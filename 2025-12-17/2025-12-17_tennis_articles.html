And I have thoroughly enjoyed every step of the way with you.“We have made it to the top, and I feel that if our sporting paths had to part, it should be from up there. From the place we always worked for and always aspired to reach…You have made me grow as an athlete, but above all as a person. “We have made it to the top, and I feel that if our sporting paths had to part, it should be from up there.

I am left with the peace of mind of knowing that we have given our all, that we have made everything available to each other.“Thank you for everything, Juanki.” Alcaraz, 22, has not announced a replacement coach, though his statement referenced “new adventures and new projects.”“I wish you the best in everything that comes your way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"It is very difficult for me to write this post," Alcaraz wrote in Spanish. Thank you for making my childhood dreams a reality. I have enjoyed every step with you so much. "We have reached the top, and I think that if our sporting paths have to separate it should be from there, from the place we always worked for and aspired to reach. I have so many memories that it would be unfair to choose just one. I will never forget the journey we went on together. With all my heart, I wish you the best for what is to come. Alcaraz began working with Ferrero seven years ago and won all six of his major titles under the guidance of the Spanish coach. Ferrero also helped Alcaraz, then 19, become the youngest player to claim ATP Year-End No. Alcaraz captured 24 tour-level titles during his partnership with Ferrero, including eight ATP Masters 1000 crowns. The Spaniard, who will continue to work with Samuel Lopez, also won the 2021 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF title with Ferrero by his side. "Today is a difficult day," Ferrero wrote on social media. "One of those when it's hard to find the right words. Saying goodbye is never easy, especially when there are so many shared experiences behind it. We have worked hard, grown together, and shared unforgettable moments. "I take with me laughter, challenges overcome, conversations, support during difficult moments, and the satisfaction of having been part of something truly unique. Today, a very important chapter of my life comes to an end. "Thank you, Carlos, for the trust, the effort, and for making your way of competing make me feel so special. I wish you all the best, both professionally and personally. I would also like to thank the entire team for making my work easier throughout all these years. With you, I have learned that work is not just about tasks or results, but about the people who walk alongside you. Each and every one of you has left a mark on me that I will never forget.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If junior Grand Slam titles were entry tickets, the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF would have a very selective door policy. Five of the six debutants in this year's field arrive in Jeddah as former boys' major champions, a contrast to the two returners, Americans Learner Tien and Nishesh Basavareddy, who are proving there's more than one route to the top. For 6'4” Belgian Alexander Blockx, that journey began in Melbourne, where he won the 2023 Australian Open boys' title. “It gave me a lot of confidence on the court that showed me that I can really keep up with the guys and play in those big moments,” Blockx told ATPTour.com, reflecting on his title run in Melbourne. Two players Blockx defeated en route to the title — last year's Jeddah finalists Joao Fonseca and Tien — have since risen inside the world's Top 30 in 2025, reinforcing the sense that his own breakthrough is arriving fast. The future, however, isn't just knocking, it already has silverware. The Spaniard won the 2022 US Open boys' title at just 16, instantly putting a spotlight on his career before it had truly begun. “It was tough at that moment, but now I'm feeling much more confident, and it's not the first time I'm having people watching me and people saying that I'm going to be near the top… “It's nice to have been preparing myself for this kind of pressure, and now I'm able to live it in a good way.” Martin Landaluce takes a selfie with the Jeddah field on Media Day. Now 19, calmer and armed with the tools he's developed at the Rafa Nadal Academy — including a heavy focus on breathing and mental work — Landaluce feels far better equipped for the attention that follows him. This week in Jeddah, he is sharing that attention with countryman and close friend Rafael Jodar, who etched his name into the same US Open trophy two years later in 2024. Jodar has backed that title up with a rapid rise, surging more than 700 spots in the PIF ATP Rankings to World No. 168 in 2025 and winning three ATP Challenger Tour titles in the final three months of the season to secure his Next Gen spot. Yet he's careful not to blur the lines between junior success and professional progress. “I could say that it was probably one of the best weeks, but I couldn't say that it's why I've done these things this year,” Jodar said of his US Open run last year. The 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF field. Still, he knows trophies alone don't guarantee anything on Tour: “I think all the juniors play quite grown-up tennis right now. I think it's a higher level than ever, but you need to adjust your acceptance… To accept that everybody can play very good tennis and that you can beat and get beaten by everybody.” Dino Prizmic rounded out his own junior career exactly how he wanted, winning the 2023 Roland Garros boys' title before stepping full-time into the professional ranks. Five junior Grand Slam champions, five distinct journeys, but none of them identical to the routes taken by Tien or Basavareddy. In Jeddah, the message is clear: Junior titles can open doors, but it's what comes after that earns you a seat at the table.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans eager to stay ahead of the curve and identify the next wave of #NextGenATP talents should keep a close eye on ATP Challenger results. The eight players competing at this year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF have all tasted ATP Challenger success to get where they are today. ATPTour.com highlights each Jeddah competitor and the Challenger milestones they've achieved in their young careers. After winning his first Challenger title in February, Budkov Kjaer said: “In a way, yes, [I am surprised] that it came. Because everybody at Challengers is so ridiculously good. Facing fellow 18-year-old Federico Cina in the Hamburg final, it marked the youngest Challenger championship match at that level since 2003, when Mario Ancic beat Rafael Nadal, coincidentally, also in Hamburg. At 18 years and 25 days, Engel became the fifth-youngest German winner in Challenger history and the first player born in 2007 to win a title at that level. “Every title is a big one, especially my first Challenger,” Engel said after winning in Hamburg. “This win makes it even better and I'm really happy.” Rafael Jodar Nearly a year removed from his US Open junior triumph, where he edged Budkov Kjaer in a 10-point tie-break at 6-6 in the third set, the teenager captured his maiden ATP Challenger crown in Hersonissos, Greece in September. The Madrid native earned ITA All-American honours during his first season at the University of Virginia and qualified for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, a programme that aims to increase the development pathway for top players in the American collegiate system to earn direct entry into select Challenger events.You May Also Like: Rafael Jodar's Journey: From idolising Nadal to forging his own path Dino Prizmic Prizmic is proudly waving the flag as Croatia's next promising talent. Having started his tennis journey at Tenis Klub Split, the same club that produced Goran Ivanisevic and Mario Ancic, Prizmic is aiming to follow in their lofty footsteps. With his triumph at the Bratislava Challenger in June, Prizmic, then 19 years old, became the second Croatian — alongside Ancic — to win three Challenger titles as a teenager. The #NextGenATP star finished the Challenger season with a 27-9 season record, highlighted by two title runs and three additional final appearances. Landaluce won the Orleans Challenger in September, claiming 125 PIF ATP Ranking points and later building on that with a semi-final run in Olbia, where last year he won the title. When Landaluce won Olbia last season, he became the fifth Spaniard since 2000 to win a Challenger title at age 18 or younger. Jodar has since added his name to that list. The first four players all ascended to the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings: Carlos Alcaraz, Rafael Nadal, Tommy Robredo and Nicolas Almagro.A champ and his trophy 🏆 #ATPChallenger | @RFETenis pic.twitter.com/D5WSmhZ1sf— ATP Challenger Tour (@ATPChallenger) September 28, 2025 Alexander Blockx The Belgian bookended his ATP Challenger season with titles, winning his first event of the year (Oeiras) and triumphing again in his final Challenger outing (Bratislava). Now, the 20-year-old will look to close out the year by building on that triumph and claim his biggest career title in Jeddah, where he is seeded second. Nishesh Basavareddy Back in Jeddah for a second consecutive year, Basavareddy competed in just seven Challenger tournaments this year, including three quarter-final appearances. He had more than paid his Challenger dues in the 2024 season, during which he reached six finals (two titles) and posted a 41-13 match record. 122 in the PIF ATP Rankings, a stark contrast from where he is today as World No. Now seeking to go one step further than last year's runner-up finish to Joao Fonseca, the lefty mostly competed on the ATP Tour this season, with just one Challenger appearance. But Tien's success on the ATP Challenger circuit served as a springboard for him to compete on the sport's biggest stages. Last season, Tien boasted a 35-9 Challenger-match record, including three title runs.
