                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I read a story Spielberg recounted about looking up to the stars one night in the desert, laying on the hood of his car or something, and feeling like he was telepathically contacted by NHI. I had a very similar experience, but I haven't been able to find his story at all lately. does anyone have a link, or know what I'm talking about? When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions vary widely among enthusiasts and skeptics alike. However, several cases are frequently cited for their credibility, multiple witnesses, and corroborating evidence. Here are some of the most notable and convincing UFO sightings: Description: Over 60 schoolchildren witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and several beings emerging from it. "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Description: The pilot and co-pilot of a JAL cargo flight observed a massive UFO, which was also tracked by ground radar. What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well." Description: U.S. military personnel stationed at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge reported multiple UFO sightings over several nights in Rendlesham Forest. They described a craft with strange lights and symbols. Credibility: The involvement of military personnel, their detailed accounts, and corroborating evidence like audio recordings make this case highly persuasive. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO." "I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes, (which actually happened twice). It was never given a reasonable explanation, and even our Governor at the time admits he was told to dismiss the story and make fun of it." Description: Iranian military pilots attempted to intercept a UFO that was tracked on radar. Their aircraft experienced instrumentation and communication failures when approaching the object. Location: Off the coast of San Diego, California Description: U.S. Navy pilots from the USS Nimitz carrier strike group encountered a highly advanced, tic-tac-shaped object performing impossible maneuvers. Credibility: The incident was captured on FLIR footage, and multiple trained military pilots provided consistent testimonies under oath. Credibility: The photographs were analyzed and found to be authentic, showing expected artifacts from early 2000s digital cameras. "The images showed expected JPEG compression artifacts from early 2000s digital cameras." Description: Multiple witnesses saw a large, illuminated object crash into the water. A search and rescue operation found no debris but reported strange lights underwater. Description: Two fishermen claimed they were abducted by crab-clawed robots from an oval UFO. They were traumatized and their accounts remained consistent under scrutiny. "They went to the local sheriff where the police thought they were lying so they were interviewed, but then left alone with a secret recording device and they carried on talking about everything that happened between them and were clearly traumatised by whatever had happened to them." Credibility: Numerous eyewitnesses claimed to see alien bodies and a massive military cover-up, which has led to ongoing debate and skepticism about the official explanation. There were scores of eyewitnesses who claimed to see alien bodies, none of which match the description of the supposed 'crash test dummies' the government later claimed they were."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senator Sheldon Whitehouse voiced frustration with "all the conspiracy theories" and "creepy, weird plot ideas" spreading about the Brown University shooting, telling online commentators to "please just knock it off." "Speculation, particularly out on the internet, by people who have no idea what they are talking about, who have no clue about what is happening, is not helpful to the investigation," Whitehouse said during a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Dec. 17. " Before being elected to the Senate, Whitehouse served as Rhode Island Attorney General and, before that, U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island. "There is simply no need, from an investigative point of view, for people who have no idea what they're talking about to offer their stupid and ill-informed views about what happened all over the internet," he said. "So I would please, just from a law enforcement perspective, ask anyone who sees this to just shut up until we know who did it and why. Whitehouse noted that parents who were looking forward to their children coming home for the holidays "are now having to prepare funerals. They probably had already bought presents for their children. This has to come as perhaps the most savage blow that a parent can face." "Ill-informed and unnecessary speculation about what went on does those families no good at all," Whitehouse said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decades ago, a spacecraft suggested Saturn's largest moon, Titan, had an ocean. New observations suggest that the liquid may look more like slush. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Saturn's largest moon, Titan, may be hiding a habitable world of slushy sea ice, new research hints. Back in 2008, NASA's Cassini spacecraft gathered data on Titan that suggested an open ocean might lurk beneath the moon's frozen crust. But the new analysis hints that what lies underneath is instead "slushy tunnels and pockets of meltwater," according to the investigators. The results, published Wednesday (Dec. 17) in the journal Nature, have large implications for our understanding of how common water is on other worlds. If confirmed, the work may also influence our search for life on other worlds, as water is a key ingredient for life. "Instead of an open ocean like we have here on Earth, we're probably looking at something more like Arctic sea ice or aquifers, which has implications for what type of life we might find, [and] also the availability of nutrients, energy and so on," study co-author Baptiste Journaux, an assistant professor of Earth and space sciences at the University of Washington, said in a statement. The story begins with Cassini, a spacecraft that launched in 1997 and spent much of its 20 years observing Saturn and its moons. The team found that the shape of Titan begins to change only about 15 hours after Saturn exerts its strongest gravitational pull in Titan's orbit. "Nobody was expecting very strong energy dissipation inside Titan," lead study author Flavio Petricca, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in the statement. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Historically, Titan has always been hard to observe. The planet is shrouded in a thick, orange atmosphere that's rich in chemical compounds that may be precursors to life. Cassini's observations revealed a bizarre surface where methane falls as rain, seas constantly shift, and temperatures stand around minus 297 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 183 degrees Celsius). While water is believed to be in the slush, it wouldn't be as liquid as an open ocean, the team found. Aside from recycling the old Cassini radio-wave observations, the researchers used new thermodynamic models developed by Journaux's lab to study how water, minerals and other components behave on worlds like Titan. —Mysterious 'magic' islands that come and go on Saturn's moon Titan finally have an explanation —Largest sea on Titan could be more than 1,000 feet deep —Saturn's moon Titan may have a 6-mile-thick crust of methane ice — could life be under there? While at first this lack of a full ocean sounds like a blow to the search for life, the research team emphasized that instead, "It expands the range of environments we might consider habitable," Jones said. Scientists also found that “pockets of fresh water” may exist within Titan at life-friendly temperatures of 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius). Moreover, nutrients would be concentrated in small pools of this water, perhaps allowing for more rich conditions for life than a less-concentrated ocean would. It is hoped that Dragonfly's surface observations of Titan will reveal more about where life may be lurking and how much water might be available for organisms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first trailer offers a tantalizing glimpse into a story that promises to shake the world with revelations about alien life, while keeping much of the plot shrouded in mystery. The star-studded cast includes Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Eve Hewson and Wyatt Russell. O'Connor plays a determined man on a mission to reveal the truth about alien life to the world. The trailer is packed with cryptic crop circles, high-speed chases, eerie creatures and chilling hints that humanity may not be alone in the universe. Adding to the buzz, cryptic billboards appeared in Times Square and Los Angeles on December 10, bearing the message: 'All will be disclosed — Spielberg 06.12.26.' This is a developing story... More updates to come Spielberg's fascination with UFOs and outer space began in childhood, when his father woke him one night to watch the Perseid meteor shower from a field near their home in Haddon Heights, New Jersey. That early wonder inspired his first amateur film project at just 17, a 1964 feature, length sci-fi movie called 'Firelight', which he screened at a local Phoenix theater for family and friends, charging $1 per ticket.' Both films were blockbuster hits, with ET becoming the highest-grossing film of all time for over a decade, surpassing Star Wars. More recently, in 2005, Spielberg revamped the timeless 'War of the Worlds' that was one of that year's top films. He has returned to his roots with 'Disclosure Day,' which was based on an his original story, but penned by r David Koepp, who helped write 'Jurassic Park,' 'Jurassic Park: The Lost World,' and 'War of the Worlds.' 'Just watched this chilling clip from Steven Spielberg's new UFO film Disclosure Day (trailer dropped [Tuesday])—Emily Blunt's weather forecast turns into straight-up ALIEN NOISES live on air, a UFO enthusiast posted on X. 'Already looking forward to seeing 'Disclosure Day' next year -- and I love that Emily Blunt is playing a Kansas City TV meteorologist. In the newly released clip, there is a shot of bizarrely behaving robins that flying into an apartment where Blunt and O'Connor are sitting. One social media users posted on X about the billboard, saying: 'This billboard in Times Square is not just promoting another movie. Spielberg, the most influential director in the history of cinema, the man whose last name is a synonym for Hollywood, is about to debut his first original sci-fi story in years.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” wrote science fiction visionary Arthur C. Clarke. These innovations represent the “sizzle” of technology—the flashy, futuristic gadgets that feel ripped from Black Mirror or Severance. Mind-boggling, they get us talking, fired up about an unbounded future. His fabless semiconductor company enables “no new wires” communication for industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and automotive applications. According to Encyclopedia Britanica, it involves “any system that views all matter as alive, either in itself or by participation in the operation of a world soul or some similar principle.” In other words, it suggests all matter, even the feeder lines in your power grid are sentient to some degree. When we stop to consider the work Semitech does from a different perspective, again, like someone from the Middle Ages, it might appear magical. Consider its PLC4TRUCKS technology, which allows vehicles to exchange data over the same electrical harness that powers their lights and brakes. Suddenly, trucks and trailers, even from different manufacturers, can communicate in real-time. Fleets can monitor ABS health, tire pressure, and more from miles away through something as sophisticated as aggregating sensor data over power lines and sending it to the cloud wirelessly. Likewise, trains utilize data transmission to support control of real-time diagnostics and passenger information services. Another way to understand the transformation enabled via PLC and other sophisticated communications technologies is via the leap from “dumb” to “smart” devices. A basic light switch circa 1960 is an example of the former. Flip it on or off and you can light the room. The smart version of this same device enjoys qualities absent in its counterpart. It can sense its environment and connect to a network such as your phone or the cloud. PLC comes into play here too, enabling the coordination of decentralized services in a smart grid, enabling it to monitor what's happening and react in real-time quickly. Today's electric vehicles aren't limited to consuming power in a dumb fashion. Instead, they can convert electrical networks into one more data conduit. This way, EVs can return unneeded power, enabling a smart ecosystem not unlike nature itself whereby intelligent systems can manage large-scale electrification and support environmentally friendly energy usage. It's indicative of what's called ambient intelligence, “… a concept where AI, sensors, and connected devices create responsive environments that adapt to people's presence, preferences, and behavior,” according to TechnologicInnovation.com. Ambiently intelligent thermostats that shut off when no one's in the room, optimizing for energy use and costs, are akin to the behind-the-scenes work Semitech and other related companies perform. Unseen, unacknowledged, such responsive devices silently power our world. But ask the typical person to describe how they seamlessly connect and communicate with each other, and they would be hard-pressed to give you an accurate answer. Beyond such smart processes we've come to rely upon as part of daily life, including traffic lights that flicker on or off when our cars pull up, there is another aspect to this topic worth exploring. The growing strain on our power grids, driven by data centers powering what some call an “AI arms race”, is becoming mission-critical. As more electricity is required to sustain applications like ChatGPT as the new form of search, our devices will need to more intricately coordinate with each other. “You can think of such decentralized communication not as a single omniscient mind straight out of sci-fi books like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but instead as various neurons within a brain or even ants in a colony,” said Collin. We began this discussion attempting to imagine how someone hundreds of years ago would interpret the technological marvels we often view as commonplace. If anything, things are just ramping up, especially as companies like OpenAI go all-in on achieving the goal of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial superintelligence (ASI.) Some experts, including Ray Kurzweil, believe that if we do ever achieve such awe-inspiring breakthroughs, we will reach the Singularity, that promised land where AI becomes so intelligent, its abilities exceed our abilities to predict or control our destiny. In other words, technological progress would stop advancing incrementally but instead leapfrog to a vertical curve beyond our wildest ambitions. "As above, so below” is a Hermetic axiom suggesting patterns repeat at every scale of existence. Following such esoteric logic, if we do ever achieve the Singularity and one day look back upon life in the year 2025, it's possible that bright future will seem just as magical and miraculous to people living today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Older generations are driving political polarization and conspiracy theories on top internet platforms, while Zoomers tend to be more issue-focused rather than on partisan warfare, a sweeping new study found. Socialprofiler, an artificial intelligence platform, combed through the top social media sites and analyzed some 756 million profiles to conclude that older generations are more outspoken about partisan politics online than younger ones. The study assessed posts that users of different age groups interact with the most on X, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to help reach its conclusions. While Gen Z frequently engages with left-leaning political content and progressive social issues, it was the Millennials and Gen Xers who were more slanted toward traditional partisan content, the study found. The findings from Socialprofiler's first-of-its-kind social media study track with other anecdotal findings that older Americans can be too online and go down rabbit holes of social media conspiracies. A Talker Research survey of 2,000 American adults age 50 and older, commissioned by Centrum Silver in September, found that the average older American spent a collective 22 hours per week in front of some type of screen, including scrolling through social media. Another study out University of Colorado Boulder found adults age 55 and older are significantly more likely to share political misinformation than younger social media users. As Americans age, they become more partisan and those beliefs can muddy their online judgment, the November 2025 study found. “This suggests that different forms of escapism and alternative worldviews appeal to different age cohorts, rather than representing a simple replacement of traditional faith with scientific rationalism,” the study said. When asked why the gap between younger and older generations on conspiracy theories exists, Noskov admitted that “We don't exactly know,” but teased that his company is planning to conduct additional research on that in the future. Republicans generally drew much more robust engagement on the top social media platforms overall, but Democrats unsurprisingly fared better among younger cohorts. Zoomers appeared specifically focused on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. “Even among movements that initially attracted younger, politically engaged users, there may be a natural lifecycle or shift toward depoliticization,” the study noted. Although polls have generally shown a decline in religion among younger Americans, Socialprofiler found that some religious movements, such as Islam, are making inroads with the youth. Accounts that are private were not assessed, though Socialprofiler was able to learn from people's interactions with content on other social media platforms. “So usually most people will have at least one of those public.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New findings indicate that the first interaction between humans and extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) may not align with the peaceful, friendly encounters frequently portrayed in films. 'The first confirmed detection of an extraterrestrial technological civilisation is most likely to be an atypical example, one that is unusually 'loud',' Kipping explained in his recent paper published on arXiv, which is owned and operated by Cornell University. These signals could indicate a civilisation facing crisis—unstable, fleeting, or potentially approaching its end. The hypothesis, also explained through a YouTube video released by Cool Worlds, highlights similarities with findings in astronomy. Kipping suggests that a similar principle holds true for ETIs. We are more inclined to detect civilisations that emit the strongest techno-signatures, rather than those that are more common or flourishing in silence, according to him. Examples of these 'loud' signals include the accidental discharge of significant energy or radiation, as well as intentional efforts to communicate urgent messages throughout the universe. Hollywood has consistently depicted extraterrestrial beings as either kind-hearted guides for humanity or aggressive invaders aiming to take over our planet. However, Kipping and fellow researchers advise caution when it comes to anticipating such cinematic occurrences. 'The history of astronomical discovery shows that many of the most detectable phenomena ... are rare, extreme cases with disproportionately large observational signatures,' Kipping said in the paper. Simply put, the Eschatian Hypothesis suggests that instead of the gentle and benevolent ET portrayed in films, we might witness signs of a civilisation on the brink of collapse, sending out extreme signals detectable from light-years away. In this context, it suggests that our first encounter with extraterrestrial life could originate from a civilisation nearing its own conclusion. Kipping advocates for a focus on extensive, high-frequency surveys in the quest for these signals, aiming to capture rare cosmic occurrences. According to Universe Today, institutions such as the Vera Rubin Observatory and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are advancing towards a strategy of ongoing monitoring, enhancing the likelihood of identifying unusual signals before they disappear from sight. Instead of focusing on specific, narrowly defined techno-signatures, research initiatives might gain from a broader approach. This could be observing for anomalies in flux, spectrum, or apparent motion that remain unexplained by established astrophysical phenomena.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Talented actor Aadi Saikumar is gearing up for the release of his biggest film, Shambhala: A Mystical World. Produced by Rajasekhar Annabhimoju and Mahidhar Reddy under the Shining Pictures banner, the film has been mounted on a lavish scale to deliver a truly immersive cinematic experience. Archana Iyer, Lubber Pandhu fame Swasika, Ravi Varma, Madhunandan, and Siva Karthik play key roles. The teaser, trailer, and making video have been trending on social media, and the film is carrying excellent reports in trade circles. As a result, both theatrical and non-theatrical rights fetched solid revenues for the makers. Top distribution houses are presenting the film in different regions. In the Nizam territory, Mythri Distributors LLP will release this Aadi Saikumar starrer, while Usha Pictures will distribute it in Andhra Pradesh and the Ceded regions. With leading distributors coming on board, Shambhala is expected to get a strong showcasing. Several platforms showed interest, and Aha ended up bagging the digital rights. Sri Charan Pakala's background score and Praveen K Bangarri's cinematography are said to be the other major highlights of the film.</p>

Germany's far-right AfD, was represented at the gala by about 20 lawmakers, prompting a Democratic congressman to denounce it as 'rolling out the red carpet for leaders of Germany's Nazi-cosplaying party.' During the event, a protester wearing a Nazi armband was removed after reportedly shouting, 'I guess we're all Nazis!'

The guest list at the New York Young Republican Club's annual gala on Saturday included white nationalists, antisemitic conspiracy theorists and a Jewish city councilwoman, who ultimately decided not to attend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India, Dec 17 : Steven Spielberg's highly anticipated UFO film, Disclosure Day, teases a thought-provoking journey in its first trailer, asking: “What if we are not alone, and the truth is bigger than fear?” Unlike typical alien invasion movies, the teaser is quiet, introspective, and deeply human. Elizabeth Marvel's character muses, “Why would he make such a vast universe yet save it only for us?” Josh O'Connor adds that the truth belongs to everyone, not just those in power, signaling the film's emotional and philosophical depth. O'Connor describes the movie as “old-school Spielberg,” signaling a return to emotional storytelling over spectacle. Promotion for Disclosure Day includes Times Square billboards and a teaser screening before the latest Avatar movie.

Atrazine is banned in the European Union and other countries due to health and environmental concerns, but remains widely used in the U.S., where it is a common contaminant in drinking water, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Despite these concerns, U.S. regulators allow its continued use. The new assessment by the WHO's cancer agency comes 10 years after the agency's landmark finding that glyphosate, the world's most heavily used herbicide, is also “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Both atrazine and glyphosate are also endocrine disruptors, meaning they can disrupt key hormone systems that regulate growth, development and metabolism. Both herbicides are also largely produced by companies outside the United States. Note: It's recently come out that the popular pesticide paraquat probably causes Parkinson's disease.
