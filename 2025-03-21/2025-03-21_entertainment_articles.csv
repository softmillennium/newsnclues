Mayor Steve Meiner looked almost apologetic on Wednesday at Miami Beach’s City Hall as he declared he would withdraw his own proposal, which threatened to terminate the arthouse theater O Cinema’s current lease and grant funding because it had screened the Oscar-winning Palestinian-Israeli documentary No Other Land. At times he seemed to contradict himself, admitting his resolution should have been “more open to discussion” while claiming it also wasn’t “healthy to debate.” With tears welling up, he told the packed chambers, “But I just want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, even though some of you said things that were hurtful: I love you all, I really, really do.”

The proposal had been announced in an email newsletter sent on March 11, in which Meiner accused the film — which shows harrowing on-the-ground footage of the destruction of a West Bank village by Israeli soldiers between 2019 and 2023 — of being “egregiously antisemitic.” He claimed that his proposed legislation was intended for the city, which currently rents space to the theater at South Beach’s Historic City Hall, to “move on from O Cinema, as permitted by our contract, and seek a cultural partner that better aligns with our community values.”

Meiner’s threat received national attention; over 700 filmmakers and creatives (including Barry Jenkins, Phil Lord, Laura Poitras) signed an open letter of support for the single-screen nonprofit cinema, calling the proposal an “act of censorship.” The same tenor of indignation dominated the room during Wednesday’s city-commissioner meeting, in which nearly a hundred constituents and defenders of O Cinema let loose on Meiner — both for the threat to the theater and for the fact that Meiner had chosen not to take questions at a virtual town hall held the night before — one minute at a time.

A woman who drove down from Broward County jokingly excused the pink rollers in her hair and pronounced that “Miami Beach sucks now.” O Cinema, she said, “is the only reason” she ever comes by anymore. A young O Cinema supporter later echoed the sentiment: “I got up at 6 a.m. to be here and I don’t get up at 6 a.m. for anything.” Others against Meiner’s proposal identified as Zionists and disagreed with his claim that he was “speaking for 90 percent of the Jewish community.” Local filmmakers and members of Jewish Voice for Peace and the Miami DSA also spoke. Mountains filmmaker Monica Sorelle took her allotted minute to quote a statement from No Other Land co-director Yuval Abraham, and referenced a recent hate crime in which a Jewish Miami Beach resident shot two Israeli tourists because he believed they were Palestinians — an example of how hatred spreads blindly.

The mayor’s defense was limited from the audience; less than a dozen spoke in favor of the proposal. One man compared No Other Land to D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation. Two other supporters were fellow South Florida mayors, Hialeah’s Esteban Bovo Jr. and Miami’s Francis Suarez, along with the consul general of Israel in Miami, Maor Elbaz-Starinsky. Meiner allowed all three to speak for longer than a minute, though that overtime was eventually drowned out by constituents chanting “one minute’s up!” (Elbaz-Starinsky responded by calling the constituents “antisemites.”) Elsewhere, the audience objected to the mayor claiming that O Cinema has never screened a film that shows “the Israeli perspective.” (“It’s co-produced and directed by Israelis!” someone shouted.)

That Meiner (who claims he has, in fact, seen the film) dropped his proposal was perhaps not surprising, considering that the majority of the city’s six commissioners had encouraged him to do so. But he also deferred a vote on a second resolution, which would “encourage” the theater to show films that “highlight a fair and balanced viewpoint of the current war.” An email from O Cinema went out Friday afternoon, addressed to friends and supporters, vowing to “remain in conversation with the city until it is resolved.”

Dangling threads didn’t seem to dampen the mood after the meeting on Wednesday, however, as commissioner Joseph Magazine encouraged everyone present to take a photo together as a “sign of unity.” Only one, commissioner David Suarez, refused. (During the meeting, Suarez had called No Other Land “a megaphone for Hamas sympathizers” and declared that “most of the people here would be the first victims of Hamas.” He also went into graphic detail about how “women would be sexually mutilated, thrown off rooftops, and stoned to death.”)

Still, O Cinema co-founders Vivian Marthell and Kareem Tabsch — who remained stoic during the entire proceedings — are relieved with the outcome. “I think we’re all overwhelmed by the positive support that we received from the community and encouraged by seeing democracy at work and hearing opposing viewpoints,” Tabsch told Vulture after the meeting. “I think the commission did the right thing today and that we came out victorious at the same time.”

“I totally feel hopeful. We’ve been within the city of Miami Beach for ten years,” Marthell added. “Our programming speaks for itself. It’s varied, it’s diverse, it speaks to our communities, it speaks to our issues, and it speaks to having dialogue.”

O Cinema was the first theater in South Florida to screen No Other Land. When Meiner caught wind of this, he sent the theater a letter, asking them to remove screenings of the film and claiming it was “a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people.” Marthell and Tabsch declined, to which Meiner responded with the proposed threat to their lease and funding. The theater owners nevertheless continued offering more screenings of the film (which despite its Oscar win for Best Documentary, remains without an American distributor). “Should we have capitulated to the mayor’s demands it would have been a betrayal of our mission and of our audience,” Tabsch said. “We couldn’t allow our first amendment right to free speech be trampled on because if we had, where would it stop? It wouldn’t just end at O Cinema and we could not allow that to happen to us and to our community.”

This is far from the first attempt by South Florida politicians at interfering with film programming. In 2000, the city of Miami pulled $50,000 worth of county funding from the Miami Film Festival for screening the Cuban film La Vida Es Silbar, though the motion was ultimately repealed. More recently, in 2022, District 3 Commissioner Joe Carollo — notorious for a lawsuit over his weaponization of city departments against local businesses in Little Havana — wrested control of the Tower Theater, the only multi-screen first-run art cinema in Miami, away from Miami Dade College and Miami Film Festival. The venue is now closed most of the time.

Other forms of Palestinian art have been pulled elsewhere in Miami amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. As the Miami New Times reported, the city’s Institute of Contemporary Art and arts organizations like Oolite Arts have taken down works relating to Palestine. Artist Charles Gaines has said the ICA asked him to alter one piece of art and to leave another out of a career retrospective of his work.

Tabsch and Marthell sound relieved that O Cinema has so far evaded the same fate as Tower Theater. But they are careful not to speak ill of those who threatened them. “Having good relationships with our elected officials is important,” Tabsch said, “and I hope that this is a bump in the road and we can get back to the great relationship we had going forward.”",vulture

Spoiler alert: This story contains major character and plot details.

Britt Lower faced a nesting doll of an acting challenge in Severance’s second season by portraying disparate characters: Helena Eagan, the cold, calculating heiress to the Lumon corporation, and her defiant Innie, Helly R. You get the sense that Helly — who possesses free will, acerbic wit, and close bonds with her colleagues in macrodata refinement — is someone Helena could have become if she hadn’t been groomed by her father, Jame, to take over the family empire. (“Think of hell,” Lower cracks about the name’s phonetics.) In the combustible finale, directed by Ben Stiller and written by showrunner Dan Erickson, both Mark S. (Adam Scott) and Helly make drastic choices that will inevitably set off further hostilities between the Innies and the Outies: After succeeding in an escape attempt to free his Outie’s captive wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman), Mark S. remains and runs hand-in-hand through the severed floor with his redheaded love. And Helly unionizes another department against Lumon’s severed-worker practice, reminding everyone how they’re all treated like “fucking machines” that can be turned on and off at the will of the company. (“They give us half a life,” she spits, “and think we won’t fight for it.”)

Lower says the show has been planting seeds for this since the first season — and the narrative twist is enhanced by what she believes to be Helena’s own quiet radicalization while undercover as Helly at the start of the second season. “She’s waging a war inside of herself within the same body,” the actor tells me during a recent makeshift art session on a bench at the Pratt Institute Sculpture Park, adding touches of paint and marker to our shared canvas. “It’s quite provocative and relatable.”

Were you told Helly’s entire arc before the season?

I knew the whole of season two going in. We filmed out of order, as we did with the first, so it was necessary for me to know what was going on from the start.

What were some clarifying questions you had?

You go into a project with as much information as you can muster through inspiration and discussions. But then you hope for surprise — for the moment where you’re on set and the way someone reacts to you, or the way the lighting is, tells you something about the character that you didn’t know before. That was a lot of season two, especially with the Outie, like how Helena moving through the world is so dictated by her father. She doesn’t seem to have many females in her life.

Did anything genuinely surprise you about Helena’s development this season?

How much longing Helena feels. Especially when she’s in disguise, she’s embodying this part of herself she’s lost touch with or never had touch with quite fully. I was really moved by getting to see Helly’s perspective through her eyeballs. Helly has these really human connections with Irving, Dylan, and Mark, and they affect her so much. And then, by contrast, Helena’s scenes with her father are so sterile. Hurt people hurt people, generations of lack of nurturing. I tried to come at both sides of them with empathy for being trapped inside the same company in very different ways.

Do you interpret her longing as romantic love, friendship, or any type of general human connection?

In the first four episodes, if you’re doing a rewatch, you can see how much she’s enjoying getting to be Helly.

So she wasn’t putting up a front?

There are so many masks she has to wear. To a certain extent, I want the audience to decide for themselves. But there’s a heartbeat in there that she has. There’s a longing, I think, for something she hasn’t had access to: connection. She does have a sense of humor, and she’s able to tap into Helly’s. She passes, almost.

Did you play those episodes as assuming the audience would catch on that Helena was the one there?

It was something we had a lot of conversations about. Ben, Dan, the other directors, and I were always trying to decide how obvious it was. Even on set sometimes, the other actors would forget. But I was always aware. I, the actor, felt sad for Helly that her friends were being deceived. Then I felt a sense of sorrow for Helena, too, that she’s getting to experience this. It’s like the organic version of reintegration. Helly and Helena, by the time we hit the middle of the season, have gotten to experience each other’s lives firsthand for a little bit. Helly has experienced the father both on the outside and then the inside in that strange office scene from the ninth episode. And Helena has gotten to experience Helly’s “chosen family” within the office world. They still have a lot to learn from one another. I think about it as the inner critic and the inner child. We all have those parts of ourselves: the inner child that’s doodling and then the inner critic that’s like, This isn’t art! Being in a state of awe and childlike wonder is a goal. But also you wouldn’t get very much done if you were always in a state of awe. The ego protects you, but it can protect you too much from living a free life.

To your earlier point, how many masks does Helena have to wear?

Her relationship with her father is one. She’s seeking his approval, and she’s concerned for his well-being. There’s something up with him; I do think there are some mental-health issues going on. Just based on Michael Siberry’s incredible performance — the way he moves through space and the way he’s treated by her. So she has this ailing father who’s so odd and withholding. And she has to wear a mask in front of the other women employees, too. It’s like a Russian doll of masks.

Do you think Helena wants to be CEO?

I don’t think she would even be able to answer that. There’s just no choice in a family structure like that. I was recently watching Orlando with Tilda Swinton. I love that film. I was thinking about that kind of lone, princely figure. And in this case, it’s a high-control group she was raised in. I’ve thought a lot about, Where’s Helena’s mom? I think she, much like Helly, is on a journey of self-discovery and answering the question Who am I? Seeing this other version of herself has really rattled her. There’s a strange envy. Helly has her own different version of that toward Helena. But Helly is much more on the journey of This isn’t fucking ethical. She has a really clear sense of what’s justifiable and what isn’t. Initially, Helly is like, “Get me the hell out of here at all costs.” But then it turned into “Get us out of here.” To her surprise, she realizes this is her family. And then in season two, all of them start to have contrasting desires — all the Innies with their Outies. They have opposing objectives within their little family unit, which is so real. Moving through that together is what makes a family grow, deepen, and help define itself.

A big hole that we don’t know about Helena is, as you said, the identity of her mother.

I’m going to leave that one a mystery.

What else have you filled in for yourself about the character to inform your portrayal?

Some of it isn’t verbal. I listen to a lot of Patti Smith to get into Helly. For Helena, it’s these sweeping classical arrangements. That was more of how I tapped into her subconscious, which was also informed by the strange environment. She lives with her dad. She has the regimen of eating an egg in the morning and the routine of swimming. It’s just all very brutal. She has corporate, cultlike mannerisms. I can imagine that’s been the case her whole life. The cool thing about playing Helly in season one is I got to walk around Lumon and be like, “What the fuck are you guys doing? Why are you acting like that? Ms. Cobel and Mr. Milchick, why do you talk like that?” Now, I get to be in the position of someone who walks around and talks like that. Still, you don’t see Helena alone very much, except for that scene when she’s watching the security footage of Mark and Helly. So, again, is there a mask? Even if there’s no one in the back of the room, she’s still aware there’s someone watching her every move.

When Helena, pretending to be Helly, sleeps with Mark, she tells him afterward, “I didn’t like who I was on the outside. I was ashamed.” Do you believe her?

I think there’s some honesty in what she’s saying. She also has self-awareness of how she acted toward Irving. She tells Mark, “I was mean. That was mean of me.” There’s a really tender scene that was cut for, I think, plot purposes between Dylan and who we now understand was Helena on the outdoor retreat. Dylan says, “I don’t like the outside.” It’s a beautiful scene that Zach Cherry is so present in. And Helena as Helly is being so present with him and listening. And she’s like, “I get it.”

I know there were quite a bit of rewrites and delays this season. Was anything dropped from the Helena-Helly perspective that you felt would have been beneficial to the character?

There were a lot of rewrites. Maybe I shouldn’t say it, maybe it’s fine. A lot of reworking happened in the middle of filming. We had a break due to the strikes and came back with a fresh set of scripts for the ending. It’s like a giant puzzle that we’re all building and solving at the same time. Every piece of it is detailed and correlates to another piece. But, of course, much like the fans, we as actors have a vivid imagination of what might be happening that’s not seen.

Do you find Lumon’s lore as a company and the dynamics of the characters equally compelling?

There are so many interesting pieces to the “what” of what’s happening, but the “why” and “how” are the human part. What are they going after, and how are they going about getting what they want in relationship to each other? I’m really drawn to the warmest thing onscreen, which is the people and the goats. Some of those questions are answered by the end. It’s like a fractal — you zoom in and there’s more.

Have Helena’s beliefs about Innies softened a bit? At the start of the season, she was referring to them as “fucking animals.”

She’s definitely been affected by what she’s experienced. She’s doubting what she does at the company. It’s humanizing.

How long have the seeds been planted about the Innies and Outies essentially going to war with one another?

The conversation started in season one when Helly’s progression of self-harm reaches a point where … it’s less of a suicide and more of an act of war, really, because she wants Helena to wake up in a noose. Humans are meaner to ourselves than we are to anyone else. And look, Helly has taken over Helena’s body at the end of season one. She posed as her Outie in the same way that Helena then poses as her Innie. The question of autonomy is really at full volume in these episodes — and certainly consent. We dealt with those scenes delicately and had a lot of conversations about what Mark and Helly would be going through. When she comes back in episode five, she learns what’s happened. And then, it’s interesting again, after Mark and Helly share that intimacy under the makeshift tent, it’s directly after that when Helena goes to see Mark at the Chinese restaurant.

That scene seemed like a test arranged by Helena.

Helena’s curious about it. They have a kind of chemistry that’s different in each iteration. So far, the only versions of them that haven’t met yet are Outie Mark and Innie Helly. In season one, Helly and Mark have a camaraderie and shared banter. It’s that scene where Helly’s like, “I think we should kill Mark and I should wear his face.” Mark picks up on the joke and bats it back. That’s really where the seed of their connection is — a dark sense of humor. They’re finding levity in an environment that’s quite intense.

The finale’s ending scene is a spectacular implosion of autonomy, with Innie Mark choosing to run through the halls with Helly than escape with his Outie’s wife. How did you prepare for this moment?

We definitely talked about The Graduate. Everything is happening so fast from the time the marching band arrives. The intensity in all the corners of Lumon are ramping up. It starts by Helly wanting Mark, at least, to survive. That’s his chance of surviving if he gets out and saves Ms. Casey in the process. Once there’s that turn in MDR with Mr. Milchick and Dylan returning, they’re in it together. Then the alarms go off. I think it’s instinctual. She just runs. I don’t know what she’s after except maybe to see him one more time.

The Graduate’s ending veers to the uncertain. Do you read Mark and Helly’s stampede more optimistically? They look pretty elated to me.

It’s the cocktail of emotions. They’ve made this decision. So I think there’s an elation. The script direction said they were just running. I remember when we were doing it, it felt like we were a couple of wild horses who were just let loose. The moment that was important to me that stayed in the edit, which I’m proud of, is Helly seeing Gemma. Mark pulls her, she lingers, and she’s really connecting with Gemma for the first time. That moment is really essential for what comes next.

Is it like a “I see you and I won” type of look? A competitive element?

Not necessarily. The whole scene is a reckoning for all of them. Helly is reckoning with this other person who loves the same person she loves, but on the outside. It’s so complex. It was important to me that it feels like Mark is making that decision with you, the audience. Again, maybe Helly is just coming to look at him one more time. She’s present and it really becomes about Mark’s choice at that moment. Looking at this other woman who he doesn’t know, making a choice for him. And then he’s weighing, Was my Outie being truthful? Are we going to reintegrate? Is he going to hold up his end of the bargain? It’s an impossible decision.

How will this reckoning reflect what we see in the third season?

All of the Innies are waking up to their own humanity and free will. Dylan is on that journey and even the marching band, another department, is now. Helly’s just like, “Maybe we have more people on our side than we think, and maybe there’s a chance for us down here to figure out something.”

What are you hopeful for the chance to explore as the show continues? It’s almost like the duality of Helena and Helly gives you an ever-expanding terrain.

It’s so relatable to be at odds with parts of oneself. I think it’s interesting that in this project, those parts of the same person get to be fully actualized and have this discourse with each other to see what it’s like to walk around in someone else’s shoes. Hopefully, that creates empathy and understanding, particularly for the head of this company that has some questionable things going on. For someone to have inside of her a really strong rebellion, how does that affect the company for the greater good? On a personal level, how does the wilder, fiercer, and freer part of this woman — which she has lost touch with — affect her moving forward? What does she have to learn from that? How can she grow and expand? I think the question in season two is how the Innie and the Outie have two separate souls. I don’t know if there’s an answer to that, but there are two separate consciousnesses with a shared body.

I wholeheartedly believe Helly has more freedom trapped on the MDR floor as an Innie than Helena does in her life as an Outie.

I think so too. Helly’s not afraid to ask questions. In the world of Lumon, you can’t. There’s a way that things are done. You don’t question authority, and you follow a protocol. Helly is just the total antithesis of that. She really was the catalyst in season one for waking all of them up. They all start to be like, “Wait, what? What are we doing here?” That starts to bleed through to all versions of them.",vulture

Spoilers follow for Severance season two, episode ten, “Cold Harbor.”

There’s a scene in Severance’s season-two finale that feels inevitable and impossible at the same time. To this point, the show has maintained a nearly impervious wall between grief-stricken widower Mark Scout and his alternate self, imprisoned Lumon Innie Mark S. They are intimately linked; each Mark’s existence relies on the continued participation of the other. They are the same and yet wholly different people. Innie Mark can’t talk to Outie Mark, and that barrier has been Severance’s central source of tension.

At last, though, Ms. Cobel and Mark’s sister, Devon, realize they can scale that divide by taking Mark to the remote birthing cabins, first introduced in season one, where women escape the pain of childbirth by transitioning to an Innie self. The trio is working on a plan to free Mark Scout’s wife, Gemma, from somewhere deep inside the Lumon facility, and they need Mark S.’s participation. Using a camcorder, the two Marks walk back and forth across the Innie/Outie barrier, watching the alternate-Mark footage and recording responses. “The first thing I need to say to you is that I am so sorry. I created you as a prisoner and an escape,” Outie Mark says. “You’ve been living a nightmare for two years.” “Nightmare is the wrong word, actually,” Innie Mark responds. “We find ways to make it work.”

Compared with Severance’s usual storytelling mode in season two, where any explicit plot point is buried in layers of ambiguity, vagueness, and artful indirection, the conversation between the Marks is immediately, beautifully blunt. There are no hidden motives, no creepy goats or unexplained ether huffing. There’s just Mark Scout and his Innie having a straightforward conversation about what they both want, how they want to get it, and what the stakes are for both of them.

It’s a shocking scene, all the more effective and upsetting because of how fuzzily low-rent it feels — Mark’s face is partially cut off on a tiny, high-contrast camcorder screen — compared with Severance’s typical moody, stark landscapes and queasily clean fluorescent interiors. It’s also a huge relief. At this point in the season, the screws have been turning tighter and tighter in ways the show doesn’t always pace well. The Cold Harbor completion rate has sat just short of 100 percent for way too long. Much of season two’s discoveries, especially in the later half, loop back to the past, with time spent learning about Cobel’s childhood and understanding where Gemma has been all this time. The conversation between the two Marks finally offers a meaningful push of forward momentum.

More fundamentally, though, the discussion between Innie Mark and Outie Mark stems from exactly the place where Severance’s writing works best. They’re talking about their real lives and real futures, sure, but it’s through a very heady, very abstract conversation about what it is to be a self, how much value an unseen laborer’s life can possibly have, how much Mark Scout is culpable for the tragedy of Mark S.’s existence, and what responsibility these two men have toward each other. Taken as a whole, the conversation proves that these are, in fact, two different men. The audience has known this all along, but the dual Marks’ conversation emphasizes that Outie Mark has not, and by the end, he still cannot accept it.

The arc of their discussion moves from suspicion to wonderment to good-faith negotiation, with Outie Mark trying to talk his Innie into what he sees as a fair compromise. They can help each other! If his Innie will only help him find Gemma and get her out of Lumon, then he can offer Innie Mark a form of escape as well. They’ll reintegrate, and Innie Mark will no longer be trapped in what is essentially a form of slavery. From Mark Scout’s point of view, it’s all upside. But when Innie Mark starts to ask reasonable questions about how this will all work, Mark Scout responds with the tone and logic one might use to try to talk down a toddler on the verge of a tantrum. Outie Mark’s concept of the world is predicated on the belief that Innie Mark is a brief and regrettable blip, and when Innie Mark starts pushing back, Outie Mark can barely summon the patience to hear him out. His love for Gemma is more legitimate than Innie Mark’s relationship with Helly; his life and his family outside of Lumon are real and complex, and Innie Mark’s world is tiny and simplistic. It’s not that he wants to hurt his Innie. It’s that his Innie does not really exist, and so hurting him does not matter.

Adam Scott does remarkable work as the dual Marks; his performance elevates the scene from a stark philosophical discussion into something palpable and tragic and infuriating. Because the performance is so striking, in fact, it’s suddenly clear how much has been lost on the way to arriving at this point. In the service of emotional spectacle and visual style, Severance season two often sacrificed storytelling logic for what looks really cool. This problem is all over the rest of the finale: Why on God’s green earth is there an entire severed marching band? Are they severed on some kind of freelance contract basis? Have they been trained to play instruments once they were severed, or do people retain their saxophone skills across the severed barrier? How does it make sense to use resources for a marching band but not adequate security staff? Why does it take so long for anyone to intervene once Mark starts sprinting around the building? Why is the exit door unlocked?! Despite Severance’s growing attempts to court Easter egg–level readings, with its cluelike names for all of Gemma’s different Innie rooms and its perpetual hinting at further mysteries to unravel, the show cannot sustain the detail-level logic. Its visual approach and overall direction remain stunning, but the show perpetually prioritizes those elements over obvious questions about mechanics and motives.

It’s frustrating, because to its enormous credit, Severance cares, deeply, about the big underlying questions of its premise. When its visual panache is harnessed in the service of the show’s core questions rather than following cars as they wind endlessly through winter landscapes, Severance is incredibly compelling. It has built two whole seasons of TV to arrive at this moment between the two Marks, this very plausible and unbearably sad proof that even its own protagonist cannot see his Innie’s humanity. The show loves to invest buckets of energy into marching bands and ORTBOs, but all of it works best when it’s primarily functioning as the set dressing for this big Socratic argument at the show’s heart, about who exists in the world, who matters, and who is disposable.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Rachel Zegler Is a Star — Just Not the One Disney Wished Upon,https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-shouldve-stood-by-snow-white-star-rachel-zegler.html,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","She deserves a movie (and a studio) more aware of all that she’s capable of bringing to the screen. Photo: Walt Disney Studios

The list of controversies and complaints preceding the release of Disney’s live-action Snow White remake reads a bit like the poster for Saturday Night: The lead is too outspoken, the villain is controversial, the dwarfs are problematic, the songs are by Pasek and Paul, the prince isn’t in the movie?, they have 110 minutes to remake a beloved animated classic — what could go wrong? A lot, as it turns out, as Marc Webb’s adaptation of the 1937 animated classic spent most of its four-year lead-up dogged by social-media outcry, much of which was pinned to its star, Rachel Zegler. First, people took issue with her heritage, because Snow White (a fictional character) is “canonically” white; then, she took flak for talking about the dated nature of the original film; and late last year, she apologized for anti-Trump statements she made on her Instagram. A rival studio executive told Vulture, “The reality is Rachel Zegler should not be playing Snow White.”

Disney refused to stand by its leading lady in the run-up to the film’s release. It had multiple opportunities to defend Zegler against trolls who took issue with her casting, for racist reasons or otherwise, but did not. And her apology to Trump voters reeked of corporate cajoling. That’s a shame because what’s immediately apparent while watching Snow White is that Zegler is the only part of the movie that actually works. We’ve long known she can really sing (in West Side Story, sure, but have you seen her do “Gimme Gimme”? ) and she’s more than capable of carrying a movie (see: 2023’s Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes), but Snow White feels like the first Zegler vehicle that runs purely on her charm and skill. Her Snow White feels like a self-aware heroine in conversation with the Disney-princess mythos, far more skeptical than swooning, as well as gentle enough to appeal to children. (Like a presidential candidate, Zegler has turned much of her press tour into an exercise in baby-holding.) She has that princess-y spark that’s so necessary to these movies, and puts the “action” in live action: always looking, listening, responding to the environment around her. Zegler may not be the first person to pretend to pet a big-eyed deer on the head, but she might be the most convincing.

It helps, of course, that Zegler can truly sing. Like the animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ Adriana Caselotti, Zegler is a soprano, and though most of the songs in the remake are pitched down to an alto range, she pushes through the stomp-clap Pasek and Paul of it all with plenty of gusto and commitment, moving easily through spaces filled with nothing. Her rendition of “Whistle While You Work” may be the movie’s big showstopper, a lively dance sequence in which Zegler is the only thing that feels alive. She moves and twirls as though this really is a lot of fun, and for a few minutes, all the baggage this movie carries with it washes away. There’s a dedicated earnestness to her approach to Snow White — she moves not as if she believes Snow White is “real” but as if she knows who is watching the movie (children, mostly) and what they want to get out of it (a nice time).

The fate of the film in the greater Disney-live-action-remake swamp is yet to be determined, with box office tracking on the lower side. Right now it stands as an artifact, mostly, of ideas that probably felt wiser many years ago, the whole thing now burdened by bizarre politics and overstuffed lore. Almost nothing about the movie feels like a genuine choice as opposed to a R&D-tested average. In turn, the movie is full of contradictions: The dwarfs look horrible but sound good; Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen is the best styled presence onscreen but can neither sing nor dance (nor act?). In lieu of a Prince Charming, the love interest, is just a guy named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap) who advocates for Snow White to fight for herself … but also winds up saving her at the end of the day.

Amid the mess, Zegler emerges as the singular force who summons actual magic in her performance, and is perhaps the only person who ought to come out of all this unscathed (except for Andrew Barth Feldman who “voices” Dopey — he’s fine). She charms, she belts, she gives it her all and has gotten very little in return. That the actor has yet to sign on to any new big-screen projects is not a huge surprise after the year she’s had, but that doesn’t mean Zegler is going away. She spent the fall on Broadway in Romeo + Juliet and will soon go to the West End to play the titular role in Evita. Claims that Disney made a mistake in casting her are true, just not that the studio executives intended it. Zegler is a star worth nurturing, not neglecting, and Snow White is all the better because of her sparkle.",vulture

“Seven Severance Questions” is a weekly attempt to digest the events of one of television’s twistiest shows by highlighting the weirdest, most confusing, and most important unresolved issues after this week’s season-two finale, “Cold Harbor.” There will be theories. Many will be unhinged.

Severance has a way of giving out answers loaded with another bucket of questions. The season-two finale did just that across multiple levels of the Lumon building. Want to know how Mark’s innie and outie handle the Helly-Gemma situation? Sure, the show will tell you. Want to know what Cold Harbor was all about? Got you there, too. Want to know what the deal is with the goats? Coming right up. But none of it will be clean. None of it will settle anything. Sometimes, the answers can take you deeper down the rabbit hole than any of the questions ever did.

They can also make you shout a little. Were you shouting? At the end? In the hallway? I was. I’m not sure I even knew what I wanted Mark to do or whom to choose. I just kept shouting “NO!” and “YES!” and “WHAT ARE YOU DOING??” Arguments can be made that this choice was as tough on me as on him. The arguments aren’t particularly good, but they are definitely arguments. This show can twist you into a pretzel. And sometimes a marching band shows up. You just have to accept all that.

Below, please find our final round of questions about this season. I’m sure you have more. So do I, if I’m being honest. But these feel like a good place to start …

.

I guess the answer to this one depends on the lens you’re using to view the show. Are you rooting for the outies to find the happiness that was so elusive to them that they sought refuge through brain surgery that could segment off an entire chunk of their life? Are you rooting for the innies to experience something like a full life instead of just being drones created in a fit of hopeless desperation? Do you want to see thought-lost love rekindled or new love continue to blossom? Those are the things we all were trying to process as Mark’s innie was standing in that hallway between Gemma and Helly. It’s kind of what he was processing too.

You can see why he made the choice he did, even beyond the selfish reasons, even beyond “I love the redhead and don’t even really know that other woman.” There are issues of trust at play here that were planted at the beginning of the episode, when Mark’s innie and outie were having that conversation via camcorder that went sideways almost immediately. Mark’s innie did not appreciate how dismissive his outie was of the life the innies built inside Lumon. He got very prickly when his outie mispronounced Helly’s name as “Heleny” in a tone that scanned as Aw, it’s cute you think you have a little girlfriend, buddy. He didn’t particularly love how his outie just kind of expected him to be onboard with this plan that would essentially kill his friends and rest his own existence on a promise from the guy who put him there in the first place. Mark’s innie has been through a lot. He has reason to be skeptical. I’m not sure Cobel’s being there helped a lot.

There’s also the issue of … I mean, why would his innie think his outie deserves any of this? His outie is a depressed mess with no friends who has now subjected their body to two experimental brain procedures in the hope of digging out of a rut. Yes, getting Gemma back might solve some of that, but Mark’s innie has no real knowledge of what their life was like before. All he knows is that he has friends and a purpose and is in love, and this guy who has gone years without any of that is asking him to give it all up for something uncertain at best. So yes, he freed Gemma, and yes, he went through with most of the plan, but in that final moment, looking at his two potential futures, he went with the one he wants to fight for. Hard to blame a guy for that.

.

Right, there’s the sticky part. Mark’s and Helly’s innies got their Butch & Sundance moment, running down the hallways as the alarm blared, ending on a freeze-frame that, if we didn’t know better, would read as a finale-finale and not just the final moments of this season. But things are still complicated. If Mark’s innie leaves the severed floor even for a second, his outie is never going back. Drummond is dead in a large Icelandic lump outside the elevator. (If you know anyone who went to law school, please do not ask them whether Mark’s innie or outie is responsible for the murder. They will never stop talking.) The Cold Harbor project was working until it didn’t. The goat lady has gone rogue. The vending machine is broken. It’s messy on the severed floor in a number of ways.

Here’s where it’s interesting, though. Jame just straight-up admitted he likes Helly R. more than his own daughter, Helena. He likes her fire and spirit and sees Kier in her, whatever that means. We could be looking at a world where he tries to keep her severed full time, which would in theory save the severed floor, corpses and all, and could keep Mark’s innie down there too. The only guarantee is that things are going to get weird. Gemma will have a lot to unpack. Devon will flip out. Lumon will have to somehow keep all or most of it quiet. It’ll be a mess. I’m ready whenever they are.

.

I think we may. My theory earlier in the season was that it was after some sort of immortality hack, a way to sever memories and move them from vessel to vessel in perpetuity. I thought this for a bunch of reasons, some having to do with Miss Huang (clones????), some with the goats (clones????), and some with the thing where rich weirdos always seem to be after immortality (Jame Eagan is nothing if not a rich weirdo).

But then we learned Miss Huang was just a regular kid who had been part of Lumon’s long-standing tradition of child labor. And then we learned the goats are just being raised as sacrifices to be buried with dead test subjects and guide their souls to the afterlife. Then we heard about Kier’s “eternal war against pain” and saw that Gemma’s final test in Cold Harbor involved taking apart the same baby crib from back when she and Mark were struggling to conceive. And then I remembered that the only thing rich weirdos love as much as immortality is the idea of a technology-assisted utopia.

That’s where I’m at now. That’s why I think Mark and Gemma were so important to the project: This was a couple experiencing pain. If Lumon could separate them and sever the parts of their brain that remember that pain, they could — their theory here, not mine — be on the path to ending suffering. Mark saw Ms. Casey without triggering his Gemma trauma. Gemma was run through a series of stressful situations, culminating in one that would be downright cruel if it didn’t work, to see if they could sever the memories out individually. All of that could be pointing toward a world in which everyone gets a chip placed in their head at birth, and you go to the doctor every time you experience something unpleasant, and the doctor punches a few buttons and bloops the bad vibes out of existence forever — a society of pleasant zombies who feel nothing and never have to learn lessons.

Cold Harbor didn’t pass the ultimate test, though, which turns out to be “your blood-soaked husband rushes into the room and tells you to come with him.” Gotta refine a lot more macrodata to account for that one. It’s not necessarily back to square one on the whole plan now, but it’s probably back to a single-digit square somewhere.

.

Some preliminary notes:

— I did not foresee a scenario in which Dylan’s outie denied the resignation request. I thought he would have been thrilled. But it’s kind of sweet, in a way, that his loser outie is taking all of this as a wake-up call and motivation to become a better man. I’m rooting for him.

— This entire piece could easily have been questions about the marching band. What do they do on the severed floor all day when they’re not performing? Do their outies play instruments? Did their innies have to be trained from the start because they came in with no knowledge of music? Do you think one of them is a drummer on the outside but when he got down there they needed someone on the trumpet so he had to switch? You can see how this quickly spins out of hand. I’ll stop before it does.

Anyway, yes. It is my hope that next season begins with Dylan covered in war paint and the band marching behind him with its brass instruments sharpened into pointy weapons. You cannot take this away from me. Not yet.

.

I’ll be honest, I’m a little disappointed in how Milchick’s arc ended this season. I thought he was going to pop. I thought he was going to take Lumon down after a season of slights and long hours and the company taking him for granted. I really thought we were headed there after his little zinger about Kier’s height. (I also hope I’m not the only basketball-obsessed ’90s child who heard the opening notes of “Sirius,” by the Alan Parsons Project, and half-expected the Kier statue to say, “And now, your Chicago Bulls!”) And yet … nope. He played ball right up to the end, when the marching-band army had him surrounded.

At least he got to dance again. Maybe that’s how he works out his frustration. Maybe it’s in his contract: “Must let Seth dance once a month.” It does seem to make him happy.

.

I was sad when Miss Huang got shipped off last week. She had just been humanized, and I was starting to like her, and I wanted to see her get to play her theremin a little bit more. Maybe a cover of a pop song from the ’80s. Something peppy. Hall & Oates would work fine.

After all of this, though, after the murder and the blaring alarms and the uprooting of everything she was working on, I’m glad she got out when she did. Miss Huang did not need to be part of this. And I did not need to spend the whole episode worrying about the safety of a child I just got attached to. It would have been very stressful for both of us.

Spoilers ahead for Severance season two through the finale, “Cold Harbor.”

Severance never states what year it’s taking place. In fact, it deliberately obscures the matter by mashing up televisions, cars, and phones of past technological eras with a futuristic procedure that can separate a person’s home and work life. “But occasionally you have to say, okay, here’s a reference point in this world,” says director and executive producer Ben Stiller. “And, for me, I just wanted to use a Stone Roses song because I thought the lyrics were interesting.” “Love Spreads,” from 1994, may be a personal reference point for Stiller and Harmony Cobel alike, but it still won’t clue you in to the show’s time period — nor will the rest of the second season’s playfully reverent needle drops, which defy both genre and decade. A random sampling includes the Alan Parsons Project, Billie Holiday, and Canadian legend Gordon Lightfoot, choices mostly sourced from the Spotify playlist Stiller constantly updates with songs that he feels are Severance-worthy. He wants to stress, though, that this decision-making is a bit more arbitrary than what viewers may expect.

“When you decide to use a song, it’s a big statement or decision,” Stiller explains. “Especially in a show like this, because our score is such an incredibly important element to the tone. The depth of investigation to which people analyze it is something I never could have imagined. I always wrestle with it. So I never want to say, Oh, something is or isn’t here for a specific reason. It’s fun to let people have their ideas and thoughts.”

Sometimes, these decisions were determined by Stiller’s love of a particular artist. Others came from simply hearing a cool tune on the radio, adding it to the playlist, and seeing if an opportunity arose to utilize it later. With Severance’s explosive season-two finale now released, Stiller went into further detail about how he landed on six key songs, crescendoing to a velvet fog with the final moment of Mark S. and Helly R. (Adam Scott and Britt Lower) running hand in hand through the Lumon hallways. “There are no hard-and-fast rules,” he says. “It’s always just what feels right.” And this time, Mel Tormé was the perfect fit.

Episode 1 : “God Walks Down,” the Allergies

Our four Lumon pals are reunited at their cubicles and get back to work after the tumultuous events of the season-one finale.

Our music supervisor, George Drakoulis, and I go back a million years. He’s stealthy. For example, in season one, I thought “Enter Sandman” would work for Petey’s funeral. He was like, Oh yeah, I’ll call the Metallica guys and see if we can get a deal. He has those types of relationships. If I’m reaching out for an idea about something, he’ll send me incredible playlists.

Episode one was weird because we’re trying to reset and restart but also follow up on the end of this big cliffhanger from the previous season. Part of the episode structure was to get the gang back together. We had this idea for a circular dolly shot around the group where we see them reconnect with one another and get back into their work groove. The core of the show for me is the relationships between these people — these friends who are working together. This Allergies song came up on my Spotify feed, I’m not sure how, but I heard it and really liked it. I didn’t know the Allergies, either. But it felt like something that was kicking us off into the rest of the season. We’re back in it and it’s as hopeful and fun as it can get on Severance.

Mark is being reintegrated by Dr. Reghabi, and his memories of his Innie and Outie lives are being melded. The song also featured prominently in a season-two trailer.

I grew up in the ’70s and ’80s and remember this was one of the Who’s biggest hits after Keith Moon died. My friends and I were in a band, and we may have tried to play this. It’s always been a great song. It has that thing where it builds up and then kicks in, which was exactly like the sequence we were trying. When I’m editing a sequence, I always think about what’s going to help bring it to light. Is it a score or a song? There’s a list of songs that I would keep trying for certain moments. If I’m in my car and listening to a song and like it, I’ll add it to a playlist for “end song for episode three.”

There’s the synthesizer in the beginning of “Eminence Front” — da da da da — and it almost felt like what Dr. Reghabi was doing to Mark in the room. Because she has all the electronic equipment and reintegration stuff, it started to feather into that drum hit and fill, which has such a kick of energy. So it felt aligned, like it was all leading to Mark sitting up on the table. Then, the lyrics were perfect. I saw they used it in the trailer. At first, I was like, Oh, it’s going to be in the show, too. But then I realized, well, why not use it? Sometimes, it can take months of thinking about it or trying things out, and then all of a sudden the right song clicks in. This is one of those moments.

Episode 5 : “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,” Gordon Lightfoot

A yet-unknown Lumon doctor whistles the song while walking on the severed floor, picking up dental tools before going down the black hallway.

In one of the drafts of the seventh episode, there was a reference to this song that Dr. Mauer makes, but we cut it. The idea was he was talking about the song with Gemma as he was working on her teeth to calm her down. As it is with Severance, she’s on the testing floor, so there are always questions about what’s being said to her and if she’s retaining that information or not. I’m a huge Gordon Lightfoot fan. I used “Carefree Highway” as the end title for the fifth episode of Escape to Dannemora. I think he was a genius. The documentary about him is really cool, too. The idea was this was going to be a signature and eerie tune that we hear for Dr. Mauer, and we played into that. Everything else beyond that, I’ll let people theorize.

Episode 6 : “Sunshine of Your Love,” Ella Fitzgerald

Irving leaves Burt’s home after a somewhat uncomfortable dinner with his husband, Fields. Burt watches, with a hardened expression, as Irving walks to his car.

It was never going to be the Cream version. When a great director uses a song in a movie, like Martin Scorsese did with Goodfellas, it’s his. You can’t use it again. When you take a deeper look at it, this is an episode about relationships and love. There was one version of the edit where we flipped the last two scenes and we ended on Mark, when he was on the floor having the seizure. That would have called for a different ending song. But when we looked at it in the edit room, we thought it was more interesting to end on Burt. You know on some level that Mark is going through something, but it would be crazy if Mark — with all the tension of what’s going to happen — actually died in that moment. As an audience, that would be a huge thing. So, it’s more interesting to end on Burt and what he’s thinking. Because next time we see Burt, that’s going to play into it.

“Sunshine of Your Love” isn’t really romantic. It’s kind of dark and weird, and yet Ella Fitzgerald is singing it. I was in Hawaii when I heard it. I was like, Oh my God, this is crazy. Ella Fitzgerald is rocking out to it. It felt like this could thematically be a perfect dark yet romantic cue for the end.

Devon calls Harmony and tells her that Mark has been reintegrated. She asks to speak to Mark and tell her “everything” as she speeds out of her childhood town. Harmony previously listened to “Love Spreads” by the Stone Roses in episode three, showing a rare bit of insight into the character’s personality.

The big discussion was figuring out how to kick us off into where we’re going for the next episode. This eighth episode is so quiet and stark. This moment had to feel very different from the tone of the rest of the episode. For a while, I was like, Oh, is it too much and too jarring? Cobel has got a lot inside of her and we felt it — it really was like she’s a “fire woman” after what she just experienced with Sissy. It’s another song with a build. It felt like it was from her era. I wanted the audience to feel like we’re heading full steam back into the story now, and it kicks you off into the last two episodes of the season. I had another Cult song, “She Sells Sanctuary,” I was playing around with. But this one felt a little bit more right in the moment with the energy it brings.

Episode 10 : “The Windmills of Your Mind,” Mel Tormé

Mark S. successfully helps Gemma escape her Lumon captivity. After a brief internal battle, he chooses not to follow Gemma out but instead stays inside with Helly R. They run through the hallways holding hands, and a freeze-frame of the couple ends the season.

I don’t know if I’m turning into my parents, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve gotten into this Mel Tormé era. He was amazing. This was obviously the biggest music cue for the show, where it’s like, What are you going to go out on? The final image of season two was always a dystopian disconnect of two people running and in love. But in this hellish prison of these hallways, where are they going to? I was looking for the juxtaposition of the craziness of that with a hopeful song. We knew we were going into slow motion and wanted it to feel dreamlike and weird. Then, we knew we were going to have this freeze-frame at the end. I even tried “I Got You Babe” by Sonny & Cher. It was interesting and kind of unexpected, but you don’t want to be too cute. “As Tears Go By” by Nancy Sinatra was also a strong contender, but it didn’t make as much thematic sense.

“The Windmills of Your Mind” is weird both with its lyrics and sound. It’s like a crazy drug trip. It’s so strange. Because, really, that’s what this whole show is about. The circles that you’ll find in the windmills of your mind. When we were editing the episode, we made a clip of the last two minutes. Then, I just played songs at home with my phone over them, just to see what felt right. I thought it might be too crazy, but I put it on and then I sent it to Theodore Shapiro, our composer. Teddy was like, “Oh, by the way, I hope you keep that Mel Tormé song.” And I was like, “Yeah, it’s kind of great.” Then we found “Work Song” by Bobby Darin for the end titles. On paper, it was strange to open one song into another song. But I loved how they fit together. “The Windmills of Your Mind” is the craziness of the psychology of the show, the emotion, and the love. And then, it’s back to the guy who goes to work every day with “Work Song.”",vulture
https://vulture.com,It’s Time to Meet the ‘Real’ Kyle Mooney,https://www.vulture.com/article/kyle-mooney-the-real-me-music-album.html,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:13:14 GMT","Photo: Kyle M/Spotify

Earlier this week, actor, director, and Saturday Night Live alum Kyle Mooney teased the release of a new project in an Instagram video. Speaking in the nervous tone of a celebrity about to issue a public apology or reveal a scary health diagnosis, Mooney explained that “the last couple years have been pretty crazy,” and that, as a result, he’s decided to put out a new project that divides his fan base. “It’s who I am, it’s the real me, and I want to be okay with showing this side of myself and not caring what people might think or they might say,” he said.

That project, it turns out, is a full music album titled The Real Me, released March 21 on the legendary Stones Throw Records (!), and it does indeed shed a revealing light on the previously opaque public figure. For example, it would have been impossible to know prior to this that Mooney, now going by Kyle M, is into musical genres as diverse as “rock and roll, country, dance, and R&B.” That’s according to his official artist biography on Spotify, which also notes, “His debut album, The Real Me, is considered incredibly creative and poetic.”

The poetry and creativity are apparent from the album’s introductory track, in which Kyle M tees up what listeners are about to hear by playing both sides of a conversation:

“Hey, what’s going here?”

“Well, we’re going on a journey.”

“We’re going on a journey? What do you mean?”

“We’re going inside.”

“Inside where?”

“We’re going inside of … you.”

“Oh.”

And oh the places that journey takes us — from Kyle M’s ’50s-style ode to his “Blue Car” that will make you want to do the twist like Chubby Checker, to his four-on-the-floor banger “I Gotta Dance Tonight,” about how movement can liberate us from the pressures of capitalism. It is quite a trip. “The nine-to-five has got me stressed / Typing away in my shirt and vest,” he croons on the latter. “Boss is a jerk, always yells at me / I need a break from all the monotony / Where can I go to let it all out? / I need a way to scream and shout / Got no idea what I’m looking for / But I think I can find it on the dance floor.”

There will be a temptation among Mooney fans not to take this project as a serious artistic effort. After all, the comedian has a long reputation of playing comedic bits extremely straight without winking, and this project feels apiece with that. To those people, Mooney offers a rejoinder on the album’s closing track, “The Real Me,” sung over campfire guitar strums: “I know I come off as a clown / But I’m telling you now / There’s a real me deep down.”

It only took 18 years in the public light, but Mooney finally feels comfortable sharing that “real” version of himself now, and we applaud his courage and vulnerability.",vulture

It’s Friday afternoon. The sun is shining. The weekend hovers on the horizon with good times ahead. It’s been a quiet week, all considered, with no additional legal mishegoss from the ongoing It Ends With Us lawsuit pile-on and then … wait … no … Justin Baldoni and Jennifer Abel, his current publicist, are suing his former publicist Stephanie Jones in the midst of also suing Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the New York Times. Have these guys run out of all the possible lawsuit permutations by now? This has been going on for nearly three months. What is one more lawsuit going to do exactly?

Per Variety, Baldoni set his sights on Jones, with his lawyer, Bryan Freedman, claiming that she leaked private communications to Leslie Sloane, Lively’s PR. During the premiere of It Ends With Us last summer, Jones was working with Abel at her company Jonesworks, the two of them collaborating on Baldoni’s behalf. Abel announced to Jones that she was leaving the firm to start her own company in August of 2024, which Baldoni’s newest legal complaint alleges led Jones to turn on him. When Abel quit her job, Jonesworks demanded she turn over all her computer data. “In turning over these materials to Lively, Jones knew full well that the blowback would engulf not only Abel but also her clients, Wayfarer, and Baldoni,” the complaint alleges.

So, to follow the logical thread here, just in case you’re lost with all the Spider-Man-pointing meme going on here: The new complaint alleges that Baldoni’s team hired Jones and Abel, fired Jones, then Jones went to Sloane with confidential texts, who then took those texts to Lively and the Times. One starts to wonder how many lawsuits will be enough to satisfy anyone involved anymore. Better get at least one more in there, just to be safe.",vulture
https://vulture.com,What’s the New ‘Snow White’ Live-Action About? Lingering Qs,https://www.vulture.com/article/snow-white-2025-lingering-questions.html,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:47:18 GMT","Rachel Zegler as Snow White. Photo: Walt Disney Studios

If there’s one truth about our world it’s that when a beloved Disney cartoon becomes a maligned Disney live-action remake, there’s always a lore drop. Sometimes this takes the form of a villain backstory — consider the spinoff films Maleficent or Cruella, or the detail that Gaston is a “war veteran” (which war?) in Beauty and the Beast. Other times this means there’s an unnatural interest in STEM fields, like the kids in both Dumbo and The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. Never has the encroaching specter of lore been more apparent than this weekend’s Snow White. Already maligned with controversy surrounding both stars Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler, the studio’s latest introduces a number of aggressively irrelevant details to further complicate its new take on an unimpeachable classic. In an attempt to better understand Snow White — who’d have thought we needed that? — some lingering questions about the film’s convoluted backstory.

Where is this supposed to be set?

Obviously, this isn’t really clear — we have no country name nor made-up map to look at — but Snow White makes reference to the wars “in the south.” Oh, Mary voice: “The south of what?” There’s also an area called the “Western Vale” (which is a region in Guild Wars 2, though that’s surely a coincidence).

Wait, what are they at war over?

No clue. It’s about an evil queen and dwarves, not military strategy.

How does the government in Snow White function?

We’re dealing with a mostly straightforward monarchy, with Snow White’s (Rachel Zegler) birth parents ruling until their untimely deaths and her stepmother (Gal Gadot) taking her throne in their absence.

What is the economy based on?

Under Snow White’s parents’ rule, everything seemed like an agrarian paradise, a loosely medieval kingdom where everyone is always eating fruit and/or pies and/or fruit pies. Whether or not they have a functioning trade system remains to be seen.

What happened when the Evil Queen took over?

The Evil Queen doesn’t care about pie; she cares about being the fairest of them all and jewels. She forced a number of the farmers to become guards or soldiers in her army — again, to fight what war? — at the risk of farmlands. Why she would neglect agriculture makes little sense, but upon the film’s start, the people in the kingdom are starving.

So the prince comes from another kingdom to rescue Snow White?

No, this time the prince is just a guy named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap) who is basically like the DSA chapter president of people who live in the woods who are loyal to the true king of wherever the hell this is set.

Wait, so the prince is a pro-monarchist bandit?

Yeah, there seems to be affection for the original line of royalty who were all about sharing resources, even though communism, or even socialism, is at odds with monarchy. The Evil Queen is bad, however, because she hoards resources. That much is clear.

The dwarves.

What about them?

Are they still mining jewels?

Yup, that’s the same.

So the Evil Queen who is obsessed with jewels is trading with the dwarves?

No. It’s not clear where the Evil Queen’s jewels and gems come from, nor do we know where the dwarves’ mining lodes are going. The dwarves tell Snow White they haven’t encountered a human in hundreds of years.

Don’t the bandits live in the woods?

Yeah.

So the bandits and dwarves, who all live in the woods, never interacted before now?

Maybe the woods are really big.

And the dwarves … they’re brothers?

They seem to be really old not-friends who all live in the same house. When you’re making a cartoon 87 years ago, you don’t have to explain how and why seven guys all live in the same house. In 2025, for whatever reason, that otherwise simple setup starts to feel a bit strange, like, are they friends or cousins or what?

They have magic powers too, right?

When the dwarves go into the mine to sing “Heigh-Ho,” their hands glow red and when they touch rocks, all the minerals and gems light up.

What does that do?

No idea.

Does that power come into play during a climactic scene?

No, we never see the dwarves use this power again for the rest of the film.

Sorry — their hands glow?

For some reason!

Just to double back for a second, why does the Evil Queen’s policy shift from a pie-based economy to a gem-based send Snow White’s kingdom into economic depression? Did she make all the farmers and bakers become miners?

No, it’s not really clear where her gems are coming from, just that she’s got a lot of them and doesn’t care about anything else. Mostly it seems like the people in the kingdom have just been starving and not farming during her reign of terror, though if she’s so focused on jewels, why does she care if anyone is farming?

What happens at the end?

Snow White rightfully takes the throne, and the economy goes back to being pie-based.

Do the pies look good at least?

Weirdly, no … they’re way too big and way too crusty. How do you mess up pie?",vulture
https://vulture.com,"Every Live-Action Disney Remake, Ranked",https://www.vulture.com/article/live-action-disney-remakes-ranked.html,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Disney

This article was originally published on May 26, 2023. However, Disney’s commitment to mining past IP for fresh, nostalgia-fueled dollars means that we must continue to update this list every several months for the foreseeable future. The latest classic to meet this fate is Snow White.

When, at the height of the so-called Disney Renaissance in 1994, the studio that was producing a string of animated hits decided to revisit an old favorite in a new way, no one could have predicted what a gigantic industry Disney’s live-action versions of its own animated movies would become. There were sporadic live-action adaptations in the years following that initial remake of The Jungle Book, including a stretch of movies like Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland that offered alternate, reimagined spins on classic films. But the live-action remake trend really solidified in 2015 with the release of Cinderella, the first of many slavishly faithful retellings of well-known movies. That has often resulted in hermetically sealed reenactments designed only to remind viewers of something they’re already familiar with.

In recent years, Disney has been mining its animated past more aggressively than ever before, and this week’s theatrical release of the long-delayed Snow White comes just a few months after prequel/sequel Mufasa: The Lion King and a few months before Lilo & Stitch. New live-action versions of Moana, Hercules, Tangled, and more are all in various stages of development. Along the way, Disney has stretched the definition of “live action” to encompass photorealistic CGI productions that include little to no actual live-action footage.

Those movies are included in this ranking, though, since Disney has successfully sold them as something different from animation. Every movie adapted from a Disney animated feature film is here, from the semi-clever variations to the straightforward re-creations, all carefully prepackaged for easy, unchallenging consumption.

25. The Jungle Book: Mowgli’s Story (1998)

Although it was released just four years after Disney’s first live-action version of The Jungle Book, this direct-to-video production is a separate, more faithful retelling of the story — yet sticking to the original plot is about the only thing this movie succeeds at. Future Disney Channel star Brandon Baker plays Mowgli, in a cloying, awkward performance that fits with the hacky sitcom writing. The “jungle” looks like a low-rent animal-encounter attraction, and director Nick Marck places hyperactive voice-over dialogue alongside mostly static shots of real animals shuffling around uncomfortably, not moving their mouths. There’s no sense of adventure, just an annoying kid staring at various captive creatures while bored B-list actors recite bad jokes on the soundtrack.

24. 102 Dalmatians (2000)

Glenn Close’s delightfully unhinged performance as villainous, puppy-murdering fashion magnate Cruella de Vil carries 1996’s 101 Dalmatians, but it’s not enough to save this dreadful sequel. Cruella spends the first part of the movie supposedly reformed, thanks to some Jason Bourne–style government reprogramming, before reverting back to her evil ways. She breaks down a wall to get to her furs like they’re John Wick’s guns and once again sets her sights on amassing Dalmatians to make into a coat. Director Kevin Lima dials up the wackiness, and Close follows accordingly, mugging and screeching as Cruella is outwitted by various bumbling dogs and eventually defeated by being baked into a giant cake, somehow.

23. Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016)

There’s a bit of Tim Burton charm to Disney’s first live-action Alice in Wonderland, but that’s all disappeared as director James Bobin takes over for the sequel. Mia Wasikowska’s Alice is adrift in her own story, mostly just reactive as she travels back in time ostensibly to save the doomed family of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Both the Hatter and the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) get boilerplate tragic origins in a cluttered plot that’s drowned out by the hideous, oppressive visual effects. Depp overloads on his irritating brand of wide-eyed whimsy, and a miscast Sacha Baron Cohen inexplicably sounds like Werner Herzog as the personification of Time.

22. Pinocchio (2022)

With his frequent fixation on technological advancements at the expense of storytelling, director Robert Zemeckis is a perfect fit for the current era of Disney remakes, as he proves in this unsettling, disastrous take on one of Disney’s earliest animated classics. Creating detailed CGI versions of the original hand-drawn animated designs for wooden puppet Pinocchio and his insect pal Jiminy Cricket renders them grotesque and disturbing, and that extends to the sour, distorted interpretation of the original movie’s story, characters, and musical numbers. Tom Hanks stumbles through his role as human wood-carver Geppetto, giving a misguided performance in a hopelessly misguided movie.

21. The Lion King (2019)

Let’s be clear: This is not a live-action movie, no matter what Disney calls it. It’s a painstakingly photorealistic CGI update of the traditionally animated original, but it’s still an animated movie. It’s also entirely stiff and lifeless, sacrificing the expressiveness of a cartoon for something that looks like it would play on TVs at Best Buy to demonstrate a horrifying new type of motion smoothing. After introducing the hyperreal CGI environments and creatures of 2016’s The Jungle Book, director Jon Favreau takes things one step further, applying the same techniques to everything depicted onscreen. He delivers the grand, Shakespeare-influenced story of betrayal and redemption as a clumsy diorama of the animal kingdom.

20. Christopher Robin (2018)

The kid protagonist of the animated Winnie-the-Pooh movies becomes a stereotypical neglectful movie dad in this glum live-action follow-up to the cartoon adventures of the stuffed bear and his friends. The title character (Ewan McGregor) is now a downtrodden World War II veteran working as a middle manager at a luggage company and ignoring his wife and daughter. His childhood animal playmates return to remind him about what matters in life, basically harassing him into becoming a better person. “Was it always this gloomy?” Christopher Robin asks when he returns to the magical Hundred Acre Wood, a relevant question about both the tone and visual style of such a dismal, hectoring movie.

19. The Jungle Book (2016)

Favreau’s first Disney project features one human actor, Neel Sethi as Mowgli, but his presence is just as stilted as the CGI animals surrounding him. Even a mere seven years later, the cracks are already starting to show in the once-astounding special effects, particularly in the harsh, artificial lighting of the supposed jungle setting. Bill Murray and Christopher Walken bring some charisma to their respective voice performances as Baloo the bear and King Louie the orangutan, but their half-hearted delivery of a couple of songs from the animated movie is pretty feeble, a reminder of how much more vibrant and memorable their cartoon counterparts are.

Once Rachel Zegler’s Snow White gets banished from the castle by her stepmother, the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot), she heads deep into the uncanny valley to encounter repulsive CGI versions of the seven dwarfs, whose smooth-yet-gnarled visages are never not upsetting. The rest of this remake of Disney’s first-ever animated feature is simply underwhelming, with both Zegler and Gadot barely measuring up to costumed theme-park workers. Zegler has a lovely singing voice, but the slick, uninspired new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul sit awkwardly next to the old-timey originals. The hoodie-wearing rebel replacement for Prince Charming (Andrew Burnap) is smarmy and condescending, and the half-hearted attempts to give Snow White more agency are just meaningless padding.

17. 101 Dalmatians (1996)

Close’s grandiose version of Cruella de Vil remains definitive, but the rest of this dopey family comedy is a mix of strained slapstick and unearned sentiment. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson — in a hairstyle that makes her look exactly like Princess Diana — play the bland lovebirds whose pet Dalmatians inspire Cruella’s envy, and their scenes are dull and treacly, with weird patriarchal overtones. Screenwriter John Hughes cribs from his own Home Alone for the silly sequences of animals thwarting criminals, but these dogs have nothing on Kevin McCallister, especially since they never get to speak.

Director Barry Jenkins’s slightly more elegant follow-up to the stilted Lion King remake has big prequel energy (it includes origins for both a rock and a stick), but no particular reason for existing beyond Disney’s insatiable hunger for brand extension. The framing story features annoying meta-commentary from Timon and Pumbaa, as flashbacks recount the early friendship between lions Mufasa (Aaron Pierre) and Scar (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), then known as Taka. The new songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda are appealing enough, but the visual style is still off-putting, and the plot offers a dull journey along a checklist of predetermined incidents.

15. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019)

It’s one thing to retell a famous fairy tale from an alternate perspective, but it’s another thing to figure out how to keep that new story going, whether it’s warranted or not. The studio demand for a follow-up to 2014 hit Maleficent doesn’t translate into an engaging narrative now that Sleeping Beauty villain Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) has been thoroughly rehabilitated. New conflict comes from Michelle Pfeiffer as a scheming queen whose son is set to marry Maleficent’s goddaughter Aurora (Elle Fanning), but the simplicity of the original fable is replaced with muddled lessons, ugly special effects, and a confusing metaphor for the displacement of native peoples.

14. Dumbo (2019)

Tim Burton’s second Disney live-action remake is a poorer fit for his sensibilities than Alice in Wonderland, and he struggles to integrate his creepy-cute style with the basic, episodic structure of the animated classic. Burton and screenwriter Ehren Kruger essentially retell the entire original movie in the first 40 minutes, then continue the story by bringing flying elephant Dumbo into a new setting. The movie perks up when Michael Keaton and Eva Green arrive as a ruthless impresario and his sensitive acrobat girlfriend, and Burton envisions his obvious Disneyland analog as a capitalist hellscape. It’s a half-formed allegory at best, though, with uninteresting human protagonists and a chaotic, murky finale.

13. Beauty and the Beast (2017)

Bill Condon’s adaptation of the first animated movie ever to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture is also the first live-action remake to incorporate all of the songs from its source material. Unfortunately, this invites comparisons to the superior original, despite the admirable efforts from stars Emma Watson and Dan Stevens as the title characters. The reprises of moments from the animated movie are rather pale imitations, while the additions, including a few downbeat, maudlin new songs from Alan Menken and Tim Rice, are all superfluous. The introspective, provincial girl and the arrogant, cursed prince both get extra trauma added to their pasts, but all it does is pad out the run time.

12. The Little Mermaid (2023)

The casting of Halle Bailey as Ariel shows what a difference it makes when Disney recruits actual singers for roles that involve lots of singing, but she doesn’t do much more than smile beatifically when she’s not belting out musical numbers. The star-crossed romance between mermaid Ariel and human prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) is mostly a dud, although screenwriter David Magee attempts to give Eric some extra depth so that the connection is based on more than love at first sight. The new songs, especially a rap-inflected number led by Awkwafina as seabird Scuttle, aren’t worth much, and the depiction of the undersea world is a garish, plasticky eyesore. Bailey’s fantastic voice only takes the movie so far.

11. Aladdin (2019)

The genie from the original Aladdin is a remarkable example of animators and a voice performer coming together to create something unique and brilliant, so there’s no way for a CGI-enhanced Will Smith to live up to Robin Williams’s legacy. He sure does try, but the effort always shows, and his domineering presence crowds out the subtler moments. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott have a sweet, understated dynamic as street thief Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, and their version of love ballad “A Whole New World” is a highlight. Director Guy Ritchie adds unnecessary action scenes and a perfunctory solo song for Jasmine, but it all comes back to Smith’s desperate, attention-grabbing antics.

10. Lady and the Tramp (2019)

This Disney+ original, which was a high-profile launch title for the streaming service, gets points for casting real-life rescue dogs rather than relying solely on antiseptic CGI replicas. The dogs are cute, although even with special-effects augmentations, they’re still far more inert than their animated equivalents. The romance between the title characters, a pampered family dog and a rough-and-tumble stray, also lacks the warmth and passion that traditional animation can convey. The iconic spaghetti-strand kiss barely registers in this version. It’s pleasant but forgettable, serving as the first of many reminders that, on Disney+, it’s just as easy to watch the earlier, better movie instead.

9. Cinderella (2015)

Director Kenneth Branagh’s Cinderella is often elegant and opulent, and if nothing else, it scales back on the title character’s grating, obtrusive little mouse friends. Lily James’s Cinderella doesn’t have much more personality than the simplistic animated version, although she gets to have a few more substantive conversations with Prince Kit (Richard Madden) before becoming the object of his obsession. Cate Blanchett is relatively subdued as Cinderella’s wicked stepmother, with her shrieking stepsisters picking up most of the slack. There’s nothing notably new here, but it’s a bright, lively adaptation of an oft-told fairy tale.

8. Alice in Wonderland (2010)

Burton has spent the last 25 years or so adding his goth-lite aesthetic to various existing properties, often giving Johnny Depp a prominent role. It would be easy to dismiss all of those efforts as equally hollow, but it’s clear that Burton doesn’t have the same level of artistic engagement on all these projects. Although it’s far from his best work, Alice in Wonderland is such an obvious choice for Burton that it’s nearly impossible for him not to connect with it. Depp is only mildly annoying as the Mad Hatter, and Mia Wasikowska brings a fierce indomitability to Alice that’s missing in the sequel. Even a watered-down version of the vintage Burton magic still has a certain appeal.

7. Maleficent (2014)

Jolie’s first go-round as the misunderstood Sleeping Beauty villain is much more successful than the second, although it still never quite justifies its independent existence. Jolie is best when she gets to be truly menacing, but that’s confined to a handful of moments in a movie that is determined to reimagine Maleficent as maligned and mistreated. The villain role shifts to Sharlto Copley’s power-hungry King Stefan, but he never seems like much of a threat compared to the majestic Maleficent. The pseudo-maternal bond between Maleficent and Fanning’s Princess Aurora is flimsy, but when Maleficent brings the full force of her powers down on her enemies, the movie can be thrilling.

6. Peter Pan & Wendy (2023)

There’s an added genuine human touch to director David Lowery’s Disney remakes, although this take on the story of Peter Pan isn’t as successful as his earlier version of Pete’s Dragon. Still, Lowery puts care and consideration into his characters, especially the adolescent Wendy Darling (Ever Anderson), whose reluctance to grow up leads her to Neverland along with her younger brothers. The other title character, Alexander Molony’s Peter Pan, is less compelling, which gives the movie a lopsided focus. Jude Law’s Captain Hook becomes a more melancholy character thanks to revelations that tie his past to Peter’s, and his villain rehabilitation is more effective than certain flashier Disney efforts in that area.

5. The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (2010)

The brief sequence that re-creates the “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” segment from 1940’s Fantasia could be cut entirely without any effect on the plot, but that turns out to be a good thing. Rather than copying a Disney animated classic, this Jerry Bruckheimer production fits in with the YA action-fantasy boom of the 2000s. It’s a lower-tier example, but Nicolas Cage is having fun as an ancient sorcerer who’s frustrated by his clueless college-age apprentice (Jay Baruchel), and Alfred Molina relishes the role of the evil wizard out to destroy the world. The action is passable, the mythology is generic, and the post-credits scene is overly optimistic about the prospects for a sequel, but there’s a good-natured sense of wonder that ties it all together.

4. Cruella (2021)

It may be a somewhat empty pastiche of more subversive films, but director Craig Gillespie’s origin for 101 Dalmatians antagonist Cruella de Vil (Emma Stone) is still gorgeous to look at. Taking its cues from the previous live-action movies, Cruella is set in the fashion world of 1970s London, with both Stone and Emma Thompson (as Cruella’s rival the Baroness) channeling aspects of Glenn Close’s indelible performance. The faux-gritty Cruella is a sprawling mess of a movie that never quite figures out its tone or narrative approach, but it features fabulously creative costume design and enjoyably nasty performances from the two leading Emmas.

3. Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book (1994)

Author Rudyard Kipling gets a possessive credit, but director and co-writer Stephen Sommers deviates substantially from both Kipling’s source material and the Disney animated film. Sommers is not working under the weight of decades of Disney remakes, so he’s free to make a rollicking pulp-adventure movie starring Jason Scott Lee as an adult Mowgli, returning to so-called civilization after growing up in the wild. There are no talking animals, but Lena Headey’s Kitty, who looks longingly out her tower window while her military-officer father (Sam Neill) keeps close watch on her, is essentially a Disney princess. Fans of Sommers’s retro action classic The Mummy will find plenty to enjoy, as a reluctant Mowgli leads a dastardly British captain (Cary Elwes) into various elaborate traps in search of hidden treasure.

2. Mulan (2020)

Director Niki Caro jettisons the songs and almost all of the humor from one of Disney’s weaker Renaissance-era animated films, depicting the Chinese legend of strong-willed female warrior Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) as a sweeping wuxia epic. It’s a rousing, immersive blockbuster action movie, with excellent fight sequences and a mesmerizing performance from Gong Li as the shapeshifting witch Xianniang. Caro skillfully shoots both massive battles and close-quarters combat, with key supporting performances from martial-arts stars Donnie Yen and Jet Li. The movie streamlines some complex gender themes with Mulan posing as a man in order to join the Chinese Imperial Army, but it takes the characters’ risks and ambitions seriously. It’s a remarkably successful reinvention that stands confidently on its own.

1. Pete’s Dragon (2016)

Lowery has the advantage of working from shoddy source material for his adaptation of the justifiably forgotten 1977 live-action/animated hybrid, so nearly any kind of update would look better in comparison. Even so, Lowery crafts a lovely, heartfelt coming-of-age movie in the vein of a 1980s Amblin Entertainment production, infused with compassion and tenderness. There’s some danger for feral boy Pete (Oakes Fegley) and his furry green dragon friend Elliot after they’re discovered living in the forest outside an idyllic small town, but Lowery’s film keeps its gentle rhythm even through the finale’s perilous bridge collapse. Robert Redford delivers folksy wisdom as a local eccentric who once had his own dragon encounter, and even Karl Urban’s greedy logger is more of a nuisance than an outright villain. Lowery demonstrates the best approach to a remake, by keeping only what’s useful and using what’s left for his own personal vision.",vulture

Approximately half of late-night TV was off this week, which means Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert, and Taylor Tomlinson were all spared from having to feign shock and dismay over the vandalism of Teslas. On multiple shows this week, hosts started a monologue segment about the … let’s call them “direct actions” at Tesla dealerships this week, which the audience applauded uproariously. Then the hosts had to do a legally obligated “Hey now, destruction of property isn’t cool, guys” preamble before going in harder on Elon Musk and what the The Daily Show termed his “Nazi cum.”

We saw this same disconnect between what the audience was braying for and what the hosts felt/were allowed to say on network television with the Luigi Mangione story. Sure, legally, NBC can’t condone murder — not with as many cop shows as it has. And destruction of property is also what many in the legal profession are calling “technically a crime.” But if one believes America is being taken over by fascists, then one will eventually have to endorse the crime of resisting fascism. It’s something late-night hosts of the ’60s and ’70s didn’t have to contend with, since they weren’t really trying to be anything other than the Establishment. Johnny Carson never had to contend with an audience whoo-ing the burning of draft cards. All these hosts (and their legal departments) will have to find the line they’re willing to walk. Or they can retreat into apolitical Carsonland; that is an option, too. Now for the funniest bits on late night this week.

There’s a name for a joke based on misdirection, which I believe originated in The Simpsons fandom: a screw-the-audience joke. They were big in the David Mirkin era of the show (seasons five and six) and involve setting up a possibly cliché joke then subverting it at the last second. Last Week Tonight had a great one during its episode about online gambling. It’s at the very beginning of the segment: John Oliver says sports are the second-best activity you can do with balls, after … reading … pornography. It’s a double subversion, in that reading is far more tame than what you’re expecting, and then porno is, frankly, exactly what you were expecting. You dirty bird, you.

Everybody’s Live is now, and probably forever shall be, a work in progress. The point is to keep it loosey-goosey, especially because that irks the tighty-whitey John Mulaney. He’s fighting against his nature with this show, and isn’t that one of the big nine plots? During the cruise-ship episode, Mulaney and crew (shout-out Ben Stiller for having the best follow-up questions) spoke to former boat worker Oren, who once stored a dead body in a state room. This was, by far, the best call Everybody’s Live has gotten. More corpse talk in the coming weeks, please. It immediately raises the stakes and keeps us locked the fuck in. And the logistics of death is one of the great subplots, so there’s that.

It’s not as freewheeling as Club Shay Shay, but it’s still something. Any time Katt Williams goes on the record, it’s an event. This time, he was on The Tonight Show, explaining that he was nice to an up-and-coming Jimmy Fallon not out of the goodness in his soul but because Fallon had the energy of a guy who was going to rise to the top. Williams told a lot of crazy-yet-true tall tales about himself and explained how golf saved his life. It was a slightly wider-appeal Katt Williams than you’ll get on a podcast, but it’s still Katt.

2.

You have to salute the sheer audacity of this bit between Jordan Klepper and Troy Iwata, which presupposes that being disappointed in Donald Trump is fatal to sick children. Let’s back up: Earlier in the week, Trump said Biden’s pardons weren’t legit because they used something called an autopen. Then he copped to using an autopen to write some bullshit to sick kids. The bit on TDS, then, suggests that the children are so heartbroken that Trump didn’t personally sign their “hang in there, kid” letters that they dropped dead. A whole hospital’s worth. One dead kid is a tragedy; an entire hospital’s worth is comedy gold.

Every moment of this True Confessions segment on The Tonight Show is absurd and delightful. The premise of the segment is this: A celeb says a statement, and their famous acquaintances have to suss out whether that statement is a truth or a lie. The whole premise falls apart if the players are engaged to be wed and hopefully know quite a lot about each other. Benny Blanco immediately clocks that Selena Gomez is lying, and she doesn’t care enough to try and front. Then it’s Fallon’s turn to talk, and it’s truly delightful how little Belena know about anything. Benny doesn’t know who Millie Bobby Brown is, nobody knows she got married, and Selena doesn’t know about Fallon’s stand-up past. “Do you like the guitar?” she asks. “Are you known for that?” Asking the decade-plus host of The Tonight Show what they’re known for? An incredible boss move. You’ve always got to keep an eye out for Selener.",vulture

As an adaptation of the Disney classic, Snow White feels like it dislikes its source material, eschewing most of the 1937 film’s memorable tunes for some new forgettable pop songs. As a story about a young woman trying to reclaim her father’s kingdom, it manages to work just enough. That’s due to Rachel Zegler, who shines as a Disney princess as she acts and sings circles around the rest of the cast, including Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen, who rules over the kingdom, sure, but she seems way more concerned with having gems and looking good at all times.

As The Pitt faces a “mass-cas” event, we’re republishing this February 20, 2025, interview with a real-life Dr. Robby. Read Noah Wyle’s take on episode 12, “6:00 P.M.,” here.

Watching The Pitt often feels like navigating an anxiety attack: You’re overwhelmed with a wave of doom, you work through it, then you deal with however things shake out … just as the next wave hits again. Max’s spiritual successor to ER — though it’s legally complicated to call it that — follows a shift in the life of a busy emergency room in Pittsburgh. Noah Wyle anchors the show as Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinovich, the attending physician who leads the department’s efforts to treat the endless swirl of patients barreling through the door.

Visceral, grisly, and exceedingly stressful, The Pitt draws a lot of its stickiness from its real-time structure: Taking a page out of 24, the 15-episode season tracks the goings-on of one entire 15-hour shift. That format lends a greater sense of realism to the show, which has apparently been so effective that it’s driven some chatter online (and in the Vulture comments), often from voices within the medical community praising the series’ verisimilitude.

To kick the tires on these plaudits, Vulture reached out to a medical professional who is a fan of the show: Dr. Lukas Ramcharran of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. A physician who holds an M.D. and an M.B.A. from New York University, Ramcharran serves as an attending physician and assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins. In other words, he’s a real-life comp for Dr. Robby. We spoke earlier this week ahead of The Pitt’s eighth episode, as he was enjoying an off day doing administrative tasks on his computer.

I’ve heard some people say that The Pitt is the most realistic depiction of emergency medicine on television, perhaps ever. Does that ring true to you?

Oh, absolutely.

How did you get into the show?

My wife and I are not huge consumers of television, because we have a 10-month-old at home and we have another due in a month. She’s working full-time, and I’ve got ER shifts. Years ago, I watched ER, and I loved that show at the start when it was really about the medicine, but less so as the show understandably had to create more plotlines and become more dramatized. I don’t think I even finished the series.

We had seen the ads for The Pitt on HBO. But what really turned me on to it was seeing social-media chatter from the educational side of things. EM:RAP endorsed it, which is a national education platform for emergency medicine that creates a lot of content we use for learning about the specialty. It’s a wonderful resource outside of the more traditional lectures and things we do in the formal residency-training program. I believe it also consulted on the show. Then I saw some promotional clips with Noah Wyle and physicians who were consulting on the show talking about the medical boot camp they had put the actors through to get them to portray this as accurately as they could, and that really got me interested.

But surely you still went into the show with some skepticism.

Of course. A lot of us in the field, regardless of speciality, like to poke fun at how inaccurate things are depicted on television. And we understand why. The purpose of these scenes is to best serve the plot, right? But The Pitt is great. My wife, who’s not in medicine, and I have been together since college, and she’s seen me go through the entire educational pipeline to become an attending physician. I’ve always told her I would love for our family to see what we do on a daily basis — to see the specialty that I love and have dedicated my life to. Of course, because of HIPAA and patient-privacy needs, we can’t ever have family members stop by on a workday, so my primary motivation was seeing if this show could show her that. It’s been such a joy. I’m constantly pausing and saying, “That’s what we do! That’s the thing I told you about!” Obviously, I edit too. “This would actually be more bloody” and so on. And she is constantly saying, “Hey, can you quit pausing?”

What stands out to you about the show?

I really like the format. The idea of one shift is good at showing what a day in the life is like and different push-and-pulls in the role. You have the medicine, but you also have all these other non-medicine things that pull at your attention: your team members, your hospital, the trials and tribulations of working with people who come to you on their worst day.

Unlike other shows, it doesn’t linger in long dramatic plotlines. There’s no time for that, because it’s one shift and everything they’re doing has to revolve around what’s actually happening between people in the ER. It’s a lot less Grey’s Anatomy in that sense. There’s a lot more computer work. There’s a lot more phone calls. There’s a lot more interruptions, right? All of that is very accurate.

Dr. Robby is constantly jumping around, and that’s really close to what being an attending physician is like. You’re trying to do the medicine, but you’re also there for the education of your medical residents. He’s constantly dropping into things, seeing where he can help out a learner, giving them a little bit of autonomy, giving them some leash, trusting his senior residents and empowering them to take on the next stage of their career. That’s really wonderful to watch, but you also see aspects where he’s human. You see the full system: the support staff, the people up front being triaged in the waiting room, the people handling the waiting room. You have the social worker, who’s probably one of my favorite characters; they are the unsung heroes in many ways.

And you’ve got administrators, who I think are a bit dramatized and more vilified than usual. Everyone, including administrators, is working to be aligned in trying to take care of everybody and moving care forward. They are the ones who are trying to look at systematic and operational issues, asking, “How can we take care of more patients?”

How many times per day do administrators actually visit an emergency department?

Very, very few. When you’re an attending on shift, your job is to care for patients and train your learners. The medical director, the associate medical director, and our admin staff who are not on shift that day — those are the ones who field those kinds of requests. The idea of an administrator coming down in the actual shift and engaging with you in real time … that’s not realistic. You can imagine how that would be an incredible disruption to patient care.

That back-and-forth between the administrator and Dr. Robby recurs throughout the season, and The Pitt seems to use it to explore the tension between patient satisfaction, hospital incentives, and delivering care. How do you feel about that portrayal?

Those sentiments are true, but it isn’t necessarily felt on an individual-to-individual level. We all feel the stresses of a strained hospital system: congested waiting rooms, the patients who are admitted but not yet upstairs. It isn’t typically expressed as interpersonal conflict. I understand why they do that for the show, but in real life, it tends to be more collaborative. There’s a lot of us saying, “How do we get better?”

But the issues are real. It’s certainly not an excuse for prolonged wait times, but my hope is that if a patient sees a show like this, there’s exposure to an issue we’re trying to remedy. Clinicians and nurses are not sitting around and choosing who they want to see. There’s just so much going on. It’s almost an explanation of how we want to get to everybody in time but sometimes can’t. People are constantly busy.

Do a quick performance evaluation for me: Is Dr. Robby a good head of emergency?

I think so. He’s not Superman. He certainly has these ghosts that haunt him related to what appears to be the death of his mentor during the height of the pandemic. But he is very skilled in terms of his clinical ability. Can he do better? Sure. But we’ve all had those days, right? I’ve had days where I’ve done well clinically, if that’s the measuring stick, but I needed to do a better job of leading the hearts and minds of my support staff who I’m entrusted with.

As an attending, one of the hardest things we do isn’t the cardiac arrest or the complicated procedures. We’re all trained to feel comfortable to handle those. It’s the family members who you’re trying to help understand the poor prognosis, or intubating someone whose family is revoking those goals of care in real time. It’s the end-of-life care, the abuse cases — those things stand out to you in a shift.

It’s the ethics, too. There’s a case in the show where a mom intentionally gets herself into the hospital to draw attention to her son who may be having thoughts of hurting people in school. You see that Dr. Robby wants to help that kid, even though he’s not actually a registered patient. You see other residents say, “Did you do the right thing?” I love all that stuff, because equally important to the more technical aspects of medicine is the portrayal of all the things that affect us emotionally.

“They’re indicating that this character (Dr. Trinity Santos, played by Isa Briones), who’s already a bit of a loose cannon, has a troubled past that somehow overlaps with the situation. So she threatens the patient, who’s in a vulnerable state. I thought that one was a little dramatized.” Photo: Max

That scenario is part of a trend on the show, where we see the physicians struggling with the role of being mandated reporters. There’s the kid with the troubling thoughts, but also the young woman seeking an abortion and that patient who’s suggested to be sexually assaulting his daughter.

Those cases really illustrate how complex things can get. We are mandated reporters, and as physicians, we’re constantly partnering with child-protective services and law enforcement to ask, “What are we obligated to report? Do we have enough here?” There are clear-cut cases, but there’s a lot of gray too. Sometimes we see female patients who are victims of domestic violence, and the decision to report is ultimately theirs. As a clinician, you might want to say: “You have resources, you have the ability to talk to a social worker, you have the ability to talk to a police officer should you want to.” But they can come in and say, “No, I just want to make sure my arm is not broken.” So there are situations where you want to help but you just can’t.

There’s that case on the show where a mother has been giving her husband medication to curb his libido, but giving that medication is illegal and highly dangerous and may result in death. So there’s the mission of needing to report that, but then the show layers on the question of whether there’s inappropriate harassment going on with the patient — though there’s nothing concrete. In real life, we would partner with the mom and the social worker, we would have a discussion, we would ask permission to engage with the daughter and find out if there’s probable cause where we can start involving the authorities. But that’s gonna have to come at the permission of the guardian. Would we ever go behind a guardian? There are things that can medically and legally emancipate a minor from their parents’ care, but this is one where you have no reason to believe the mother is also abusing the child.

Then, the series shows a doctor overstepping ethical bounds and taking justice into her own hands. What’s interesting, of course, is how they’re indicating that this character (Dr. Trinity Santos, played by Isa Briones), who’s already a bit of a loose cannon, has a troubled past that somehow overlaps with the situation. So she threatens the patient, who’s in a vulnerable state. I thought that one was a little dramatized. I’ve never met a physician who’d do that.

There are so many of these moral conundrums in this one shift. Have you had shifts like that?

Not that often, actually. If things were like this every day, the burnout would be hard to overcome. With a show like this, you have to pack a lot into the shift to make good TV. It’s not that it’s unrealistic — I’ve had shifts as busy as this, and I’ve had shifts not as busy as this.

I have a technical question: In the hub area, the physicians choose their next patients off what appears to be a Google doc. Is that a Google doc?

That’s the track board of electronic medical records. We use Epic, which is the main electronic-medical-record system used around the country that shows you patient information: vital signs, age, sex, different color codes telling you different levels of acuity. It might look like a Google doc from afar.

What The Pitt demonstrates is a very common model, where physicians are constantly looking at a central screen figuring out what’s next, and the charge nurse is calling out what emergencies are coming through next. It’s not first come, first serve; it’s the sickest patient first, so there’s constant triaging. Here at Hopkins, we have a similar setup, but we have individual private rooms in a 60-bed ER. We don’t have a central screen, and our charge nurses are managing who goes into what rooms. We just keep moving from room to room, and your next room is your next patient.

How many times, if any, have you seen a new doctor pass out in front of a patient?

Once, but it was not in front of a patient. In this case, it was a mix of hours of training and dehydration, and it all caught up to them. They just needed a moment, and they ended up being completely fine. It absolutely can happen. You might have a medical student who’s not going into emergency medicine, for whom this is their first emergency-medicine experience, and it’s quite overwhelming. I’ve had observers in the ER from our medical school and from our undergraduate campus get lightheaded and have to sit down or exit the room. But in terms of fully passing out, just one.

How do you feel about the scrub machine?

That is highly accurate and quite hilarious. The two compartment bins, the wrong sizes, the “does not detect” — absolutely. What happens to Dr. Whitaker (Gerran Howell) is deeply accurate. We all have changed scrubs multiple times. We’ve all gotten multiple types of body fluids on us. We all carry backup scrubs. I carry my own personal backup scrubs in my work bag.

The Pitt touches on this a bit, but there doesn’t seem to be much eating going on.

Absolutely. We certainly don’t eat in the clinical area. It’s what we call a JCAHO violation, which is a violation in terms of patient safety and hospital operations. We also don’t eat in front of patients, because a lot of patients are not allowed to eat if they’re awaiting surgery. We see it as kind of cruel if we eat in front of them.

A lot of emergency-medical clinicians just don’t eat. They will do their whole shift with either a granola bar in their pocket or lots of coffee. I personally do a lot of protein shakes and liquid calories, so I don’t ever have to sit down to eat on a shift and I can walk around with them. You don’t really get a mandated break for meals. When I was a resident, I abandoned many meals that I was heating in the microwave because an overhead call came in and I forgot all about it. We all have our different tricks on how to take care of ourselves. We’re eating before and after shift and things like that.

And the bio breaks — bathroom breaks — look, we’ve all been there where you walk toward the bathroom and a gunshot victim comes in and you just have to hold it.

What’s your favorite procedure depicted on the show so far?

In the last episode, the scene that I thought was really wonderful was where they did what we call the refractory ventricular fibrillation arrest that gets crashed on the ECMO. We have that protocol here at Hopkins. We also do dual defibrillation, which is what you see the two residents use: Two defibrillation pads are used to try to overwhelm the electrical system and get that heart out of rhythm. It’s much more complicated in real life, but seeing the cardiothoracic surgeons come down, seeing them cannulate, putting those large lines to the patient, seeing a resident explaining to a medical student but almost explaining it to the audience — I got really excited about that.

I also like how they use something called the LUCAS machine, which is the auto CPR device. That’s the device we use. It’s funny that I get to show my wife that, because my first name is Lukas, and that’s the LUCAS machine everybody always pokes fun at me for.

How common is it to have a super-young resident?

I’ve certainly never had a child prodigy. We’ve had international trainees from Europe and Canada where they might be a year or maybe two years younger than the average. But I’ve never had somebody that young. I imagine it’s not impossible, but they still would need all these years of premed training in college and then medical school. But never say never.

Which character do you relate to personally?

I think every attending will probably say Dr. Robby. While I don’t see a lot of myself in him, I sympathize with the plight and what he’s grappling with. As I said, there are things he could do better, and we’ll see what happens as the show goes on, but I appreciate that he gives his colleagues and his support staff his best.

Last question. Why would you spend your days off watching a show that so effectively re-creates the stresses of your job?

[Laughs] I think if you talk to any spouse of a clinician, who themselves are not in medicine, they’ll wholeheartedly agree with the fact that when they get around their friends, all they do is talk medicine. For a lot of us, it’s a huge part of our identity. It’s a huge part of our purpose in life. I love medicine. I love my specialty. I would not be in an academic setting if I did not believe in buying into the mission of training the next generation. So this kind of stuff doesn’t stress me. It excites me.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Michelle Zauner’s Success Nearly Destroyed Her,https://www.vulture.com/article/michelle-zauner-japanese-breakfast-for-melancholy-brunettes.html,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","‘That was sad for me because I had achieved this dream of mine, and parts of it were difficult.’ Photo: Marco Giannavola/

Japanese Breakfast’s new album is out now. Chew on For Melancholy Brunettes (and Sad Women) while you devour our interview with the band’s front woman, originally published on March 11, 2025.

Michelle Zauner knew something was wrong. It was 2021, and she had just released an acclaimed record with her band Japanese Breakfast followed by an even more acclaimed memoir, Crying in H Mart. But the success of both was wreaking havoc on her body. “I was just keeled over with stomach pain before every show,” she says. “It was all stress and pressure and feeling like, I don’t deserve this. People are going to find out that I am an awful singer.” By the end of 2023, she had moved to South Korea to start work on her second book — and recuperate.

The trip was a long time coming: For nearly a decade, Zauner has been mastering the art of turning personal lore into indie-rock and literary gold. Psychopomp, her first studio album as Japanese Breakfast, emerged in 2016 and chronicled the immediate fallout of her mother’s death; in 2018, Zauner expanded on those memories and her sense of Korean American identity with an essay in The New Yorker titled “Crying in H Mart.” When her full-length memoir arrived in 2021, shortly before the band’s third studio album, Jubilee, the book spent more than a year atop the New York Times’ best-seller list. Taken together, it felt like a genuine celebration: One could finish paging through Zauner’s heart-wrenching story and then witness her bouncing across the stage in a puff of taffeta at Radio City or on SNL with what looked like an inarguably hard-won joy. You couldn’t not root for her.

I recently met Zauner over lunch in New York, where she’s back after spending the past year abroad. It’s clear that her time in Korea not only gave her some professional breathing room, but also a wider perspective on the decisions she’s made. She’s now gearing up for her public return as Japanese Breakfast with the March 21 release of a previously shelved record, For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women). The project touches on her recent artistic success, though its storytelling is both subtler and meatier than what fans accustomed to her popularized first-person register might expect. Instead, she writes vignettes of muddy, moody characters who insist on playing with fire. It’s new lore for a new era, but Zauner remains firmly herself: “All of my ghosts are real,” she sings, almost with a sigh of relief. “All of my ghosts are my home.”

Looking back, it’s wild that Crying in H Mart and Jubilee came out within two months of each other. Was that always the plan?

The record was supposed to come out a year earlier, but the pandemic pushed it. I was like, Two months is enough for them to be considered separate entities. I don’t know what I was thinking. A lot of the press I was doing combined them; they almost felt like simultaneous releases.

I was initially very afraid that something in the book was going to paint my album in a negative light because it was just so open, and I felt that it put the record in a vulnerable position. But they supported one another. The book actually helped the record live a fuller life. I was able to get a lot of opportunities that I wouldn’t have if they were separate, like Late Night or SNL. I’m not sure, if we just had a record out, I would have been considered a large enough artist to be given that kind of opportunity.

Writing a memoir about your mother’s death is as intimate as it gets. Did its success change your relationship with the public? Were fans stopping you on the street and doing drive-by trauma dumps?

I’m at a very cozy level of notoriety where that doesn’t happen very often, and when it does, it’s always a really sweet thing. I almost feel like I’ve been so open with my life and my person that no one wants to know any more. So I feel very left alone.

That’s heartening in light of how so many female artists have been talking about their experience with the parasocial element of fame. Last year, Mitski compared fame to “the shittiest exclusive club in the world … where strangers think you belong to them.” Chappell Roan likened it to “the vibe of an abusive ex.” But it doesn’t sound like that’s been your experience.

What both of those women have said about fame is completely valid to their experience. Honestly, the two of them are much larger artists than I am, and I think they maybe have more obsessive fans than I do. I can totally see why they feel that way. I know Mitski is a very private person, and there are just experiences that she’s had that I haven’t.

Are there boundaries that you’ve set to keep your experience that way?

I do find myself being slightly more cautious in interviews than when I started. I get wild asks from the press sometimes. I’ve had a publication ask for photos of my mother when she was sick, which I found to be really cruel. That’s not for sharing. How dare you even ask for that.

You’ve described For Melancholy Brunettes as a response to the period when you had this breakthrough album and a best-selling novel — everything an artist could ever want. But you also felt a sense of doom. You said, “I was flying too close to the sun, and I realized if I kept going, I was going to die.” Tell me about that.

I come from a DIY background where I’ve been playing music since I was 16 years old, booking shows, promoting myself, touring the country in vans, sleeping on floors, carrying my amp down rickety stairs. So as soon as I was able to begin financially supporting myself by playing music and not having to work at a restaurant on the side, I was like, I’ve won the lottery — I need to just run as fast as I can and do everything and be grateful. I have to keep going at this clip.

When we first went on tour after the pandemic, we were doing six days on for six weeks. And it was crazy. I mean, I said yes to every single interview. I said yes to every single show because I never made money doing that before. And then I started getting crazy stage fright and health problems.

Was there a specific inciting incident?

It might’ve been right when we were playing shows again. You have to remember that this was right after the pandemic. Can you imagine having gone from a year of not seeing anyone to then playing the biggest concerts of your life? I think our first show back was in D.C. in front of 1,800 people. I was freaked out. That whole cycle was very scary for me; I had all of these skin and stomach issues.

And then I went to Korea and it all went away. It was just stress — and not sleeping enough. I was honestly living on anxiety medication for the last three years in order to sleep. I was not eating very much; I lost a lot of weight. I felt like I was sitting at a poker table and I was just winning hand after hand and I was just so afraid of losing the entire time. And all I wanted to do was escape before I lost everything. We were flying a lot; it was really hard on the body, and I remember reading about Jim Croce dying in a plane crash on the way to do a performance. I just got so afraid that I was working towards something that I didn’t really understand anymore.

And then I had friends die. I had a lot of important family events that I was missing. It’s so fun and amazing to travel the world and play shows, but it requires a lot of being absent from your life. It’s an incredibly privileged position, but there were parts of it that were really quite hard. And I think that was sad for me because I had achieved this dream of mine, and parts of it were difficult. I want to be cautious about the way that I talk about it, because it was not lost on me how lucky I was. I think that was part of what made it really challenging.

Did you still feel the financial pressure of touring at the time?

The book afforded me financial security in a way that made me question it: Do I need to go so hard? But it’s tough because there are ten people who are in the band and crew who I feel a responsibility of taking care of.

It seems like touring is only getting more expensive, too.

It’s a huge risk. The money that you put up front before you make anything is really scary. And especially touring during COVID, it was like, This bus costs, like, $1,500 a day. If I get sick, I have people’s salaries and a bus to pay for during the seven-to-ten-day recovery time it takes for me to get back to playing. You just become so obsessed with your health and body, but it’s hard to take care of it when you’re sleeping in a bus and you can’t cook for yourself.

Also, I used to drink a fair amount before playing shows, and I was quickly realizing that that was not sustainable. But how do you throw a party every single day just completely sober when that’s not something that you’ve done before? It was hard for me to learn how to do that. I realized I could no longer even just have casual drinks every night to help me get loose. I was like, I can’t do this anymore. I need to just be an angel and be very well behaved.

Did it feel like you had to “fake it” onstage?

I mean, you just feel awkward. It is a type of acting; you’re acting out a confident version of yourself.

When did you start thinking about taking a year off and going to Korea?

My publisher said, “We will support your next book. We can’t wait for your next one.” And the only idea I had for it was what my mom used to say to me: “If you lived in Korea for a year, I think you would become fluent in the language.” And I was kind of curious to put that to the test. I loved the idea of a project that forced me to focus on one thing and to live a quieter, humbler life in one place.

But I was nervous. The first track on the album was about the fear that I had of telling the band, because I felt incredibly worried about taking their jobs away for a year. They were all supportive, but I felt very, very guilty before telling them that that was what I wanted to do.

How did it feel to be in the motherland? Within the Asian diaspora, that kind of homecoming is a famously fraught experience.

Yeah, I may be guilty of seeing it through rose-colored glasses because the things that are problematic about Korean culture, I felt a bit protected from. It was the first time that I returned to Korea feeling like a successful woman. I could just enjoy the parts that I wanted to, and I didn’t have to work in a company. I didn’t have to date anyone.

Even the etiquette and the rules of certain mannerisms would’ve been uncomfortable for me when I was younger, but it was kind of a fun challenge for me to understand. I enjoyed my time there even though I think I also used to feel so upset that I was never embraced as a Korean person. When people say, “But you’re not Korean,” I’m not so bristly about it because I understand what that really means.

I have this joke with friends where it’s like you go back and think it’s going to feel like, Now this is where I belong! But the mindfuck is that turns out you don’t really belong there, either.

Not all Korean people are like this, but I’ve had some Korean people say to me, “I don’t understand why Korean Americans are so obsessed with our culture.” I feel like it’s so judgmental and unfair because any time a Korean person is trying to stake out a position or find themselves, at least in the U.S., I’m always rooting for them. I think a lot of Korean American people or Asian American people are rooting for them. And it’s heartbreaking to me that they can’t do that for us over there sometimes.

How plugged in to the rest of the world were you while you were on “sabbatical”?

I only consumed Korean content while I was abroad. I didn’t listen to any English music with English lyrics; I didn’t watch any TV or movies. I just wanted to be completely immersed in Korean content. Even in the very beginning, I tried to only text my Korean friends in Korean. I learned a lot about Korean cinema and watched K-dramas. I was interested in learning about older Korean music; that was really fun for me.

Now that you’re home, what do you look at online?

I’m just obsessed with how this record is being perceived. It’s a very self-absorbed thing, but I would love to get offline.

Do you search for yourself?

All the time. It’s terrible.

What is the scariest place to search for yourself?

YouTube comments are pretty brutal. After SNL and every live performance, I try to not read those.

Has your approach to promoting yourself on social media changed this time around?

I feel like I am less unhinged on the internet than when I was younger. I think I was kind of unsure of how I was going to navigate that element of social media and thought that I might try harder, but I just can’t. I’m not going to.

You recorded For Melancholy Brunettes before you left for Korea. Now that you’ve returned and are gearing up to tour for it, does the album itself feel differently to you?

I’m not sure how people will receive it. It’s less of an obvious record and a slower burn. I hope that people take their time with it. But that’s exactly the record that I want to make. And I’m just so excited to get to play guitar again. I think these are some of the best lyrics that I’ve written.

You have Jeff Bridges featuring on “Men in Bars,” which takes the album in an interesting country direction. What’s the story behind the feature?

I wrote this song a long time ago; it was originally a Bumper song, which was a pandemic side project I did with Ryan Galloway. I was inspired by this Kenny Rogers song called “Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town,” which is about a war veteran who is pleading with his lover. I loved the idea of having a duet between a man and a woman, kind of like “Islands in the Stream.”

My producer, Blake Mills, and I knew for a long time that this was going to be a good opportunity for a cameo feature, and we passed back different ideas for who could play this role, who had sort of a lower-register voice. Blake had played on a record of Jeff Bridges’s and played me a song of his called “Nothing Yet,” which I thought was so beautiful. So Blake texted him, and Jeff video-called us out of the blue 30 minutes later. He was just super-down. Unfortunately, I had to move to Korea before they could cut his vocals, so Blake and our engineer, Joseph Lorge, went to Jeff’s house to record his part. That’s how that happened. But I’ve never met him.

Will you link up on tour at all, do you think?

I hope so. I’d love to meet him. I designed and ordered my own stationery specifically to write him a letter to say thank you. After I did Conan O’Brien’s podcast, Conan sent me a typewritten letter, from the typewriter, with a little drawing on his own stationery. I thought that was the classiest, coolest thing ever, and I decided I wanted to be that type of person. So I asked my manager if I could make my own stationery.

When you publish a memoir, you have all the control as the narrator. How does that experience compare to releasing a personal album, where you can cloak details in music and metaphor?

I don’t feel particularly cryptic in my lyrics, but apparently I am. It’s interesting having that experience with the book; it’s so rooted in actual moments that you just don’t have the real estate for in songs. But I wrote the song “Orlando in Love,” and I made a video that was very clear to me what was happening. That song is about a whimsical, romantic, foolish man who lives by the sea in a Winnebago and is seduced by a siren. And then when I was doing an interview, the journalist asked me if it was about the pressures of being an ideal woman, because that’s one of the lyrics, and it blew my mind that someone could have that interpretation when it seemed to me so clearly just a fictional story about this man. Sometimes it’s frustrating that that is out of my control.

So it was interesting to me that writing Crying in H Mart was the first time that people really understood. There are certain songs that I think are easier to understand than others, but one thing that I really love about writing music is the freedom to dip in and out of fiction and nonfiction, how you can jump from song to song to a different topic and then you find this narrative thread between them. And yeah, I think that this narrative thread is going to be a little bit more challenging than the one before for some people. I worry about them, but I hope that the ones who get it get it.

How does that compare with, say, writing the Crying in H Mart screenplay for the movie adaptation? What did it feel like to wrestle with the idea that you were ceding control to a new narrator or other storytellers?

Horrible. It was kind of a worst-case scenario for a first feature about the most personal story that’s already lived a life of its own as a successful book. Now you have a bunch of strangers telling you what to change about real people.

The only thing that made me comfortable with that was that I was trying to be honest and fair to them. I would love to have the opportunity to do it again with something that’s a little bit less touchy for me, obviously, because I think that so much of making a film is you have to listen to a lot of people, and that can be a really positive collaborative experience. But I was honestly very defensive and guarded because it’s an extremely difficult, personal story. I come from two mediums where I’ve been given so much freedom. With music, I’ve always been on an indie label, and they’ve never told me what to do in terms of the creative work; I’ve never been given notes.

What kind of notes were you getting on the adapted screenplay?

Mostly just where certain events should go. I was like, But that’s not how that happened! I worried about changing the order of certain events and how it might shed a negative light on certain characters. I will just say that I have amazing producers and people who were involved with that movie, but I think for me, it was a difficult process.

In a recent interview, you mentioned that the Crying in H Mart movie is now on hold indefinitely after director Will Sharpe stepped away from the project. What happened?

We were waiting to get green-lit and then during the writers strike, the director felt that this movie wasn’t going to get made. I think he probably had a lot of other offers; he’s also an actor. I shouldn’t speak too much about it, but he decided to leave, and I think once the writers strike was over, after going through that process already, I was like, I can’t go through that again. I just needed some space away. I mean, I was devastated when Will left. I had a very big meltdown in Hamburg, Germany, when he called and let me know, because it was a year of my life that felt completely down the drain. But I think, if anything, perspective makes the best work. So if I’ve been away from the screenplay for years, when I open it back up again, I think it’s only going to get better from there. I think someday I would like to direct it.

I was going to say: You’ve directed a few of your music videos.

But I don’t feel ready. I’m still working with my producers about a long-term plan to see that to fruition, but I’d rather it not be a movie than a bad movie. So I don’t want to take it on until it’s something that I feel ready to do.

I have amazing producers, and I would love to make a movie with them. But I think I need to learn how. I don’t want to learn how to direct on that feature.

You mentioned in a recent Korean interview that you want to be a mother this year. Talk about complicated desire! Or is that one actually more straightforward than all the others?

No, it’s incredibly complicated. It’s something that I pushed and pushed and pushed down the road. I mean, I’m hesitant to talk about it. I don’t know how difficult it will be for me, but so much of this record is fixated with this kind of anticipatory grief of the artistic life that I may have to leave behind in some capacity. Or it might change in a great way.

I think of these incredible women like Dolly Parton and Stevie Nicks, who never made that sacrifice for their work. I mean, who knows why they decided not to have children. But I think there’s a part of me that feels like, Well, my artistic work is my child. I know a lot of working-women mothers who are doing an incredible job, but it’s an enormous loss of time and physical ability to bring a child into the world. And I’m very worried about how that will impact myself and my work, but it’s also something I am really interested in and excited for.

So looking ahead to the tour: How are you doing it differently this time? We’re not doing six days on anymore, right?

Now it’s four days. I think that when you get to be a bigger artist, it goes from saying yes to everything to the power of no. That was something that Karen O gave me when we played together at Forest Hills: “You need to learn how to say no.” There’s value to no, beyond just your sanity, because it has the potential to lead to bigger opportunities if you feel comfortable walking away.

I would like to have fun again. It used to be so fun for me.

And it isn’t at all anymore?

I mean, even when it is difficult, there are times when the adrenaline kicks in and it’s fun. It’s just all of the moments leading up to it. It’s just physically demanding and difficult, but I think that I’ve learned about some boundaries that will make it easier for me to be able to meet those demands. I don’t think I knew what those were beforehand, because when I was younger, I was just able to do it. I also went through some growing pains on this last record around becoming a bigger band: not being able to just be a young person drinking and sounding like shit and instead realizing that there’s a certain responsibility that comes with playing larger rooms and charging higher ticket prices. You have to approach it with a certain professionalism. Because, suddenly, I had people in my band who were classically trained, and I felt very inferior and self-conscious around them.

I feel like people always talk about impostor syndrome being this really awful challenge that we have to rid ourselves of. Karen Chee actually has a joke about this — about how most people are not really good at things naturally. You want to be a rock star? Chances are you are a fucking impostor! What do you have to do to prove that you deserve to be there? You put in the work. I feel more comfortable now that I have more time to put in the work than when I had to figure it out on the road at that time.

I actually saw a fortune teller before I left Korea, and I was like, “I had really bad stage fright the last few years. Is that going to be a thing?” And she was like, “You’re a Year of the Snake. It’s your year. You’re not going to feel that way anymore.” I’m just choosing to believe her wholeheartedly and see that to fruition.

Lumon has spoken with the shareholders, and Severance is now officially renewed for season three, as confirmed by Apple’s Tim Cook himself on Twitter. At least Ben Stiller didn’t get sent to the break room. “Making Severance has been one of the most creatively exciting experiences I’ve ever been a part of,” Stiller shared in a press release. “While I have no memory of this, I’m told making season three will be equally enjoyable, though any recollection of these future events will be forever and irrevocably wiped from my memory as well.”

Season 3 of Severance is available upon request.

Thankfully, the gap between seasons will be way shorter than three years, as Stiller promised the plan is “definitely not” to wait so long to find out what happened to Mark S and the Macrodata Refinement department.

Every Robin Hood for himself. The inherent spiritual (and mortal) paradox of American life. It’s not only easy but nigh on downright justifiable to consider your criminal deeds for the greater good when you and yours are a ragtag few in dire need of an inhabitable life.

Dope Thief’s third chapter is mostly a utilitarian one, in a good way — filling out the scale and scope of the world and mortal stakes for the characters while massaging an urban-western-type vibe into the proceedings, culminating in a good old-fashioned head-in-a-box routine for your trouble. Ray Driscoll is stuck in Philly, and the heat is closing in. Business as usual, other than the mysterious, immediate big-time drug-dealing threat on his life and the life of everyone he knows.

Two days have passed since the robbery, and Manny is still nowhere to be found. Ray scopes out the old haunts and doesn’t find much outside confirmation that the killer Aryan meth-running biker gang is still on the hunt for both of them. “Everybody you get close to is in the crosshairs with you,” Son tells him under the bridge along his morning jog. “Everybody you care about.” Best to exit the scene and give the rest of us a fighting chance away from the line of fire.

But it isn’t just the heat closing in that’s keeping Ray around. There’s still the notion of being your own personal Robin Hood — parlaying a lifetime of loss into one big win. The golden nugget that’ll take you and yours out of the rat race.

And that’s the angle he tries to sell to Theresa when he finds her safe at home and ready to do a one-woman intervention on his ass. Not much time to argue his point though, seeing how Manny is hiding up in his attic room and Theresa just got a call from prison saying Bart’s been stabbed. Manny’s in a relapsed panic, and Theresa is frantic about getting to the prison in time to be with her lover on his deathbed. So, with at least the knowledge that Manny is alive and relatively in one piece, Ray drives Theresa to prison with every intention of hanging back in the car. A flash of black-and-white memories of being rousted out of bed and abused by prison guards reminds us that Ray is even more familiar with the hell behind U.S. prison bars than even his father.

Shoutout to director Tanya Hamilton and crew for staging and shooting the next scene like the riveting suspense sequence it is: rooting the viewer in the geographical positioning of Ray and Michelle, the lawyer at the nearest road-side bar, speaking in code as the Aryan biker boys surround them — a table of day-drinking prison guards the only thing between them and oblivion. In this episode alone, Brian Tyree Henry has had plenty of moments to work his old Paper Boi rhythm on the drama as well as the humor (thinking of his physical reaction to Theresa demanding he sit down and hear out her shaky intervention), but this scene in particular sees him exercising his peerless emotional communication in the eyes, making the well-pitched coded dialogue sing as he and Michelle find the right moment to escape the bar with the prison guards. A-plus acting that serves a thrilling and dramatic purpose in equal measure.

However, it seems like Ray’s luck has run out after a heavy confrontation with Bart in the infirmary. It turns out Bart was stabbed as bait to bring Ray out of hiding, and a whole platoon of bikers is waiting for Ray just outside the prison gates. Inside the prison walls, there is an emotional stalemate between the two men. A father who, as Ray points out, has no right to be disappointed in his son, but in so expressing it, taps into Ray’s disappointment in himself. So when he steps onto the other side of those prison gates and the DEA swoops in and saves him from what was surely set to be a Sergio Leone–style criminal execution (the timing strains credibility a bit here, even for a show that mixes straight drama with pulp like this one does — nevertheless, kick-ass spaghetti-western LARP-ing shit), Ray takes his second chance at life to make all the amends he can — parlay a lifetime of bad decisions into priceless nuggets of love.

And for his first miracle, St. Ray manages to bring Manny back to Sherry, tell her they have to destroy her car because it’s been spotted, and propose to her on Manny’s behalf with the engagement ring he found hidden in Manny’s apartment. It’s a rough-and-tumble show (it was a bit rushed over in the edit, but it definitely had me chuckling out loud), but I’ll be damned if Ray doesn’t pull it off.

Unfortunately, no half-good deed goes unpunished. Just as these crazy kids are about to celebrate their engagement, the meth-runners saddle them with the old head-in-a-box routine. An insanely brutal end for a local pawn shop owner who didn’t do anything except sell Manny a firearm and call the Aryan bikers a trio of dumbasses to their faces. Meanwhile, the feds are getting the names of every visitor to the prison that day, and Mina has recognized a composite sketch of Ray in his fake DEA cap. A big old unjust pile of shit to fall on any small–time Robin Hood when every day feels more and more like it’s a crime to be alive.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Yellowjackets Recap: Where the Wild Things Are,https://www.vulture.com/article/yellowjackets-recap-season-3-episode-7.html,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:00:17 GMT","Yellowjackets Croak Season 3 Episode 7 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Colin Bentley/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME

“Croak” is available to stream now via Paramount+; it will make its Showtime network premiere on Sunday.

The cold open of “Croak” promises a fresh start to this season of Yellowjackets. The episode opens with a single perfect frog. It hops around for a moment before settling down, puffing its slimy sac out, and then opening its mouth to release an otherworldly screech. The camera pulls out to reveal dozens, if not hundreds, of these little creatures scuttling in a pond, screaming and mating and screaming some more. This sound, we’re meant to understand, is the unholy sound that the Yellowjackets have been hearing in the woods. Sometimes, the things we perceive as threats or horrors are just a bunch of animals in the wilderness, trying to get their evolution on; every organism is simply trying to survive.

Things in the wild are not always as they seem, and Yellowjackets seems to be underscoring the idea that the mysteries of the forest aren’t really that mysterious after all. Every time the show introduces a potential supernatural element, it’s negated. Sure, there are gusts of mysterious air that swish around the characters every now and then, but it truly seems as if a mixture of collective trauma and preexisting mental health conditions are the conclusive answer to all the freaky things happening, both in the woods and in the present day.

For example, the mere existence of the frog group illustrates that the terrain in the woods is not impassable. These girls have had an entire spring and summer to figure out how to hike out of there, and they just haven’t tried. The wilderness isn’t keeping them there; it’s their own collective inertia. Or is it lazy storytelling? I’ll go with inertia for now. And as for Lottie, their spiritual leader, well, she becomes the very first Yellowjacket to kill in cold blood. When we finally pick up from the end of the last episode, Lottie grabs an axe and wastes zero time slamming it into the back of one of the hiker’s heads. Is it the wilderness or is it a psychotic break? (It’s 100 percent a psychotic break.)

But let’s backtrack to the beginning of this episode. We meet the ill-fated hikers as they follow the mating of the Arctic Banshee Frog. Apparently, these little creatures hibernate for years, only to emerge and have a “summerlong frog orgy” to repopulate their species. Researchers Edwin (Nelson Franklin) and Hannah (Ashley Sutton) are smitten with one another, with Edwin following Hannah on her journey to record the eerie mating sounds. Along with them is a hiking guide named Kodi. The amazing and hilarious Joel McHale plays Kodi. The role of mysterious military heavy feels a little off for McHale, but he did recently play a soulless restaurant owner in The Bear, so the man is proving that he has range.

The group gets caught in a rainstorm one day, so they decide to smoke a joint and listen to Sugar Ray’s “Fly.” Fun times. But then a fully baked Hannah decides that she wants to call Miss Cleo from the satellite phone. Hijinks ensue and the antenna gets broken. Then, Edwin’s suspicions of Kodi go from bad to worse as they continue on their mission. So, when they hear (and smell) something the next night, Edwin is encouraged to investigate.

It turns out that Ben really was a bridge that connected the girls to the outside world. If Edwin hadn’t smelled the Ben-B-Q or heard the whoops of the feral Yellowjackets, then the two groups would have probably passed like ships in the night. It’s unclear whether or not the encounter with the frog people will lead to an active rescue, but as we only have two-three more months left in the wilderness timeline, it feels like these new people provide a catalyst for rescue in some way.

The introduction of this group into the wilderness timeline upends something I thought might be possible on the show. The Lost vibes on Yellowjackets have always been off the charts, and it always seemed like they would meet some “Others” in the woods. However, when Edwin, Hannah, and Kodi stumble upon the encampment, it’s clear that the Yellowjackets are the “Others” and that anyone who encounters them should be very afraid. After Lottie murders Edwin, Hannah and Kodi flee, and a Most Dangerous Game–style hunt begins. The girls know the wilderness now, and they use all of their senses to track their prey, even doing it without the aid of their torches. They have become stealth animals, and watching them operate on collective instinct to locate and capture two innocent humans is invigorating.

Ever since the introduction of Pit Girl, this is the type of conflict we’ve been waiting for. We’ve gotten teases of it with the group’s pursuit of Travis in season one and their attempt to hunt Natalie in season two, but this time the girls are a team, hunting strangers that pose a threat to their livelihood. Hannah hides in an old tree stump and dictates a message to her daughter on her DAT recorder while Kodi tries to run out of danger and instead finds himself corralled by Akilah, Travis, and Misty (of all people).

As Hannah flees, her dark hair cascades down her back, and her whole aura gives Pit Girl. Maybe it’s not Mari, after all. Perhaps this isn’t the last time this poor woman will be hunted.

From the present-day timeline, we know that none of the hikers were ever found. After hearing her recording of the audio file, Callie does some googling and finds the missing team. She talks to Jeff about it, but he’s still in denial mode. Callie, for her part, knows that her mother and her friends were totally capable of murder.

And they seem to be gearing up for yet another murder as Shauna, Van, Tai, and Misty head off on a road trip to Virginia in Shauna’s clunker of a van. Having all the survivors back together in one place is fun, and watching these four actresses play off of one another is always a treat. They still lean on their old high school dynamics, with Tai and Van chatting with Misty about her Walter situationship, and haggling over who pays for gas. As the group is stopped at the gas station, Van asks Tai if she killed Lottie, and Tai doesn’t exactly answer the question. Instead, she tells Van that she will follow the whims of the universe if it keeps her love alive.

As they get back on the road, Walter comes through with some interesting information: The DNA from the hair under Lottie’s fingernails matches Shauna’s DNA. Misty texts both Tai and Van about this development, and they try to figure out how to get Shauna to pull over the van without arousing her suspicion. These women are still so scared of Shauna, and it’s hilarious. But then a fresh new hell arises as Van starts vomiting blood. Shauna has no choice but to go to a hospital.

Once there, Tai accompanies Van to her room under the pretense that she’s her wife. She was her wilderness wife, so I guess there’s that. Van gets hooked up to some machines and begins to have a vision of her younger self telling her that death was always an “even trade” and then burning her bedsheets. As she burns, she sees “Other” Tai telling her that it’s going to be okay and that she’s going to save her. It’s feeling more and more like Tai is not herself and that she has been taken over by her dark half, but to what end?

As Misty and Shauna sit in the waiting room, Misty confronts her about the DNA. Shauna does some performative huffing, says she’s going to go get a Coke, and then ditches her entire crew at the hospital without a word. Shauna remains the coldest of the cold. For what it’s worth, though, I don’t think she killed Lottie. Perhaps Walter’s DNA testing is a bit off, and Callie is the killer? I see no clear motive for Callie, but it would match up with the DNA evidence, and perhaps there’s a twist in store for us down the line? Callie hasn’t done much but whine about her suspension and yearn for a more meaningful connection with her mom this season, so a surprise killer role might shake things up for her storyline.

Shauna drives to her final destination, a neat white house with a picket fence. Presumably, this is Hannah’s daughter’s house. She watches, giant knife at her side, as people flutter behind the windows. This woman has killed before, and she’s absolutely not going to hesitate to kill again.

However, it’s interesting to note that we have not seen Shauna kill anyone in the wilderness timeline. At least not yet. Again, Lottie is the one who has committed the first straight-up murder. In a disturbing image, she babbles to Edwin’s bashed-in skull, anointing herself with his blood as she whispers to the wilderness. The rest of the Yellowjackets kind of just shrug off her behavior, like, “Oh, that’s just our kooky oracle, doing kooky oracle things; what are ya gonna do?” They’re annoyed with her, but they don’t judge. Mari and Gen work to get an arrow out of Melissa’s shoulder, deciding that it’s best to push it all the way through instead of pulling it out. The field medic decisions these girls make on the fly are always a sight to behold.

Meanwhile, Shauna and Van return to camp with Hannah in tow. She sheepishly waves at the rest of the girls, saying, “Hi. I’m Hannah.” Oh man, this woman is doomed.

Buzz, Buzz, Buzz

• Love how Misty snipes at Shauna about asking for help cleaning up Adam’s murder. She says that she’ll probably need her help for whatever she’s planning to do to Hannah’s daughter, too, saying, “If past is prologue, you will.” But to be completely honest, Misty didn’t do such a great job of cleaning up Adam’s murder either.

• Shauna says she doesn’t deserve Jeff, and I nearly screamed at my TV that she does not, indeed, deserve him. I agree with her sentiment in the season three premiere that he would flourish as a widower.

https://indiewire.com,Ben Stiller on How the ‘Severance’ Season 2 Finale ‘Signals a Different Tone’ for Season 3,https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/ben-stiller-severance-finale-different-tone-season-3-1235110319/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Severance” Season 2, Episode 10, “Cold Harbor.”]

Of the many twists and turns lurking within the corridors of “Severance‘s” Season 2 finale, no fan should be surprised when, waiting behind the episode’s final bend, is Ben Stiller’s name. Officially the director and executive producer but unofficially the “conjurer” of Apple’s acclaimed corporate thriller (as dubbed by Adam Scott), Stiller’s “directed by” credit has graced 11 of the show’s 19 total episodes so far.

After handling the first and last three entries of Season 1 — including the tone-setting introduction that hooked untold millions, as well as the buzzed-about finale that brought them all back for more — the DGA Award winner had to choose five entries for himself among the second season’s 10 hour-long entries.

But which ones?

“What I was attracted to in the second season was taking some chances,” Stiller said in an interview with IndieWire. “Because I felt like if we just sort of tried to stay within the bounds of what we’d done, it would feel like we were treading water.”

That call of the unknown resulted in Stiller helming Episode 1 (“Hello, Ms. Cobel”), Episode 3 (“Who Is Alive?”), Episode 4 (“Woe’s Hollow”), Episode 8 (“Sweet Vitriol”), and the Season 2 finale, Episode 10 (“Cold Harbor”). Within those entries, a pattern emerged. In one way or another, most of Stiller’s episodes function as departure episodes. The premiere breaks from tradition and never leaves the severed floor. “Woe’s Hollow” follows the MDR team on their first corporate retreat, and “Sweet Vitriol” visits the tiny town where Harmony grew up. Stiller himself described “Cold Harbor” as a “standalone episode.”

“That was fun to go off on location and do those things, but it’s also interesting when you watch the whole season because every episode kind of has its own personality,” Stiller said. “You’re kind of going, ‘OK, we’re going to try something else here that hopefully will live in the world of the show.’ But you’re definitely taking chances to be able to expand the lexicon of the show.”

Below, Stiller digs a little deeper into the Season 2 finale — how it serves as a bridge between the very first episode and what’s coming in Season 3, the scene they were “worried” about getting right, what inspired the final shot, and how his directorial approach helps to keep audiences attuned to the weird, twisty vibes of “Severance.”

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

IndieWire: I love that Season 2 starts with Mark running into the office, looking for Gemma, and then it ends with him running back into the office, leaving her behind. Was that kind of symmetry important to you?

Ben Stiller: Yeah, definitely. In fact, I’d say it’s probably the first thing that we came up with. Knowing where you’re going, obviously, is very important. On this show, it’s always clear where we’re going, but the creative process — it’s different getting there. The idea of having that beginning opening shot and that ending of him in the hallways, it made a lot of sense.

In the beginning, when we first thought about it, we didn’t know if we were going to go as far as him going with Helly all the way, but then as we were going along, we felt like we really should go that far because I didn’t want to do another cliffhanger type of ending where you didn’t know what he was going to do. I felt like, “OK, let’s go a little further with this because this makes sense,” and it also sets up a new reality for going forward in the show.

Hallways were a big deal this season.

Also, the beginning of Season 2 for me was a little bit of an echo to the beginning of Season 1 — when Mark’s walking around in the hallways the first time. It also felt like, “OK, well this is the objective of Season 2: Mark is trying to find Gemma. She’s alive. [Running through the hallways] is the natural next step.” So yeah, that imagery was there from the very beginning. Stylistically, we didn’t want to [shoot the finale] exactly the same way as the beginning of the season, which was a lot more robotic and smoother, since it felt like the end is going to be a lot more chaotic. But it’s still the same idea.

How did you land on that freeze-frame for the final shot?

For me, that image was just in my head from the beginning — when we said, OK, we’re going to go this far and this is where we’re going to take it. You don’t see freeze-frames at the end of movies that often these days, but it used to be done a lot more. It’s just kind of this moment in time where you’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the end of the movie, but it’s going to keep going. We just don’t know where it’s going to go.” You marinate in this moment. It reminded me of movies that I watched growing up. This slow zoom in on the freeze-frame reminded me of ’70s movies a little bit.

We actually— we shoot this show digitally, but we transferred that last shot to film and then re-transferred it because we wanted to have the grain to zoom in on. So it felt like a movie that would’ve been shot on film where they would’ve had an optical printer that would’ve zoomed in on it. And it goes to red, which we haven’t really gone to before. I think it’s kind of signaling, “Hey, we’re going into a different tone here now. We are going into a different reality for these people.”

When I first saw it, my brain immediately went to “The Graduate,” even though that doesn’t end on a freeze-frame.

Maybe it’s a mix of “The Graduate” and “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.” [But] that’s such an amazing movie and that ending, I always think about that ending. It’s sort of everything. The protagonist gets what he wants and then it’s like, “OK, you got what you want. Now what?” And it’s the rest of your life, you know?

Because Season 1’s closing shot is so striking — a feeling that only intensified as people waited for Season 2 to come out — did you feel any extra pressure to produce another indelible image this time? Something people will really remember while they wait for Season 3?

As I heard people react to the finale of the first season — it seemed like people really responded to it — you definitely start to think about that. [Laughs] What are we going to do for the next finale? And the only thing that was in our head, really, was just like, “Well, let’s just not do the same thing.” I don’t want to do the same thing, but I do want to have something that’s hopefully memorable and stays with you and feels visceral. But it’s not a cliffhanger like that. I feel like that [Season 1] finale is so specific to the season because all the threads are coming together. I think the reason why that finale works for people is that it’s tying up all these loose ends from the season, and I feel like this finale, hopefully, is more of a standalone episode in its own way. It’s just its own thing, a little bit more, hopefully.

For me, Season 2 really confronted one of the ideas at the root of the show, which is whether you can separate the work from the worker. As much as some people want to say, “Work is just what I do, it’s not who I am,” that’s not necessarily true — not when you’re devoting so much of your time to a job, to a place, to the people who work there. There’s an investment there, on some level, whether you want it or not.

What that made me think of was Milchick’s arc, because I feel like while he’s an employee, but he’s [also] management. In this season, he’s really dealing with feeling the limitations of the company and how they treat him and what his place is in the company. He has to advocate for himself. I thought that was a really worthwhile thing to explore. Because with Mark, his trajectory is so much about trying to figure out his loyalty to his Outie and also his feelings for Helly. To me, his storyline is much more kind of personal in that way.

But the Milchick one is most indicative of how you navigate within a company and when you advocate for yourself or not, and all this corporate kind of crap that you have to deal with. The other layer to it is when you work at Lumon, it’s not just you’re working for the company. You’re either severed, where you don’t know anything else about the world except the company, or you’re someone who in management is committed to the Eagan philosophy and the Lumon ideology and is kind of a zealot. So it’s very connected to the ethos of the company, the culture of the company.

Which makes me think about Burt.

He’s also at a point in his life where he’s committed. How do you reconcile all the hours and time you put into a job, whether you’re doing something that’s nefarious or not? What part of your identity is what you have done for the company? And if the company is doing things that are bad, how do you justify that? But it’s really more like: Who am I if my identity is not linked to what I do?

OK, let’s talk about the conversation between Mark’s Innie and Outie. How did prepare for that scene as a director? What were those conversations like, and what were you worried about?

We were definitely worried about it going in because we knew it was a climactic point, but it was also the actual dialogue between the two of them. What were they going to talk about? How were they going to get to the core of what their issues are? And every time we would rehearse it, or there would be a draft of it that Dan [Erickson] would write, we’d have these discussions about it — Adam and Dan and myself and Beau Willmon — we were all talking about, like, what is this conversation? Where is Outie Mark coming from? How is Innie Mark going to take it in?

So there was the content of it, which we kept rewriting every time we rehearsed it, and then there was the question I was thinking about as a director: How are we going to do this that’s going to make it interesting visually because it’s a long-ish scene? Just the mechanics of the fact that he has to go [inside and outside]. You can’t just show it in real time. The scene would go on forever and be so boring.

Once we finally rehearsed it on set, Jessica [Lee Gagné] and I just came up with very simple rules [for shooting it]. Like, Innie Mark will be on the right, Outie Mark’s on the left, every time. I knew that we eventually wanted [the frame] to kind of get tighter and tighter, so I just tried to shoot enough angles that it would get more and more intense and build more and more tension. Then the blocking of it, figuring it out with Adam: When would he stand up, if he stood up? And it felt like, well, he’s the same person, so when he stands up as his Outie, his Innie is going to get pissed off and he’ll stand up too because they kind of have the same instincts? So we figured out that blocking and then just tried to keep it as simple as possible, so you’re not really thinking about the camera as much as just being able to follow the conversation.

How exacting did you end up getting with Adam in terms of blocking out those movements?

Having worked with Adam on the show for the last almost five years or whatever — it’s crazy we started doing it that long ago — I feel like I know him well enough, and he knows me. The way we’ll approach working on a scene is I want to hear what his instincts are as an actor. So part of me is like, “Oh, this would be easier if nobody ever stands up and we’re just in one place all the time, but is that right for the scene?” Then he’s like, “No, I think I might be walking around.” “So what point would you get up?” “Well, probably when he gets upset here.” So we work it out together and I make sure he feels comfortable. The key for any scene is that the blocking feels organic, and that it feels real and motivated to the actors.

So I can’t give enough credit to Adam in a scene like that because he’s having to play two characters. He’s thinking about what he should be saying because that’s important to him, and then he’s figuring out how Outie Mark is going to play it. He made this choice: that Outie Mark is really trying to convince Innie Mark — that he’s underestimating Innie Mark a little bit. He made that choice, and that was very important to him. He was like, “Hey, I think I have to be trying to manipulate him a little bit.” And Innie Mark picks up on that. That made a huge difference in the scene, too.

Once you’d shot it, did you know you had it? Or not until the editing room? Or not even then?

No, I did not know. Honestly, I was stressed out about it. When [the editor] Geoff Richman said, “Yeah, I have a first cut of it. It’s like 18 minutes long,” I was like, “Oh, shit!” [laughs] But I have to say, when we would go in the editing room and start watching, even the long cut of it, I would get caught up in the conversation. So when I first started watching it, I thought, “OK, I think that’s a good sign as someone who’s read it and shot it, that I’m getting caught up in the conversation that Adam’s having, the writing is making sense.” So that was a clue that, OK, this could be working well.

https://indiewire.com,How the Single Takes of ‘Adolescence’ Hide in Plain Sight,https://www.indiewire.com/features/craft/adolescence-episode-2-single-take-1235110104/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","For all the miracles of digital cinematography, non-linear editing software, and the unseen wizardry that goes into something as small as sky replacement, they do open up a treacherous thought for audiences: “It’s fake. It’s all VFX. The bravura oner is actually a cheat stitched together in the edit.” In the acclaimed Netflix series “Adolescence,” it isn’t a cheat. Every episode exploring the fallout of a 13-year-old boy, Jamie (Owen Cooper), being accused of murdering one of his classmates, Katie (Emilia Holliday), is shot in a single take.

The true challenge for director Philip Barantini, cinematographer Matthew Lewis, and the entire filmmaking team on “Adolescence,” however, was to make the audience forget the gimmick of the oner and to bring out what great long takes actually do to an audience: make us very, very nervous. The haunting contained tension of Jamie and psychologist Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty) in Episode 3 stands in contrast to the mazelike chaos that detectives Bascombe (Ashley Walters) and Frank (Faye Marsay) wade through when they look for the motive and the murder weapon at Jamie’s school in Episode 2.

But for every episode, Barantini told IndieWire that an extensive rehearsal process was key. “The first week of rehearsals, we’d work with the core cast members in five-page blocks building up the performances piece by piece. The second week was a tech rehearsal where all departments would work through the episode in real-time with the actors to fine-tune before the last two days of tech rehearsal,” Barantini said.

During tech, background artists would join the run-throughs, and Barantini would fine-tune the kind of detail work that might only get picked up on a second watch. In the case of working with the nearly 300 children used for Episode 2, that meant making sure they had their mobile phones throughout and costuming assistant directors as teachers. They could give directions on camera and be listened to — or, with warning in advance, ignored — as the scene called for it.

The filmmakers’ focus throughout was on making the timings flow — in the conventional terms of our sense of pace, of course, but also spatial logistics. “In the first episode, we needed to find a house that was no more than a three-minute drive from the police station; the same with the hardware store in Episode 4. All told, the opening scene [in Episode 1] needed to be 11 minutes long so that the full exchange before, during, and after Owen is in the police van can be delivered,” Barantini said.

For Lewis and his camera team, achieving that kind of movement through space with precise timing required a staggering amount of planning, tracking vehicles, and handoffs. In the sequence in Episode 2 where Ryan (Kaine Davis) jumps through a ground-level window and tries to run from Bascombe before he’s arrested, Lewis wanted to make sure the camera kept up with the runners without the shot feeling like something out of “Call of Duty.” The camera needed to get ahead of them to grab frontal, more three-dimensional views of the chase. And for that, “Adolescence” needed a daisy chain of running operators and tracking vehicles.

The sequence starts with Lewis passing the camera through the window to his other operator, Lee David Brown, who was waiting to take it and run after the actors. Lewis, meanwhile, bolted behind the school building to hop onto a waiting vehicle.

“There’s a couple fairly spicy handoffs in that little sequence,” Lewis said. “I am just offscreen on a tracking vehicle, on the front of it, sort of strapped on. We convene, and he passes the camera back to me as I start going up the road, and he’s still running up the road as well. So he’s moving; I’m moving; and he passes the camera across. Then, we floor it.”

Once the vehicle caught up with the actors, a grip unbuckled Lewis from the hood of the vehicle, and he started running the camera up the alley where Ryan gets caught. But there was no rest for the weary, as once Frank books Ryan, Lewis and the camera hopped onto a rickshaw to get pulled back down the road to hand the camera off to a drone. The camera then had to fly a full field over to the murder location, where Jamie’s dad Eddie (Stephen Graham) is leaving flowers.

A spring-loaded docking system made the drone handoff easier, allowing Lewis to bring the camera in from any angle and not jolt the camera as it was secured. It took a lot of coordination with the grips, who were waiting with the drone just offscreen.

“[The drone] grabs really quietly without any sort of movement change. So that goes in. I actually change some settings on the camera on the side before I step away — I change the follow mode so that it’s just controlled on wheels, basically. Then, my operator, Lee, who ran that section, is then at the wheels getting ready. Then I step away, the drone spins up, the grips walk forward, and they let go of it exactly when they feel it’s being pulled out their hands,” Lewis said.

It took one more run into a waiting van that sped over toward the murder memorial, and then Lewis was doing another handoff to catch the drone, release the camera, and frame up Graham for the final shot. “It was a bit wild when I look back at it,” Lewis said. “Like, why did we think that was a normal thing to do?”

It’s not normal, but it is effective and deeply moving. “Not every genre is suited to a single take, but when it does work, the audience is thrown into it, and it’s live, they’re in this world,” Barantini said. “The best review I [read] recently was that someone wished we’d cut back to the court or the police station. When someone told them that they couldn’t as we’d filmed it in one take, they hadn’t realized — which was a sign that we’d all done our jobs right! It’s like Scorsese’s line on editing: Everyone thinks it’s good editing if you notice the cuts, but great editing is also when you don’t see it.”

https://indiewire.com,The Television Academy’s Second Annual AI Summit Pushed Calm — and Concern,https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/television-academy-second-annual-ai-summit-recap-1235110255/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","Remember that time in your life when being forced to consume broccoli felt like a death sentence? Your parents would tell you that it was good for you, that it would make you stronger and healthier, but the scent, texture, and taste told a different story. Eventually, you grow up and come to find that your parents were in fact just trying to do right by you, that broccoli can provide some value to your diet, and maybe you can even come to enjoy it once you look past some of its less appealing features.

This, essentially, was the message on display at the Television Academy‘s second annual AI Summit, hosted Saturday, March 15 at the Saban Media Center in North Hollywood. Academy members represented the children in this analogy, AI entrepreneurs, technicians, and legal experts were the parents, and the tech itself was the broccoli gently being airplaned into our mouths. The only problem was that as much as they worked to convince the audience that consuming AI now would be better for us in the long run, it was hard to walk away with anything but the taste of battery acid burning our tongues.

One of the first indicators that this summit might be more interested in pushing a message than fostering a conversation was the fact that, despite commencing the day’s panels at 8:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning, no coffee or water was allowed into the theater we’d be situated in for the next four hours. The audience was left in a drowsy state, perfect for force-feeding “facts” that may have caused uproar or distress from more caffeinated individuals.

Opening the event, senior marketing manager at Adobe, member of the TV Academy’s AI Task Force, and chair of the AI Summit, Kylie Pena said, “Our industry is embracing AI tools, experimenting boldly, and proceeding with a healthy amount of caution. This shift from uncertainty to cautious curiosity mirrors the vast changes we’ve experienced this year. The landscape has rapidly evolved, shaped by innovation, breakthroughs, and importantly, significant questions about ethics, creativity, and our responsibilities to creative and technical professionals across all of the TV Academy’s peer groups, many of which are represented here on stage today.”

But were they actually? After Pena’s introduction, Eric Shamlin, CEO of Secret Level — one of the three companies responsible for the controversial AI-produced Coca-Cola commercial last year — was brought on stage to deliver the Keynote. Shamlin is an Academy Governor, specifically working within the Emerging Media Programming peer group, and also serves as a chair on the AI Task Force. There are 31 peer groups across the entire Television Academy including Casting Directors, Writers, Costume Design & Supervision, Stunts, Lighting, Camera, & Technical Arts, and many more who might have something to say about the use of AI in film and television, but not one of these groups were represented in the morning’s conversations.

“To bridge both the creative and business worlds, we have an obligation not just to react to AI but to actively guide how it’s implemented,” said Shamlin. “That means collaborating with the guilds, studios, policymakers, and technologists.”

And yet the only ones chosen to speak on the subject were those who proffered an enthusiastic appreciation of the technology’s so-called “magic” — a term that would be used so frequently by various speakers, one started to wonder if they had all used the same PR firm. Clearly, this event was geared toward highlighting where AI is today, how it’s used, and where it’s headed, but any summit on the subject of the technology should not ignore the voices that oppose its use. Doing so only served to remind this writer that the insistence on its implementation is not a product of its usefulness, but our usefulness to it. Shamlin doesn’t believe this is something to question however, instead pushing the notion of opportunity.

“The iPhone democratized capture, YouTube democratized distribution, social media democratized marketing, and now AI is democratizing production value,” he told the crowd at Saban Media Center. “For decades, the one thing studios controlled was access to high-end production, budgets that determined talent, crew, location, and scale. AI is breaking down that final gate.”

Sounds nice, right? What’s not considered in this statement are the thousands of jobs evaporating as a result of breaking down this gate. Is it ethical to let a technology such as this not only control what we consume, but to erase an entire economic infrastructure in order to allow it to do so? Some might say this is just how evolution and advancement work and good luck trying to stop it. This was roughly how it was pitched in the first panel, “The Real Talk on Embracing Change.” Moderated by AI & media tech investor Seth Hallen, the panel featured chief content officer & EVP of Production at Metaphysic.ai, Ed Ulbrich, and longtime media executive and filmmaker Barbara Ford Grant. Ulbrich was the standout, able to offer thoughtful insights on AI’s growth in entertainment, particularly as it applies to the visual effects industry.

“I’ve seen a lot of disruption,” Ulbrich said. “I got to move to L.A. in the early 90s to start a company with James Cameron, Stan Winston, and Scott Ross called Digital Domain. So that was an incredible journey, 20 years of that. We didn’t call it AI, but machine learning, computer vision — that is not new. This is something we’ve been doing for almost 20 years.”

Ulbrich also pointed out that we’ve been scanning actors for 25 years to fill out crowd scenes, but only in the last few years has there been any pushback on it. Again, there is a little bit of selective presentation in this pronouncement, as Ulbrich didn’t acknowledge that this pushback comes from the new intent of modern machine learning, which — to a certain extent — is to replace actors by training AI on past work. Even so, he helped the audience adjust to the idea that AI can be a tool with many benefits. For instance, Robert Zemeckis’ 2024 drama “Here” was able to de-age stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright in-camera as they were shooting, a process that years ago, might’ve taken weeks and millions more in the budget.

“I look at it this way: People are like, ‘You’re eliminating jobs.’ Well, there’s a whole bunch of people who got to make that movie that wouldn’t have otherwise,” said Ulbrich. “It wouldn’t have been made at the price.”

And if Hanks and Wright were OK with AI training on their earlier work, it’s their prerogative, no? The question becomes: Now that AI has that information on both actors, would their talent even be needed on a set in the future? Will their likeness be available to all who wish to use it? What does this practice say about the value of the artist to the art?

Following “Real Talk,” the AI Summit attempted to answer these questions by bringing out a slew of legal experts including Loyola Law School professor Julie Shapiro, Protege Media’s Dave Davis, Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz’s Andrew Folks, and Covington & Burlington’s Robyn Polashuk. Moderated by chief client engagement officer for Screen Engine/ASI, Holly Leff-Pressman, the panel acted as a “Legal Ask Me Anything,” with attendees encouraged to text in questions for them all to answer. However, one of the first comments from the group laid out the fact that there are still many unknowables that have allowed this technology to evade legal boundaries or at least attempt to do so.

“The laws have not been prepared to address these technologies,” said Folks. “It’s, ‘Let’s go through privacy, copyright, all of these areas that are grappling with how to take on AI,’ so yeah, it’s an interesting feeling.”

Folks went on to share some of the regulatory action that has been put in place, such as the EU and Colorado AI Acts, as well as legislation in Virginia and Texas that “address AI from a comprehensive point-of-view.” He also discussed how existing law, such as copyright, can be “tweaked” to include AI, a concept that’s being litigated right now. OpenAI and Google have opposed this, recently arguing in an official U.S. government proposal that fair use protections be applied to all copyrighted material used for AI purposes. Immediately, a slew of over 400 A-list Hollywood power players condemned such an action.

Considering AI was such a hot button issue for the WGA and SAG-AFTRA during the 2023 strikes, these two guilds have more protections than most when it comes to both utilizing the technology and preventing their materials being used for training models said Shapiro. However, many are still bound by the idea of “good faith” in negotiations, which doesn’t necessarily exist without the proper regulation. The notion of regulation, particularly in Hollywood and Washington D.C., tends to make many balk.

“I believe the Copyright Office — because it’s federal law — has been very cautious in terms of making a statement whether or not they need to rewrite certain sections or build in certain sections of the Copyright Act for this very purpose,” Shapiro said. “It took them a long time to do it with music.”

Davis believes that ultimately, the fairest way to handle the use of copyrighted material is some kind of “licensing marketplace for AI training” that he believes companies in Silicon Valley are already preparing for.

Ghen Laraya Long, Esq., Eric Weaver, Ben Sheffner Invision for the Television Academy

Other horror stories related to the AI industry were shared in the next panel, “Evaluating AI Tools,” which featured a chat between Motion Picture Association SVP & associate general counsel Ben Sheffner and head of Virtual & Adaptive Production at USC’s Entertainment Technology Center Eric Weaver. One of the main topics of discussion included a real-word anecdote that speaks to the caution companies and individuals must take in handling this new technology. Moderator Ghen Laraya Long brought up a colleague who was an engineer at a major media company, but got fired for releasing malware from an AI tool he downloaded that resulted in a massive breach of data.

Sheffner explained that studios currently adhere to two considerations when it comes to AI: Can they be sued for copyright infringement? and If they generate a product using AI, do they own the copyright over that material?

“That means that they can license and exploit it around the world,” said Sheffner, “make millions of dollars for the studio, and for all the people who worked on it, but what the U.S. Copyright Office has said, and I know the previous panel touched on this, is that simply entering prompts into an AI system that produces an output is not copyrightable material.”

Even if someone were to create hundreds of prompts before finally landing on their final product, the U.S. Copyright Office would still not deem it eligible for licensing, which proves a massive protection for artists currently. It might also just be another hurdle the studios and AI companies have to jump over should OpenAI and Google’s proposals gain traction in the halls of Congress or, easier yet, The White House. But politics aside, both Sheffner and Weaver counseled caution when it comes to downloading any AI tool and to make sure they’re from reputable sources.

In terms of applying these tools, founder & chief creative officer of Secret Level Jason Zada presented two examples of work he and his company have done over the last year to show just how far the tech has advanced in that time. The first was the company’s homage to the 1995 “Holidays Are Coming” Coca-Cola commercial, which sparked controversy for its unsettling depiction of human beings. This is one of the big problems with current AI models and why many companies are seeking out more data for training. However, Zada did illustrate a good point in breaking down his workflow in that using the tech to build a vision for your project can often put many filmmakers ahead of the curve.

Jason Zada Invision for the Television Academy

“We’ve been doing generative AI for about the past two years, and we have this saying that pre-production is the new post-production,” said Zada. “What I mean by that is like every single time we get into pre-production on any project, we’re starting to see basically what it’s going to look like very, very, very early on.”

The second project Zada presented was a recently released music video for the Wu-Tang Clan that mixes martial arts and Blaxploitation films from the 1970s. Was the imagery slightly better than the Coke ad? Sure. Did it still lack a sense of humanity and creative nuance that suggested unequivocally the use of AI? Absolutely.

“ChikaBOOM,” an animated project boasting the voice talents of Yara Shahidi, Daveed Diggs, and Natasha Lyonne, was also discussed by one of the show’s coordinators, Alyssa Katalyna. Applied to animation, AI tools are a little better hidden and do seem to be a more natural extension of traditional CGI, itself an advancement of 2D animation. Even so, it’s difficult not to consider where the use of this AI might lead. Right now it’s focused on speeding up the process of designing and refining, but what happens when it moves past this stage? Is AI just a tool or do companies want it to replace human artistry, thereby helping their financial bottom lines?

Ultimately, the Television Academy’s second annual AI Summit, though informative and well-curated, was too prioritized with the growth of this technology to offer space for those who question certain elements of its necessity. Putting up such blinders in pursuit of continued application and advancement certainly won’t help convince people to use it, but only serves to garner further distrust.",indiewire

The year of “Barbie” is continuing right on into 2024. But we’re not talking about that Barbie: Now, it’s Barbie Ferreira‘s time to be talked about.

The “Euphoria” breakout star, who parted ways with the HBO series ahead of Season 3, leads “Bob Trevino Likes It,” her first film since the show exit announcement. While Ferreira has had roles in “Unpregnant” and “Nope,” it’s “Bob” that puts Ferreira on the map as one to watch — and she even executive produces it along with her co-star John Leguizamo.

In the film, Ferreira stars as Lily Trevino, a 25-year-old at-home caretaker who struggles with self-abandonment. The source of most of her woes? Her narcissistic abuser father Bob (French Stewart). Lily can’t see the damage that Bob has caused, and after an explosive fight in which Bob blames Lily for cramping his bachelor lifestyle, he cuts her off for good.

Thus, Lily is now left actually abandoned, and she opts to stay emotionally distant from her bubbly client, played by “The Sex Lives of College Girls” star Lauren “Lolo” Spencer, and wallow in her room scrolling the internet. It’s only when Lily tries to cyber-stalk her own father that she feels like she’s hit a new low … and Facebook friends a faceless other Bob Trevino (Leguizamo) whose approval she craves. Every time this Bob “likes” one of her posts, especially ones that are flashbacks to Lily’s neglected childhood (baby Lily blowing out candles on a birthday cake, tween Lily playing basketball, etc.), it’s as if Lily is finally getting the validation and love from her father. Too bad this Bob isn’t actually biologically related to her.

Meanwhile, Leguizamo’s Bob is dealing with his own issues. His marriage to his loving wife (Rachel Bay Jones) has been stunted ever since the loss of their infant son, and Bob tries to stifle any pain by overworking for his racist boss. Lily’s presence comes at the right time for Bob, too.

Lily and Bob 2.0 do eventually meet up, and Bob’s inherent kindness dismantles Lily’s desperate approval-seeking behavior. Sure, Lily has boundary issues, but her life story makes her would-be therapist in training cry (and seek her own psychiatric help) after just one session. After Lily shares with Bob how her father got rid of her childhood dog and blamed an eight-year-old her for “abusing” it, Bob brings her to an animal shelter to connect with a puppy. Bob knows what Lily needs, and there is never any undercurrent of discomfort: These are just two people looking for familial love, and they have found it in each other.

“Bob Trevino Likes It” is a tearjerker of a film, but it’s grounded in the fact that it’s also a true story based on first-time feature writer-director Tracie Laymon’s own encounter with a Bob Laymon. Leguizamo may give one of his career-best performances in the feature, but it’s Ferreira’s surprising command onscreen that is the most memorable. With this feature, she proves her own talent is among that of her A-list “Euphoria” co-stars Sydney Sweeney, Jacob Elordi, and Zendaya.

Ferreira may have been sidelined in “Euphoria” Season 2, but with “Bob,” her range is evident. Ferreira sobs hysterically, spouts horrific recounts of an abusive childhood, and slowly opens up, all in the span of a two-hour film. It’s a quiet movie, one whose tension is found in waiting to see just how far Lily and Bob will take their quasi daughter-father relationship (will Lily finally meet Bob’s wife? Will both Bobs finally cross paths?). Do we “like” it? We love it.

Blanchett said during Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang‘s “Las Culturistas” podcast that she would prefer to go “back to the day” when awards shows weren’t televised to the public. That way, those nominated and attending could instead focus on being part of a “great party” and not dealing with photographers and lip readers on social media.

“There’s so few spaces that you can go now where you are private,” Blanchett said. “That’s what I loved about the late ’80s, going to all of the dance parties in Sydney for Mardi Gras. People were just there. They were so present, you know, they were just together, collectively, having a great time. It was non-aggressive. No one was being recorded. No one cared what anyone did.”

The “Black Bag” and “Disclaimer” star continued, “I mean, I say, I know it’s blasphemy, go back to the day when it wasn’t televised. Bring that back and just have a great party where people can just let go. I mean, the industry is so scattered and at such a point…which I think potentially could be exciting or could really be depressing, but it’s at a pivot point, and so we need to gather together and celebrate what it is that we do, without it having to have any public-facing. I mean, the fashion is great, and all of that stuff. We’ll find out in the end who won or who didn’t win. But it would be so nice that that happened behind closed doors. Absolutely a very different evening.”

As for the so-called “lip readers” online that try to decipher what stars are saying to each other at these ceremonies, Blanchett doubted their accuracy. “That’s really, what? I mean, do something. Learn Ikebana or something, like a skill that’s actually beautiful,” Blanchett said.

Blanchett won the best supporting actress Oscar in 2005 for “The Aviator” and best lead actress in 2014 for “Blue Jasmine.” She also was nominated for six other Oscars.

The first televised Oscars ceremony was the 25th ceremony in 1953. The 2025 Academy Awards were streaming live for the first time on ABC and Hulu.",indiewire

Pascal and Heyman are just in talks at the moment, as the deal reported last month between Amazon MGM and the Broccolis is still being finalized. Amazon MGM had no comment.

Amazon MGM on February 20 announced it was forming a new joint venture to house the James Bond IP, with the studio obtaining creative control of the franchise. Broccoli has been the main caretaker of the franchise’s direction for decades, along with her half-brother Wilson.

The last Bond film to hit the screen was “No Time to Die” in 2021, the final entry starring Daniel Craig, who only made five Bond films but had the longest tenure as Bond, dating all the way back to 2006 with “Casino Royale.” Amazon purchased MGM in 2022 for $8.5 billion, acquiring all the IP and library rights to over 4,000 films and 17,000 shows, but the crown jewel of that library, 007, had remained in limbo.

The Wall Street Journal had a lengthy report about the friction and differences of opinion between the Broccolis and the other powers that be at Amazon MGM, and though the Broccolis had collaborated with Amazon MGM on other projects and some unscripted Bond projects for TV, the films did not have a direction or a new Bond to take up the mantle. More eyebrows were raised in the wake of the news when Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked fans online who they wanted to see cast as 007.

Pascal, since leaving Sony in 2015, has become one of the most successful franchise producers in Hollywood. She’s produced Sony’s “Spider-Verse” animated films, the Tom Holland “Spider-Man” MCU films, and critical darlings like “Little Women” and last year’s “Challengers.” While at Sony, she also oversaw the release of the most commercially successful Bond film to date, 2012’s “Skyfall.”

Heyman, of course, is no slouch. He produced all the “Harry Potter” films and the “Fantastic Beasts” follow-ups and has the “Potter” series reboot at HBO, and some of his other box office hits have included “Gravity,” “Paddington 2,” “Once Upon a Time …i n Hollywood,” and “Barbie.” He’s also a producer on the Matthew McConaughey film “The Rivals of Amziah King,” which just premiered at SXSW and is seeking distribution.

When Scott Stuber left Netflix to relaunch United Artists under Amazon MGM, there was the feeling that he could be in line to shepherd Bond considering the label’s history with the 007 franchise.

https://indiewire.com,‘Being Maria’ Review: Maria Schneider’s Horrific ‘Last Tango’ Experience Is Only One Facet of This Compelling Portrait,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/being-maria-movie-review-schneider-last-tango-1235110513/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:30:00 GMT","Toward the end of Jessica Palud’s “Being Maria,” an uneven but poignantly restorative portrait of “Last Tango in Paris” star Maria Schneider (played here by “Happening” breakout Anamaria Vartolomei), the actress sits for an interview in which she reflects on her recent experience shooting Jacques Rivette’s self-disowned “Merry-Go-Round.”

With a warm smile on her face, Schneider describes the serendipity of the film’s premise, which revolves around a boy and a girl who cross paths in Paris after being summoned there by someone neither of them can find: “It’s about two people who meet because the person they were supposed to meet doesn’t show up.”

The production of Rivette’s creatively unmoored film was not a happy one (Schneider couldn’t stand the male lead, and quit the movie before it even wrapped), but you’d never know that from the way it’s discussed in “Being Maria.” So far as Palud is concerned, there’s more value — more truth — to be found in doomed and/or forgotten attempts at artistic discovery than there is in even the most iconic displays of artistic debasement.

It’s an ethos that “Being Maria” embodies in spite of itself, as Palud is much sharper in depicting Schneider’s trauma on the set of “Last Tango” than she is in detailing the psychic fallout of shooting Bernardo Bertolucci’s erotic drama — particularly the butter-lubricated scene of anal rape, which was sprung on the actress and her character alike.

That’s also an ethos that “Being Maria” comes to assume as an identity. Palud’s spare and elliptical script (co-written with Laurette Polmanss, and based on a second-person memoir written by Schneider’s cousin Vanessa) is the furthest thing from the work of Jacques Rivette, and yet it too could be seen as a story about two people who meet because the person they were supposed to meet doesn’t show up.

One of those people is Maria Schneider, and the other is us. The person who never shows up is Jeanne, the character she played in Bertolucci’s film, and would always be remembered for — the one whose assault was captured on camera, and whose pain would follow the actress like a shadow for decades to come. Jeanne’s simulated but unscripted rape was meant to expose the truth of her character’s humiliation and distrust, but those emotions were manufactured at the expense of the 19-year-old girl who played her. They belonged to her, and “Being Maria” is determined to wrestle them back.

To that end, it’s helpful that Palud’s film — which starts three years before “Last Tango” was shot in 1972, and ends roughly decade later — frames Schneider’s encounter with Bertolucci as the defining episode of a life that extended far off-screen in both directions. The rape scene has an obvious gravity to it (it pulls Schneider up through her teenage years, and pins her down as she tries to leap into adulthood), but Palud refuses to privilege the most notorious episode of the actress’ life over the multitude of invisible moments that led to it or were created in its wake.

We meet Maria as a doe-eyed teen who’s been newly reacquainted with her actor dad (Yvan Attal as Daniel Gélin), a leading man who conceived her at the height of an affair with a 17-year-old model — and then, for the sake of his marriage refused to recognize her as his daughter. Their connection enrages Maria’s mother (“He’s like all men,” she seethes, “he fucks around and then he goes home to his wife”), but the misogyny baked into the film business only seems to make it more compelling for the young Maria, who’s eager for the male affection she never received as a child.

Palud doesn’t put too fine a point on that, but she doesn’t have to. “Actors don’t choose roles,” Maria is told, “roles choose actors,” and so it goes that she finds herself sitting across from a yassified Bertolucci (Giuseppe Maggio, playing the director as a pretentious young himbo), who looks at the fresh-faced girl sitting across from him and declares that “there’s something wounded about you.” It’s a wound that he’s eager to exploit. The next thing she knows, Maria is acting against the great Marlon Brando (Matt Dillon, in a nuanced performance that creates mystique without mimicry), and awing at his ability to make his character’s emotions seem real.

Locked into Maria’s perspective at all times, Palud shoots the making of “Last Tango” with a gauzy sense of remove — as though it were the most surreal experience imaginable, and also just work to be done. Just as there’s no dramatic build-up to Maria landing the part, there’s no romance to the process of acting it, nor the slightest whiff of self-satisfaction in recreating iconic scenes.

What we’re left with is a curious feeling of distance. Maria couldn’t be more enmeshed with her co-star on set, and yet she’s blithely left out of Brando’s impassioned conversations with their director; she is a prop for these men to use as they see fit, and it never occurs to them to ask for her thoughts on a given scene. So far as Bertolucci is concerned, his actors are merely an obstacle between their characters and the truth — a truth that he insists upon achieving by any means necessary (Bertolucci never comes off well, but nothing we see on screen is as damning as the fact that Palud was an intern on “The Dreamers,” and saw the director at work first-hand).

‘Being Maria’

Even Brando feels uncomfortably vulnerable as the result of that approach, but he believes in a method that Maria is too young to question. He believes that yanking off the actress’ pants without warning and simulating an unscripted anal rape will allow Maria to express the “truth” of Jeanne’s horror, and he believes that the ends will justify the means (assuming he considers the ends at all). But what use is the truth of that moment if it doesn’t belong to Jeanne? And if the truth were created as a result of such extreme manipulation, would it not be the exact kind of artificial construction that Bertolucci was so determined to avoid?

There’s little ambiguity as to how “Being Maria” would answer those questions, but the indignities visited upon Maria speak for themselves, and Palud’s disinterest in judging the artistic quality of “Last Tango” is almost matched by her disinterest in limiting Schneider’s life to the stuff of a proto-#MeToo screed. On the contrary, she’s fascinated by the mottled self-image of a young woman who could feel herself being defined by the male gaze for all the world to see — a young woman whose star was born through an act of destruction, and whose public image would follow her into the most private spaces thereafter.

The particulars of that process are rendered in frustratingly generic fashion, as Maria’s effort to escape from the shadow of her success is reduced to a heroin addiction and a few bad days on set before a chance encounter with a young journalist (Céleeste Brunnquell) offers a new path forward. While the film observes that her public image would continue to be molded by a series of male directors, it fails to meaningfully explore how that tension manifested itself in Schneider’s post-“Tango” performances.

But even as Benjamin Biolay’s dolorous string score threatens to flatten “Being Maria” into a more traditional rise and fall story, the film is buoyed by Vartolomei’s constant pursuit of the truth, and by the intensity with which Maria is always searching to see herself reflected in the eyes of those looking at her — our eyes very much included.

“No one cares about truth,” a manager tells Maria after she’s a bit too honest on the “Last Tango” press tour, which is a performance unto itself. “Do your job as an actress, no more.” By inviting Vartolomei to play Schneider in a biopic so attuned to the difference between creation and destruction, “Being Maria” movingly reaffirms that Schneider was doing her job as an actress — right up until the moment when Bertolucci and Brando forced her to stop.

Grade: B

About halfway through his conversation with himself, Mark Scout has had enough. Mark’s Outie (Adam Scott) started the camcorder-assisted back-and-forth with a well-intentioned apology, but really, his opening concession was just the framework for a favor. A big favor. One man’s “I am so sorry — I created you as a prisoner and as an escape,” is another man’s “I am so sorry you were ever born.” And that other man is Mark’s Innie (also played by Adam Scott, who’s outstanding throughout an emotionally turbulent finale), who knows exactly what his Outie is asking of him. He knew it before they started swapping video messages.

“You want me to give my life?,” Mark’s Innie says. “The lives of everyone down there? Just to save one person you happen to care about?”

Devon (Jen Tullock) is caught off-guard by Mark’s Innie’s interpretation of events and quickly initiates his chat with Mark’s Outie, hoping the man of two minds can sort it out instead. She, like Mark’s Outie, has been focused on saving Gemma (Dichen Lachman) and punishing Lumon. They haven’t thought about Mark’s Innie beyond imagining his nightmarish working conditions, and I doubt even those daydreams paid much heed to the other Innies toiling away beside him. (No wonder Mark’s Outie mangles Helly’s name.) So hearing Mark’s Innie describe saving Gemma as a sacrifice — the ultimate sacrifice — knocks them back.

After all, it’s easier to ignore people you don’t have to see. It’s easier to neglect pain you don’t have to think about. Mark’s Outie says as much himself, when he first gets fed up with Mark’s Innie.

“Look,” his Outie says, shifting tone from sensitive to superior. “I mourned Gemma for two years. I lost my job, my teaching job, because I fucking started showing up drunk. I hid all of her stuff in my basement because it was easier pretending that she never existed.”

Now, he wants to do it again, only with his Innie — with all the Innies. Mark’s Outie clearly regrets getting severed. He may even realize that hiding from pain by shutting his brain off (chemically, by drinking, and literally via severance) doesn’t work. Here, in baring his soul to the camera, he wants his Innie to see how much Gemma means to him, knowing Helly (Britt Lower) means something similar to Mark’s Innie. Similar, but not the same. Mark’s Outie still doesn’t want to acknowledge that there’s more than one life at stake in Episode 10’s rescue mission. He still doesn’t see Mark’s Innie as anything more than a rogue part of his own greater being.

And it costs him.

“Severance” Season 2 ends with a paradoxical wallop, both inevitable and breathtaking. The Marks lead a daring escape through the bowels of Lumon Industries, switching between Innie and Outie on every floor in order to rescue Gemma from her 25(!) torture rooms and return her to the real world. But the excitement over defeating the evil scientists and saving the damsel is distorted by the sound of Gemma’s distressed cries. Here she is, finally out of the dungeon, looking into the eyes of her lost, loving husband… and he runs into the arms of another woman.

Good luck explaining that, Devon. (Well, I assume it’ll be Devon. I hope it’ll be Devon — she better be waiting for Gemma just outside the emergency exit door!)

But to us, Mark’s reasoning is painfully clear. His Innie is running for his life, running toward his life, and running away with the woman he loves. Mark’s Innie did the right thing by saving Gemma, an innocent victim. We still don’t know how, exactly, she ended up in Lumon’s sub-basement, nor why Lumon chose to conduct its advanced severance procedures on her, but we do know Gemma was being held against her will. Mark’s Innie recognizes as much and, after a pep talk from Helly, goes through with the plan to free her, despite the risks.

What he doesn’t do is free Mark’s Outie. Instead of blindly trusting his above-ground alter ego to do what he promises — “If you help me, I won’t abandon you,” Mark’s Outie says — Mark’s Innie chooses to stay behind. To stay at Lumon. To stay with Helly. He (rightly) deduces from Mark’s Outie’s struggle to explain how reintegration actually works that he’s better off looking out for himself, at least until more definitive answers can be found.

It’s a “head over heart” decision — save for the charming asterisk that Mark’s Innie is following his heart, too. Mark’s Innie may be acting selfishly. He may even recognize that he’s effectively swapped Gemma and Mark’s Outie, the latter becoming a corporate hostage and the former his distraught partner kept in the dark. But Mark’s Innie is also holding Mark’s Outie accountable. Mark’s Outie isn’t to blame for Gemma’s plight (as far as we know), but he’s certainly to blame for his Innie’s. He said as much when he apologized. Now, he’s facing the consequences.

The “Severance” Season 2 finale is noticeably different than Season 1’s ending. First of all, Season 2’s climactic conclusion isn’t a cliffhanger. It pulls us back from the brink, offering a platform to stand on, even if we’re still waiting near the edge to see what happens next. But where Season 1 unifies the audience behind Mark’s urgent discovery (“She’s alive!”), Season 2 is pointedly divisive. Where Season 1’s ending directs viewers’ ire toward Lumon, an evil corporation that faked Gemma’s death and then experimented on her, Season 2’s ending puts the climactic weight on Mark. It asks us consider what we would do in the same situation. It asks a difficult question, rather than giving a provocative answer.

People don’t typically respond to reason in the same way they respond to feelings, and “Cold Harbor” evokes a bevy of conflicting feelings. While it’s jarring in the moment to be denied one of our primary couples’ long-sought reunions, Mark’s Innie makes a choice. It’s not a choice everyone will be on board with, even if they can appreciate why he makes it. Reactions will depend on if the viewer is ‘shipping Mark and Gemma or Mark and Helly; they’ll depend on who sees Innies like Mark’s Outie sees them (as a part of Mark) and who sees them like Innies do (as distinct people); they’ll depend on how satisfied theorists are with the answers provided about Cold Harbor, the mysterious numbers, and Lumon’s overall mission. (“The numbers are your wife,” Harmony says. “Every file you completed is a new consciousness for her — a new Innie.”)

Heck, some viewers will certainly be disappointed that Harmony (Patricia Arquette) didn’t get more to do than deliver exposition (though she is the perfect person to break the big news, considering she invented severance and her creepy yet authoritative stature). Others will be anguishing over Irving (John Turturro) and Burt (Christopher Walken), whose respective and collective fates weren’t addressed at all. Plenty more will simply be bummed their predictions didn’t pan out.

But “Severance” Season 2 was always building to this. In the first episode, Mark saves his fellow Innies and then they choose to stay at Lumon. In the last episode, Mark saves the Innies again and then he chooses to stay at Lumon. There’s a clear growth trajectory for Mark’s Innie, whose goals align with Mark’s Outie at the start of the season before he goes out on his own in the end, but the rest of Season 2 is also dedicated to recognizing the distinctions between Innies and Outies. There’s the twist with Helena pretending to be Helly, which calls attention to how polar opposite people can exist in the same body; there’s the disconnect between Dylan’s Innie (a “self-assured badass”) and his Outie (who we find out is kind of a loser); there’s a similar disconnect between Burt’s severed selves, with his Outie seeking redemption for his seedy life through his Innie’s newborn innocence.

Even splitting the first two episodes between Innies and Outies works to illustrate not only that these people are living in separate worlds, but that they’re both alive. One can’t be written off to benefit the other, just like all those hours we spend toiling away at work can’t simply be written off like they didn’t impact (or even dictate) our lives. Lumon’s goal, whether through the severance procedure or cult-like devotion, is compliance. It wants to control its workers. It wants them to believe what the company tells them to believe, and do what the company tells them to do.

What Lumon does to Gemma reveals the vile vision for extending that goal: For a time, Lumon was satisfied with exploiting half of each worker. While they’re on the clock, they’re Lumon’s, but when they’re off the clock, they’re free to make whatever choices they want (until it’s time to punch in again). But if they can sever each employee 25 times, how will those people ever know it’s time to go home? What’s to stop them from moving from one room to the next, working on different projects, for an endless amount of time? And that’s without considering what it means that they kidnapped Gemma and, until now, got away with it? What’s to stop them from doing that on a wide scale? Or what’s to stop them from breeding workers who never see the light of day and never think to ask?

These aren’t new questions, necessarily, but “Cold Harbor” offers a resounding rebuttal to anyone who thinks shutting Lumon down fixes all the problems the company has created, and it does so by forcing Mark’s Innie and Outie to acknowledge one another. In their earlier discussion, before it devolves into an ultimatum, Mark’s Outie refers to his Innie’s life as a “nightmare,” and Mark’s Innie politely pushes back. “Nightmare is the wrong word, actually,” he says. “We find ways to make it work — to feel whole. … Whatever this life is, it’s all we have, and we don’t want it to end.”

His comments are echoed later on, when Helly is rallying the Choreography and Merriment marching band. “They’re going to turn us off like fucking machines,” Helly shouts. “They give us half a life and think we won’t fight for it?”

Think again.

Grade: A

“Severance” Season 2 is available to stream on Apple TV+. The series has been renewed for Season 3.

Further Refinement:

• From her opening slight to Jame Eagan (Michael Siberry) — “You’re so fucking weird” — to her Norma Rae moment with the marching band and running off with Mark S. to end the season, Helly had a helluva day. Sometimes, doing the right thing really pays off. You love to see it.

• That said, I don’t know what to make of Jame’s preference for Helly over Helena. Perhaps he just likes watching his progeny squirm under his thumb rather than insufficiently capitulate to his power, but it feels like he’s got bigger plans for his acknowledged daughter — and that’s scary.

• Speaking of who Jame’s acknowledged, his comment about “siring others in the shadows” helps explain how Harmony got Mark and Devon into the birthing suite. “She’s one of Jame’s,” Harmony tells the guard near the end of Episode 9. “No one’s to know.” So… what happened to those kids? Where are they? What do they know? Are they severed, as their dear ol’ dad seems to prefer, and… (ick) how many times?

• What a relief to see Dylan back after he tried to quit last week. But his reappearance also reminds us that Irving is still gone — will he be the new wild card in Season 3? Emerging from expulsion to save the day, much like Harmony did in Season 2?

• Playing the Michael Jordan-era Chicago Bulls’ intro music to kick off Lumon’s historic celebration for completing Cold Harbor is… too perfect.

• R.I.P. Mr. Drummond. What a way to go out! You won’t be missed, but here’s hoping we see plenty more of Darri Ólafsson, the actor who gave him such brutish, calculating menace. If you want to see his range, flip over to HBO’s “Somebody Somewhere,” where he plays the exact opposite character.

• As someone who wasn’t a huge fan of the goats’ return in Season 2, seeing Lorne (Gwendoline Christie) reappear in the finale helped justify the earlier emphasis on her flock. I still think the sequence in Episode 3 left a lot to be desired, but it’s a relief, looking back, to know a goat (and its shepherd) would play a pivotal role in Episode 10. And I’m even more relieved that little Emile wasn’t “entombed.” No more killing!

• God, I hope Milchick defects to the rebels in Season 3. He’s too damn cool to be a bad guy, as much as I enjoy watching him wrestle with his personal pride and his loyalty to Lumon. Bring that vending machine toppling muscle over to Team MDR.

• “At least you’ll have a chance at living.”

“Yeah, but I want to live with you.”

https://indiewire.com,Steven Soderbergh on His ‘Shock Comedy’ That Was Never Made: ‘Nobody Wanted to Touch’ It,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/steven-soderbergh-comedy-never-made-1235110489/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:30:00 GMT","Sex, lies, and… shock comedy? In a new interview, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh details his outrageous comedy film that never was. The “Presence” and “Black Bag” director told Men’s Health that he had a “frustrating” experience trying to get a script greenlit that was akin to “Team America” and “Blazing Saddles” in terms of being a “completely batshit crazy” story.

“I had this shock comedy that I was trying to get made that nobody wanted to touch. That was frustrating,” Soderbergh said. “It’s hard to describe, but it was deliberately outrageous and provocative. And all the people that read it that could potentially pay for it, whether it be companies or wealthy individuals, said, ‘This is too hot.’ So, that was a bummer.”

He continued, “I was really interested in making something that was like a full-on comedy, like ‘Blazing Saddles.’ Not a subtle comedy. That still appeals to me; it’s just apparent that it’s not going to be that script. But I like the idea of trying to make what would be the equivalent now of ‘Team America’ or ‘Blazing Saddles.’ Just something completely batshit crazy. … I want it to be outrageous, and to have people laughing at it, and other people going like, ‘I’m not sure you’re allowed to do that.’ That kind of thing.”

The wide-ranging auteur also revisited his films that did manage to get produced — including the underrated “The Good German,” which Soderbergh admitted is the “most reviled” feature he’s ever made.

“It would be really bad form for me to pretend to be under-appreciated. But there is no question that ‘The Good German’ remains the most reviled thing I’ve ever made, which I’m kind of baffled by,” he said. “I just… Wow. Like, people were really angry. And it was just odd, because of all the things I’ve done, that might have been the closest I got to getting what I saw in my imagination, you know? And then it just, it really made people angry. Yeah, that was interesting.”

Soderbergh added, “Other stuff I’ve made — stuff that when it came out people were unhappy with —almost everything else has gone through a kind of cycle. People are like, ‘Oh, I saw “Solaris.”‘ And, ‘”Ocean’s Twelve” is actually not that bad.’ That kind of thing. Nobody brings this movie up. Nobody has ever said, ‘Hey, I watched “The Good German” again. And actually…’ Nobody has ever written that sentence.”

Soderbergh knows that modern younger audiences are more director-driven when it comes to their movie picks: “Here’s what I know from talking to Focus Features [which distributed ‘Black Bag’], and people at A24, and Neon: Young people, 25 and under, are going to the movies, and are very director-oriented.”

Soderbergh previously told IndieWire in 2024 that, after publicly retiring in 2013, he had to realize how Hollywood has changed before returning to filmmaking.

“I would say, ‘I don’t know what I was thinking.’ But I do know what I was thinking,” Soderbergh said. “And what happened was I confused the job with some other issues within the industry or the business that I was unhappy with. And so I announced that ‘Behind the Candelabra’ was going to be my last film for a period. I put out no timeline, I just said, ‘I’m stopping. I’m going to pursue something that I’ve been doing on the side, which is painting, and I’m going to get serious about that, and spend however many years I need to spend to get better at that.’”

He added, “The heads of the studio, they [now] don’t have the kind of control and power even that they used to have. Everything evolves, everything changes. That’s the only constant. So the artist has to figure out how to navigate these changes.”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Why Controversy Over Disney’s Live-Action ‘Snow White’ Wasn’t Worth It,https://www.indiewire.com/features/podcast/sundance-cities-live-action-snow-white-screen-talk-1235110405/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","On this week’s “Screen Talk,” we take a closer look at the three cities vying to become Sundance’s new home. We are also discussing Plan B’s extraordinary limited series, “Adolescence.” And we’ll parse that amazing last episode of “The White Lotus.”

We also debate the merits of Disney’s controversial live-action “Snow White” and ask why Warner Bros. has it in for animation. As of March 16, the studio has removed the Looney Tunes cartoon shorts library (released 1930-1969), starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig, and Wile E. Coyote from streaming service Max. “They’re trashing the past,” said Anne. “Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav will do anything to save a dime.”

Under his direction, the studio hasn’t been kind to animation. The “Looney Tunes” live-action hybrid film “Coyote vs. Acme” was scrapped by WBD in 2023 before the film was set to start streaming on Max, taking a $30 million tax write-off instead. WBD later announced that it had no plans to ever release the $70 million movie, and instead, the film was made available to be sold to another interested studio. WBD’s decision followed the similarly scrapped films “Batgirl” and animated feature “Scoob! Holiday Haunt.” It looks like, finally, indie distributor Ketchup Entertainment is in talks to release the film.

And there was actually some good news this week from Florida, where the city of Miami backed off of trying to control what local arthouse O Cinema could show. The city’s mayor tried to pull Oscar winner “No Other Land,” a film about Israeli soldiers razing Palestinian homes on the West Bank, made by both Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers, which was sucked into the rhetoric of the moment. When the theater refused to budge, the mayor threatened to evict them. But the Miami City Council opposed the move, refusing to censor the theater’s programming.

On the Sundance front, this week Ryan, Brian Welk, and I each took one of the three cities that Sundance must choose as its new home when their Park City deal runs out in 2026. They are expected to make their announcement at the end of the month. Park City has outgrown the festival by offering too few theaters and skyrocketing costs. One option is 45 minutes away at the major Delta Airlines hub Salt Lake City, home to major sports teams and plenty of venues, which has long played Sundance programming and has a lively film community.

Sundance Picasa

Salt Lake would seem a perfect fit, except for one thing: Republican Governor Cox is weighing whether to keep the festival’s revenues instate or sign a bill forbidding the flying of certain flags on state buildings and schools, including the Pride flag. If he signs it, Sundance would be a blue festival in a red state. We also looked at Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio. Boulder is more LGBTQ-friendly, said Ryan, a welcoming blue state with a university and accessible ski resorts like Vail and Aspen, while Cincinnati is another large-scale baseball city in a purple state with plenty of grand theaters and a hip downtown.

Ryan and Anne both admire an extraordinary new hit Netflix series, “Adolescence,” from Plan B. The British series stars burly character actor Steven Graham, who gives an Emmy-worthy performance as a working-class father trying to do better than his parents ever did, but must now face the idea that his 13-year-old son may have killed a fellow student. The four episodes are shot in amazing uninterrupted long takes that immerse the viewer. Ryan cited Antonioni’s “The Passenger” when describing one shot, while Anne compared the series’ cinematic virtuosity to “1917.”

Mike White’s “The White Lotus,” after treading water for an episode or two, has picked up the pace as the three women pals go into party mode, and Walton Goggins’ character heads for Bangkok to see an old friend, played by Sam Rockwell, who tells a riveting story about what he’s been up to, as Goggins reacts. It’s a master class in scene acting.

Both Anne and Ryan dismiss the controversies swirling around Disney’s latest live-action entry, the long-in-the-works “Snow White,” and enjoyed it more than they expected. It might even prove to be a box office hit. The two leads (Rachel Zegler and Andrew Burnap) are able Broadway warblers, and the new numbers from “La La Land” songwriters Pasek and Paul are hummable, even if Gal Gadot is just serviceable as the Evil Queen.

We didn’t even mind the motion-capture seven dwarfs, and enjoyed the ways that the writers updated the film: the Princess Snow White runs the story, while her adoring Prince Charming is no white knight, but more of a forest Robin Hood-type, wearing a hoodie.

https://indiewire.com,‘Severance’ Has Been Renewed for Season 3,https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/severance-season-3-renewal-1235110481/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","Yes, “Severance” will be back for Season 3. The Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning Apple TV+ series has been renewed for a third season, just hours after the the Season 2 finale dropped on the streaming service, leaving fans even more puzzled by the workplace thriller. Season 2 recently made history as the most-watched series ever on the Apple platform.

“Making ‘Severance’ has been one of the most creatively exciting experiences I’ve ever been a part of,” executive producer and director Ben Stiller said in an official statement. “While I have no memory of this, I’m told making Season 3 will be equally enjoyable, though any recollection of these future events will be forever and irrevocably wiped from my memory as well.”

Stiller helped announce the renewal by tweeting, “So some fans are asking for Season 3 of ‘Severance.’ What do you say, Tim Cook?” Apple CEO Tim Cook replied, “Season 3 of ‘Severance’ is available upon request.”

“Severance” is created by writer/executive producer Dan Erickson. Stiller has directed a majority of the series, which stars Emmy Award nominee Adam Scott, along with Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken, and Academy and Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette.

“The idea of getting to make more ‘Severance’ with the greatest cast and crew on Earth is more thrilling to me than all the world’s finger traps combined,” Erickson said in his own statement. “I can’t wait to continue spreading woe, frolic, dread, and malice with these truly incredible people.”

Actor and executive producer Adam Scott added, “I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work with Ben, Dan, the incredible cast and crew, Apple, and the whole ‘Severance’ team. Oh hey also — not a huge deal — but if you see my Innie, please don’t mention any of this to him. Thanks.”

In “Severance,” Mark Scout (Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a “severance: procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself.

In Season 2, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe. “Severance” Season 2 was also executive produced by John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Sam Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz, and Nicholas Weinstock. In addition to starring in the series, Scott and Arquette serve as executive producers. Fifth Season is the studio.

Stiller recently told IndieWire that Season 2 was “taking some chances” with the storytelling. “I felt like if we just sort of tried to stay within the bounds of what we’d done, it would feel like we were treading water,” he said in a recent interview. “As I heard people react to the finale of the first season — it seemed like people really responded to it — you definitely start to think about that. What are we going to do for the next finale? And the only thing that was in our head, really, was just like, ‘Well, let’s just not do the same thing.’ I do want to have something that’s hopefully memorable and stays with you and feels visceral. … I feel like this finale, hopefully, is more of a standalone episode in its own way. It’s just its own thing, a little bit more, hopefully.”

Stiller also assured fans that Season 3 will not take as long to make as Season 2 did. Three years elapsed between the first and second seasons of the series. “No, the plan is not to [wait three years],” Stiller said during Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast ahead of the Season 2 finale. “Hopefully we’ll be announcing what the plan is very soon.”

He further confirmed during “Jimmy Kimmel Live” that the “Severance” team already knows how the series will end. “We know what the ending is but how we’re getting there is the creative process,” he said.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘Prison Break’ To Reunite ‘Mayans M.C.’ Stars Clayton Cardenas & JR Bourne With Elgin James; Myles Bullock & Georgie Flores Also Board,https://deadline.com/2025/03/prison-break-clayton-cardenas-jr-bourne-myles-bullock-1236346685/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 19:33:02 GMT","EXCLUSIVE: Hulu and 20th Television‘s Prison Break pilot has cast Clayton Cardenas (Mayans M.C., Mayor of Kingstown), JR Bourne (Mayans M.C., Teenwolf), Georgie Flores (Dumplin, Into The Dark) and Myles Bullock (BMF, Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist) as series regulars.

The project reunites Cardenas and Bourne with Mayans M.C. co-creator Elgin James, who is leading the efforts on the Prison Break pilot as writer and executive producer. Bourne also starred in James’ feature debut in the indie drama Little Birds (2011).

They join series leads Emily Browning, Lukas Gage and Drake Rodger.

Watch on Deadline

As we previously reported, James’ version will be its own thing and set within the same universe as the original FOX series of the same name from Paul Scheuring. This new project is not expected to involve the characters at the center of the OG project, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), and Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell). The spinoff project was first revealed to be in development in late 2023 and was picked up to pilot in December.

Cardenas will portray ‘Ghost,’ a ruthlessly dangerous inmate at one of the deadliest prisons in America.

Bullock will play “Darius ‘Red’ Lewis,” an inmate at one of the deadliest prisons in America.

Flores will play ‘Andrea,’ one of the female cadets training to be a Corrections Officer at one of the deadliest prisons in America.

Bourne will play ‘Junior,’ a mentally unstable lone survivor of a decades-old prison break that devastated the town.

The original Prison Break, which debuted in 2005, followed Michael Scofield (Miller), a young man determined to prove his convicted brother Lincoln Burrows’ (Purcell) innocence and save him from death row by hatching an elaborate plan to escape prison. The series aired on FOX for four seasons, followed by a made-for-TV film titled The Final Break which aired 12 days after the Season 4 finale in 2009 to wrap things up. A 2015 Prison Break sequel limited series starring Miller and Purcell, also on Fox, served as a fifth season. The series Prison was the No. 1 most streamed series in the U.S. in August 2024, according to Nielsen. All episodes of the crime drama are available to stream on Hulu.

James is executive producing under his Sierra Drive production banner alongside four executive producers from the original series, Dawn Olmstead, who has been working closely with him throughout the development process, Prison Break creator Paul Scheuring, Marty Adelstein and Neal Moritz.

Bullock is best known for his performances in Starz’s BMF and the 20th Century Studios remake of White Men Can’t Jump on Hulu. His most recent project, Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist, revealed a standout performance by Bullock in the role of ‘Willie Black,’ a key player in the heist at the center of the limited series. His TV credits also include FX’s Dave, Marvel’s Runaways for Hulu, Criminal Minds, and CBS’ S.W.A.T. Bullock is repped by Independent Artist Group and Liberman-Zerman Management.

Cardenas is currently in production on the upcoming fourth season of Mayor of Kingstown for Paramount +, produced by Taylor Sheridan, where he portrays ‘Anthony Torres.’ He is best known for his lead role of ‘Angel Reyes’ on FX’s Mayans MC which aired on FX for multiple seasons. He then joined the cast of The Abandons for Netflix and just wrapped the first season. He has also been active in the Los Angeles theater scene, most recently producing and starring in a reading of Jesus Hopped the A Train in the role of ‘Lucius.’ He is repped by The Rosenzweig Group.

Flores starred in the HBO Max’s pilot More, written by Amy Chozick. She starred in the Blumhouse/Hulu anthology series Into The Dark and shot one of the leads of the Amazon pilot Untitled for Catalina Mastretta, opposite Lorenza Izzo. She was also seen starring in the hit Netflix feature Dumplin, opposite Danielle MacDonald and Jennifer Aniston, directed by Anne Fletcher. Before, she starred as one of the leads opposite Bella Thorne in Freeform’s series Famous In Love. She is repped by Innovative Artists, Management 360, and Lev Ginsberg.

Bourne most recently starred in FX’s Mayans M.C. where he played the diabolical Isaac, King of Meth Mountain, which he played since the motorcycle drama’s third season; and Teen Wolf: The Movie, reprising the role of ‘Chris Argent’ which he first brought to life in the Jeff Davis series from MTV. Additional TV credits include Stargate: SG-1, 24, Fringe, The Secret Circle, Revenge, Suits and Somewhere Between. In addition to Little Birds, his film credits include The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Butterfly Effect 2 and Run Rabbit Run. He is repped by McKuin Frankel Whitehead, LLP.",indiewire

TVLine can reveal that the Seth MacFarlane cartoon’s upcoming season finale (airing Monday, March 24 at 10/9c) will double as a network finale. While reruns of past seasons will continue to be shown on TBS (and Adult Swim) through 2030, sources confirm that the Warner Bros. Discovery-owned cable channel will no longer serve as the destination for first-run episodes.

Now we are able to confirm that American Dad! is eyeing a multi-season renewal at its former home, Fox, which would reunite it with fellow MacFarlane cartoon Family Guy (now in Season 23).

American Dad! made its debut on Fox in February 2005, where it aired for nearly a decade before making the jump to basic cable in October 2014. It was the last scripted original to air on TBS; its most recent two-season renewal was handed out by the previous regime ahead of the WBD merger in 2022.

For the uninitiated: American Dad! “centers on super patriotic CIA agent Stan Smith and the misadventures of his unconventional family in Langley Falls, Va.,” per the official logline. The voice cast includes series co-creator Seth MacFarlane (as Stan and Roger), Wendy Schaal (as Francine), Rachael MacFarlane (as Hayley), Jeff Fischer (as Jeff), Scott Grimes (as Steve) and Dee Bradley Baker (as Klaus).

A total of 388 American Dad! episodes will have aired across two networks when its TBS run comes to an end. Our sister site Deadline was the first to report its return to Fox.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,The Women’s Sports Boom Will End If We Don’t Continue to Build,https://www.sportico.com/business/media/2025/womens-sports-boom-media-momentum-wnba-nwsl-1234844022/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:50:00 GMT","Today’s guest columnist is Haley Rosen, founder and CEO of Just Women’s Sports.

For those of us who have spent our lives in women’s sports, the current moment of hype and excitement has required us to straddle two realities at once.

On the one hand, things are changing in a real and substantial way. Viewership records are getting smashed across the board, marquee events are outdrawing their men’s counterparts, and brands and investors are diving into the space.

It’s been reported that the Cleveland Cavaliers ownership group will pay $250 million to join the WNBA, beating out eight other bids. NWSL franchise fees, meanwhile, are up 55x since 2021.

Despite losing Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese to the WNBA, viewership of this year’s women’s college basketball season was up on ESPN, with a record 15 games drawing over 500,000 viewers, setting us up for what could be another blockbuster March Madness, starting today.

A paradigm shift is clearly underway, as investors start to see the business opportunity women’s sports represent. Instead of being treated like charities, these leagues are being valued like startups. Even Eminem wants in on the action.

And yet, most athletes aren’t feeling this change. They’re seeing the spike in interest, hype and franchise valuations, but their bank accounts aren’t getting any bigger. Angel City FC might have sold for a quarter of a billion dollars last year, but the average NWSL salary is $117,000 (compared to $594,390 for the MLS). Although valuations are soaring, the average WNBA franchise only earned $13.2 million in revenue in 2023, while the average NWSL team brought in $15.4 million in 2024. Almost all of these teams still operate at a loss, and no franchise is close to cracking the world’s 100 most valuable, all of which are worth $2 billion or more.

In the past, you could point to a lack of broadcast deals as hindering the growth of women’s sports, but this accessibility problem has mostly been solved. Yes, you might need a variety of subscriptions to make it happen, but today, for the first time in history, a majority of women’s sports events are just a few clicks away—the same as men’s sports.

So if the investment is there, the games are available and women’s sports have never been more popular—why are athletes still struggling? Why aren’t more franchises profitable? What’s actually stopping us from unlocking this space?

The answer, to me, is media.

Today, women’s sports are still reliant on a media ecosystem built around and for men’s sports. Leagues like the WNBA and the NWSL need these media partners to broadcast their games. The problem is they are never these platforms’ main priority. So even as they’re smashing viewership records, women’s sports are still fighting for scraps when it comes to coverage, promotion and shoulder programming.

Many of these platforms use a sub-brand to cover women’s sports, itself an implicit confession that their flagship IP will always prioritize men’s. These sub-brands are essentially side projects, run by talented people with good intentions, but never given the actual resources to thrive.

This “sub-branding” of women’s sports points to a larger problem when it comes to coverage. People assume that as women’s sports grow, they’ll earn more coverage from legacy outlets—that it’s simply a matter of extending what they’re already doing to include women’s leagues. In theory, these platforms could cover women’s sports. But in practice, doing so would put them in conflict with their core business, which is, and will continue to be, men’s sports.

The hard truth is that it doesn’t matter what viewership records the WNBA or NWSL break. The broadcast platforms they partner with have significantly larger deals with men’s leagues like the NFL and NBA, and so that’s where they’re going to focus their resources, because they need to make the most of those rights.

This content outside the games isn’t just important for driving tune-in. It’s what creates the immersive world of sports, giving fans common touchpoints and conversations to join at any time.

The NFL season has been over for weeks, but the NFL is still the talk of the sports world thanks to the relentless media coverage of free agency and the draft. Compare the sheer number of shows, podcasts, newsletters and social posts dedicated to NFL free agency vs. the NWSL season—which just kicked off—and you’ll start to get an idea of how large the coverage gap is.

This lack of coverage and content outside of the games is what allowed us to launch and grow Just Women’s Sports (JWS) from a single Instagram account to a multi-platform brand reaching 105 million fans a month. Our mission is to make women’s sports huge. And our belief is that in order for that to happen, they need their own media ecosystem. They need platforms, personalities and programs whose No. 1 priority is women’s sports. Not just a few times a year—but every single day.

The WNBA’s media rights deal runs through 2036, the NWSL’s through 2027. Women’s March Madness rights, sold as part of a package deal, run through 2032.

Two things can be true at once: These deals are a significant source of revenue, but leagues can’t rely only on their broadcast partners to provide the comprehensive coverage that will transform women’s sports from a series of isolated events into 24/7, year-round entertainment.

We have to look elsewhere to build an ecosystem where the lights never turn off, where coverage doesn’t stop after the final whistle, where highlights, analysis and storytelling are available every day, and where fans don’t just tune in to the occasional event—they engage and connect in real-time, around-the-clock.

Without such a media ecosystem, women’s sports will stay stuck where they currently are, with only a handful of prominent athletes breaking through, while the rest struggle to pay their bills.

Right now, we have momentum. Investors see the potential. The games are available, and millions of fans are tuning in. But this isn’t the finish line. It’s just the beginning.

We’ve seized the spotlight. Now we have to build the world.



(This article has been corrected in the sixth paragraph to note that the average NWSL salary is $117,000. A previous version reported $56,000, which is the league minimum.)

https://indiewire.com,How Gunnar Hall Jensen Found the Guts to Complete His Film About His Son After the Young Man’s Death (EXCLUSIVE),https://variety.com/2025/film/global/gunnar-hall-jensen-son-death-1236344786/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:27:41 GMT","Norwegian director Gunnar Hall Jensen has made a trademark of his playful and quirky self-portraits in which his reflections on life often find a universal echo. His latest film, “Portrait of a Confused Father,” set out to explore his relationship with his son, drawing on footage filmed over 20 years. Three weeks before filming was to have wrapped, he heard that his son had been killed.

Hall Jensen speaks to Variety about how he found the courage to complete his film amid his and his family’s immense grief. The trailer to the film, which has its world premiere Sunday at CPH:DOX, debuts below.

The highly personal documentary is a heartfelt and raw story of a middle-aged control-freak father, who struggles to connect with his defiant son. It’s a story of love, of the difficulty and beauty of parenthood, but also of loss.

We see Gunnar – the filmmaker/protagonist – who does his utmost to connect with his beloved rebellious only son, while navigating his own traditional and slightly outdated concepts of masculinity. As Jonathan turns into a defiant self-confident young man, testing his own limits, Gunnar gets confused, like any parent with kids from Gen Z would, but also because Gunnar’s own father – a captain on a cruise ship in the Caribbean – was never there for him.

Popular on Variety

Then when Jonathan turns 18, things go south. The young man disappears for weeks, after having emptied his saving accounts. When Gunnar finally finds him, Jonathan is living a completely different life in Brazil with a male social media influencer with over 10 million followers. Drawn by the promise of easy money and a world of hyper masculinity, Jonathan starts to lose control. One day, Gunnar gets a phone call that will change his and his family’s lives forever. Jonathan, at the age of 21, has been fatally attacked. A period of grief, and reconstruction follows, as Gunnar – who had separated from Jonathan’s mom – gets back together with her.

Speaking to Variety about his experience, Hall Jensen says: “Three weeks before filming was completed [in November 2023] I got the message parents fear the most: Jonathan – 21 years old – was killed. After the shocking news, I really just wanted to die myself. It was too much. Jonathan’s beautiful nature had been cut, taken out of the world at a young age.

“Something in me had been broken that could not be fixed. I know most parents that lose a child feel that way. But paradoxically one keeps on breathing. And after the first months of logistics from hell, I clearly saw that the film had to be completed, with the horror of my son’s death included. I saw it as a duty towards Jonathan, and also as a duty towards the audience out there.

“Firstly, it is representative of the love between a son and a father, how difficult and rewarding it can be.

“Secondly, I also saw the film as a relevant representation of the times we’re living in and the [inherent] dangers. How easy it is for a young man to get lost in today’s chaotic world with twisted ideas of how to succeed and become rich, promoted problematically by today’s gurus, coaches, influencers on the internet.

“Thirdly, we have an overload of books and films around mother/daughter relationships, but very few authentic stories about fathers and sons.”

To complete the film, going through the footage of his son was very hard, says Hall Jensen, and it involved “a lot of tears and agony.” However, the filmmaker developed a method.

“Daytime, going through the material, I shut off my emotions as a father as much as possible. I observed the material as a filmmaker. I forced myself to be professional telling a story in the best way possible. Then, in the evening, I took a couple of glasses of wine, and broke down. All the beautiful memories I had seen during the day hit me hard. It was meltdown! My wife often found me in the home office crying, helpless in the dark. She wondered why I did this to myself.”

Two people were crucial in helping Hall Jensen structure his narrative and find the right tone: his long-time editor Erlend Haarr Eriksson, and BBC Storyville’s commissioning editor Lucie Kon, who had boarded the project at an early stage via the film’s sales agent DR Sales.

“Lucy had bought a personal film about a father and son trying to connect. Then after the tragedy, I decided to move on with the film and to include the tragedy and what led to it. Lucie stayed on board, full on,” Hall Jensen says. “It was hard for me to change the film from an artistically playful and light-footed documentary into a more explanatory work, but Lucy helped a lot, both in taking out scenes that now seemed irrelevant, with sharpening the story in a more explanatory way and with going heavily into the voice-over narration. I am deeply grateful to her. She helped lift the film to a level I could not have done myself.”

One of the challenges in the script, was to decide when to announce the shocking news to the audience. Hall Jensen says long discussions on the subject were had with Haarr Eriksson and Kon. There were two choices, says the director: either he would tell the tragedy as the story unfolds, chronologically, or he would do this at the beginning, an option he went for. Not only was that the natural way to tell the story from his perspective as a narrator, aware of the tragic events, but that was also a way to grab the audience’s attention, hence his decision as well to insert reminders of the tragedy through the voice over at various intervals. That said, as the director points out, the film is “in no way some kind of true crime story” as it’s first and foremost “a story about a father and son, trying to connect.”

“Being a decent father is a tough ride,” says Hall Jensen, who recalls his son as “an unstoppable force of nature.” “I don’t have solutions, but I hope this father and son story will resonate with the audience. I also wish to warn other parents of the dangers of the internet, and the need to monitor children and teenagers,” he adds.

Kim Christiansen, executive producer, in charge of documentaries and co-production at DR Sales, praises Hall Jensen’s achievement. “It’s incredible how Gunnar has managed to complete the film and we’re extremely proud to present ‘Portrait of a Confused Father’ for both the industry and especially the audience at the world premiere at CPH:DOX. Despite the tragic outcome, it is important to state that this is the most beautiful father and son love story I have ever came across, in any genre.”

The film is produced by Norway’s top banner Upnorth Film, credited for Hall Jensen’s previous film “Oh, It Hertz!“ (CPH:DOX, 2021), Håvard Bustnes’ festival hits “Phantoms of the Sierra Madre,” and “Two Raging Grannies.”

The film is produced by Ingrid Aune Falch, Christian Aune Falch and Torstein Parelius at UpNorth Film, and is being co-produced by Valérie Montmartin and Anders Justin for France’s Little Big Story and Sweden’s Film Väsernorrland, with Kon at BBC Storyville. Jan Rofekamp and Freddy Neumann serve as executive producers.

Following its screenings at CPH:DOX, the documentary will be released theatrically by Norsk Filmdistribusjon in Norway in August 2025 before a TV launch on NRK in Norway, Yle in Finland, DR in Denmark, SVT in Sweden, RTS in Switzerland, BBC in the U.K. and France Télévisions.",indiewire

https://indiewire.com,"Paramount-Skydance Deal And Other Mergers Could Be Blocked Over DEI Policies, FCC Chief Brendan Carr Says",https://deadline.com/2025/03/paramount-skydance-merger-fcc-brendan-carr-dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-1236346715/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:26:47 GMT","Paramount Global, Verizon and any other companies trying to gain the government’s blessing for mergers should eliminate policies aimed at promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.

That was the blunt message from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr in an interview with Bloomberg.

“Any businesses that are looking for FCC approval, I would encourage them to get busy ending any sort of their invidious forms of DEI discrimination,” Carr told the news outlet Friday.

Carr said the commission’s review of deals would include looking for “illegal” DEI policies. That stance is consistent with the Donald Trump Administration’s broader efforts to stamp out DEI (which the president even blamed, without proof, for causing a fatal plane crash in Washington, D.C. in January),

Watch on Deadline

Already, a number of media companies have been rolling back DEI efforts they had scaled up in recent years, especially in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in 2020. Paramount last month joined the list, with its Co-CEOs telling employees that the company would no longer measure “success in progress on companywide DEI initiatives, including aspirational representation goals.”

Under the law, Carr said, the FCC can only “move forward and approve a transaction if we find that doing so serves the public interest,” Carr said. ““If there’s businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don’t see a path forward where the FCC could reach the conclusion that approving the transaction is going to be in the public interest.”

Last summer, Paramount announced a long-in-the-works $8 billion deal to combine with Skydance Media, telling investors it expected to close the transaction by the end of June. The FCC, which is evaluating the deal because it involves the transfer of broadcast licenses, has already seized on the actions of CBS News and 60 Minutes. After a conservative group filed a “news distortion” complaint about varying edits of an interview of former Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, Carr has said the matter would factor into the merger review.

Trump, meanwhile, has sued Paramount and CBS News over the interview edits. The $20 billion complaint, filed in Texas, says the interview was shaped in a way that cost traffic and viewership to the president’s Trump Media and Technology Group, which includes social media platform Truth Social.

Lawyers for CBS and Paramount earlier this month filed a motion to dismiss the suit, calling it an “affront to the First Amendment.” Just as Disney opted to pay a $15 million settlement over a Trump claim against ABC News rather than risk further Trump-led scrutiny, Paramount has held internal discussions about settling the Harris interview suit. A payout, though, could simultaneously ease the regulatory path for the merger and alienate a large swath of staffers in the news division, leaving a reputational stain.

Mayans MC showrunner Elgin James is writing this new Prison Break, and will executive-produce alongside Prison Break creator Paul Scheuring and the original series’ executive producers Dawn Olmstead, Marty Adelstein and Neal Moritz. Specific plot details have yet to be disclosed, but the project will tell a new story set in the same universe as the original series.

Previously, TVLine confirmed that Drake Rodger (The Winchesters) will play Tommy, an inmate at one of the deadliest prisons in America, who has already served 10 years; Aussie Emily Browning (American Gods, The Affair) will fill the role of Cassidy, an ex-soldier turned corrections officer who takes a job at the aforementioned, co-ed prison; and Lukas Gage (YOU, Dead Boy Detectives) will play Jackson, a politician from a well-to-do background who’s in the midst of his first congressional campaign.

Newer to the mix, reported on March 21 by sister site Deadline, are Clayton Cardenas (Mayans MC) as “Ghost,” a ruthlessly dangerous inmate; JR Bourne (Mayans MC, Teen Wolf) as Junior, a mentally unstable, lone survivor of a decades-old prison break; Georgie Flores (Famous in Love) as Andrea, a Corrections Officer-in-training; and Myles Bullock (Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist, BMF) as Red, a “shot caller” convict.

The made-for-Hulu reboot, announced in mid-December, is also expected to cast the series regular role of a very pregnant inmate whose baby daddy is locked up just a floor away.

Fox’s Prison Break originally ran for four seasons from August 2005 to May 2009 (The Final Break wrap-up movie included), and then returned with a nine-episode revival run in Spring 2017. Yet whereas that fifth season on Fox brought back series leads Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell and Sarah Wayne Callies, among others, the prospective Hulu series is not expected to do the same.",indiewire

According to the medical examiner’s report obtained by Us Weekly, Plaza, 40, said she had a friend check on Baena’s well-being in October 2024, one month after they quietly separated. (Plaza confirmed to the examiner that she and Baena separated in September 2024.)

“Baena made concerning remarks … which prompted her to call a friend to perform a welfare check on her husband,” the report read. “Baena had been attending therapy since that event.”

The report also stated that Plaza had been in contact with Baena on the day of his death, as he sent her a text message that morning.

I could write more. I should,” Perry, 40, wrote via Instagram on Wednesday, January 8. “But Jeff wouldn’t write that much: he’d want a […]

News broke in January that Baena died by suicide after he was found unconscious inside his Los Angeles home. Baena’s dog walker discovered his body, per the medical examiner’s report. He was 47 years old.

“This is an unimaginable tragedy,” a spokesperson for Plaza told Us in a statement that month. “We are deeply grateful to everyone who has offered support. Please respect our privacy during this time.”

Plaza and Baena dated for nearly a decade before tying the knot in 2020. While the actress has not further addressed Baena’s death or their split, she seemingly paid homage to her late husband during an appearance at the SNL 50 anniversary special. For the occasion, Plaza donned a tie-dye T-shirt — which Baena had an affinity for — underneath her blazer.

During a December 2021 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Plaza recalled how she and Baena spent their quarantine together and detailed their impromptu decision to tie the knot.

“We got a little bored one night. We got married and I’ll tell you how: Onehourmarriage.com. That’s real, look it up,” Plaza said at the time. “We were in the lockdown. Things got a little crazy, especially in my house. My husband got really into tie-dying and when I say tie-dying, I mean 50 shirts a day.”

The ceremony took place in her and Baena’s backyard.

“I created a very quick love altar in our yard. Facts of our love, little stones, smoke, fire. Things of that nature,” the Parks and Recreation alum explained. “Then the man from Alhambra showed up in a Hawaiian shirt with a briefcase [to perform the ceremony]. … I can’t remember a lot of it, it was fuzzy. But I’m pretty sure it’s legal.”

https://usmagazine.com,"TV Stars Who Made $1 Million an Episode: Jennifer Aniston, More",https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/tv-stars-who-made-1-million-an-episode-jennifer-aniston-more/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:33:07 GMT","The casts of Friends, Sex and the City and Two and a Half Men changed the game for TV stars by making more than $1 million per episode of their classic shows.

While TV was once seen as second-rate in comparison to Hollywood blockbusters, the 1990s changed everything with the dawn of mega-sitcoms that commanded huge price tags for their A-list stars.

The rise of streaming has only bolstered budgets for TV, meaning stars such as Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are making record-breaking fees for their latest projects.

Keep scrolling for a look at some of the highest-paid actors in the TV history, including plenty of surprises:

Related: ‘Sex and the City’ Drama Through the Years: A Timeline Just as Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte had their adventures, the cast of Sex and the City have been on what seems like a roller coaster since the show began in 1999. After running for six seasons, the HBO series wrapped in 2004. The costars went on to reprise their roles four years later: Sarah […]

Sex and the City

Sarah Jessica Parker’s promotion to executive producer of Sex and the City, as well as being its lead star, for the final three seasons boosted her salary significantly. Reports suggest that HBO was paying SJP over $3 million per episode by the time Sex and the City ended.

The money kept rolling in as SATC was turned into a movie franchise, with Parker reportedly earning $15 million for the first film and $20 million for the sequel. When Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis returned for the sequel show And Just Like That…, they earned $10 million each for a 10-episode season.

Sex and the City executive producer Michael Patrick King spoke on the “Origins” podcast in 2018 about the way Parker’s star-power was crucial to the show’s success.

“The show doesn’t exist if Sarah Jessica wasn’t the blonde star of the show, that’s No. 1,” he said. “Kim [Cattrall] was not at the height of her career, Kristin was under her in terms of notability, Cynthia was a theater actress — and their contracts reflected that status.”

The producer went on, “As the show progressed, the characters, everybody grew, it became a family. Kristin, Cynthia and Sarah Jessica became one group, and Kim never joined mentally. Kristin and Cynthia went in the light, they became those two ladies, they understood it was Sarah Jessica’s name, look at the posters.”

The Morning Show

Former Friends costars Aniston and Witherspoon (in case you forgot, Witherspoon played the sister of Aniston’s Rachel!) reunited in 2019 for Apple TV+’s signature drama series The Morning Show, in which they played feuding coanchors on a news show.

It was reported in 2019 Apple was spending $15 million per episode as part of an overall $300 million deal to produce the first two seasons. Aniston and Witherspoon earned $2 million each per episode, for both starring in and executive producing The Morning Show.

Apple’s huge spending on The Morning Show paid off as it received 27 Emmy Award nominations and became the streamer’s second-most-watched series, behind Ted Lasso. It’s no surprise that Apple repeatedly renewed The Morning Show, with a fourth season now in the works.

Witherspoon told The Hollywood Reporter that she was perplexed by the backlash to her and Aniston’s Morning Show paychecks.

“There seemed to be a resentment, as if we weren’t worth it or it was bothersome, and I thought, ‘Why is that bothersome?’” she recalled.

Witherspoon continued, “I guarantee these companies are real smart, and if they agree to pay us, they’re doing it for a reason. They probably had a lot of lawyers and a lot of business people decide on that number because they knew that they were going to make more than that back. Does it bother people when Kobe Bryant or LeBron James make their contract?”

Two and a Half Men

Charlie Sheen’s hefty $2 million-per episode contract for CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men made it all the more shocking when he went to war with the series’ cocreator, Chuck Lorre, in 2011.

Sheen stopped showing up to work and then publicly demanded a 50% raise, so Lorre and CBS responded by firing him and banning him from entering the production lot where Two and a Half Men filmed. ​​Ashton Kutcher was hired to replace Sheen for Two and a Half Men’s remaining four seasons.

Sheen admitted to Deadline in 2023 that Two and a Half Men could have continued for another decade if he hadn’t “f—ed everything up.”

After the March 2025 premiere of Denise Richards and Her Wild Things, fans have been granted a rare look inside her family life and the friendships she continues to maintain.

“We could have done it as long as we wanted to,” he said. “So they say, don’t live in regret, but you have to honor it. You have to learn from it. Well…”

The actor admitted he “knew the rules” of starring in a sitcom from the outset but lost perspective as Two and a Half Men became more successful.

“It’s like we practice all week and then Friday night was game night and you got to play for the name on the front of the jersey, not the back,” he noted. “And then, somewhere along the way, I decided that the rules no longer applied to me. And that was not fair to the system that was in place.”

Everybody Loves Raymond

When Everybody Loves Raymond aired its last two seasons between 2003 and 2005, Ray Romano became the highest-paid actor on TV with a salary of $1.8 million per episode, or nearly $40 million per season. Romano topped the previous record-holder, Kelsey Grammer, making $1.6 million per episode for Frasier.

Romano proved his dedication to his work by foregoing a large fee when he joined Parenthood in its fourth season in 2012. The actor told TV Insider that he offered to take less money just because he loved the NBC family drama.

“I was a big fan of Parenthood and I actually asked to be on it,” he said. “I knew [producer Jason Katims], and after the season 3 finale, I emailed him and said, ‘Congrats.’ Joking I said, ‘Hey, Men of a Certain Age has just gotten canceled… I’m available.’ And he emailed me back and said, ‘We could never afford you.’ I said to him, ‘Yes, you can. Whatever my agent tells you, you come to me. I will make sure you can afford it.’

He added, “My agent called me a week later [saying], ‘Did you tell Jason Katims you would work for less money?’ And I go, ‘Yes, I did.’ I wasn’t doing it for the money at that time. I was doing it because I was a fan and [I wanted the] experience. And it was a great experience.”

Frasier

Grammer was once the highest-paid actor on TV by commanding a $1.6 million-per episode contract for Cheers spinoff Frasier. The episodic sum grew to around $2 million for the short-lived revival of Frasier on Paramount+ in 2023.

Grammer expressed hope in a 2024 Toronto Star interview that the new Frasier would last at least a decade.

“That’s sort of a knock-on-wood statement, I suppose,” he admitted.

Unfortunately for Grammer, Paramount canceled the Frasier revival in January 2025. He has since campaigned for another streaming service to save the show.

“There’s a better home for it,” Grammer told The New York Post in March 2025. “I think they gave it sort of a good try, but they weren’t particularly passionate about the project. I mean, obviously, they didn’t really promote or spend much time on it.”

The Terminal List

Chris Pratt isn’t only raking in cash from his leading roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Super Mario franchises. Pratt is also receiving an impressive pay check for his Prime Video streaming series The Terminal List.

Variety reported in August 2021 that Pratt was earning a jaw-dropping $1.4 million for every episode of the action thriller series.

Based on Jack Carr’s 2018 novel of the same name, The Terminal List casts Pratt as a former Navy SEAL who returns home from war with conflicting memories about the deaths of his platoon. The Terminal List ranked on Prime Video’s Top 10 list of its streaming content within two weeks of release.

Amazon has doubled down on its investment in The Terminal List by renewing it for a second season in February 2023 and commissioning a prequel series based around Taylor Kitsch’s character.

Home Improvement

Tim Allen made $1.25 million for playing Tim “The Tool Man” Taylor in Home Improvement’s final season, but it was his lofty salary that ultimately contributed to the show ending.

Allen’s costar Patricia Richardson revealed to The Los Angeles Times in 2024 that she caught wind of ABC offering to pay him $2 million per episode to return for a ninth season, which was double what they offered her.

Richardson admitted she was ready for Home Improvement to end, so she forced ABC ‘s hand by demanding the same money as Allen to return.

“I knew that Disney would in no way pay me that much. That was my way to say ‘no’ and was a little bit of a flip-off to Disney,” she said. “I’d been there all this time, and they never even paid me a third of what Tim was making, and I was working my ass off. I was a big reason why women were watching.”

ABC declined to meet Richardson’s pay demands and Home Improvement ended in 1999.

Seinfeld

Jerry Seinfeld was one of the few TV stars to walk away from a hit show at the peak of its success, after making $1 million an episode.

Seinfeld told The Howard Stern Show in 2013 that NBC was so desperate for him to return for a 10th season that he was offered $110 million.

“I could have got more than that,” he admitted, adding: “To be honest … the love affair between the people that were making the show and the audience was so intense, it was so white hot, I had to respect that.”

“I could not go to that point where it starts to age and wither, and it doesn’t take long,” he acknowledged.

Seinfeld’s final episode, “The Finale,” was watched by a staggering 75 million viewers May 14, 1998.

Friends

Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer each were paid $1 million an episode for the final two seasons of Friends between 2002 and 2004.

The six core Friends cast members negotiated with NBC as a united front so they’d all get paid the same wages, thus eliminating any potential jealousy from spreading within the group.

Related: 'Friends' Most Memorable Guest Stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer rose to massive fame during Friends, which aired on NBC for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004. From the start, the sitcom drew the attention of celebrities — and landed some huge guest stars. In the first season, both George Clooney and […]

During an appearance on The Howard Stern Show in 2021, Aniston argued that the cast should have been paid the same because they were “all doing the exact same amount of work.”

“We all felt that way. I thought it was the most important thing — as we all did — that we all were equal in every single way,” Cox agreed. “That was the first time that people had all stuck together in a cast. I think it was scary, probably, for productions after that.”

The Big Bang Theory

Like the Friends cast before them, Big Bang’s Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco negotiated together in 2014 to make $1 million per half-hour episode for seasons 8 through 10.

When it came time for the trio to re-up with CBS in 2017, the stars and castmates Kunal Nayyar and Simon Helberg all agreed to take $100,000 salary cuts per episode so their costars Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch could get substantial raises.

Parsons opted to leave The Big Bang Theory in 2018, with costar Galecki admitting the rest of the cast felt “blindsided” by the news.

“I was shocked. We were just blindsided that day,” Galecki said. “And not necessarily shocked by Jim’s decision, but that he hadn’t had that conversation with his castmates first to prepare us. So yes, it could have been handled better. We’re a family; have a conversation. And I don’t even disagree with how Jim felt, because in many ways, I felt the same way. I just disagreed with how it was managed.”

While The Big Bang Theory ended in 2019, the franchise has lived on with prequel Young Sheldon and its spinoff Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage, as well as an upcoming companion show Stuart Fails to Save the Universe with BBT cast members Kevin Sussman, Lauren Lapkus and Brian Posehn returning.

Ted Lasso

It was reported in 2021 that Sudeikis negotiated a major pay increase, to $1 million per episode, for the third season of Apple TV+’s sports comedy Ted Lasso.

Ted Lasso season 3 was originally supposed to be the end for the Emmy-winning comedy, but Sudeikis confirmed on the “New Heights” podcast in March 2025 that the show would return.

“We’re writing season 4 now. That’s the word,” he revealed to host Travis Kelce.

Sudeikis then teased, “Ted’s coaching a women’s team. So there, that’s [happening].”

Matt Chernis, Apple TV+’s head of programming, subsequently announced, “Ted Lasso has been nothing short of a juggernaut, inspiring a passionate fanbase all over the world, and delivering endless joy and laughter, all while spreading kindness, compassion and unwavering belief. Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show.”",usmagazine

“I didn’t really grow up with him but when I moved out to L.A. he let me live with him for a year and we got to know each other a little then,” Cole, 49, shared in an October 2021 interview with Cowboys & Indians magazine.

Cole’s parents divorced when he was young and at “about 9 or 10 years old,” the actor saw his father on TV.

“I didn’t know he was my dad. I waited for the finish of the film, and I saw Wings Hauser [in the credits],” he recalled. “So, I went into my mom’s room, and I said, ‘Hey mom. I just saw a guy on TV, his name’s Wings Hauser.’ And she looked at me and went: ‘Wow!’ And I said, ‘Yeah, I saw this guy.’ And she goes, ‘Yeah, well, let’s talk about that.’ She explained to me who he was, and that’s how I found out about my dad.”

Cole said his dad was a “huge fan” of Yellowstone. (Cole has played Rip Wheeler on the Paramount Network series from its debut in 2018.)

“[He’s] obviously very proud of what I’ve done in it,” Cole continued. “He’s an old cowboy, after all. Our family, the Hauser side of the family, are all Montanans. So, it’s very close to him. We have family in Helena and Livingstone and all over the state.”

Cole’s quotes are being shared on social media following the news that Wings died on Saturday, March 15, at age 78. His wife, Cali Lili Hauser, announced the news in a social media statement five days later.

He died from natural causes, Cali confirmed to Variety. (Cole has yet to publicly react to the news of his father’s death.)

Wings was known for his various television roles, including playing Greg Foster on The Young and the Restless in 1977 before returning in 2010. He had several film credits, including Ramrod in 1982’s Vice Squad, Tough Guys Don’t Dance and The Insider.",usmagazine
https://usmagazine.com,3 Underrated Netflix Shows to Watch This Weekend (March 21-23),https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/3-underrated-netflix-shows-to-watch-this-weekend-march-21-23-2025/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:00:59 GMT","The most popular show on Netflix right now isn’t the latest season of Love Is Blind or yet another salacious true crime documentary — it’s a series about a baby-faced teenage murderer. Adolescence is an unexpected hit with audiences and critics alike, with some believing it could be the Baby Reindeer of 2025.

Adolescence isn’t for everyone, though, but fortunately for you, Netflix has tons of underrated shows to choose from. From costume dramas like Bridgerton to disturbing sci-fi tales like Dark, the streamer has a little something for everyone.

This weekend, treat yourself to a lavish remake of a classic 1963 movie, one of the best crime shows on TV right now, and an under-the-radar show about life after the world as we know has ended.

‘The Leopard’ (2025)

It’s hard to believe a big-budget show based on a classic movie qualifies as underrated, but The Leopard has been oddly ignored by audiences and most critics since it premiered earlier this month. That’s an injustice, since the six-episode series is a feast for the eyes and ears as it faithfully recreates a 19th-century Sicily that’s on the cusp of a revolution.

You could go to the movies to see Mickey 17, Robert Pattinson’s wild new sci-fi film from Parasite director Bong Joon-ho. Or maybe you’re in the mood for a cool, sexy spy thriller like Black Bag starring Michael […]

The show focuses on one aristocratic family and, in particular, Don Fabrizio Corbera (Kim Rossi Stuart). He’s the elder patriarch who wields massive social and political influence in his hometown of Salina. But as Sicily’s old ways disappear and a new social order emerges, Don Fabrizio realizes he has to make some sacrifices for his family to survive. Will he do what it takes to ensure his daughters will have all the comforts they’ve been accustomed to in life even if it means breaking one of their hearts?

The Leopard is streaming on Netflix.

‘Dark Winds’ (2021-Present)

Dark Winds recently returned for its third season, and the show scored its best ratings yet. Now is as good a time as any to catch up on its terrific first two seasons that originally aired on AMC and are now available to stream on Netflix.

Based on Tony Hillerman’s Leaphorn & Chee novels, Dark Winds stars Zahn McClarnon as Joe Leaphorn, a veteran police lieutenant working in the Four Corners area of the American Southwest during the 1970s. Assisted by FBI agent Jim Chee (Kiowa Gordon) and deputy sergeant Bernadette Manuelito (Jessica Matten), Joe investigates various crimes like a mysterious armored robbery via a helicopter and the brutal murder of a cult member.

Dark Winds is unique in that the majority of its cast are Native American, and the series delves extensively into Native American customs and rituals that are pivotal to the plots and characters. That’s still rare to see on TV nowadays, but Dark Winds is also just a damn good police procedural with a lead protagonist who is always fascinating to watch. After you’ve binged the first two seasons, head over to AMC+ and watch the third season as soon as you can.

Dark Winds is streaming on Netflix.

‘The Rain’ (2018-2020)

It seems like there’s a new postapocalyptic show debuting each week, but most of them aren’t as unique as The Rain. While it’s true the series has your standard “the world is ending” plot, how it sets up its apocalypse — and how its survivors deal with the fallout — is what makes it so watchable.

As a deadly virus spreads around the world via rainfall, scientist Frederick Anderson (Lars Simonsen) hides his two children, Simone (Alba August) and Rasmus (Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen), in a bunker to save them. Six years later, they emerge determined to find out what happened to their dad. But the virus is still present, and the two siblings will have to team up with other survivors to find their missing father.

The Rain takes place in Scandinavia, so expect a lot of lush green forests and beautiful scenery. The plot is intriguing enough for you to watch all of its three seasons, and the show’s depiction of its post-pandemic world has some interesting parallels to life immediately after COVID-19. If you’re looking for an end-of-the-world story told from a fresh perspective with talented newcomers, then The Rain is for you.

Baldoni, 41, and publicist Jennifer Abel, who used to work for Jones’ company, Jonesworks PR, have accused Jones of taking Abel’s work phone and handing it over to Lively and her team, who allegedly mined the phone for text messages to take out of context in an effort to make it appear that Baldoni’s side was building a smear campaign against her.

That so-called smear campaign became a major part of Lively’s original suit against Baldoni in December 2024, in which she also accused her It Ends With Us costar and director of harassment.

Baldoni and Lively, 37, have gone back and forth since, with Baldoni also suing Lively and The New York Times for defamation, seeking $400 million.

Over the summer, reports of tension between It Ends With Us lead Blake Lively and her director and costar, Justin Baldoni, dominated headlines as they promoted the project. Then, in late December 2024, Lively filed a bombshell legal complaint in California claiming Baldoni had […]

“It is undeniable that Stephanie Jones initiated this catastrophic sequence of events by violating the most basic of privacy rights, as well as any remaining trust her clients held,” Baldoni’s attorney Bryan Freedman said in a statement to Us Weekly. “No stranger to stirring up crisis scenarios for departing clients, Ms. Jones maliciously turned over communications from the phone she wrongfully took from her own partner to her cohort Leslie Sloane, immediately after Jones was terminated for cause by Wayfarer due to her own wrongful behavior.”

“Stephanie Jones, founder of Jonesworks, has a well-documented history of highly questionable conduct in the workplace, which the Lively parties would have seen with even the smallest amount of online research, yet they walked right into Ms. Jones’ ploy of bitter revenge against her most-trusted employee at the expense of her own long-term client,” the statement continued. “We will not stop until our clients are cleared of all wrongdoing and compensated for the vast damages that they have incurred.”

Baldoni’s latest suit comes after Jones filed a lawsuit against Abel, Baldoni and others, accusing them of being the ones who orchestrated the alleged smear campaign. She also accused them of breach of contract and trying to steal her clients for themselves.

“Ms. Jones’ lawsuit is based entirely on facts and concrete evidence,” Kristin Tahler, a partner at Quinn Emmanuel and representative for Jones, said in a statement to Us. “That suit clearly shows that Jen Abel conspired with Melissa Nathan and others to steal reams of confidential documents, clients and staff and eventually attempt to destroy the business that Ms. Jones spent decades building.”

“Abel, Nathan, Baldoni and their co-defendants attempted to achieve these outcomes through bullying distortion and outright disparagement,” the statement continued. “These facts are backed up by dozens of messages provided in the suit we filed a month ago and cannot be credibly disputed. Having no facts or evidence, we see a familiar playbook — smear our client, culminating in the work of fiction masquerading as the counterclaims that were filed yesterday.”",usmagazine

It’s based upon one of the most popular Broadway musicals ever, and it’s a prequel to The Wizard of Oz, a perennial favorite across several generations. But Wicked outperformed all expectations with $739 million worldwide.

Crazy Rich Asians director Jon M. Chu brought together Tony Award-winning actress Cynthia Erivo and music sensation Ariana Grande to portray Wicked’s iconic duo, Elphaba Thropp and Galinda Upland, in the years before they became the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good, respectively.

But if you’ve been holding off on going to the theater, or just waiting to revisit the movie at home, it’s time to answer the question that brought you here.

Is ‘Wicked’ streaming yet?

Yes! Today is the day that Wicked is making its streaming premiere on Peacock’s premium tiers. Peacock is treating this as a major event, and going above and beyond what it normally does for new arrivals. The theatrical version of Wicked will be joined by a new sing-along version as well, if you just can’t resist belting out a few show tunes. There’s also bonus content on Peacock that would have ordinarily been saved for the Blu-ray and HD release.

Us Explains Universal Studios ; Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are the latest stars to step into the iconic roles of Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West, but how does their film adaptation of the Broadway musical Wicked connect to the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz? Even the OG […]

If you don’t have Peacock, and you’re willing to wait a few more months, Wicked will eventually show up on Amazon Prime Video. That’s part of an ongoing content-sharing deal between Universal Pictures and Amazon, which is why some of Universal’s most recent hits are streaming on Prime Video instead of on Peacock. Once Wicked heads to Prime Video, it will be removed from Peacock for the duration of its stay.

When will ‘Wicked: For Good’ be available to stream?

Because the Wicked musical was too long for a single movie, the second half of the story will unfold later this year in Wicked: For Good. That film has a November 21 release date, and it’s likely to be just as big in 2025 as its predecessor was last year.

But now that Universal and Peacock have set the timetable for the first Wicked’s streaming premiere, it seems likely that Wicked: For Good will be available to stream by this time next year.

Related: 'Wicked' Ends Awards Season With 2 Wins at 2025 Oscars The cast and crew of Wicked had a magical night at the 97th annual Academy Awards. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were among the many Wicked stars who celebrated the film’s 10 Oscar nominations at the Sunday, March 2, awards ceremony, which was held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Wicked tied with The […]

The only reason Universal would have to shrink the theatrical window between now and then is if Wicked: For Good bombed at the box office. Since that’s not likely to happen, put March 2026 down on your calendar. But don’t let that stop you from seeing it in theaters as well.

Bryan Freedman described the move as “abhorrent” and described it as “abusing the system” via a statement issued to Us Weekly on Thursday, March 20.

“Ms. Lively’s recent motion to dismiss herself from the self-concocted disaster she initiated is one of the most abhorrent examples of abusing our legal system,” he said via the statement. “Stringent rules are put into place to protect the innocent and allow individuals to rightfully defend themselves. Laws are not meant to be twisted and curated by privileged elites to fit their own personal agenda.”

He continued: “As we said yesterday in response to Mr. Reynolds’ same cowardly measures, we will continue to hold Ms. Lively accountable for her actions of pure malice which include falsely accusing my clients of harassment and retaliation. Her fantastical claims will be swiftly debunked as discovery moves forward, easily disproved with actual, evidentiary proof.”

A spokesperson for Lively slammed the statement when Us reached out for comment.

“The late night flurry of answers — instead of motions to dismiss — reveal that [Baldoni and Wayfarer defendants] know that they have no legal arguments remotely capable of dismissing our complaint,” Lively’s spokesperson told Us on Friday, March 21. “They have instead accepted that Ms. Lively’s complaint states valid legal claims that they could not muster a single reason to dismiss. Meanwhile, every person and entity the Baldoni-Wayfarer team sued has moved to dismiss their meritless PR stunt.”

Earlier on Thursday, Lively, 37, filed the motion to dismiss the lawsuit, according to documents seen by Us.

“This lawsuit is a profound abuse of the legal process that has no place in federal court. California law now expressly prohibits suing victims who make the decision to speak out against sexual harassment or retaliation, whether in a lawsuit or in the press,” Lively’s lawyers Mike Gottlieb and Esra Hudson told Us in a statement.

The statement continued, “This meritless and retaliatory lawsuit runs head first into three legal obstacles, including the litigation, fair report, and sexual harassment privileges, the latter of which contains a mandatory fee shifting provision that will require the likes of … Wayfarer Studios, and others that brought frivolous defamation claims against Ms. Lively to pay damages. In other words, in an epic self-own, the Wayfarer Parties’ attempt to sue Ms. Lively ‘into oblivion’ has only created more liability for them, and deservedly so, given what they have done.”

A spokesperson for Lively also told Us, “The painful reality is that Ms. Lively is not alone in being sued for defamation after speaking up about being sexually harassed at work. That is entirely why California recently enacted AB 933, the Privileged Communications Incident of Sexual Assault, Harassment, or Discrimination Act, which codified California civil code section 47.1. While Ms. Lively has suffered greatly by speaking up and pursuing legal claims, it is important for other people to know that they have protections, and that there is a specific law that expressly protects them from being silenced or financially ruined by a defamation lawsuit because they had the courage to speak up.”

Baldoni, 41, and Lively have been embroiled in controversy since they costarred in the film adaption of Colleen Hoover’s best selling novel, It Ends With Us.

Investigation Discovery’s Hollywood Demons special, which premieres Monday, March 24, features an update on where Collins, 77, is now after leaving Hollywood in disgrace.

“Stephen Collins now lives with a woman who is 40 years younger than him,” Dr. Drew Pinsky claimed in the special. “She was a super fan.”

Dr. Drew speculated on Collins’ relationship with Nagel, 37, adding, “The age difference — given what we know about his history — certainly raises an eyebrow. Let’s hope he can commit to this woman and not perpetrate on others.”

Related: Inside Stephen Collins‘ Child Sexual Abuse Drama — Including Where He Is Now Stephen Collins‘ child sexual abuse scandal ended his career but where is the 7th Heaven alum now? Collins was a household name for his role as Reverend Eric Camden on 7th Heaven. The show, which aired from 1996 to 2007, followed a minister and his wife as they dealt with the drama of raising seven […]

Collins did not participate in the ID special and producers reached out to “more than 100 contacts” of Collins’ and “nearly everyone declined to participate or did not respond.” (A producer in a voiceover claimed that only men agreed to speak with them about their experience with Collins.)

After his acting career came to an end, Collins was spotted on multiple occasions with Nagel, in Fairfield, Iowa, where they currently live. The couple, who the Daily Mail claimed got married in 2019, have been spotted attending twice-daily transcendental meditation sessions. The outlet also reported that Nagel posted about Collins’ hit show 7th Heaven years before they got together.

The actor became a household name after booking the role of Reverend Eric Camden on 7th Heaven, which ran from 1996 to 2007. Collins made headlines seven years after 7th Heaven ended when TMZ published an audio recording from a marriage counseling session with his then-wife, actress Faye Grant, where he admitted to sexually abusing three underage girls.

“I’m a flawed person,” Collins said in an interview with Katie Couric at the time. “In the church, it’s actually one of the things I love about the church … It’s really one of the main things about the Christian faith. Christ said in so many ways, ‘Bring me that … which about you is broken, bring it,’ and most people are broken in some way.”

Collins denied he was a “pedophile” before adding, “Most people get to, or have to, or choose to hide it. This came out. I didn’t choose this to come out. I didn’t want to have to deal with these things publicly. … I had dealt with them very, very strongly, and committedly, in my private life, but I think I’m a human being with flaws and I’ve done everything I can to address it.”

An investigation was launched in 2012 into the claims against Collins. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department later released a statement confirming they could not “substantiate the allegation” against Collins and no charges were brought against him.

Despite the 7th Heaven cast — including Jessica Biel and Beverley Mitchell — reuniting over the years, they haven’t been spotted with Collins. Catherine Hicks, who played his onscreen wife Annie, previously didn’t rule out a 7th Heaven reunion — under one condition.

“We would have to open with Stephen’s coffin,” she joked to TMZ in 2016. “It’s all up to the networks and those types of things. I think we’d all love to be together. 8th Heaven with a new boyfriend for Annie.”

Creator Brenda Hampton addressed Hicks’ comments about a reunion, telling Life & Style in 2017, “I would include him. I think all the actors would like to do a reunion show. It would be really fun!”

She continued: “I think Catherine was caught off guard and said something off the top of her head. [The scandal] is so personal, [it’s] none of my business.”

King and Newman got married in 2007, nearly 13 years before they went their separate ways. Us Weekly confirmed in May 2020 that the former Heart of Dixie actress filed for divorce and requested a temporary restraining order against Newman.

The TRO was ultimately partially granted after King accused Newman of abuse, who denied the allegations. King and Newman settled their divorce three years later and agreed to share custody of their sons, James and Leo. (Newman shares son Etienne and daughter Beatrix with wife Cyn, whom he married in 2023.)

News broke in March 2025 that Newman was granted sole physical custody of James and Leo after King allegedly failed to complete a six-month drug and alcohol rehabilitation program and a 26-week parenting course. While King has not addressed the allegations, court docs obtained by Us revealed that she is allowed supervised visits with her kids.

Related: Jaime King's Ex Kyle Given Sole Physical Custody of Sons Amid Rehab Order Jaime King’s custody agreement with ex-husband Kyle Newman has been changed after she allegedly didn’t complete a rehabilitation program. Newman, 49, has been awarded sole physical custody of their two sons, James, 11, and Leo, 9, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly on Monday, March 17. The boys will now primarily reside with […]

Keep scrolling for a timeline of King and Newman’s divorce:

May 2020

Along with her divorce petition, King asked the court for a temporary restraining order against Newman. She claimed that Newman had been aggressive and emotionally manipulative toward her, also alleging that he refused to let James and Leo speak to her when he took them to Pennsylvania. (A source told Us at the time that Newman traveled to the East Coast with the boys during the COVID-19 pandemic. King stayed back in Los Angeles.)

King also sought sole legal and physical custody of their sons, alleging that she felt Newman “systematically made [her] feel inadequate, insecure, unsafe and traumatized” during their marriage.

Newman denied the accusations in a statement.

“Kyle was deeply saddened by Jaime’s attempt to obtain court orders based solely on false claims without providing him any opportunity to respond,” a spokesperson for Newman told Us. “Kyle wants nothing but the best for his whole family and hopes that Jaime can find the peace and help she needs.”

King’s emergency motion was partially granted, so Newman couldn’t “be within 100 yards” of King. Her petition for sole custody was not immediately addressed.

September 2020

Newman filed new documents claiming that King “emptied and closed” their joint bank accounts. He asked that King pay for all of his legal fees, arguing that he’s a stay-at-home father and cannot easily cover the $150,000 costs already incurred.

Asking for financial reimbursement, Newman claimed that he was James and Leo’s primary caregiver because of King’s alleged history of substance abuse.

“Since the children’s birth‚ Jaime has rarely been alone with the children,” Newman claimed in the docs. “I do not recall her ever taking them anywhere by herself — there has always been a nanny, godparent‚ someone to supervise and help her. By 2015, it became evident to me that Jaime was not capable of taking care of the children — she simply did not have the faculties or ability to take care of them given her substance abuse issues.”

Newman also requested primary custody of James and Leo, which King shot down in her November filing. According to King, “the boys have experienced a great deal of trauma in the last seven months” because of the custody dispute. She further alleged that Newman wouldn’t let them FaceTime her, denying his claims of her apparent drug problem.

“In February of 2020, [Newman] attempted to wreak havoc with my professional life,” King wrote in her motion. “[He] called at least one of the executives on Black Summer after midnight demanding information about me. [He] had a third party call various people who worked on the show demanding that some action be taken before I ‘killed myself’ with drugs or alcohol. No one on set believed that I had an issue, because I did not (and do not.) In fact, I was on set on time every day, and always professional.”

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard finalized their divorce in 2017, but their relationship drama continued on with a nasty court battle after they’ve both accused each other of verbal and […]

September 2023

King and Newman reached a settlement three years later.

“It was an emotional day at the courthouse yesterday, as Jaime and Kyle sat down in a room and hammered out the details of their settlement, putting their two children first,” Newman’s lawyer, Garry M. Gekht, said in a statement to Us. “It was truly touching to see them get along again after years of acrimony — Jaime even joined Kyle to get coffee across the street from the courthouse as I was writing up the settlement agreement.”

April 2024

In April, King submitted an emergency request to stop paying Newman child and spousal support and claimed that she “lacks the ability to pay” the funds. She alleged that Newman has success as a filmmaker, game designer and writer to be able to support himself.

In response, Newman filed his own paperwork alleging that King had “been out of compliance with the court’s child and spousal support orders for well over a year.”

She is also asking […]

March 2025

New court documents confirmed that Newman was awarded sole custody of James and Leo after King allegedly had yet to complete a rehab and parenting program. He and King still have joint legal custody, though Newman has a “tie-breaking authority” on any disputes.

King, who has not publicly addressed the legal update, was further ordered to complete individual counseling and will be allowed to have supervised family visits on Tuesdays, Thursdays and alternating Sundays.

That same month, In Touch reported that Newman previously accused King of drinking and using drugs during one of her pregnancies in 2020 documents. At the time, King told a judge that she’d never had a substance abuse issue and called the claim “unfounded.”",usmagazine

“Hi, I’m Tracy Anderson, welcome to my actual kitchen,” Anderson, 50, said in a video uploaded to the Goop Instagram profile on Wednesday, March 19. “We have a Tracy Anderson Green Goddess Crunch Goop Salad coming to Goop Kitchen for you.”

Social media users have since focused on the “actual kitchen” comment, with some speculating if this was a reference to Meghan, 43, using a satellite kitchen when shooting her Netflix show With Love, Meghan. (Us Weekly has reached out to Goop for comment.)

“Omg, are Tracy Anderson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Goop making a not so subtle dig at Meghan for not filming in her actual kitchen?” one X user wondered, reposting the Instagram video. The post has since gone viral with various replies agreeing with the take, with others noting that fans of Meghan have been flooding the Goop video’s comments section.

Here’s everything we learned from binging the Duchess […]

Meghan has been vocal about filming her Netflix show, which premiered earlier this month, in a Montecito house down the street from where she and Prince Harry live with their two kids, Archie, 5, and Lilibet, 3.

“I wanted to protect that safe haven,” Meghan told People in an interview published on March 5. “We’re a close-knit family, and I love those moments — putting Lili down for a nap, having lunch together, having sacred time together at the end of the day.”

She added, “Our kitchen is where Mama just cooks for the family, and with a crew of 80-plus people, that’s a lot of people to have in your house!”

Us Weekly confirmed in January that Meghan had rented out a separate home to use as a filming space for the series, which has since been renewed for a second season.

After With Love, Meghan started streaming, Meghan announced her forthcoming lifestyle brand As Ever. Many internet users were quick to clock apparent comparisons between Meghan’s new business venture and Paltrow’s Goop.

Paltrow, however, is not bothered.

The Yellowjackets star, 45, is listing her home in the charming Los Angeles neighborhood of Silver Lake for $4.175 million, Us Weekly can confirm.

According to the listing created by Compass real estate agent Lorraine Getz, the “stunning architectural masterpiece is a showstopper” thanks to panoramic views and light-filled open floor plan.

As for why Ricci listed the property, a representative from listing agency Compass explained to Us that the actress is choosing to move because a family member lost their home in the Palisades fire. As a result, she’s looking for a bigger space as a relative moves in.

An extreme wind storm, caused by Santa Ana gusts, sparked fast-burning brush fires at around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, January 7, with drivers along Sunset Boulevard and Palisades Drive abandoning their cars to seek safety, according to the […]

Back on January 7, multiple fires began burning in Los Angeles County for weeks and forced thousands of residents to evacuate their homes. The deadly Eaton and Palisades fires were fully contained on January 31, but not before thousands of homeowners lost their properties or were displaced.

The next lucky buyer of Ricci’s property has many amenities and features to look forward to.

The three-bedroom, four-bathroom residence features a dream kitchen fit for a chef thanks to a sub-zero fridge, Miele appliances and a striking center island.

Guests who prefer to rest and relax will enjoy the living area anchored by a sleek fireplace and space for a big-screen TV.

Owners looking for some fresh air will also appreciate walls of sliding glass that lead to a private deck and a rooftop terrace.

Located on a quiet cul-de-sac, the private property includes an elegant pool and spa overlooking the city skyline.

As an added bonus, the listing states “every inch of this home has been curated with impeccable attention to detail, from the Spanish ‘Porcelanosa’ tile and Caesarstone countertops to the state-of-the-art smart home automation.”

“It’s funny, because I’m doing the audiobook and some chapters, I’m still crying,” Knowles, 71, told Us Weekly exclusively at Habitat for Humanity Los Angeles’ 2025 Builders Ball. “I’m like, ‘How many times am I going to read this and cry?’ I guess the answer is forever, because it’s my life. It’s my history.”

Tina — the mother of Beyoncé and Solange Knowles, whom she shares with ex-husband Mathew Knowles — will tell her story in Matriarch, out on April 22. She is also set to go on a pretty extensive tour to promote the book with “a few fabulous friends,” including Keke Palmer, Michelle Obama and Kelly Rowland, among others.

“I’m so blessed,” Tina told Us, noting that she hopes readers feel “a sense of community” when reading Matriarch.

“It’s all about that,” she continued. “Also, a big, big, big hope is that people will understand how important it is to look into your past, learn about your ancestors, and pass that history on to your children and your grandchildren. That’s what I’m hoping that will happen from this book.”

Tina teased these themes when she announced the memoir via social media in October 2024.

“I have always been a storyteller, and it’s something I learned from my mother. When I had a family of my own, I believed that my daughters needed to know where they came from in order to know where they were going,” she captioned her post at the time. “I’m now ready to share my story with all of you, so that we can all celebrate these themes of strength, motherhood, Black pride, and identity.”

Aside from her own tour to promote Matriarch, Tina is also gearing up for her daughter Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter tour, which kicks off next month as well. (Beyoncé released her Cowboy Carter record in March 2024.)

While there have been bright spots like Black Bag and Mickey 17, the overall movie slate these last few months just can’t compare with last year’s stellar lineup that included Dune: Part Two with Timothée Chalamet and Love Lies Bleeding with Kristen Stewart.

While there isn’t anything truly exciting in movie theaters at the moment, the same isn’t true for streaming. For example, Hulu has tons of interesting movies like A Real Pain with Kieran Culkin and Longlegs with Nicolas Cage.

Those movies are great, but chances are, you’ve probably watched them. The streamer also has hidden gems that are just waiting to be discovered. The following three movies are criminally underrated, and worth your time and attention this weekend.

‘The Forgiven’ (2021)

What would you do if you accidentally killed someone? The Forgiven asks this question right away, as married couple David and Jo Henninger (Ralph Fiennes and Jessica Chastain) hit a teenage boy while driving one night in Morocco. Since David was intoxicated while driving, the couple decide to lie and claim it was an accident and that the boy was at fault.

And so begins a descent into guilt and paranoia as the couple grapple with what they’ve done in different ways. Jo opts to attend parties held by the couple’s immoral friend Richard (Matt Smith) but David’s conscience begins to weigh on him. How long can he go without revealing the truth?

You could go to the movies to see Mickey 17, Robert Pattinson’s wild new sci-fi film from Parasite director Bong Joon-ho. Or maybe you’re in the mood for a cool, sexy spy thriller like Black Bag starring Michael […]

The Forgiven is one of those movies that makes the most of its tricky moral dilemma and doesn’t provide any easy answers. It’s great to see talented actors like Fiennes and Chastain embody characters with such sketchy morals. The Henningers aren’t the most empathetic people around, but they aren’t monsters, either. The film doesn’t ask you to take sides, but rather to empathize with everyone involved in an impossible situation.

The Forgiven is streaming on Hulu.

‘Joyride’ (2022)

12-year-old Mully (Charlie Reed) is upset with his father, who intends to use money donated by their fellow Irish citizens to pay off his debts rather than honor his late mother’s memory. Distraught, Mully steals the cash and jumps into a seemingly empty taxi. After he drives off, he is surprised to discover two passengers in the back: Joy (Olivia Colman), a forty-something lawyer, and her newborn baby.

Joyride has a ridiculous premise (what 12-year-old knows how to drive?) but it uses it as a foundation to tell a touching story between two lonely souls who are both running away from something. Joy isn’t so sure she’s the best person to raise a child while Mully doesn’t believe his father cares enough to raise him. The movie showcases how the two share their private fears and hopes while traveling across the gorgeous Irish countryside.

Joyride won’t win any awards, but it’s a solid drama that features another great performance by Colman. The movie’s ending is almost as unbelievable as its beginning, but by that point, you’ve grown too fond of the two lead characters to care all that much.

Joyride is streaming on Hulu.

‘Femme’ (2023)

Jules (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) is a successful London drag queen who is violently assaulted by a gang of street toughs one night. Months later, he encounters one of the men, Paul (George MacKay), at a gay sauna. When he realizes Paul doesn’t recognize him out of drag, Jules plots to exact revenge by filming them having sex and posting it on the internet. But as Jules begins to hang out more with Paul, the two men develop an intimate connection that threatens to derail Jules’ plan and expose Paul’s secret life.

But if you’re like Us and want to watch some quality movies from the comfort […]

Femme is an engrossing thriller that examines the lengths people will go to protect what’s most valuable to them. For Jules, it’s the comfort and power he had as a drag queen, something that Paul took away during the attack. For Paul, it’s hiding who he really is under a violent public persona he secretly abhors. Femme’s biggest strength is the superb acting by Stewart-Jarrett and MacKay, who provide depth and empathy to their complicated characters.

“I’ve already been on more dates with new people,” Mellencamp, 43, revealed on the Friday, March 21, episode of iHeartRadio’s “Diamonds in the Rough” podcast. “I went on a first date pre- the thing, and then I went on a second date yesterday actually. He’s really cute and nice.”

After Mellencamp shared a photo of the mystery man with her podcast cohost Erika Jayne, she provided more details about the potential suitor making her smile.

“He hasn’t asked me to have children yet, so we’re on the up and up,” she joked after sharing a story of a past date gone bad. “He’s 35. He works in events. Very kind.”

Mellencamp’s latest dating revelation quickly grabbed the attention of Jayne, 53, who had some follow-up questions.

“Is this OK? Are you OK? Did the doctors say you could date?” she asked. “I know they said you could ride horses. Is this right? What am I living through?”

After seeing a picture of Mellencamp’s new man, Jayne admitted that he was cute and wanted to know his intentions.

“Do I need to get on the phone with this fool?” she joked. “How about this? How about we just take it day by day?”

During the chat, Mellencamp gave thanks to Arroyave, 47, for continuing to be a huge supporter and helper during her cancer fight.

A rapper with former ties to Big U is happy the Rollin' 60s Neighborhood Crips leader has been locked up on murder and conspiracy charges ... and wants him put UNDER the jail ... she's claiming to be one of his victims!!!

TMZ Hip Hop recently ran into SKG, a former Death Row artist -- whose name stands for ""Suge Knight Girl"" -- out this week and she's packing a lot of opinions regarding the Big U RICO charges.

SKG tells us Big U was a literal monster to her and the Crenshaw community for years, by allegedly using brute force to extort local businesses.

She also claims Big U beat her in the presence of Nipsey Hussle while she was pregnant!!!

She's been telling the story for years ... Nipsey and his late friend Stephen Jiles ""Fatts"" Donelson allegedly set her up to be ambushed and beaten by Big U after he was embarrassed by the way he was presented during a meeting with L.A. radio station KDAY.

SKG says she has no sympathy for Big U, but her heart yearns for the family of Rayshawn Williams, the 21-year-old aspiring rapper who federal agents allege Big U murdered in Las Vegas back in 2021.

SKG spoke to Williamson's family and even got backed up by Wack 100 -- another one of Big U's archenemies -- but tells us she feels safer since he's been arrested.

And despite her rocky past with the late Nipsey, SKG wants everyone to be on the lookout for Big U to be implicated in the rap legend's murder.

Abel has hired Baldoni's powerhouse lawyer Bryan Freedman, who accuses Stephanie of triggering the whole legal drama between Justin and Blake Lively involving their film, ""It Ends with Us.""

Play video content TMZ.com

Freedman filed the counterclaims on Abel's behalf against Jones -- who's the CEO of the PR company Jonesworks, which still represents Justin.

In a statement, Freedman tells TMZ ... ""It is undeniable that Stephanie Jones initiated this catastrophic sequence of events by violating the most basic of privacy rights, as well as any remaining trust her clients held.""

Freedman says Stephanie is ""no stranger to stirring up crisis scenarios for departing clients,"" accusing her of maliciously turning over ""communications from the phone she wrongfully took from her own partner to her cohort Leslie Sloane, immediately after Jones was terminated for cause by Wayfarer due to her own wrongful behavior."" Leslie, of course, is Blake's PR rep, who has also been sued by Baldoni.

In the new court docs, filed Thursday, Abel responds to Jones' lawsuit against her, Baldoni, and Baldoni's PR crisis manager Melissa Nathan ... Abel makes a bunch of counterclaims, including invasion of privacy, false light and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

As you know ... Baldoni has filed a few major lawsuits in recent months -- including the massive $400 million lawsuit he and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, filed against Blake, Ryan Reynolds and Leslie Sloane.

In the suit, Baldoni claims the three started a smear campaign against him to take control of the movie ""It Ends with Us.""

Kristin Tahler, partner at Quinn Emmanuel, who's representing Jones, tells TMZ ... “Ms. Jones’ lawsuit is based entirely on facts and concrete evidence. That suit clearly shows that Jen Abel conspired with Melissa Nathan and others to steal reams of confidential documents, clients and staff and eventually attempt to destroy the business that Ms. Jones spent decades building.""

She continues, ""Abel, Nathan, Baldoni and their co-defendants attempted to achieve these outcomes through bullying distortion and outright disparagement. These facts are backed up by dozens of messages provided in the suit we filed month ago and cannot be credibly disputed.",tmz
