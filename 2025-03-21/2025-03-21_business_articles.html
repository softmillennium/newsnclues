The Trump administration is stepping up its review of federal agencies' contracts with consulting companies, warning in a letter to the top 10 highest-paid consulting firms doing government work that they must submit scorecards justifying their contracts without using consulting “jargon or gobbledygook,” according to a letter obtained by NBC News.

The letter — sent by Josh Gruenbaum, who leads cost-cutting efforts at the GSA — requests new information on the companies' billions of dollars worth of government contracts, broken out by agency.

Each firm that received this letter must detail their pricing structure and look for cuts that can be made using “simple layman terms (a 15 year old should be able to understand what service you provide and why it is important)” Gruenbaum wrote.

The letter — which came with an attached scorecard template — pits the firms against each other, saying their responses will be compared against both the government-wide review and what is submitted by other consulting firms.

 The consulting companies have been asked to detail the kind of work they have been doing and disclose how much the companies were paid by government agencies between 2019 and 2024 — and must submit this information by March 31st. 

GSA has canceled 1,700 consulting contracts since Trump took office, according to internal data the agency provided to NBC News.

The U.S. denied allegations that a French scientist was turned away at the border over his political beliefs.

Philippe Baptiste, the French minister of higher education and research, said the unidentified researcher was denied entry to the U.S. earlier this month while traveling to a conference near Houston.

U.S. authorities found his phone “contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration's research policies,” Baptiste said in a statement.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said that was “not true.”

“The French researcher in question was in possession of confidential information on his electronic device from Los Alamos National Laboratory,” in violation of a nondisclosure agreement, she wrote on X last night, “something he admitted to taking without permission and attempted to conceal.”

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., are demanding information from the Defense Department about Elon Musk's meeting this morning at the Pentagon. 

"Did the Pentagon today provide Mr. Musk with a top-secret briefing today on U.S. war plans for China?" Warren and Duckworth asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a letter obtained exclusively by NBC News. 

They sought additional details about the briefing, including whether the Pentagon changed its original plans for the meeting after initial public reports came out about it. The two senators also asked what clearance processes were in place for Musk to receive the information that he did. 

"Mr. Musk arrived at the Pentagon earlier today. But it remains unclear exactly what information he received, and whether you or other Pentagon officials modified plans for him to receive top-secret information “on the U.S. military's plan for any war that might break out with China," they wrote in the letter, quoting an article by The New York Times, which was first to report on Musk's briefing. 

The Times reported last night that Musk was set to receive a briefing today on U.S. plans for any war with China. Three defense officials told NBC News that the briefing would include a discussion about China, but could not confirm it would delve into any war plans. Two of the officials said the briefing would be be unclassified. 

Trump and Hegseth both denied the reports, saying Musk came to the Pentagon to discuss his efforts to cut government costs under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency initiative. They said this morning that the meeting did not include information about any war plans for China.

The complaint filed by a bipartisan coalition alleging that a political group affiliated with Elon Musk violated state campaign finance laws as part of its spending efforts in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race will move forward.

Following a preliminary review, the Wisconsin Ethics Commission found that the complaint was “sufficient to proceed to consideration by the Commission,” according to an email from the commission obtained by NBC News.

According to Wisconsin statutes, that effectively means that the commission found the complaint to contain “sufficient allegations to establish that a violation” of certain Wisconsin campaign finance laws “has potentially occurred.”

The complaint was filed earlier this week by longtime Wisconsin Republican activist Tracy Mangold with the support of a Democratic strategist-led group that's focused on supporting the party's legal efforts around election protection. It alleged that Building America's Future violated campaign finance laws in failing to properly disclose various expenditures and disbursements related to the “Progress 2028” campaign.

In response to questions about the development, Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Building America's Future, referred to a post he wrote on X on Tuesday, calling the complaint “laughable” and that it was “unsurprising that Democrats are throwing a hissy fit” about the group “simply telling voters what Susan Crawford's positions are.”

“We're not the slightest bit concerned and don't plan on relenting,” Romeo wrote in the post.

The complaint is related to a series of digital ads put out by a group identifying itself as Progress 2028 that have tied Crawford, a liberal candidate in the technically nonpartisan race to a variety of liberal policy ideas. Some ads, for example, call Crawford a “progressive champion,” while others contend she will “stand up for immigrants” and give convicted criminals “second chances.”

The Associated Press and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel have reported that the ads, which appear largely on Facebook and other social media sites, were funded by Building America's Future, a Musk-aligned group. (Building America's Future isn't required to disclose its donations, but Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have reported that Musk helped fund it in the past.) The group is one of two associated with Musk — the other is Musk's America PAC — that have together spent millions to boost the conservative candidate in the race, Brad Schimel.

The complaint specifically alleged that Building America's Future hasn't properly disclosed the disbursements to fund the campaign — known as express advocacy disbursements — as would be required under Wisconsin campaign finance law.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone, who has long called for the federal government to open up more documents about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, refrained from immediately weighing in on the tranche of files released this week by the Trump administration.

"Oliver is holding off on commenting on anything regarding the JFK files until he's able to familiarize himself with the new materials," a representative for Stone said in an email to NBC News this week.

Stone directed the 1991 film "JFK," a dizzying exploration of the conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's killing. The movie focuses on former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) who distrusted the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

The director has said the movie was intended to serve as a "counter-myth" and a deep dive into the country's "untold history." It surveys a sprawling cast of potential culprits, including the CIA, the Mafia, Cuban freedom fighters and the military-industrial complex amid the war in Vietnam.

The batch of Kennedy files released this week did not immediately appear to contain any narrative-shifting bombshells about Kennedy's killing, though some of the files reveal the 35th president's skepticism of the CIA.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to call a snap federal election on Sunday that is expected to be held on April 28, The Globe and Mail reported, with the campaign likely to be dominated by anger over Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports and calls to make Canada the 51st state.

Carney has not yet made a final decision on April 28 as the election date, the newspaper reported yesterday, citing two sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss campaign plans and strategy. His office has not responded to an NBC News request for comment.

Carney, the newly elected leader of Canada's governing Liberal Party, became prime minister last Friday after his predecessor and fellow Liberal, the highly unpopular Justin Trudeau, stepped down after almost a decade in power amid criticism over his response to 25% tariffs that Trump has imposed on Canadian imports.

The center-left Liberals are now in a tight race with the Conservative Party, after Trump's actions and rhetoric prompted a surge in Canadian nationalism and support for the Liberals that erased the Conservatives' double-digit lead in the polls in a matter of weeks.

Trump said this afternoon that people who were deported to El Salvador by his administration went through a rigorous vetting process.

"I was told that they went through a very strong vetting process, and that that will also be continuing in El Salvador, and if there's anything like that we would certainly want to find out," Trump said in response to a reporter asking about reports that some who were deported weren't criminals.

"These were a bad group. This was a bad group, and they were in bad areas, and they were with a lot of other people that were absolutely killers, murderers, and people that were really bad with the worst records you've ever seen," Trump added. "And, but we will continue that process, absolutely we don't want to make that kind of a mistake."

Families of the Venezuelan immigrants who were recently deported say they were shocked to see their loved ones sent to a megaprison in El Salvador and deny that they have links to the Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua, NBC News reported this week.

Trump criticized Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who ran as Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket last year, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office this afternoon.

“He lost an election. He played a part. You know, usually a vice president doesn't play a part, they say. I think Tim played a part. I think he was so bad that he hurt her, but she hurt herself,” Trump said.

Trump's comments come as Walz has re-emerged on the national stage this week. The Minnesota governor returned to Wisconsin for the first time since the 2024 campaign to rally support for the Democratic candidate in the state's highly contested Supreme Court race.

During the Wisconsin event and in an interview on California Gov. Gavin Newsom's podcast, Walz urged Democratic governors to stand up to what he called Trump's "unconstitutional mandates."

Trump also blamed Harris' loss in part on Joe Biden. "Joe hurt them both. They didn't have a great group. I would probably put him at the bottom of the group," Trump said.

In his Oval Office remarks, a reporter asked Trump about NBC News' reporting that Biden is eager to help the Democratic Party get back on its feet by fundraising, campaigning or whatever else is needed. 

Trump said he'd welcome it. 

"I hope so," Trump said. 

Trump still uses his former opponent as a frequent foil. He has invoked Biden in some form more than 400 times since his Jan. 20 inauguration, according to an NBC News analysis.

Following his executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, Trump said Friday that the Small Business Association will “immediately” begin overseeing student loan servicing. He also said the Department of Health and Human Services will handle nutrition programs and programs for children with disabilities.

Yesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said those areas would remain under the Education Department.

Completely eliminating the department would require the approval of Congress, and Trump has said he hopes Democrats will vote in favor.

America PAC, the super PAC founded by billionaire Elon Musk ahead of the 2024 election, is reviving its controversial petition-gathering program to promise Wisconsin registered voters $100 if they sign its conservative-leaning petition ahead of next month's state Supreme Court race. 

The new petition says signers are "rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role," language that mirrors Musk and other Trump allies (as well as the president himself) who have lambasted judges they believe are stymying Trump's agenda. A post on X from the group says voters can also receive $100 for each signature that comes from their referral. 

America PAC ran a similar petition drive in swing states ahead of the presidential election, but that drive was coupled with an entry into a $1 million raffle for signers. Philadelphia's district attorney sued Musk and the group over the sweepstakes, but was unsuccessful. 

It's the latest attempt by Musk to use his virtually unlimited personal wealth to further his political aims. However, like last year's petition, the $100 only goes to people who sign the petition and is not explicitly linked to any promise to vote or to back a certain candidate or political party.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will continue to deport immigrants to a megaprison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador if the individuals have a final order of deportation, a Homeland Security spokesperson told NBC News.

The order by Judge James Boasberg only blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants subject to Trump's presidential proclamation from the U.S. to El Salvador without final orders of removal. 

The DHS spokesperson said that Venezuelan people who ICE arrested this week could face possible deportation to El Salvador if they are ordered deported by an immigration judge. 

The DHS spokesperson did not say when future deportations to El Salvador may occur. 

Sending deported immigrants to a prison in a foreign country that is not their own is unprecedented. The recent use of Guantanamo Bay was as a detention center rather than a deportation site, and immigrants there remained in the custody of the U.S.

When immigration judges order an immigrant to be deported, they do so with the expectation they will be humanely sent back to their home country.

U.S. ally South Korea is struggling to remove its Department of Energy designation as a “sensitive country” after being added to the list in January.

The designation, which takes effect April 15, puts South Korea on the lowest tier of the watch list along with countries such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. Countries may appear on the list for national security, nuclear nonproliferation or terrorism support reasons, and they are subject to additional review before their nationals are granted access to DOE facilities, according to the department's website.

“We will negotiate toward removing South Korea from the list as much as possible, but if that doesn't work, we will create a constructive alternative,” Ahn Duk-geun, the South Korean trade minister, told reporters yesterday upon arriving in Washington.

“We plan to find the best possible solution so that this does not become an obstacle to scientific and industrial cooperation between South Korea and the U.S.,” he said.

Joseph Yun, the acting U.S. ambassador in Seoul, said Tuesday that South Korea was added to the list because visitors to the DOE's labs mishandled sensitive information, according to Reuters. He did not elaborate on the details but said it was “not a big deal” and did not have broader implications for U.S.-South Korea cooperation.

Protesters gathered outside a VA medical center in Saginaw, Michigan, on Thursday to oppose the Trump administration's sprawling cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The protesters held signs reading “Keep your promise” and “Hands off our Veterans,” waving and cheering as cars passed to draw attention to the thousands of VA employees who have been fired from the agency, which provides health care and other critical services to millions of veterans.

Carly Rose Hammond, a member of the Saginaw City Council, told NBC 25 that now is the time for the nation to stand up for the veterans who fought for its freedoms.

“They're coming after nurses, they're coming after Medicaid, they're coming after Social Security offices. Those are people that need those services every single day — that's what we as voters voted for,” Hammond said.

An internal memo obtained by NBC News earlier this month detailed plans to slash 80,000 jobs from the agency by August in order to “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.”

Critics and concerned veterans warn the cuts could be detrimental for veterans who rely on the agency for health care and other critical services.

The Trump administration has appealed more than 15 decisions by federal judges to circuit courts since Jan. 20.

That includes one appeal filed overnight by Elon Musk and DOGE, appealing Judge Theodore Chuang's order to reinstate USAID systems and access, to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The administration has also appealed, for example, a ruling to reinstate National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, a Democrat, as well as another ruling to reinstate Cathy Harris, who was fired as a Democratic member of the Merit Systems Protection Board. 

The government also appealed a ruling last weekend that blocked deportations using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Planes carrying deportees, however, didn't turn around and instead landed in El Salvador, appearing to defy the judge's decision. The White House has denied that if defied the judge. 

Trump has been railing against federal judges who have blocked actions by his administration. This morning, he wrote on Truth Social, "No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., met a friendly crowd at a town hall last night in a Trump-won county. 

The congressman received a standing ovation when he arrived, and many of the attendees appeared to agree with his comments. 

But one constituent was booed by the crowd after he said he was a "little disappointed" that the congressman voted against the House Republican spending bill that was approved last week. 

The congressman was able to get them to stop booing, saying he appreciates the constituent's perspective, then explained why he voted against the bill.

“It was the worst CR I've ever seen in recent history, because it basically let the administration take money and move it around however they'd like, and spend it however they'd like, right?” he said.

Speaking to reporters afterward, Subramanyam dodged on whether he thinks it's time for new Democratic leadership. When pressed by NBC News, he said that the future of Senate Minority Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is up to the Senate.

“It truly is. ... I don't think we're in disarray. I think right now, we look like we're in disarray, but we certainly have a unifying message,” said Subramanyam.

Beijing said it welcomed a visit by Sen. Steve Daines, a strong Trump supporter, but did not say whether he would meet with senior Chinese officials as the world's two biggest economies take turns imposing tariffs on each other.

China welcomes Americans “from all walks of life, including members of the Congress, to visit China,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing today, adding that China believes both the U.S. and China benefit from the “steady, sound and sustainable” development of their relationship.

Daines, a Montana Republican, is the first member of Congress to visit Beijing since Trump returned to the White House in January. He arrived in the Chinese capital yesterday after meeting with top leaders in Vietnam and said he would be talking with Chinese officials about curbing the international flow of fentanyl, the U.S. trade deficit with China and fair market access for American farmers and ranchers.

His office said earlier that Daines would be coordinating closely with the White House and would be “carrying President Trump's America First agenda,” The Associated Press reported.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in the presidential race has given rise, again, to whispered worries in the Democratic Party about female candidates and electability — resurrecting a fraught conversation that bubbled for years after Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton.

The whisper campaign has started to some extent in New Jersey, where this year's governor's race will be one of Democrats' first big electoral tests since Trump won his second term.

Former President Joe Biden has told some Democratic leaders he'll raise funds, campaign and do anything else necessary for Democrats to recover lost ground as the Trump administration rolls back programs the party helped design, according to people close to him.

Biden privately met last month with the new Democratic National Committee chairman, Ken Martin, and offered to help as the party struggles to regain its viability amid polling that shows its popularity has been sinking, the people said.

NEW DELHI — India's IT ministry has unlawfully expanded censorship powers to allow the easier removal of online content and empowered “countless” government officials to execute such orders, Elon Musk's X has alleged in a new lawsuit against New Delhi.

The lawsuit and the allegations mark an escalation in an ongoing legal dispute between X and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over how New Delhi orders content to be taken down. It also comes as Musk is getting closer to launching his other key ventures Starlink and Tesla in India.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, is seeking information from the Securities and Exchange Commission over its decision to relax federal regulations around meme coins weeks after Trump and first lady Melania Trump released their own versions.

The SEC defines a meme coin as a type of crypto asset inspired by internet memes, characters, current events, or trends. In a staff statement last month, the agency said because of its view that meme coins are typically purchased for entertainment and social interaction rather than financial value, owners of the asset do not have to abide by federal regulations.

“Persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933,” a February statement from the agency reads. “Accordingly, neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws.”

In a letter to acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda, Warren highlighted the financial benefits the Trumps incurred through the coins and wrote the rule change “conveniently presents a legal interpretation that could shield the President and First Lady's coins from regulatory scrutiny.” 

“By the afternoon of January 20th, the coins were reportedly worth a combined $9.5 billion and attracted large numbers of first-time crypto investors,” the senator added. “Though the $TRUMP coin lost roughly two-thirds of its value within a few weeks of launch, President Trump's companies earned nearly $100 million in fees; small retail investors, meanwhile, lost money.”

Warren in the letter characterizes meme coins as “direct threats to consumers” that could benefit from more, not less, oversight.

The information the senator is requesting from the SEC includes “all communications” between the agency and the White House,” and more specifically, whether the agency has taken directives from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, a board formed by Trump in January that includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

“It is essential that the Commission issue policy proposals designed to benefit the American public—not the President's bottom line,” her letter reads.

Trump denied a New York Times report that his adviser Elon Musk is set to be briefed by the Pentagon today on the U.S. military's plan for any potential war with China.

“China will not even be mentioned or discussed,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform late last night.

Musk, who is leading the Trump administration's effort to slash the size of the federal government, is scheduled to visit the Pentagon today for a meeting and briefing, three defense officials told NBC News. Two of the officials said Musk was expected to be briefed on China but that the briefing would be unclassified. None of the officials could confirm the Times report, which cited two U.S. officials. 

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also denied the report, saying in a post on X that it would be “an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.”

Japan said there had been “no change” in plans to enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the U.S.-Japan alliance, despite news reports that the Pentagon is considering canceling a planned expansion of U.S. forces stationed in Japan.

The move to cancel the expansion, as outlined in draft documents seen by NBC and CNN, would save about $1.18 billion, part of larger cuts to defense spending that could include restructuring the U.S. military's combatant commands and headquarters and giving up U.S. command of NATO military operations for the first time in almost 75 years.  

The Japanese government's top spokesperson, Yoshimasa Hayashi, told reporters in Tokyo today that Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the expansion plan during Ishiba's visit to Washington last month.

The U.S. and its longtime ally Japan, which hosts more than 50,000 U.S. service members, have been intensifying military cooperation in recent years in an effort to address growing security threats from China and North Korea.

China called on the U.S. to protect Chinese nationals studying in the U.S. after a member of Congress requested several universities to disclose detailed information about their Chinese students, citing potential national security risks.

In a letter to six universities, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., accused China's ruling Communist Party of establishing a “well-documented, systematic pipeline” to embed researchers in leading U.S. institutions for “sensitive” technologies. The universities are Carnegie Mellon, Purdue University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland and the University of Southern California.

“America's student visa system has become a Trojan horse for Beijing,” Moolenaar said in a statement, in what he called a “direct threat” to American national security.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that educational cooperation is “in the interests of both parties.”

“We urge the U.S. to stop generalizing national security and to genuinely protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students, and not to take discriminatory or restrictive measures against them,” spokesperson Mao Ning said yesterday at a regular briefing in Beijing.

China is the second-biggest source of international students in the U.S. after India, accounting for about a quarter of the total in the 2023-24 academic year, according to the State Department.

LAS VEGAS — At the first stop of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour out West, two of the Democratic Party's most unabashed progressive lawmakers had plenty to say about President Donald Trump. But they also had some strong words for their own party.

“This isn't just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. told the fired-up crowd gathered at the Craig Ranch Amphitheater to see her and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.”

While Ocasio-Cortez did not mention any Democratic leaders by name, the crowd broke out into multiple “Primary Chuck” chants — a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who backed down from a funding fight with Trump last week.

This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets provisionally closed lower on Friday, led by declines in the travel sector which was down 1.6% after the closure of Heathrow airport.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 and French CAC 40 were both about 0.6% lower by 4.40 p.m. London time, while the the German DAX shed 0.5%. London's FTSE 100 was about 0.6% lower.

The travel and leisure sector lost about 1.6% after London's Heathrow Airport closed on Friday following a fire at a nearby electrical substation. British Airways-owner International Airlines Group was trading around 1.9% lower.

Basic resources — including stocks such as ArcelorMittal and wood pulp processor Stora Enso — were down about 2.3%.

European investors digested monetary policy updates that came from multiple central banks in the region, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve, this week.

The Bank of Russia held its key rates at 21% on Friday, citing high inflationary pressures. On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank trimmed interest rates by 25 basis points, while the Bank of England held rates steady in the U.K. and Sweden's Riksbank also opted not to alter interest rates.

"Since [our] previous meeting, global trade policy uncertainty has intensified, and the United States has made a range of tariff announcements, to which some governments have responded," the Bank of England said on Thursday. "Other geopolitical uncertainties have also increased and indicators of financial market volatility have risen globally."

It came after the Fed also kept its key interest rate steady on Wednesday. Although the central bank said it still sees two rate cuts happening this year, officials cut their 2025 economic growth forecast for the U.S. and noted that uncertainty had increased, with tariffs poised to add inflationary pressure.

— CNBC's Sophie Kiderlin and Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Fabrizio Palermo, CEO of Italian utilities company ACEA, said the world is not prepared for the water consumption demands of running artificial intelligence.

"Estimates by year 2030 are saying that basically, the water consumption linked to AI can reach a level as high as the full consumption of the US," Palermo told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe. "This is significant, and clearly the world is not ready for that."

"The situation is critical. We are going towards what can be called the new water era ... we need to be prepared for this new water transition," he added.

Palermo also said that AI can help with water management, such as predicting future water availability. He added that  awareness of the demand for water was "rising," with the European Commission's appointment of a commissioner for water resilience.

JPMorgan's Head of Global Multi-Asset Strategy John Bilton said markets will likely be in a "better place" next year.

"If we take a step back and think: 'Where are we going to be a year from now?' chances are we're probably still going to be in a better place, and that starts to inform how you think about taking risk in these markets," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday.

Bilton referred to moves from Germany to reform borrowing rules and "reasonable" corporate profit expectations as more positive data points.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could cause "a little bit more chop" to markets ahead of the duties coming into effect on April 2, Bilton said, adding that he expected more positive news to come on fiscal boosts and deregulation, which could provide a "boost" in the second half of 2025.

Aviation expert Anita Mendiratta said the implications of the fire and power outage causing the closure of London's Heathrow Airport on Friday were "very wide."

"The growth of the [aviation] industry is happening faster than the growth of infrastructure," said Mendiratta, founder of consultancy AM&A, speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday. "All of this is a very dramatic learning curve," she said.

Mendiratta described the growth of aviation globally as "massive."

"It is extreme in terms of how it has grown far beyond even 2019 rates," she said. This raises questions over the industry's resilience to unplanned weather or geopolitical events and whether the surrounding infrastructure can support it.

The three major averages traded lower in the U.S. Friday morning.

Just after the opening bell, the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 321 points, or about 0.8%.

In a note to clients after German lawmakers passed public borrowing reforms that will pave the way for higher national defense spending, economists at Deutsche Bank declared it "time to bake this fiscal regime shift into macro forecasts."

The analysts now expect Germany's GDP growth to accelerate to 1.5% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027.

"That said, it will take time for the fiscal impulse to kick in, and we slightly lower our growth forecast for 2025 to 0.3% in light of stronger global cross-currents than we had previously expected," they said.

The German lender had previously forecast German economic growth of 0.5% for 2025 and 1% for 2026.

The Bank of Russia held its key rate unchanged at 21% on Friday, citing high inflationary pressures.

"The Bank of Russia estimates that the achieved tightness of monetary conditions creates the necessary prerequisites for returning inflation to the target in 2026," it said in a statement on Friday. "Achieving the inflation target will require a long period of maintaining tight monetary conditions in the economy."

The central bank's board of directors noted that maintaining a long period of "tight monetary conditions in the economy," will allow inflation to return to target in 2026.

"If disinflation dynamics do not ensure achieving the inflation target, the Bank of Russia will consider raising the key rate," it said.

The central bank said Russia's annual inflation was 10.2% as of March 17 and could slim down to 7-8% in 2025, before returning to 4% in 2026 and staying at this target further onward.

"According to the baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia expects that inflationary pressures will continue to decline in the coming months. This will be supported by a cooldown in lending and high saving activity," it added.

Russia's economy has been battling high inflation and economic constrictions as a result of Western sanctions, which have particularly curtailed Moscow's key energy exports.

British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca on Friday said that it will invest $2.5 billion in a research and development center in Chinese capital Beijing.

The new hub is expected to take AstraZeneca's Beijing workforce to around 1,700 employees.

The investment in Beijing comes as part of a partnership with the city's Municipal Government and the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area Administrative Office, AstraZeneca said.

Under the deal, AstraZeneca will enter research and development collaborations with biotech firms Harbour BioMed and Syneron Bio and will launch a joint venture with BioKangtai to develop, produce, and market vaccines for respiratory and other infectious diseases.

Anita Mendiratta, founder of consultancy Anita Mendiratta and Associates, discusses the consequences of the fire at London Heathrow Airport.

Citi issued a note on Friday over the potential impact of the Heathrow airport closure on IAG, the owner of British Airways:

"1) the 2017 IT outage cost ~£80m, including £30m in lost revenue; however, we believe much of the cost was compensation - today's fire would appear to be outside of the airline's control, so compensation may not be payable (although they will need to provide food and water and possibly hotel accommodation)," Citi said in the note.

"2) it would appear to be one-off in nature, so we'd argue deserves a one times multiple (£80m is about 0.5% of market cap post tax; 3) if the airport does not open overnight, the costs would increase proportionally."

— Sawdah Bhaimiya

A fire at a nearby electrical substation caused the closure of Heathrow Airport on Friday, affecting hundreds of flights in and out of the London transport hub. Here are some of the biggest movers as of 8:45 a.m. London time:

London's Heathrow Airport closed on Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage, airport officials said.

"Heathrow is experiencing a significant power outage across the airport due to a large fire at a nearby electrical substation. Whilst fire crews are responding to the incident, we do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored," a Heathrow spokesperson said.

"We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens," the spokesperson said.

The airport will remain closed until at least 11:59 p.m. local time on Friday.

"We know this will be disappointing for passengers and we want to reassure that we are working as hard as possible to resolve the situation," a Heathrow spokesperson said.

Oops, something went wrong

New York Federal Reserve president John Williams on Friday stressed the uncertainty of the US economic outlook, saying he expects lower growth this year amid a lot of unknowns about the impact of new trade, fiscal and immigration policies.

"It's hard to know with any precision how the economy will evolve," Williams said in a speech at the Macroeconometric Caribbean Conference in the Bahamas.

"Uncertainty is high, and there are many scenarios that could play out, depending on fiscal and trade policies and geopolitical and other developments.”

The comments came after the Fed held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Powell raised eyebrows on Wednesday when he said his "base case" is that any higher inflation from tariffs will prove transitory, reviving memories of the Fed's slow response to inflation coming out of the pandemic and sparking questions of whether the Fed could repeat the same mistake.

But Williams said Friday it's unclear about whether the effects prove to be transitory this time around, noting that it really depends on the different circumstances and the details.

"Tariff direct effects might be short-lived, but we have to be looking at more at what's happening in the economy...and kind of adjusting our view on the path of policy based on what we're learning along the way," Williams told Yahoo Finance during a media availability Friday.

To bolster his point about the uncertainty ahead for the economy, Williams on Friday noted that the range of Fed officials' new estimates for GDP growth are between about 1-1/2 and 2 percent. For inflation, the range wisbetween about 2-1/2 and 3 percent, noting that any of those are possible.

Williams anticipates lower immigration will constrain the increase of workers in the job market, putting a damper on growth. And while inflation has continued on a "bumpy path" toward the Fed's 2% goal, he noted the future is highly uncertain.

The New York Fed president characterized the current level on the Fed's benchmark interest rate as “modestly restrictive,” noting that the current range of 4.25%-4.5% is “entirely appropriate” given the “solid” labor market and inflation still running “somewhat” above their 2% goal.

Though he also stressed, “measures of policy uncertainty have increased sharply in recent months.”

Williams also addressed short-term inflation expectations, which have risen considerably in the wake of President Trump's proposed tariffs.

Williams acknowledged the increase in expectations, but noted “there are no signs of inflation expectations becoming unmoored relative to the pre-pandemic period.”

Elsewhere, this week the Fed announced it will slow the rate with which it lets Treasury securities roll off its balance sheet to $5 billion, down from $25 billion starting next month. Williams emphasized that the decision to slow the runoff “is a natural next step to smooth the transition from abundant reserves to a level that is somewhat above ample."

He added, “this action has no implications for our intended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the medium term.”

The yield on the 10-year Treasury has dropped since the Fed's balance sheet announcement. Retaining more Treasuries, means more demand, pushing down yields.

Washington — The Small Business Administration on Friday said it is cutting more than 40% of its staff as part of the Trump administration's wider effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy.

Roughly 6,500 people, or less than half-a-percent of the entire federal workforce, are employed at the SBA, according to the most recent data available. The agency said in a statement that it will "reduce its workforce by 43%" and said the cuts would save more than $435 million a year by next fiscal year.

"The strategic reorganization will begin a turnaround for the agency by restoring the efficiency of the first Trump Administration, as well as its focus on promoting small businesses," the agency said. "Core services to the public, including the agency's loan guarantee and disaster assistance programs, as well as its field and veteran operations, will not be impacted."

The Senate voted to confirm former Sen. Kelly Loeffler to as the agency's administrator in February. In a video posted to X on Friday, Loeffler said it's time to "rightsize the agency."

"Since the pandemic, the SBA has doubled its workforce, expanding in size, scope and spending with miserable results," Loeffler said in the video. "That's why change is coming to the SBA. ... This agency is done wasting millions of tax dollars to fund a progressive pandemic-era bureaucracy. We will not allow fiscal mismanagement to threaten our loan programs or criminals to get away with fraud. But we will evaluate every program and expenditure and we will rightsize the agency to transform the SBA into a high-efficiency engine for America's entrepreneurs and taxpayers." 

Staff is spread out in district offices across the country. Texas has more SBA employees than any state, including the District of Columbia, where the agency is headquartered. 

Speaking at the White House on Friday morning, President Trump announced that SBA will be responsible for handling federal student loan programs, one day after signing an order to begin winding down the Department of Education, which currently manages the programs. Experts warned that the order could throw student loans into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers. Administration officials have previously said that student loan programs would eventually be transferred to an agency like the SBA or the Treasury or Commerce Departments.

The SBA was established by an act of Congress in 1953 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president to "aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns." 

It provides loans to businesses that fall victim to natural disasters and offers support on international trade issues. The agency's federally backed loans and grants were a lifeline to small businesses and nonprofit groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I look forward to contributing to the company's long-term vision and creating sustainable value for stakeholders,” said Sarma in the official statement. 

Larsen and Toubro (LT) shares closed 2.03 per cent higher at  ₹3,417.35 after Friday's stock market session, compared to  ₹3,349.20 at the previous market close.

        The results are in for a test Google carried out in eight European countries.
    

Google has said that news is unprofitable for its adverting business following the results of an experiment it ran in eight European countries. 

The tech giant removed news from search results for 1 per cent of users for 2.5 months and on Friday announced the results of the test. 

“The study showed that when we removed this content, there was no change to Search ad revenue and a <1% (0.8%) drop in usage,” Google said. 

Paul Liu, Google's director of economics, said in a statement that they have "seen a number of inaccurate reports that vastly overestimate the value of news content to Google".

The company added in the report that the actual ad revenue impact “could not be statistically‬‭ distinguished from zero, either overall or by country”.

The experiment was carried out in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.

The test was also intended for France, but a French court blocked the move and warned Google would be fined for breaking an agreement with the antitrust authority. 

Google said the test was being carried out as part of the company's compliance with the European Copyright Directive (EUCD), one of the European Union's legal frameworks, and its licensing programme for EU news publishers.

The European law states that Google and similar bodies must pay news publishers for using parts of their content. However, the question of how much that content is worth could be an argument Google uses in negotiations.

France's competition watchdog fined Google €250 million last year for breaches linked to intellectual property rules for news media publishers. 

There were also concerns over Google's AI service using news publisher content to train its AI models for free.

The West Plains downtown community is inviting residents and visitors to participate in its spring “Small Business Passport” program, an initiative designed to encourage local shopping and engagement.

Participants can pick up a passport at various downtown locations or the Ozark Heritage Welcome Center. To complete the passport, individuals must visit and receive stamps from ten participating businesses. Once completed, the passport can be submitted for entry into a drawing for a gift basket.



This initiative aims to highlight and support local businesses while providing a fun and interactive way for the community to explore downtown West Plains. Full details are available on the passport, and no purchase is necessary to participate. The deadline for entries is April 30.

Lawsuit alleges US plane maker's treatment of John Barnett caused his death after he raised safety concerns

The family of a whistleblower at Boeing who killed himself last year is suing the US plane manufacturer, alleging the company's conduct caused his death.

Boeing pushed John Barnett to his death by harassing and intimidating him after he raised safety concerns about the company's plant building the 787 Dreamliner in Charleston, South Carolina, a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal court in the state alleges.

The world's second-largest aeroplane maker has faced significant scrutiny over its safety during a years-long crisis started by two fatal crashes of its bestselling 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019. Last year a door panel blew out of a Boeing plane in mid-air after engineers failed to replace crucial bolts, raising yet more concerns over the company's safety culture.

The crises have also raised questions over how Boeing treated people voicing concerns.

Barnett was a quality manager at Boeing for nearly three decades, starting at Everett, Washington state, before his move to South Carolina. He took early retirement in 2017, at which point he was experiencing symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, according to the claim.

He then shared concerns over Boeing's safety processes with journalists, becoming known publicly as a whistleblower. His allegations included finding metal shavings near critical control wires, and problems with onboard oxygen systems.

His family claim in their suit that Boeing responded by carrying out a “campaign of harassment, abuse and intimidation intended to discourage, discredit and humiliate him until he would either give up or be discredited”.

Barnett was found dead with a gunshot wound in his truck in a hotel car park on 9 March last year, days after giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.

In a statement this week, Boeing said: “We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family.” The company was approached for further comment.

However, Barnett's family alleged that “Boeing had threatened to break John, and break him it did”.

They said the aeroplane maker intentionally gave Barnett inaccurate, poor job reviews and less desirable shifts, and that the company publicly blamed him for delays that angered his co-workers and prevented him from transferring to another plant.

The lawsuit alleged: “Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to his death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that PTSD and John's unbearable depression, panic attacks, and anxiety … would in turn lead to an elevated risk of suicide.

“Boeing may not have pulled the trigger, but Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death.”

Plus, a look at the new watch servicing program.

Sotheby's has just announced a partnership with WatchCheck, a relatively new but intriguing company that launched last year. The partnership aims to provide an easier, seamless servicing process for over 38,000 models. WatchCheck gives customers access to servicing partners in the United States that were previously largely accessible only to commercial clients.

I had a chance to check out the process for WatchCheck last year, and it's quite intuitive and reduces many of the issues that often cause repairs to be a headache (especially if you don't live in a big city). The project was founded by Linden Lazarus (founder of vintage retailer Oliver and Clarke) and Will Haering. When you go to WatchCheck's site, you have to input a few bits of information about the make and model, upload some pictures of the watch, and describe the issue. After providing your address, you'll get an estimate from the company and receive a shipping kit. Inside the box is a pre-labeled external shipping box and a padded internal box with yet another foam insert where you place your watch. Slide it back inside and drop the watch off for shipping, and you're pretty much set.

While WatchCheck facilitates the service, Stoll & Co. in Dayton, OH, evaluates and services the watch. They offer various services, from simple repairs and battery replacements to grand complications and case refinishing (if that's your thing). Stoll & Co. is an authorized US repair center for several brands, but their expertise extends beyond the companies on their website.

Stoll & Co. is also a part of eBay's Authenticity program. A little search on Google shows you that the program hasn't been without its faults. However, with over 40 years of experience and 40 trained watchmakers, they're one of the most experienced companies of their kind in the United States.

After receiving the watch and making an inspection, WatchCheck will update you with a final price for service, which you can approve or decline. When the watch is returned to you, it comes in the internal box you shipped it with, which will also contain your receipt and warranty information.

While a lot of us (including many at Hodinkee) think of auction houses like Sotheby's as the place you go looking for the most untouched example of rare vintage watches, the fact of the matter is that modern and neo-vintage pieces make up a large portion of the volume Sotheby's sells. They also have a lot of customers who might not be enthusiasts who enjoy watches that look worn, nor do they have the contacts with watchmakers to service the watches they've picked up at auction (or through Sotheby's pre-owned selection). A service like this will make a lot of sense for those kinds of customers.

Alabama lawmakers on Thursday advanced proposed regulations on pharmacy benefit managers

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Two blocks from the Alabama Statehouse, a black wreath hung on the door of Adams Drugs — a symbol to draw attention to the number of neighborhood pharmacies that have closed, or are in danger of closing, across the state.

Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.

“We're losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,” Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said. 

Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.

Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges. 

Pharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions. 

“The biggest issue is we're not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,” Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy. 

The Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of “spread pricing” where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies. 

Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.

Helena Duncan, president of the Business Council of Alabama, told a legislative committee on Wednesday that small businesses, which might already be struggling to provide insurance to their workers, will have to either absorb the increased cost or pass it along to employees through premium increases.

“Shifting the financial burdens from pharmacies to the Alabama employers is fundamentally unfair,” Duncan told a legislative committee on Wednesday. 

Republican Sen. Andrew Jones, a cosponsor of the bill, said Thursday said other states have seen drug prices go down. Jones said it is important to protect neighborhood pharmacies because they play a vital role in communities.

“You are not going to get a big box store to open in the middle of the night to get you the medication you need,” Jones said.

Tesla notified employees of an all-hands shortly before the event, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.

The company sent employees a link to a Teams chat and an X livestream on Thursday night with the message "Join the Company All Hands to hear about Tesla's recent achievements and how we're making the impossible possible."

The event was set to kick off at 9:30 p.m. ET.

Some workers expressed confusion about the event and the short notice for the company meeting, according to Teams messages viewed by BI. Typically, Tesla hosts all-hands during regular work hours, and it is the first all-hands the carmaker has streamed publicly.

"It feels a bit hasty. No one was expecting this tonight and we're all just trying to catch up," a Tesla engineer told BI, adding that some employees heard about the event on social media first and were questioning whether it was real.

Another worker told BI the event felt like a "publicity stunt."

"This is for the investors, not the workers," the employee said.

Adding to the confusion, Tesla posted a livestream link before the event was set to kick off, only to end the livestream and delete it about 30 minutes later. During the livestream, a man's voice could be heard saying several seemingly random things, including "Dylan on stage" and "Stock parts. Joe. That's the best I can do."Some workers said they tried to access the livestream but the link on X didn't work, as Tesla sent a link to a livestream that had been deleted.

Tesla restarted a new livestream shortly before 9:30 p.m. ET, but the livestream remained silent for nearly 30 minutes.

Elon Musk tweeted a link to the event at 9:45 p.m. ET.

The event began streaming at 9:58 p.m. and ended at 11:00 p.m. ET. Musk's private jet arrived in Austin just two hours before he addressed workers in the Texas Gigafactory.

Musk spent the first half of the hour-long call providing updates on Tesla, touching on the company's safety record, delivery figures, and its progress in autonomous driving and robotics.

He then spent the rest of the session taking questions from his employees.

Tesla has been facing headwinds in recent months. The carmaker's stock is down more than 37% year-to-date and a series of protests have erupted across Tesla sales and service centers over the past few weeks.

"If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?" Musk said on Thursday night.

"Listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable," he continued.

Musk also talked about Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions during the meeting, saying that self-driving will unlock the company's true value.

"It's very difficult for people in the stock market — especially those that look in the rear-view mirror, which is most people — to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness," Musk told his workers.

"So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'" Musk added.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
