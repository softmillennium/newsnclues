Free Thinking: Is Keir Starmer or Kemi Badenoch the real Margaret Thatcher?

Welcome to Free Thinking, where we discuss the sharpest and most insightful takes from City AM’s opinion pages with Alys Denby, City AM’s Opinion and Features Editor.

In this week’s episode, Alys will be asking what Margaret Thatcher would make of Keir Starmer’s plans to cut red tape for businesses and get people off welfare and into work, whether Elon Musk is a reputational risk to his own company and why it’s so hard to get your online shopping delivered.

To answer these burning questions, Alys invited Emma Revell, external affairs director at the Centre for Policy Studies and, of course, a City AM columnist.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Mexico’s Club Leon have been kicked out of the 2025 Fifa Club World Cup over multi-club ownership rules. The 2023 CONCACAF Champions League winners Leon are owned by the same group – Grupo Pachuca – that owns fellow Mexican side Pachuca, who are also in this year’s Club World Cup. And due to rules banning clubs with the same owners taking part in the competition, Leon have been withdrawn. “Fifa has determined that Club Leon will be removed from the competition, with the club to be admitted as a replacement to be announced in due course.” It means the CONCACAF contingent currently sits at three teams – Monterrey, Seattle Sounders FC and Pachuca – with a replacement likely to come from the same umbrella of clubs that covers central and North America. Grupo Pachuca owner Jesus Martinez said in December that he would be willing to sell a controlling stake in Leon if it meant them staying in the Club World Cup. However, I think we’re going to maintain some kind of sports control. What we want is to contribute to the growth of the Mexican league, and if they see that multi-property can have a negative impact, we’re willing to help in every way,” added Martinez.

If the Six Nations taught us anything it’s that picking a squad for this year’s British and Irish Lions tour to Australia is going to be very difficult. And for others it has dented their hopes, or completely ruined them all together. Alongside Jamison Gibson-Park and Alex Mitchell, the trio offer head coach Andy Farrell a range of attacking options. Rory Darge shone in the back row for a Scotland pack often going backwards, and with other players in his position not performing well during the last two months he’s certainly put his hand up for a spot on the plane. He went about his business in a controlled manner but unleashed hell at the set piece. Tommy Freeman surprised me to no end for England during this Six Nations.

London has edged closer to becoming the world’s leading fintech hub. Will London finally topple New York and take its place as the world’s leading fintech hub? Janine Hirt, the chief executive of Innovate Finance, told City AM: “London is a world leader in fintech and financial innovation, and this preeminence has cemented our position as a global financial powerhouse. “If this continues, it will only hurt New York’s position as a fintech hub. “If fintech valuations in New York start to fall, this will have a dramatic impact on its attractiveness,” Cassis said. Several of fintech’s biggest names are anticipated to go public this year, and any listing will provide a major boost to markets on either side of the Atlantic. Revolut dealt a major blow to London in December after the firm’s chief executive said a public listing in the City was “not rational”. However, Monzo and Starling, two darlings of the UK fintech science, have signalled they could list in London. If either goes ahead, it could be a boost for the Square Mile. Read more London closes in on New York as top financial hub but risks remain Cassis said the “relative stability” of Europe was improving its attractiveness and London’s “central place puts it in a prime position to benefit”. The US’ “bigger, deeper consumer market with deep wells of venture capital cash” gives New York a “natural advantage”. Merchant said: “Stimulating and sustaining fintech investment has been critical to London’s overall financial services dominance. He added the key to London eclipsing New York was with IPOs. “UK fintech isn’t short of hotly touted IPO contenders,” he stated. He cited initiatives such as Pisces – the Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System – as “proof that the City is thinking differently about how we get behind private businesses and reframe the idea that staying private can be a huge boost to future growth” “Secondary share sales too have seen a huge resurgence in the last year – particularly among fintech companies that have become City stalwarts like Monzo, Revolut and Moneybox.” As global markets fall into uncertainty and a number of the industry’s biggest names eye public listings, the race to be the world’s top fintech hub enters a new era – an era where London could seize New York’s crown.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Coventry IOC election clears Russia ‘return to Olympic podium’, says Kremlin sport minister Russian Olympic Committee president and sports minister Mikhail Degtyarev congratulated Coventry on her election, in a vote that surprisingly took just one round to find an overall majority conclusion. Coventry is seen as the continuity candidate to outgoing president Thomas Bach, and she was welcomed by sports minister and former governor of Khabarovsk Krai Degtyarev. It appears the wind direction that was once anti-Russia is shifting towards acceptance, with President Donald Trump not slapping down a Vladimir Putin idea to play bilateral ice hockey games this year. It could pave the way for Russian reintroduction into the Winter and Summer Olympic Games, having been barred from major competition in 2019 over state sponsored doping offences. Russian athletes competed at Tokyo 2020 under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee, but there have been further sanctions on the nation after their second invasion of Ukraine in 2022. There has been concern, however, that the Kremlin would use any international success as a weapon against the west. On her election, Coventry said being the first women and African to hold the role sent a positive signal. “I hope that this vote will be an inspiration to many people. Glass ceilings have been shattered today, and I am fully aware of my responsibilities as a role model.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bolt sends £200m warning to Reeves ahead of Uber VAT ruling Cab, minicab and private hire operators have been left in limbo in recent years over a possible 20 per cent additional VAT charge on fares. The hike stems from court rulings that concluded taxi firms rather than individual drivers are responsible for contracts with passengers. Critics warn such a tax increase would result in higher fares for consumers and hit driver earnings, while Uber says it wants “consistency” across the system. The San Francisco-based ride-hailing giant was already forced to raise fees after a separate court ruled its operations in London could be viable for VAT. It is seeking a fresh ruling on contracting arrangements at a Supreme Court hearing in July, which would impact whether VAT hits private-hire operators outside London. In addition to the impact on investment, Bolt’s letter is understood to warn the looming Uber ruling could make private hire services more expensive and less accessible. Read more Will Rachel Reeves hike taxes in her first Spring Statement? Bolt argued in the letter the current system was a “postcode lottery,” where VAT is applied at varying rates depending on business models and geography.

It is a new dawn and a new day at the International Olympic Committee, with the post-Thomas Bach era beginning after yesterday’s election. Kirsty Coventry was crowned president of the IOC, one of sport’s biggest and most influential bodies, in Greece last night. The outgoing Bach insisted he would be available to offer advice, but that he might not pick up the phone… which is helpful. Whether they like it or not, the new IOC boss will need to have President Trump on their side. But bigger than the Olympics, Trump seems insistent on being the figure that brokers peace between Israel and Palestine, but also Russia and Ukraine. Much like North Korea’s involvement in the Pyeongchang Olympics as part of a unified Korea, which had a mixed women’s ice hockey team, could Russia use the Winter Games as its homecoming? Saudi Arabia and India are leading the race for 2036, with Indonesia reportedly considering a bid. Read more Lord Coe awaits IOC election result in Greece Likewise climate change will soon play a larger part in the Winter Games, with some concerns surrounding the viability of taking snowsports to new cities due to dwindling snowfall. Money does in fact make the world go round but the Olympics has clung to a holier-than- thou approach to (not) paying participants, suggesting athletes should use it as a platform rather than a cash cow. But athletics awarded prize money for its gold medallists from Paris 2024, while boxing also offered rewards. The International Olympic Committee extended its partnership with Allianz through until the 2032 Games this month having added Chinese consumer electronics company TCL in February alongside an extension to Budweiser maker AB InBev. But it has lost Panasonic, Toyota and Bridgestone over recent months and the new president will need to get working on replacing those.

The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that nearly 10 per cent of estates will pay inheritance tax by 2030, due to increasing house prices, changes to tax rules and years of allowance freezes. The main inheritance tax allowance has now been frozen at £325,000 for 15 years and is set to remain frozen for another five years.

In her maiden Budget last October, the Chancellor opted to abolish a centuries-old generous tax status afforded to wealthy foreigners known as the non-domicile (or ‘non-dom’) regime.

WASHINGTON, DC – MARCH 17: Former UFC champion and Irish businessman Conor McGregor briefly speaks with reporters alongside White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt before meeting with President Donald Trump in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Saint Patrick’s Day, March 17, 2025 in Washington, DC. Conor McGregor deserves to fade into obscurity following his criminal acts, instead he’s being paraded by Donald Trump as the face of Ireland on St Patrick’s Day, says Maria Ward-Brennan There was a time when McGregor was in his prime as a MMA fighter, rocking up to press conferences, throwing out line after line, all while wearing suits that emblazoned f**k you. Unfortunately for us, that name was everywhere on Monday, thanks to his visit with Donald Trump. Most normal people know that every action has consequences, especially when you do something wrong. Yet instead of being punished for his appalling behaviour, McGregor is paraded around the White House on St Patrick’s Day. A court ordered him to pay her over €248,000 (£206,000) and legal costs, estimated at €1.5m (£1.24m). The video, released by TMZ, attracted much attention, prompting him to grovel and apologise. He was also arrested in Florida in 2019 after he attacked a fan for taking a picture, but criminal and civil actions were dropped following an out-of-court settlement.

He narrowly avoided jail last year over his continuing dangerous driving incidents in Dublin. However, in normal times, a person like this would fade into obscurity. This was significant because St Patrick’s Day is about much more than watching parades and wearing green. Ministers and State representatives are sent to 90 cities across 40 countries as part of a robust diplomatic push. Traditionally, the Taoiseach of Ireland (Prime Minister), Micheál Martin, goes to Washington DC for a meeting with the US President to reaffirm our countries’ historic ties and trading relationship. But his official visit was long forgotten about amid Conor McGregor’s comments that “Ireland is on the cusp of losing its Irishness” and that an “illegal immigration racket” was “running ravage on the country”. Many in Ireland expressed concern about such a man apparently representing their country in Washington, so much so that a new meme was born ‘Andrew Tayto’ – he is Ireland’s Andrew Tate.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cityam.com/the-fca-must-continue-work-on-cutting-card-fees/'>The FCA must continue work on cutting card fees</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cityam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 05:37:00 <p>
The Payment Systems Regulator was doing vital work on reducing unfair card fees that are hammering retail. Now the FCA must pick up where it left off, says Tom Ironside In their recently published report into scheme and processing card fees, the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) recently found that “increasing fees impacts on UK businesses’ ability to invest and grow.” The BRC’s annual payments survey showed that UK card fees have increased year-on-year for over six years, with retailers spending £1.6bn on card fees in 2023. While this decision is rightly a matter for government, it is essential that payments regulation remains a priority, with appropriate levels of capability and resources. With the regulator itself acknowledging that the payments market in its current form is hampering investment, it is clear that without regulation, increasing card costs will continue to thwart growth. It is not only scheme and processing fees which have jumped significantly in recent years. Retailers face £7bn in additional costs this year as a result of changes to NICs, the National Living Wage and a new packaging tax. Retail operates on tight margins, typically two to four per cent so these costs cannot simply be absorbed and will lead to higher prices and reduced investment in the future. Given this, it is imperative that the FCA continues to strategically use payment regulation in a way that eases the burden on businesses, encouraging economic growth. Years of work from the PSR and businesses has now led to a point where we may see significant reform of the payments market.
