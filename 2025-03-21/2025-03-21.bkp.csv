The family pitched the tent indoors and used it for playing and eating

At the start of 2020, Istvan Csajaghy and his partner had decided to buy a four-person tent in the Christmas sales ready to take their two children camping in the summer.

But lockdown came instead. ""I got very frustrated having this brand new tent, still in its original packaging, a beautiful spring coming, and all of us stuck in the flat,"" he says.

So the family pitched the tent in the living room of their flat in Edinburgh. It became somewhere for the children to play and the family to eat.

""It's not much, but it's funny how it managed to get us out of the lockdown mood, and it still felt like some sort of adventure,"" Istvan says. ""And there we forgot about the troubles outside, and just camped indoors.""

The family finally pitched their new tent on a campsite in July 2020.""I can't even remember where we were,"" Istvan says. ""I wonder if we just booked the first camping space we found, just for the joy of pitching our brand new tent outdoors?""

Emma Fish, 53, from Atherstone, explains that lockdown provided the opportunity to consider seeking a formal diagnosis of autism for her son. 

She writes that at the time, he was finding school ""increasingly difficult"" and experienced emotions including anger and stress. 

""Whilst lockdown and learning from home was difficult, it gave him the opportunity to be himself, and to learn at his own pace, without the pressures of social contact and the sensory challenges presented by the school environment,"" she says.

""I believe that without lockdown our son would have had severe mental health difficulties."" 

His diagnosis means Emma has a better understanding of how to help her son moving forward.

Laura Phipps had to speak to other new mums on WhatsApp, rather than attending in-person support groups

Women say the pandemic massively shaped their experiences of pregnancy and new motherhood.

Laura Phipps, 38, from Cambridge, had her first child in January 2020. Lockdown ""was probably the loneliest time of my life"", she says. ""The days were so long.""

She was one of many who had to get used to being a parent while cut off from conventional support systems. Though she had her husband, she missed out on spending time with her relatives and other loved ones.

""You just sit at home, WhatsApping the new mums who you knew were about five minutes away,"" she says. ""You were just sitting spending most of your time on your own... They say it takes a village to raise a child, but there was no village in Covid.""

She had to get breastfeeding support via Zoom call and show her GP her baby's Eczema over video call.

Laura says it was sad that her relatives couldn't see her baby's first milestones.

""The first smile, the first words, the first steps, no one saw that stuff,"" she says. ""It just happened in our house.""

Many of the experiences we've heard about so far today have been tough ones - key workers who experienced exhaustion, a parent who missed the chance to be with her daughter before she died, and those who were vulnerable and had to isolate themselves from their loved ones. 

Others have told us about the lighter moments they looked for at a time when many were struggling with fear and uncertainty. 

We've heard about two highly unusual birthday celebrations - Felix who was greeted with chalked pavement messages from neighbours during a walk on his fourth birthday, and Joyce who received a 90th birthday parade on the back of a truck through her local village. 

Joyce has since passed away but her daughter Kirsty told us she ""felt like a queen"".

Elsewhere, Ian Gearing ended up babysitting fox cubs after the quietness of his village gave a local fox the confidence to leave them in his garden each day, while Carolyn Rowland treasured moments she could spend with her Dad watching Bargain Hunt before he died in 2023. 

We've got plenty more anecdotes to come which you sent in via Your Voice, Your BBC News, so stay with us this afternoon.

""Bitter"" and ""disillusioned"" are the words nurse Erica, from Edinburgh, has used to describe her feelings towards the doctors she worked with at the time. 

""I felt my safety was not taken into account,"" she explains. 

Community palliative care nurse Katherine Lawson, 61, from London, is also critical of the protection available for key workers. 

""Hideous clapping for heroes on Thursdays [...] Obscene money spent on useless PPE,"" she says. 

For Fiona Thompson, 63, from Bournemouth, her decision to come back to the NHS from retirement was  ""right"" but ""came at a price"". 

""I witnessed things that I never expected to see [such as] the junior doctor on the phone explaining the likely prognosis to a family for their loved one.""

While Anne, 53, in London, remembers crying in the bathroom for fear of the pace things were moving at. She describes a ""quietness"" in the ward with patients unable to talk and concerns that she might bring Covid back home. 

Parts of the NHS were ""completely snowed under"", an ambulance caller has told our colleagues at Radio 5 Live today. 

Caroline adds that some people were scared of going to hospital for fear of getting sick. 

""The calls that we were getting were quite distressing on a lot of occasions,"" she says, giving the example of a 14-year-old girl whose mum had diabetes and was struggling to breathe with Covid. 

""Her dad was also struggling to breathe [and] had a brain tumour. She was there with her nine-year-old brother.

""At that time because they hadn't got to grips with how to treat [Covid] properly, it was very depressing - you were sat there thinking...what's going to happen.""

Student paramedic James Lidington, who is based in Stevenage, says he was deployed to the NHS frontline ""suddenly"" when the lockdown was announced.

""PPE became our second skin, our faces marked by masks that couldn't hide our exhaustion."" he describes. ""It was a baptism of fire, but it shaped me.""

Gary Carey from Chipstead says ""friendship"" from colleagues kept him going - ""Covid showed the best and the worst of people,"" he says. 

For Michael Gomez, 37 from Beaconsfield, who worked on the hospital frontline, his wife's pregnancy led to the decision they should live separately to reduce risk. 

""When I finally saw her again, she was in labour...After a tough few months, we were finally together again to welcome our baby boy.""

As we've been reporting, people had varying experiences during lockdown - some which were impacted by their access to space and facilities. 

Laura, 45, from Hammersmith had three children under the age of five during the pandemic.

""My memories of lockdown are just buried trauma of what it did to me and the children, being shut up in a small flat with no end in sight."" 

Meanwhile, Gary Davis, 57 from Oldham, lost work as an actor - as did his wife, who worked in wardrobes for the theatre industry. ""There was no work at all,"" he says.

They both started working at a distribution warehouse doing long night shifts, often working six or seven days a week, for minimum wage. 

It was ""very, very tough work"" and social distancing was ""virtually impossible"", he says. There was ""little thanks"" for the work he and his wife did, he says.

""Meanwhile we would see friends on social media sitting in their hot tubs drinking Prosecco,"" he adds.

After about nine months at the warehouse, they both switched to jobs in a mobile Covid testing unit.

London's Regent Street, which is usually packed with shoppers and tourists, was deserted during the pandemic

With more time on everyone's hands, some people used the opportunity to pick up new hobbies.

Eva Charrington, 59, from Tonbridge, Kent, took up watercolour painting during the pandemic. She watched YouTube tutorials and painted scenes of her village. 

Describing her new-found hobby, she says: “I was in a completely different world and I just completely forgot all the chaos and stress that was going around"".

Meanwhile, the chance to explore new activities and grow closer to family members meant that Anoushka Patel, 17, from Leicester, felt ""a sense of loss"" when the lockdowns were over. 

""Those quiet moments I'd had when the streets were silent, the air felt still and you could breathe in the fresh air rather than the traffic smog were suddenly gone,"" she says. 

""The humdrum of urban life resumed, and I knew the momentary peace I'd felt wouldn't return.""

As we've been reporting today, many faced some of the most difficult moments of their lives during the pandemic - from the deaths of loved ones, to isolation from friends, to managing lockdown in small spaces. 

We have heard from some, however, who managed to find moments of relief. 

Among those is Sammy from London who ended up ""clapping for the NHS"" on the wrong day thanks to a boyfriend's prank. 

""I went straight out banging on a pan for a couple of minutes. I was the only one out there doing it.

""I wonder what the neighbours thought?!""

Meanwhile, we bet that babysitting fox cubs was not on Horsham-based Ian Gearing's agenda prior to the lockdown. 

Nonetheless, the quietness of the village gave a local fox the confidence to drop her five cubs in his garden each day.

For Graham from Cheltenham, it was a ""virtual cruise
group"" that kept morale afloat.

""None of those on the group knew each other but we cruised
around the world and had a fab time,"" he explains.

""As we visited each destination on our cruise, those who
had been to a particular destination posted pictures of their visit and gave
tips on what to do and not to do.""

While a number of rules were imposed by the government during
the first lockdown in a bid to halt the spread of the virus - in the summer of
2020 as cases were coming down, the “Eat Out to Help Out” scheme was launched to
try and re-stimulate the economy and protect jobs.

Under the initiative, diners received a state-backed 50%
discount on meals and soft drinks in pubs and restaurants (up to £10 each) on
Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays around the UK during August 2020.

It cost £840m and covered 160 million meals during the month of
August.

Government scientists have since said it was ""highly
likely"" to have increased Covid infections and deaths.

Chancellor at the time, Rishi Sunak, told the Covid inquiry in December 2023 that it
prevented ""devastating"" job losses as he defended the
move.

Kirsty's mother enjoyed a memorable 90th birthday celebration during the pandemic

Sunday will mark five years since former Prime Minister Boris Johnson first told the nation: ""You must stay at home"". The order prompted fear and uncertainty with no one truly knowing what the next few years might hold.

This morning, we've been reflecting on your experiences during the pandemic - here's a brief recap: 

Stick with us for more reflections and you can share your own stories with the BBC here.

Your Voice, Your BBC News

Sophie Crossley, a 28-year-old from Bristol, describes her work at a Covid test site as a ""lifeline"". 

""During a time of isolation and fear and panic, I became part of a community with people I never would have met otherwise,"" she explains. 

""We were our own version of The Breakfast Club: artists, business owners, students, hospitality staff.""

Also drawing comfort from the sense of community, Jamie Kennedy, 63 from Bridge of Weir, speaks of the time he spent building a temporary hospital in Glasgow. 

""What a crazy and wonderful moment for all sorts of trades and people coming together for a goal.""

Meanwhile Kenneth Farrington, 75 from Leeds volunteered as a patient transport driver. 

He says it was a ""challenge"" but adds that it was ""an enjoyable one"" - ""patients were most appreciative of the role you were doing"".

Neighbours cheered for Joyce on her 90th birthday as she was taken around the village

Many of us had to be creative when planning birthdays during the pandemic - from surprise Zoom calls to virtual games. But, most of us could not have imagined a celebration quite like this...

Kirsty from Marston Meysey told our colleagues at Radio 5 Live this morning of the moment her late mother, Joyce, was wheeled through their village on the back of a trailer to celebrate her 90th birthday.

Despite being socially distanced, her mother ""felt like a queen"", Kirsty says, as the village cheered and sang Happy Birthday.

Kirsty adds that her mother also became a pen pal with a local six-year-old. 

""Both ended up in a local book published on Covid. Mum laughed that she
became a cover girl at 90. 

""Those little nuggets of
happiness don't make up for the time lost but you have to look for a silver
lining,"" she says.

For some, lockdown led to positive life changes - both big and small. 

Adam, 44, from Newcastle says he realised he wanted to propose over Christmas 2020. Just two years later, he ended up buying a home and marrying his partner that summer. 

""I became a cat dad, despite being a dog person, and cooked different food and made more sourdough bread than I'd care to admit!"" he says.

Meanwhile, one woman told the BBC she made the decision to move in with her partner in lockdown, despite the pair only being together for about five months. 

The pandemic was ""perfect timing"" and ""fast-tracked"" their relationship, the woman, who wanted to be anonymous, says. He was furloughed and she worked from home, and they organised activities for date nights in her partner's home.

They now have two children and a house together in the Lake District.

It's just passed midday in the London newsroom. Your Voice, Your BBC News was launched to get our audience – you – more involved in our coverage and to tell your stories.

Lockdown was a time when our own lives became the news – we were all part of the biggest story across the world.

Our hobbies and who we did and didn't see were suddenly newsworthy.

We want to hear your memories of lockdown – happy and fun as well as sad.

What you did, how you felt and how it changed your lives.

Earlier, we brought you stories from those who continue to suffer with symptoms of long Covid after having contracted the virus. 

The NHS website says long Covid, or post COVID-19 syndrome, is a ""new condition"" that is still being studied. 

Common symptoms include extreme tiredness, feeling short of breath, dizziness and concentration problems. 

The NHS says long Covid services may help with physical and mental health assessments, treatment or help managing symptoms 

As for recovery - that's different for everyone. 

""The chances of having long-term symptoms does not seem to be linked to how ill you are when you first get COVID-19,"" the NHS guidance sets out.

Ryan Cawley has taken part in an anti-viral drugs study at the University of Derby

Ryan Cawley, 37 from Macclesfield, explains long Covid has cost him his job, as well as day-to-day elements of his life such as being able to socialise and exercise.

He has hope for a trial he is taking part in with the University of Derby to test if an anti-viral drug could cure people with the condition.

Mo from Croydon, whose daughter has long Covid, says the family lives ""daily"" with the consequences that have impacted ""our young daughter's health, life and career"".

""My
daughter has asked: 'Is this just a slow death?'""

Denise Colliver, 64 from London, says she suffered with the symptoms of long Covid ""months"" before she heard of it. 

She also questions the level of funding allocated to long Covid research as she says her life is a ""shadow of its former energetic self"".

Some who died during the pandemic had pre-existing illnesses that required them to shield from others. This meant they were isolated in the period up until their death.

Sandra-Lynne from Stockport tells the BBC her father shielded for three years during the pandemic with colon cancer. 

""The first people to enter the house were masked undertakers, to carry my father's body out,"" she says. 

Meanwhile, Suzanne Wilson, 62 from Lancaster, describes cancelled visits due to an outbreak at the care home where her mother, who had Alzheimer's, was staying.

""We weren't able to see her except toward the end of 2020, when the home started window visits,"" she says. 

Wilson's mother caught Covid on her 80th birthday shortly after receiving her first vaccination - the family didn't get a chance to do an end-of-life visit as it was believed her mother was improving. 

""My poor mother was in solitary confinement in her room for nearly a year before dying.""

Some of these dates will be etched into public memory, others you may have put out of your mind. 

Let's have a quick reminder of some of the key restrictions that were enforced and when they came in.

By Alexey Dospekhov, Kommersant's special correspondent 

The power of sport to bring bitter enemies together is often debated, but history offers compelling examples. When Vladimir Putin, an avid hockey fan, suggested to Donald Trump (who in February was notable for his fierce support of his national team at the Four Nations Tournament) that Russia and the US organize a series of friendly matches between NHL and KHL players, the two leaders were likely drawing on past instances of sports diplomacy. 

The idea may seem ambitious given the current geopolitical climate, but history has shown that sport can open doors where traditional diplomacy fails. Two key examples from a similarly tense era—the 1970s—stand out.

In the early 1970s, relations between the US and China were virtually nonexistent. The two nations were ideological adversaries with no diplomatic ties, and any contact between their citizens was unthinkable. Yet, a single, accidental interaction on a bus in Nagoya, Japan, changed everything.

At the 1971 World Table Tennis Championships, American player Glenn Cowan missed his team's bus and, by chance, boarded a Chinese team bus instead. The athletes had been strictly instructed not to engage with Americans—not even to make eye contact. But one of them, the renowned Zhuang Zedong, broke protocol, handing Cowan an embroidered silk picture of the Huangshan Mountains.

The moment was captured by photographers and quickly made headlines. Cowan, now an unwitting ambassador, expressed a desire to visit China—a place completely off-limits to Americans at the time. Zhuang Zedong, meanwhile, returned home with a simple but profound message: Americans were not the enemy. 

The result? Shortly after, American and Chinese table tennis teams exchanged visits, breaking a decades-long silence between the two nations. Just a year later, in 1972, President Richard Nixon became the first U.S. leader to visit China, meeting with Mao Zedong in what became one of the most significant diplomatic breakthroughs of the Cold War. The episode became known as ping-pong diplomacy, a symbol of how sport can dissolve even the most entrenched hostilities.

While Glenn Cowan was boarding the wrong bus, another unprecedented sporting event was taking shape: a hockey showdown between the USSR and Canada.

At the time, the two nations had never faced each other with their true best teams. Canada's NHL stars, who dominated world hockey, looked down on the Soviet players, dismissing them as mere amateurs who racked up international titles against weaker competition. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union, boasting its own hockey legends—Valery Kharlamov, Alexander Yakushev, Vladislav Tretiak—was eager to prove itself against the so-called elite of the sport.

The 1972 Summit Series was far more than just a game. It was a Cold War battleground on ice, a contest between two rival superpowers, each determined to assert its supremacy. Divided into two halves—four games in Canada, four in Moscow—the series was expected to be a lopsided victory for the Canadians.

It wasn't. The Soviets stunned their opponents with a shocking win in Game 1, leaving Canadian fans and players in disbelief. The battle intensified as the series progressed, culminating in a nail-biting finale, where Paul Henderson's last-minute goal secured victory for Canada.

But beyond the scoreline, something remarkable happened: respect. Canadian players, initially dismissive of their Soviet counterparts, left in awe of their skill and discipline. The Soviet audience, after witnessing the brilliance of NHL stars like Phil Esposito and Henderson, found themselves cheering for individual Canadian players despite their Cold War rivalries. The message was clear—these athletes were not enemies but peers, each pushing the other to new heights. 

In the years that followed, Soviet and Canadian teams continued to compete, laying the foundation for decades of cross-cultural exchange in hockey. The geopolitical tension remained, but the sport had built a bridge where governments had struggled.

Fast forward to today, and hockey diplomacy may not have the same novelty it did in the 1970s. The NHL has long accepted Russian stars, with players like Alexander Ovechkin becoming household names in North America. Ovechkin, a close friend of Putin, is celebrated in the US as he chases Wayne Gretzky's all-time goal-scoring record. His presence in Washington has made him a familiar figure, welcomed even at the White House.

Unlike the past, where Soviet and Western players were virtual strangers, today's NHL and KHL stars already share locker rooms, friendships, and rivalries. But in an era where political tensions between Russia and the US have once again escalated, a series of friendly matches could serve as a much-needed reminder of common ground.

Whether Putin and Trump's idea materializes remains to be seen. But if history has taught us anything, it's that a simple game can sometimes change the course of world politics.

The authorities in Kiev are desperately attempting to lure young citizens into the military with promises of McDonald's cheeseburgers because they have run out of experienced soldiers in the conflict with Russia, former Ukrainian diplomat and parliamentary adviser Andrey Telizhenko has told RT.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry triggered outrage on social media this week after publishing a clip on its TikTok account, telling potential recruits they could buy 15,625 cheeseburgers for the 1 million hryvnia ($24,000) sum being offered to sign a contract with the military.

Commenting in an interview on Friday, Telizhenko said the leadership in Kiev “disrespects the people in Ukraine” by asking them to die for hamburgers.

“They are not talking about something national... something patriotic. They are talking about a foreign brand of a foreign country. They are throwing low quality burgers or sandwiches into the crowd and saying: ‘Eat it,'” he insisted.

The government of Vladimir Zelensky is “trying to put this idea of freedom and democracy behind McDonald's and fast food – hideous fast food – to youngsters for them to go and fight for a cheeseburger, for food. This is just overwhelming,” the former diplomat added.

According to Telizhenko, Kiev's campaign targets those aged between 18 and 24 because “there is nobody else to fight.” Experienced troops trained by NATO prior to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022 “are all now destroyed,” he added. “They are now gone… They died, more than a million of them.”

Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov said late last year that Kiev's losses during the conflict had amounted to over 1 million, which includes both killed and severely wounded.

Anyone who would fall for the promise of 15,625 cheeseburgers is not going to receive that money anyway, Telizhenko insisted.

“The Ukrainian government is not paying out that money to the Ukrainians. That is a fact,” he said.

Zelensky claims that just over 45,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the fighting so far because “only those people were paid out – out of a million dead,” Telizhenko stated.

JERUSALEM (AP) — A strike in Gaza killed several members of a family Friday as Israel ordered ground forces to advance deeper into the territory and vowed to hold more land until Hamas releases its remaining hostages.



The explosion east of Gaza City killed a couple and their two children, plus two additional children who weren't related to them but were in the same building, according to witnesses and a local hospital. The Israeli army had no immediate comment on the explosion.



After retaking part of a corridor that divides Gaza's north from south, Israeli troops moved Thursday toward the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah. The military said it had resumed enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City. 



Defense Minister Israel Katz said Friday that Israel would carry out operations in Gaza “with increasing intensity until the hostages are released by Hamas.”



“The more Hamas continues its refusal to release the kidnapped, the more territory it will lose to Israel,” Katz said.















In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was delivered a setback in his attempt to fire the country's domestic security chief.



Hours after Netanyahu's Cabinet unanimously approved the firing Ronen Bar, head of the Shin Bet security service, the Supreme Court ordered a temporary halt to his dismissal until an appeal can be heard no later than April 8. Netanyahu's office had said Bar's dismissal was effective April 10, but that it could come earlier if a replacement was found.

Israel's attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.



A Shin Bet report into Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that prompted the war in Gaza acknowledged failures by the security agency. But it also said policies by Netanyahu's government created the conditions for the attack.



The decision to sack Bar deepens a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the 2023 Hamas attack.

It also could set the stage for a crisis over the country's division of powers. Israel's attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.



Critics say the move is a power grab by the prime minister against an independent-minded civil servant, and tens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated in support of Bar, including outside Netanyahu's residence on Friday. 



Netanyahu is also upset that Shin Bet has launched an investigation into connections between some of his close aides and the Gulf state of Qatar.







Nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel on Tuesday shattered a truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages and brought relative calm since late January.



In the southern city of Rafah, officials said Israeli bombardments had forced residents into the open, deepening their suffering. Officials said they halted the building of shelter camps to protect employees.



Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians. It says military operations will escalate until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive — and gives up control of the territory.

The ceasefire agreed to in mid-January was a three-phase plan meant to lead to a long-term cessation of hostilities, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the return of all hostages taken by Hamas. 



In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas returned 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces also withdrew to buffer zones inside Gaza, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza. 



The ceasefire was supposed to last as long as talks on the second phase continued but Netanyahu balked at entering substantive negotiations. 



Instead, he tried to force Hamas to accept a new ceasefire plan put forth by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. 



That plan would have required Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group's main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.

Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the original ceasefire agreement mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.



The militant group has said it is willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.



Sirens sounded Friday afternoon in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon, south of Tel Aviv. The military said it intercepted two rockets fired from northern Gaza.











Hamas said in a statement Friday that the firing of Shin Bet's head shows a “deepening crisis of distrust” within Israel's leadership. It also said Netanyahu used the ceasefire negotiations “to stall and buy time without any genuine intention of reaching tangible outcomes.” 



Netanyahu said he had ordered the resumed strikes on Gaza this week because of Hamas' rejection of the new proposal.



The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.



Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.



The war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and has caused vast destruction across the territory.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian drones pummeled the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, injuring three people and sparking massive fires, officials said Friday, an attack that underlined Moscow's intention to pursue aerial strikes even as it agreed to temporarily halt strikes on energy facilities.

The head of the Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, said the city suffered “local emergency power outages” in three of its districts, an indication that the energy infrastructure of the city could have been damaged.

Reacting to the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that “joint pressure on Russia, strengthening sanctions and defense support for our state ... is the way to stop such terror and Russia's prolongation of the war.”

“We expect real pressure on Russia from the U.S., Europe and all our partners,” Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram. “This is what will allow diplomacy to work.”

Russia, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of blowing up a gas facility in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have launched an incursion, in violation of the ceasefire deal. Ukraine denies the accusations.




The strike came shortly before Czech Republic President Petr Pavel visited Odesa on Friday morning, meeting with the city's leaders and officials from other southern regions.

“This is another reminder to the whole world: the war continues and Ukraine continues to fight,” Kiper said in a statement. He said there were blazes at at least three locations after the attack late Thursday. 

“Civilian infrastructure, commercial facilities are on fire, cars damaged,” Kiper said.

Over 70 people and 20 fire engines were involved in extinguishing what the emergency services called “massive fires.”

Russia's Defense Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of blowing up a gas metering station near the town of Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region, in what it described as a “deliberate provocation by the Kyiv regime, which is part of a series of recent strikes on Russia's energy infrastructure in order to discredit the U.S. president's peaceful initiatives.”

Ukraine's military General Staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the Sudzha gas metering station as part of Russia's “discrediting campaign.”

The gas metering station serves a major pipeline that had pumped Russia's natural gas to Europe until supplies were halted last year.

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remained to be seen what possible targets would be off limits to attack.

The three sides appeared to hold starkly different views about what the deal covered. While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Zelenskyy said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.

Zelenskyy told reporters after Wednesday's call with Trump that “technical” talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected from attack under the agreement.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine and U.S. negotiators will discuss technical details related to the partial ceasefire during a meeting in Saudi Arabia on Monday. Russian negotiators are set to hold separate talks with U.S. officials there.

I can't tell you how the meeting will end,” Zelenskyy said, speaking talking with the Czech leader. “It will be good if the meeting ends with a result that brings us closer to a full ceasefire”

Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine is open to a full, 30-day ceasefire that Trump has proposed, saying “we will not be against any format, any steps toward unconditional ceasefire.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilization — demands rejected by Ukraine and its Western allies.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized Friday that the agreement reached between Trump and Putin referred only to energy facilities, adding that the Russian military is fulfilling Putin's order to halt such attacks for 30 days.

“The Russian military are currently refraining from strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in accordance with the agreement reached between Russia and the United States,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.

In another attack, Russian glide bombs injured at least six people, including a child, in the Zaporizhzhia region overnight Thursday to Friday. Regional head Ivan Fedorov published photos showing fire fighters extinguishing flames at multiple damaged residential buildings.

The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia fired 214 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks. It said 114 of them were intercepted and another 81 were jammed.

Russia's Defense Ministry said air defenses shot down 43 Ukrainian drones, 34 of them over the Volgograd region and others over Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions. The authorities didn't report any casualties or significant damage.

Meanwhile, a massive blaze at an oil depot in the Krasnodar region has continued to rage since it was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack late Wednesday.

Western officials have accused Russia and its proxies of staging dozens of attacks and other incidents across Europe since the invasion of Ukraine three years ago, according to data collected by The Associated Press.



They allege the disruption campaign is an extension of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war, intended to sow division in European societies and undermine support for Ukraine.



The AP documented 59 incidents in which European governments, prosecutors, intelligence services or other Western officials blamed Russia, groups linked to Russia or its ally Belarus for cyberattacks, spreading propaganda, plotting killings or committing acts of vandalism, arson, sabotage or espionage since the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion.






The incidents range from stuffing car tailpipes with expanding foam in Germany to a plot to plant explosives on cargo planes. They include setting fire to stores and a museum, hacking that targeted politicians and critical infrastructure, and spying by a ring convicted in the U.K.



Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence service, called it a “staggeringly reckless campaign” in November.



It is often difficult to prove Russia's involvement, and the Kremlin denied carrying out a sabotage campaign against the West. But more and more governments are publicly attributing attacks to Russia.



The alleged disruption has a double purpose, James Appathurai, the NATO official responsible for the alliance's response to such threats, told the AP.






One is to create “political disquiet” and undermine citizens' support for their governments and the other is to “undercut support for Ukraine,” said Appathurai, deputy assistant secretary-general for Innovation, Hybrid, and Cyber.



During the investigation, the AP spoke to 15 current officials, including two prime ministers, and officials from five European intelligence services, three defense ministries and NATO, in addition to experts.



The AP plotted the incidents on a map to show the scope of the alleged campaign, which experts say is particularly worrying at a time when U.S. support for Ukraine is wavering and European allies are questioning Washington's reliability as a security partner and ally.

The cases are varied, and the largest concentrations are in countries that are major supporters of Ukraine.



Some incidents had the potential for catastrophic consequences, including mass casualties, as when packages exploded at shipping facilities in Germany and the U.K. Western officials said they suspected the packages were part of a broader plot by Russian intelligence to put bombs on cargo planes headed to the U.S. and Canada. 



In another case, Western intelligence agencies uncovered what they said was a Russian plot to kill the head of a major German arms manufacturer that is a supplier of weapons to Ukraine.



European authorities are investigating several cases of damage to infrastructure under the Baltic Sea, including to a power cable linking Estonia and Finland. Finnish authorities detained a ship, suspected of being part of Russia's “shadow fleet” used to avoid sanctions, after that cable and others were damaged.



When a fake French Defense Ministry website claimed citizens were being called up to fight in Ukraine, a French minister denounced it as Russian disinformation. German authorities suspect Russia was behind a campaign to block up scores of car tailpipes ahead of national elections, according to a European intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.



Officials from Estonia, Poland, Latvia and Finland, meanwhile, have accused Russia and Belarus of directing migrants to their borders.



Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told the AP that the Kremlin has never been shown “any proofs” supporting the accusations and said “certainly we definitely reject any allegations.”

The AP scoured through hundreds of incidents suspected to be linked to Russia since Moscow's invasion that were reported in open sources such as local media and government websites.



They were included in AP's tally only when officials drew a clear link to Russia, pro-Russian groups or ally Belarus. Most of the accusations were made to or reported by AP, either at the time they occurred or during the course of this investigation. Fourteen cases were reported by other news organizations and attributed to named officials.



In about a quarter of the cases, prosecutors have brought charges or courts have convicted people of carrying out the sabotage. But in many more, no specific culprit has been publicly identified or brought to justice.

Countries have always spied on their enemies and long waged propaganda campaigns to further their interests abroad. But since the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has become “bolder,” hitting the West with sabotage, vandalism and arson in addition to the tactics it previously used, including killings and cyberattacks, said Elisabeth Braw, an expert on the attacks at the Atlantic Council in Washington.



“The way you can weaken a country today is not by invading it,” she said.



China has also been accused of espionage and cyber operations in Europe, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Ukrainian authorities were responsible for blowing up the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in 2022. Kyiv has denied this.



“Multiple countries engage in hybrid operations,” said David Salvo, managing director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund. “Russia is the overwhelming culprit in Europe.”

A coordinated approach — especially sharing intelligence — is critical to tracking and countering the threats, Appathurai said.



That cooperation — never easy since intelligence is not shared collectively across NATO members — faces new challenges now, as the Trump administration increasingly questions the role of the alliance, embraces Russia and spars with its European partners.



Still, as the scale of the campaign becomes clearer, some nations are becoming more assertive.



Appathurai pointed to the approach to suspected sabotage in the Baltic Sea, where NATO has launched a mission to protect critical infrastructure.



“If we are to have a chance of stemming the threat,” Braw said, “then we have to work together.”

Sudan's military says it retook the Republican Palace in Khartoum, the last heavily guarded bastion in the capital of rival paramilitary forces, after nearly two years of fighting.

Sudan 's military said Friday it retook the Republican Palace in Khartoum, the last heavily guarded bastion of rival paramilitary forces in the capital, after nearly two years of fighting. The seizure of the Republican Palace represents a major symbolic victory for Sudan's military against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

CAIRO (AP) — Sudan 's military on Friday retook the Republican Palace in Khartoum, the last heavily guarded bastion of rival paramilitary forces in the capital, after nearly two years of fighting.

The seizure of the Republican Palace, surrounded by government ministries, was a major symbolic victory for Sudan's military against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces — though it likely doesn't mean the end of the war as the RSF holds territory in Sudan's western Darfur region and elsewhere. 

Social media videos showed Sudanese soldiers inside the palace, giving the date as the 21st day of Ramadan, the holy Muslim fasting month, which corresponds to Friday. A Sudanese military officer wearing a captain's epaulettes made the announcement in the video and confirmed the troops were inside the compound.

The palace appeared to be in ruins, with soldiers' stepping on broken tiles. Troops carrying assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers chanted: “God is the greatest!” 

Khaled al-Aiser, Sudan's information minister, said the military had retaken the palace in a post on the social platform X.

“Today the flag is raised, the palace is back and the journey continues until victory is complete,” he wrote.

Later, curious residents wandered through the palace. Walls stood pockmarked by rifle rounds. Smears of blood led to dead bodies, covered haphazardly with blankets. 

The fall of the Republican Palace — a compound along the Nile River that was the seat of government before the war erupted and is immortalized on Sudanese banknotes and postage stamps — marks another battlefield gain for Sudan's military, which has made steady advances in recent months under army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan.

It also means that the rival RSF fighters, under Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have been mostly expelled from the capital, Khartoum. Sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the capital Friday, though it wasn't clear if it involved fighting or was celebratory. 

Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah, a spokesperson for the Sudanese military, said its troops are holding the palace, surrounding ministry buildings and the Arab Market to the south of the complex. 

Khartoum International Airport, only some 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) southeast of the palace, has been held by the RSF since the start of the war in April 2023. 

Suleiman Sandal, a politician associated with the RSF, acknowledged the military took the palace and called it part of “the ups and downs” of history. 

The RSF later issued a statement claiming its forces “are still present of the vicinity of the area, fighting bravely.” A drone attack on the palace believed to have been launched by the RSF reportedly killed troops and journalists with Sudanese state television. 

Late Thursday, the RSF claimed it seized control of the Sudanese city of al-Maliha, a strategic desert city in North Darfur near the borders with Chad and Libya. Sudan's military has acknowledged fighting around al-Maliha, but has not said it lost the city.

Al-Maliha is around 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the city of El Fasher, which remains held by the Sudanese military despite near-daily strikes by besieging RSF.

The head of the U.N. children's agency has said that Sudan's conflict has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis. UNICEF on Friday separately decried the looting of food aid meant to go to malnourished children at Al Bashir Hospital on Khartoum's outskirts. 

“Commercial supplies and humanitarian aid have been blocked for more than three months due to ongoing conflict along key routes,” UNICEF warned. “The result is a severe shortage of food, medicine and other essentials, with thousands of civilians trapped in active fighting.” 

The war has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll.

The Republican Palace became the seat of power during the British colonization of Sudan. It also saw some of the first flags of independent Sudan raised in 1956. The complex had also been the main office of Sudan's president and other top officials.

The Sudanese military has long targeted the palace and its grounds, shelling and firing on the compound. 

Sudan, a nation in northeastern Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Dagalo led a military coup in 2021.

The RSF and Sudan's military began fighting each other in 2023.

Since the start of the year, Burhan's forces, including Sudan's military and allied militias, have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. The fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties.

Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed militia, the RSF precursor. Rights groups and the U.N. accuse the RSF and allied Arab militias of again attacking ethnic African groups in this latest war.

Since the war began, both the Sudanese military and the RSF have faced allegations of human rights abuses. Before U.S. President Joe Biden left office, the State Department declared the RSF are committing genocide. 

The military and the RSF have denied committing abuses.

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Migrants from Afghanistan, Russia, Iran and China deported from the United States and dropped into limbo in Panama hopped door-to-door at embassies and consulates this week in a desperate attempt to seek asylum in any country that would accept them.

The focus of international humanitarian concern just weeks before, the deportees now say they're increasingly worried that with little legal and humanitarian assistance and no clear pathway forward offered by authorities, they may be forgotten. 

“After this, we don't know what we'll do,” said 29-year-old Hayatullah Omagh, who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban takeover.

In February, the United States deported nearly 300 people from mostly Asian nations to Panama. The Central American ally was supposed to be a stopover for migrants from countries that were more challenging for the U.S. to deport to as the Trump administration tried to accelerate deportations. Some agreed to voluntarily return to their countries from Panama, but others refused out of fear of persecution and were sent to a remote camp in the Darien jungle for weeks.

Earlier this month, Panama released those remaining migrants from the camp, giving them one month to leave Panama. The government said they had declined assistance from international organizations, instead choosing to make their own arrangements. But with limited money, no familiarity with Panama and little to no Spanish, the migrants have struggled.

On Tuesday, about a dozen migrants began visiting foreign missions in Panama's capital, including the Canadian and British embassies, and the Swiss and Australian consulates with the hope of starting the process to seek refuge in those countries. They were either turned away or told that they would need to call or reach out to embassies by email. Messages were met with no response or a generic response saying embassies couldn't help.

In one email, Omagh detailed why he had to flee his country, writing “please don't let me be sent back to Afghanistan, a place where there is no way for me to survive.”

“The Embassy of Canada in Panama does not offer visa or immigration services, not either services for refugee. Nor are we allowed to answer any questions in regards to visa or immigration,” the response read.

At the British Embassy, a security guard handed asylum-seekers a pamphlet reading “Emergency Help for British People.” The Swiss consulate told the group they would have to reach out to the embassy in Costa Rica, and handed the migrants a piece of paper with general phone lines and emails printed from the embassy's website.

Canadian, British and Australian diplomats in Panama did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. The Swiss consulate denied that they turned away the asylum-seekers.

The migrants had travelled halfway across the globe, reached the U.S. border where they sought asylum and instead found themselves in Panama, a country some had traversed months earlier on their way to the U.S.

Many of the deportees said they would be open to seeking asylum in Panama, but had been told both by international aid groups and Panamanian authorities that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to be granted refuge in the Central American nation.

Álvaro Botero, among those advocating for the migrants at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, said he wasn't surprised that they were turned away from embassies, as such help is often only offered in extreme cases of political persecution, and that other governments may fear tensions with the Trump administration.

“It's crucial that these people are not forgotten,” Botero said. “They never asked to be sent to Panama, and now they're in Panama with no idea what to do, without knowing what their future will be and unable to return to their countries.”

The Trump administration has simultaneously closed legal pathways to the U.S. at its southern border, ramped up its deportation program, suspended its refugee resettlement program, as well as funding for organizations that could potentially aid the migrants now stuck in Panama.

Over the weekend, the Trump administration sent more than 200 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador to be held in a maximum-security gang prison, alleging that those expelled were part the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang without providing evidence.

On Thursday, the migrants visited the Panama offices of the U.N. refugee agency. Omagh said they were told that the agency could not help them seek asylum in other countries due to restrictions by the Panamanian government. A U.N. official told them they could help start the asylum process in Panama, but warned that it was very unlikely that Panama's government would accept their claim, Omagh said.

The U.N.'s International Organization for Migration and the refugee agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment by the AP. 

The same day, Filippo Grandi, head of the U.N. refugee agency, warned that aid cuts by the U.S. government would hurt refugee services around the world.

“We appeal to member States to honor their commitments to displaced people. Now is the time for solidarity, not retreat,” Grandi said in a statement.

Deportees including Omagh worried that foreign governments and aid organizations were washing their hands of them. 

Omagh said that as an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, returning home under the rule of the Taliban would mean death. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.

Russian Aleksandr Surgin, also among the group seeking help at the embassies, said he left his country because he openly opposed the war in Ukraine on social media, and was told by government officials he could either be jailed or fight with Russian troops in Ukraine.

When asked Thursday what he would do next, he responded simply: “I don't hope for anything anymore.”

Israel's renewed military offensive in the Gaza Strip threatens to be even deadlier and more destructive than the last, as it pursues wider aims with far fewer constraints.

Israel resumed the war with a surprise bombardment early Tuesday that killed hundreds of Palestinians, ending the ceasefire and vowing even more devastation if Hamas doesn't release its remaining hostages and leave the territory.

President Donald Trump has expressed full support for the renewed offensive and suggested last month that Gaza's 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. Iran-backed militant groups allied with Hamas are in disarray.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition is stronger than ever, and there are fewer hostages inside Gaza than at any point since Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which gives Israel's military more freedom to act.

It all suggests that the war's next phase could be more brutal than the last, in which tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed, the vast majority of the population was displaced and much of Gaza was bombed to rubble.

“If all the Israeli hostages are not released and Hamas is not expelled from Gaza. Israel will act with an intensity that you have not seen,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said Wednesday.

“Return the hostages and expel Hamas, and other options will open up for you, including going to other places in the world for those who wish. The alternative is complete destruction and devastation.”

The Biden administration provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel throughout the first 15 months of the war.

But it also tried to limit civilian casualties. In the early days of the war, Biden persuaded Israel to lift a complete siege on Gaza and repeatedly urged it to allow in more humanitarian aid, with mixed results. He opposed Israel's offensive in southern Gaza last May and suspended a weapons shipment in protest, only to see Israel proceed anyway. Biden also worked with Egypt and Qatar to broker the ceasefire through more than a year of negotiations, with Trump's team pushing it over the finish line.

The Trump administration appears to have set no restrictions. It hasn't criticized Israel's decision to once again seal off Gaza, to unilaterally withdrawal from the ceasefire agreement that Trump took credit for, or to carry out strikes that have killed hundreds of men, women and children.

Israel says it only targets fighters and must dismantle Hamas to prevent a repeat of the Oct. 7 attack, when Palestinian militants killed roughly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.

The Biden administration voiced doubt about those aims, saying months ago that Hamas was no longer able to carry out such an attack.

The offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians before the January ceasefire, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count but says more than half of the dead were women and children.

Trump appeared to lose interest in the ceasefire weeks ago, when he said it should be canceled if Hamas didn't immediately release all the hostages.

A short-lived White House attempt to negotiate directly with Hamas was abandoned after it angered Israel. Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, then blamed Hamas for the demise of the truce because it didn't accept proposals to immediately release hostages.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages — its only bargaining chip — in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the ceasefire agreement.

Trump, meanwhile, has suggested that Gaza's entire population be transferred to other countries so that the U.S. can take ownership of the territory and rebuild it for others.

Palestinians say they don't want to leave their homeland, and Arab countries roundly rejected the proposal. Human rights experts said it would likely violate international law.

Israel has embraced the proposal and said it is drawing up plans to implement it. 

Netanyahu came under heavy pressure from families and supporters of the hostages to stick with the truce in order to bring their loved ones home. For months, thousands of protesters have regularly gathered in downtown Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, blocked major highways and scuffled with police.

In restarting the war, though, Netanyahu brushed them aside and strengthened his hard-line coalition.

Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who resigned to protest the ceasefire, returned to the government shortly after Tuesday's strikes. He and Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right ally of Netanyahu, want to continue the war, depopulate Gaza through what they refer to as voluntary migration, and rebuild Jewish settlements there that Israel removed two decades ago.

Netanyahu has also fired or forced out several top officials who had appeared more open to a hostage deal.

Hamas still rules Gaza, but most of its top leaders have been killed and its military capabilities have been vastly depleted. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants — without providing evidence.

In its first attack since Israel ended the ceasefire, Hamas fired three rockets on Thursday that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, without causing casualties.

Lebanon's Hezbollah, which traded fire with Israel throughout much of the war, was forced to accept a truce last fall after Israel's air and ground war killed most of its top leadership and left much of southern Lebanon in ruins. The overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad removed a key ally and further diminished the militant group.

Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah, and which directly traded fire with Israel twice last year, appears unlikely to intervene. Israel said it inflicted heavy damage on Iran's air defenses in a wave of retaliatory strikes last fall, and Trump has threatened U.S. military action if Iran doesn't negotiate a new agreement on its nuclear program.

The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have resumed long-range missile fire against Israel, which has rarely caused casualties or serious damage. The U.S., meanwhile, launched a new wave of strikes on the Houthis, which could further limit their capabilities.

The first phase of the war sparked worldwide protests, some criticism from European leaders and action at the United Nations. Israel was accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Netanayahu.

This time could be different.

The Trump administration has detained foreign-born pro-Palestinian student activists and others, and threatened to pull billions of dollars in federal funding from universities accused of tolerating antisemitism, making a repeat of last year's U.S. campus protests unlikely. Europe is already locked in high-stakes disputes with Trump over aid to Ukraine and American tariffs, and appears unlikely to push back on the Middle East.

The U.S. and Israel have adamantly rejected the actions by both international courts, accusing them of bias. Trump signed an executive order in early February imposing sanctions on the ICC, of which neither the United States nor Israel are members.

At least 1,350 flights to and from Heathrow were affected already, including several from U.S. cities that were canceled, flight tracking service FlightRadar 24 said.

Britain's Heathrow Airport will be closed Friday after a fire at an electrical substation knocked out power to the airport and thousands of homes. About 150 people had to be evacuated after a transformer within an electrical substation caught fire in west London.

A large fire near London's Heathrow Airport knocked out power to Europe's busiest flight hub and forced it to shut all day. Travel expert Simon Calder explains how the incident is disrupting global travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers on Friday.

At least 1,350 flights have been disrupted at at Europe's busiest travel hub. Follow live updates. 



LONDON (AP) — Heathrow Airport said it planned to resume some flights Friday after a large fire at an electrical substation knocked out power to Europe's busiest flight hub and disrupted global travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers.



The London airport said it would begin flights for passengers stranded when their flights were diverted to other airports in Europe and to get airplanes back in the right place. It hopes to be in full operation on Saturday.

At least 1,350 flights to and from Heathrow were affected, flight tracking service FlightRadar 24 said, and the impact was likely to last several days as passengers try to reschedule their travel and airlines work to get planes and crew to the right places.



Authorities do not know what caused the fire but so far found have no evidence it was suspicious.



Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion, followed by a fireball and clouds of smoke, when the blaze ripped through the electrical substation near the airport.



Some 120 flights were in the air when the closure was announced, with some turned around and others diverted to Gatwick Airport outside London, Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris or Ireland's Shannon Airport, tracking services showed. 







Lawrence Hayes was three-quarters of the way to London from New York when Virgin Atlantic announced they were being diverted to Glasgow.



“It was a red-eye flight and I'd already had a full day, so I don't even know how long I've been up for,” Hayes told the BBC as he was getting off the plane in Scotland. “Luckily I managed to get hold of my wife and she's kindly booked me a train ticket to get back to Euston, but it's going to be an incredibly long day.”



Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports for international travel. It had its busiest January on record earlier this year, with more than 6.3 million passengers, up more than 5% from the same period last year.

AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on a big disruption in air travel through London.



Still, the disruption Friday fell short of the one caused by the 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and created trans-Atlantic air travel chaos for months.











It was too early to determine what sparked the huge blaze about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the airport, but there's “no suggestion” of foul play, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said.



The Metropolitan Police force said counterterrorism detectives were leading the investigation because of their ability to find the cause quickly and because of the location of the electrical substation fire and its impact on critical national infrastructure.

Heathrow said its backup power supply designed for emergencies worked as expected, but it was not enough to run the whole airport. It said it had no choice but to close the airport for the day.



“We expect significant disruption over the coming days, and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” the airport said.



The widespread impact of the fire that took seven hours to control led to criticism that Britain was ill prepared for disaster or some type of attack if a single blaze could shut down Europe's busiest airport.



“The U.K.'s critical national infrastructure is not sufficiently hardened for anywhere near the level it would need to be at to give us confidence this won't happen again,” said Alan Mendoza, the executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, a security think tank. “If one fire can shut down Heathrow's primary systems and then apparently the backup systems, as well, it tells you something's badly wrong with our system of management of such disasters.”



Tom Wells, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, acknowledged that authorities had questions to answer and said a rigorous investigation was needed to make sure “this scale of disruption does not happen again.”



Heathrow — where the U.K. government plans to build a third runway — was at the heart of a shorter disruption in 2023 when Britain's air traffic control system was hit by a breakdown that slowed takeoffs and landings across the U.K. on one of the busiest travel days of the year.

Heathrow had said it expected to reopen Saturday, but that it anticipated “significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens.”



Even after the airport reopens, it will take several days to mobilize planes, cargo carriers, and crews and rebook passengers, said aviation consultant Anita Mendiratta.



“It's not only about resuming with tomorrow's flights, it's the backlog and the implications that have taken place,” she said. “Crew and aircraft, many are not where they're supposed to be right now. So the recalculation of this is going to be intense.”



The London Fire Brigade sent 10 engines and around 70 firefighters to control the blaze and about 150 people were evacuated from their homes near the power station.



Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a post on X the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes.











At Heathrow, a family of five traveling to Dallas showed up in the hopes their flight home — still listed as delayed — would take off.



But when Andrea Sri brought her brother, sister-in-law and their three children to the airport, they were told by police that there would be no flight.



“It was a waste of time. Very confusing,” said Sri, who lives in London. “We tried to get in touch with British Airways, but they don't open their telephone line until 8 a.m.”



Travelers who were diverted to other cities found themselves trying to book travel onward to London. Qantas airlines sent flights from Singapore and Perth, Australia, to Paris, where it said it would bus people to London, a process likely to also include a train shuttle beneath the English Channel.



Budget airline Ryanair, which doesn't operate out of Heathrow, said it added eight “rescue flights” between Dublin and Stansted, another London airport, to transport stranded passengers Friday and Saturday. 



National Rail canceled all trains to and from the airport.

Matthew Muirhead was working Thursday night near Heathrow when he stepped outside with a colleague and noticed smoke rising from an electrical substation and heard sirens crying out.



“We saw a bright flash of white, and all the lights in town went out,” he said.



Flights normally begin landing and taking off at Heathrow at 6 a.m. due to nighttime flying restrictions. But the skies were silent Friday morning.



“Living near Heathrow is noisy, there are planes every 90 seconds or so, plus the constant hum of traffic, but you get used to it, to the point of no longer noticing,” said James Henderson, who has lived next to the airport for more than 20 years. “Today is different, you can hear the birds singing.”

Millions of midges have emerged from the Orbetello lagoon in Italy's popular Tuscany region, darkening the windshields of cars, blackening the walls of buildings and jeopardising businesses in the tourist area.

ROME (AP) — Residents of the Tuscany beach enclave of Orbetello are seeking a state of emergency declaration to help combat an invasion of midges that are keeping people indoors and threatening businesses catering to tourists.

Millions of the tiny bugs have invaded Orbetello, a speck of land that juts out into the Orbetello lagoon, a natural reserve off Tuscany's coast between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Monte Argentario.

Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.

On Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations. 

A permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to “protect citizens and economic activities in the area,” Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. But no details were immediately released.

Local residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition “Save the Orbetello Lagoon” had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday. 

“We cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house” like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.




Pier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.

“Everything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,” he warned.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The United States Embassy in South Africa said Thursday it received a list of more than 67,000 people interested in refugee status in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's plan to relocate members of a white minority group he claims are victims of racial discrimination by their Black-led government.

The list was given to the embassy by the South African Chamber of Commerce in the U.S., which said it became a point of contact for white South Africans asking about the program announced by the Trump administration last month. The chamber said the list does not constitute official applications.

Trump issued an executive order on Feb. 7 cutting U.S. funding to South Africa and citing “government actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.” 

Trump's executive order specifically referred to Afrikaners, a white minority group who are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers who first came to South Africa in the 17th century. The order directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to prioritize humanitarian relief to Afrikaners who are victims of “unjust racial discrimination” and resettle them in the U.S. under the refugee program.

There are approximately 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa, which has a population of 62 million. Trump's decision to offer some white South Africans refugee status went against his larger policy to halt the U.S. refugee resettlement program.

The South African government has said that Trump's allegations that it is targeting Afrikaners through a land expropriation law are inaccurate and largely driven by misinformation. Trump has posted on his Truth Social platform that Afrikaners were having their farmland seized, when no land has been taken under the new law.




The executive order also criticized South Africa's foreign policy, specifically its decision to accuse Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in a case at the United Nations' top court. The Trump administration has accused South Africa of supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran and taking an anti-American stance. The U.S. has also expelled the South African ambassador, accusing him of being anti-America and anti-Trump.

An official at the U.S. Embassy in the South African capital, Pretoria, confirmed receipt of the list of names from the South African Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. but gave no more detail.

Neil Diamond, the president of the chamber, said the list contains 67,042 names. Most were people between 25 and 45 years old and have children.

He told the Newzroom Afrika television channel that his organization had been inundated with requests for more information since Trump's order and had contacted the State Department and the embassy in Pretoria “to indicate that we would like them to make a channel available for South Africans that would like to get more information and register for refugee status.” 

“That cannot be the responsibility of the chamber,” he said.

Diamond said only U.S. authorities could officially register applications for resettlement in the U.S. The U.S. Embassy in South Africa said it is awaiting further instructions on the implementation of Trump's order.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia's Parliament unanimously voted to pass a controversial revision of its military law on Thursday that will allow military officers to serve in more government posts without resigning from the armed forces, despite growing opposition from pro-democracy and rights groups who see it as a threat to the country's young democracy.

In a plenary session, all eight political parties represented in Parliament backed the bill. The House of Representatives is largely controlled by parties supporting President Prabowo Subianto, a former army general with ties to the country's dictatorial past.

Currently, active military officers can only serve in ministries or state institutions related to security, defense or intelligence under a landmark 2004 law that reduced the military's role in civil affairs.

The amendment to the 2004 Law on the Indonesian Armed Forces introduces several changes that aim to broaden the military's role beyond defense.

Once in force, the new law will allow active officers to take civilian positions without having to retire or resign from service in four more bodies, including the Attorney General's Office, the Supreme Court and the Coordinating Ministry for Political and Security Affairs.

Under current law, military personnel are permitted to serve in only 10 ministries and state institutions, including the Ministry of Defense, the National Intelligence Agency and the Search and Rescue Agency. But that number will now be expanded to 14 for non-combat military functions.

A new clause also grants the president the authority to appoint military personnel to other ministries as needed, according to the draft.

The revision has raised concerns among pro-democracy activists and students who fear that expanding the military in civilian roles would restore the “dual function” of the armed services that they had in the era under the dictator Suharto.

At that time, seats in the legislature were reserved for the military, and officers occupied thousands of civilian roles from district chiefs to Cabinet ministers. The dual-function system effectively turned the armed forces into a tool for Suharto when he later became president to crush his political opponents.

Al Araf, the director of Indonesian rights group Imparsial, said Thursday the new law is inconsistent with the spirit of the reforms that followed the end of more than three decades of rule by Suharto in 1998 and returned the military to the barracks.

“The move has the potential to restore the authoritarian system,” Araf said.

Another major criticisms of the law is the way it has been discussed: behind closed doors, with little public input and in a fast-tracked process. 

The latest draft was introduced less than a month ago, following a letter to the House from Subianto endorsing the bill. Pro-democracy activists discovered that lawmakers and government officials met in secret to discuss draft revisions at a five-star hotel in South Jakarta on March 15. 

Dominique Nicky Fahrizal, a researcher at Indonesia's Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Thursday the way in which the law was drafted could prompt backlash.

“Autocratic legalism will damage the foundations of constitutional democracy because it exploits loopholes in the construction of legal thought,” he said.

Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, a former three-star army general, defended the new law, saying that lawmakers considered it properly and it will make the military more effective.

In a speech after the parliament passed the bill into law, he said the amendments were necessary because the geopolitical changes and global technology require the military to transform “to face conventional and non-conventional conflicts.”

“We will never disappoint the Indonesian people in maintaining the sovereignty of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia,” he said.

President Zelenskyy says all of Ukraine's power plants ‘belong to the people'

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — During a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, the U.S. leader apparently suggested Volodymyr Zelenskyy consider transferring ownership of Ukraine's power plants to the U.S. for long-term security, according to a U.S. statement.

Briefing the media later, Zelenskyy said the discussion with Trump had focused specifically on the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, ZNPP, in southern Ukraine.

While the facility remains connected to Ukraine's energy grid without producing electricity, it has been under Russian control since the early days of the war, making it unclear what future U.S. involvement could look like.

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is one of the world's 10 largest and Europe's biggest. Located in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces occupied it shortly after Moscow's February 2022 invasion.




While Russia declared the region annexed in fall 2022, its largest city, Zaporizhzhia, remains under Ukrainian control.

Ukraine has accused Russia of stationing troops and weapons at the plant and using it as a launchpad for attacks across the Dnipro River. Russia denies this, accusing Ukraine of shelling the facility.

Besides Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine operates three active nuclear power plants, which generate the majority of the country's electricity following sustained Russian attacks on thermal and hydroelectric plants.

These facilities are located in southern, western and northwestern Ukraine, away from frontline areas.




During their call on Wednesday, Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should consider giving the U.S. ownership of Ukraine's power plants to ensure their long-term security, according to a White House statement from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.

“American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure,” Trump suggested, according to the statement.

Zelenskyy later told journalists their conversation focused on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and the following day, made it clear that “the issue of ownership” of the other three plants was never discussed.

“All nuclear power plants belong to the people of Ukraine,” he said.

Zelenskyy said that when they discussed Zaporizhzhia, the U.S. leader had inquired about the facility's future. “Trump asked my thoughts on the plant,” Zelenskyy said. “I told him that if it is not Ukrainian, it will not operate. It is illegal.”

Even though ZNPP is a state-owned plant, Zelenskyy acknowledged that if the U.S. were to claim it from Russian control, invest in it and modernize it, Ukraine might consider it. “That is a separate question, an open one,” he said.

Since falling under Russian control, the plant's conditions have deteriorated. While its six reactors have been shut down for years, they still require power and qualified staff to maintain cooling systems and safety features.

Energoatom, Ukraine's state nuclear operator, said that after Russian forces took over, Ukrainian personnel were forced to sign contracts with Russian authorities and take Russian citizenship. Those who refused faced abduction or threats, forcing thousands to flee, leaving the facility understaffed and harder to manage.

The collapse of a dam in June 2023 further jeopardized the plant's cooling systems, which relied on water from the reservoir. In response, plant administrators dug wells, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Zelenskyy said extensive repairs would be needed before the plant could operate again, estimating the process could take at least two years.

The IAEA has repeatedly warned the war could cause a radiation leak. While the plant no longer produces electricity, it still holds large amounts of nuclear fuel, requiring constant cooling.

Regular blackouts caused by the fighting have disrupted the facility, though power has been quickly restored each time.

IAEA experts permanently stationed there still face restricted access, with Russian authorities blocking some inspection requests, according to IAEA head Rafael Grossi.

Zelenskyy said the discussions with Trump on restoring Zaporizhzhia were a positive step, but cautioned that no one would work at the plant if Russian forces remained stationed nearby.

Control over the plant is likely to remain a legal and logistical challenge, intertwined with a highly divisive issue for both warring sides: control over the land itself. Russian troops hold the area, while Ukrainian forces are separated from it by the Dnipro River and more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) of terrain.

“Simply handing over the plant while everything within a meter of it remains occupied or armed by Russia — no one will work under such conditions,” Zelenskyy said after the call with Trump. “It's impossible.”

He said there would be no way to operate securely in such a scenario. “That would mean that the plant could start operating tomorrow, only to be blown up by the Russians the following day.”

UK's Starmer meets military leaders from coalition involved in Ukraine peacekeeping planning

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday said Ukraine had initially proposed a ceasefire in the air and at sea, considering it a first step toward broader de-escalation. Speaking alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre in Oslo, he said that although he originally had sought a broader ceasefire, he was committed to working with the U.S. to stop arms being directed at power production and civilian facilities.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Senior military officers from more than 30 countries across Europe and beyond met in England on Thursday to flesh out plans for an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine as details of a partial ceasefire are worked out.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he didn't know whether there would be a peace deal in the Russia-Ukraine war, but “we are making steps in the right direction” as a “coalition of the willing” led by Britain and France moves into an “operational phase.”

“We hope there will be a deal but what I do know is if there is a deal, the time for planning is now,” he said during a visit to the meeting of military planners at a British base in Northwood, just outside London. “It's not after a deal is reached.”

“It is vitally important we do that work, because we know one thing for certain which is a deal without anything behind it is something that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will breach,” he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron said a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” will take place Thursday in Paris in the presence of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remained to be seen when it might take effect and what possible targets would be off limits to attack.




Zelenskyy, speaking in Norway on Thursday, said that although he originally had sought a broader ceasefire, he was committed to working with the U.S. to stop arms being directed at power production and civilian facilities. 

“I raised this issue with President Trump and said that our side would identify what we consider to be civilian infrastructure,” Zelenskyy said. “I don't want there to be any misunderstanding about what the sides are agreeing on.”

The tentative deal to partially rein in the three-year war came after Putin rebuffed Trump's push for a full 30-day ceasefire. The difficulty in getting the combatants to stop targeting one another's energy infrastructure highlights the challenges Trump will face in trying to fulfill his campaign pledge to quickly end the war.

AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports Ukraine and Russia have agreed to a limited ceasefire, but there's work ahead to put it in place.

Negotiators from Moscow and the U.S. will meet Monday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Sergei Ushakov told Russian news agencies. 

Zelenskyy said team would also meet with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia to discuss technical issues, and then the U.S. will act as an intermediary running “shuttle diplomacy” between Kyiv and Moscow. 

Despite the negotiations, hundreds of drone attacks were launched overnight by both sides, injuring several people and damaging buildings. 

Kropyvnytskyi, a city in central Ukraine, faced its biggest attack of the war as about four dozen drones injured 14 people, including a couple with serious burns, and damaged houses and apartments. 

“In a cruel twist, enemy drones hit Myru Street (‘Peace Street' in English),” Andrii Raikovych, head of the regional administration, said.

More than 50 drones were intercepted in Russia's Saratov region — the largest attack of its kind in the area — shattering windows in a hospital and damaging two kindergartens, a school and about 30 homes, Gov. Roman Busargin said. The attacks were focused on Engels, an industrial city near Russia's main base for nuclear-capable strategic bombers.

In its latest estimate, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russian troops suffered 900,000 casualties — including up to 250,000 killed — since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. That's a jump of 200,000 from a fall estimate.

Western estimates of the parties' war losses have varied and couldn't be independently verified.

War losses have been a tightly guarded secret in Russia. The Defense Ministry's most recent figures were from 2023 when it reported 6,000 deaths, which was regarded as unreliable.

The U.K. did not release a similar estimate for Ukrainian casualties.

Zelenskyy told NBC News last month that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, and more than 350,000 wounded. Those figures couldn't be independently confirmed and could be an undercount.

If peace comes to Ukraine, the number of troops that would help enforce it is vague. Officials have cited figures of between 10,000 and 30,000 troops as part of what's been termed a “reassurance force.”

Only Britain and France have said they are willing to send troops, though countries including Australia, Canada and Finland say they are open to being involved in some way.

At Thursday's meeting, which involved 31 countries, Starmer said planning was broken down into four areas: “the sea in one scenario, the sky, obviously land and borders, and regeneration.”

Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil. And Trump has given no sign the U.S. will guarantee reserve firepower in case of any breaches of a truce. Starmer says the plan won't work without that U.S. “backstop.”

Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at military think-tank RUSI, said Thursday that the purpose of the Western military force would be to “give Ukraine confidence that a violation of the ceasefire would lead to the Russians having to contend with European forces, and in particular European air power.”

In addition to the meeting in England, EU leaders in Brussels planned to discuss Ukraine's security needs with Zelenskyy during a meeting about ramping up defense spending after the Trump administration signaled Europe must take care of its own security. 

The German parliament's budget committee is expected to decide Friday to clear up to 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in extra funding for German military aid to Ukraine this year. That comes after parliament voted to loosen Germany's debt rules for military and security spending.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said European plans for raising military spending conflicted with Putin and Trump's efforts to reach a peace deal.

“Europe has engaged in militarization and has turned into a party of war,” Peskov said.

Residents of Kyiv voiced a mix of optimism, skepticism and confusion about a potential ceasefire.

Olena Morozova, an accountant, said she hoped Putin would agree to the terms of a peace agreement while Volodymyr Zakusylo, a retiree, said he didn't trust Trump and he thinks Russia will renege on any agreement.

Natalia Volkotrub, a medic, said she didn't know what to think because Russia had betrayed Ukraine when it failed to provide the protection it offered when Kyiv agreed to surrender its nuclear weapons after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

“We gave up our arms and were promised peace and protection,” she said. “But as of today, all promises were broken.”

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Beijing on Thursday demanded protections for Chinese students in the U.S. after a congressional panel asked six American universities to hand over a large amount of detailed information on their Chinese students, citing national security concerns. 

A letter sent to the universities, including Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, alleged that the Chinese government was embedding researchers in top American institutions to gain direct access to sensitive technologies. 

In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Chinese students account for about one-quarter of all international students in the U.S. and that their activities have promoted “the economic prosperity and technological development of the U.S.” 

“This is in the interest of both parties,” Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. “We urge the U.S. to stop overstretching the concept of national security, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students, and not impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students.” 

Her remarks came a day after John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to six colleges requesting information on Chinese students enrolled in advanced science and technology programs. He accused the institutions of putting American research at risk in exchange for financial incentives. 

The colleges named in Moolenaar's letter were Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland, and the University of Southern California. 




“The Chinese Communist Party has established a well-documented, systematic pipeline to embed researchers in leading U.S. institutions, providing them direct exposure to sensitive technologies with dual-use military applications,” Moolenaar wrote in a letter to Farnam Jahanian, president of Carnegie Mellon University. 

“America's student visa system has become a Trojan horse for Beijing, providing unrestricted access to our top research institutions and posing a direct threat to our national security, it added. If left unaddressed, this trend will continue to displace American talent, compromise research integrity, and fuel China's technological ambitions at our expense.”

The letter requested information including the Chinese students' sources of funding, the types of research they're involved in, what schools they previously attended, and “a country-by-country breakdown of applicants, admittances, and enrollments at your university.” 

Most Chinese students enrolled in U.S. undergraduate programs pay full tuition, making them an important source of funding for many universities. Many of the students do not remain in the U.S. after college graduation but return to China, where they hope a U.S. degree will land them a good job. But foreign science and engineering doctorate recipients, including those from China, are more likely to stay in the U.S. for their postdoc or employment, according to the National Science Foundation.

Last week, a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill seeking to ban Chinese students from studying in U.S. schools.

In January, the University of Michigan said it was is ending its partnership with a prominent Chinese university, a few months after five Chinese students in the joint program were charged over their suspicious activities outside a remote military site.

In a letter to a congressman, Santa Ono, president of the University of Michigan, said following a thorough review the university has initiated the six-month process to “officially end the partnership” with Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

DEIR-AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Local health officials said Israeli strikes killed at least 85 Palestinians across he Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, bringing the total to nearly 600 killed since Israel shattered a truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages and brought relative calm since late January.

Hours later, Hamas fired three rockets at Israel without causing casualties, in the first such attack since Israel broke the ceasefire on Tuesday. 

Zaher al-Waheidi, the head of the records department at the Gaza Health Ministry, said Israeli bombardments have killed at least 592 people in the past three days.

The Israeli military said it was again enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Palestinians were not being ordered to leave northern Gaza but can no longer enter, the military said, and are only allowed to move south on foot using the coastal road. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north during the ceasefire.

Early Friday, Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's request to fire the head of the country's Shin Bet internal security service. The late-night decision to sack Ronen Bar deepens a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.

It also could set the stage for a crisis over the country's division of powers. Israel's attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.




Israeli ground forces, meanwhile, are pushing into Gaza near the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah, the military said Thursday. The operations come a day after Israel moved to split Gaza in two by retaking part of the strategic Netzarim corridor that divides Gaza's north from south.

The military ordered Palestinians to evacuate an area in central Gaza near the city of Khan Younis, saying it would operate there in response to Thursday's rocket fire from Hamas. The Palestinian militant group said it targeted Tel Aviv. One rocket was intercepted and two fell in open areas, according to the army.

Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels also launched two missiles at Israel, one early Thursday morning and another in the evening, the military said. Both were intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace, according to the army, and no injuries were reported. Air raid sirens rang out and exploding interceptor rockets were heard in Jerusalem. There have been three such attacks since the United States began a new campaign of airstrikes against the Houthis earlier this week.

Gaza's Health Ministry said overnight Israeli strikes killed at least 85 people, mostly women and children. The ministry's records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. 

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Israeli strikes killed at least 85 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, according to three hospitals.

The Indonesian Hospital said it received 19 bodies after strikes in Beit Lahiya, near Gaza's northern border, which was heavily destroyed and largely depopulated earlier in the war. 

“It was a bloody night for the people of Beit Lahiya,” said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry's emergency service in northern Gaza, adding that rescuers were still searching the rubble. “The situation is catastrophic.”

Israel's military said Thursday its airstrikes in Gaza had killed the head of Hamas' internal security apparatus and two other militant commanders. Israel has said it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. A United Nations-backed group of human rights experts accused Israel last week of “disproportionate violence against women and children” during the war in Gaza.

One of the strikes early Thursday hit the Abu Daqa family's home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village outside Khan Younis near the border with Israel. It was in an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

The strike killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of a month-old baby who survived along with her grandparents.

“Another tough night,” said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors in the rubble. “The house collapsed over the people's heads.”

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration reiterated its support for Israel, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, “The president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay.” 

Israel, which cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, has vowed to intensify its operations until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive — and gives up control of the territory.

Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the ceasefire agreement mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. 

Hamas says it's willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.

Netanyahu said Sunday he would seek Bar's dismissal, saying he had lost faith in his security chief.

But critics say the move is a power grab by Netanyahu against an independent-minded civil servant. 

Tens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated across the country in recent days in support of Bar, including a mass gathering outside Netanyahu's office late Thursday in the pouring rain.

A Shin Bet report into the Oct. 7 attack acknowledged failures by the security agency. But it also said that policies by Netanyahu's government created the conditions for the attack.

Netanyahu is also upset that the Shin Bet has launched an investigation into connections between some of his close aides and the Gulf state of Qatar. His office said Bar's dismissal would take effect on April 10 or before then if a replacement is found.

Bar did not attend the meeting but sent a letter to the Cabinet ahead of time protesting the firing.

He said the dismissal was meant to hinder the agency from further investigating the failures of Oct. 7 and undermining the investigation into whether Qatar influenced the prime minister's office.

“This is a direct danger to the security of the state of Israel,” Bar wrote.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and has caused vast destruction across the territory.

Israeli airstrikes overnight into Thursday struck several homes in the Gaza Strip and killed at least 85 Palestinians, according to local health officials. Among those pulled alive from the rubble was a month-old baby girl, but her parents and brother were killed. 

Hamas fired three rockets at Israel on Thursday without causing casualties. It was the first such attack since Israel resumed heavy bombardment of Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the ceasefire that had halted the 17-month war. The Israeli military is again enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, and its forces have moved to retake a strategic corridor dividing north from south. 

In Israel, hundreds of people demonstrated outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the country's head of internal security.

Here's the latest:

Israel's Cabinet on Thursday approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's request to fire the head of the country's Shin Bet internal security service.

The late-night decision to sack Ronen Bar deepens a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.

It also could set the stage for a crisis over the country's division of powers. Israel's attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.




Thousands of Israelis gathered outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on Thursday to protest his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the country's head of internal security.

“Instead of firing the head of the Shin Bet, just to avoid an investigation, I think that the prime minister should be involved in rescuing the last hostages there are left in Gaza to die,” said Michal Halperin, a protester.

The protests come amid a renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza and ahead of a planned vote by the government to dismiss the head of internal security, a move that many view as undermining the balance of powers in Israel.

As Netanyahu's Cabinet met late Thursday to vote on the firing, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside in the pouring rain.

The Israeli military says the missile was intercepted before reaching Israeli territory. The launch came hours after Israel said it intercepted another missile launched by Yemen's Houthi rebel group.

A Georgetown University researcher who is married to a Palestinian American was detained by immigration agents who told him his visa had been revoked, prompting another high-profile legal fight over deportation proceedings against foreign-born visa holders authorized to live in the U.S.

Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University and citizen of India, was arrested Monday night outside of his Virginia home by officers who identified themselves as Department of Homeland Security agents, according to a legal filing by Suri's lawyer.

Hassan Ahmad, Suri's Virginia-based attorney, wrote in a court filing that Suri was targeted because of his wife's “identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech.”

Suri was later taken to a detention facility in Louisiana, according to a government website. 

Suri was accused of “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media” and determined to be deportable by the Secretary of State's office, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said

Marin Valev Marinov, 51, was a member of the U.N. Office for Project Services, which carries out infrastructure and development projects around the world. The U.N. agency issued a statement Thursday confirming Marinov was “hit by an explosion” in Gaza, while five wounded U.N. staff remain hospitalized.

Marinov was “supporting the delivery of life-saving aid to the civilian population” in Gaza and was one of at least 280 U.N. personnel killed there since the war began, the statement said. A “seasoned mariner and vessel Master,” he had previously worked as a U.N. maritime inspector in Yemen and for the U.N. humanitarian office.

The United Nations has not said who was behind Wednesday's strike on a U.N. guesthouse. Israel has denied responsibility, but there were no reports of rocket attacks by Hamas that day.

The head of the U.N. Office for Project Services said strikes exploded near the compound on Monday and hit it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike.

“The president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday. 

“And unfortunately Hamas chose to play games in the media with lives. This situation, let's not forget, is completely the fault of Hamas. When they launched that brutal attack on Israel on October 7th,” Leavitt said. “And the president has made it very clear that he wants all of those hostages to come home. And he fully supports Israel and the IDF and the actions that they've taken in recent days.”

The U.S. and Israeli demand for Hamas to release more hostages before negotiations on ending the war could proceed was not part of the ceasefire agreement in January.

Sharabi told the U.N. Security Council he was beaten, chained and starved in Gaza for 491 days: “If you stand for humanity – prove it” and bring back the hostages.

He said that while the council talked about humanitarian aid, he saw Hamas militants carrying and eating dozens of stolen boxes of humanitarian aid with U.N. emblems, while the hostages starved.

When Sharabi was released on Feb. 8, he said he weighed 44 kilograms (97 pounds) — less than the weight of his youngest daughter who was killed along with his wife and older daughter in Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

He told the U.N.'s most powerful body that six weeks after his release he came to speak for 24-year-old Alon Ohel, a fellow hostage whom he left behind in the tunnel, and all others including his older brother Yossi who was killed but whose body remains in Gaza. “Bring them all home. Now!” he said.

Hamas is believed to hold around two dozen living hostages and the bodies of others.

Britain's top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, told the House of Commons “it's difficult to see how denying humanitarian assistance to a civilian population can be compatible with international humanitarian law.”

Although he said it's for courts not governments to decide, Lammy said it was “appalling and unacceptable” for Israel to block aid and electricity to Gaza.

He said Israel's actions “reinforce” the U.K. decision last year to suspend some arms exports to the country.

Earlier this week Lammy said Israel had broken international law, but later reverted to the government's longstanding position that Israel's actions are “at clear risk” of breaching the law.

The evacuation order covers Bani Suheila near the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel's military said it would operate there in response to rocket fire by Hamas.

Thursday's order expands on a new Israeli-imposed buffer zone along Gaza's northern and eastern borders.

Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, said a day earlier that the military would soon order Palestinians to evacuate from combat zones.

As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza's Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. A man sprinted away from the wreckage carrying a living infant swaddled in a blanket and handed her to a waiting ambulance crew. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. “She had been screaming and then falling silent from time to time until we were able to get her out a short while ago, and thank God she is safe.”

The girl was identified as Ella Osama Abu Dagga. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war.

The girl's parents and brother were killed in the overnight Israeli airstrike, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Only her grandparents survived. 

Hundreds of Israelis gathered outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on Thursday to protest his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the country's head of internal security.

Police used a water canon to disperse the crowd after protestors tried to break through police barricades, and scuffles erupted. Several demonstrators were thrown to the ground by police officers – including an opposition legislator, according to Israeli media reports.

On Wednesday, a mass march and demonstration outside the Israeli parliament continued into the late evening hours and ended with several arrests.

The protests come amid a renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza and ahead of a planned vote by the government to dismiss the head of internal security, a move that many view as undermining the balance of powers in Israel.

Three rockets launched at Israel from the Gaza Strip on Thursday set off sirens across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Hamas claimed the attack, which appeared to be the first out of Gaza since Israel ended a ceasefire with a surprise bombardment of the territory on Tuesday.

The Israeli military said it intercepted one of the rockets, and two others fell in open areas. There were no reports of injuries.

Earlier on Thursday, a missile launched toward Israel by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi was intercepted before it reached Israeli airspace.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called the strikes on Yemen a “crime” that “should be prevented.”

In a message marking the Iranian New Year, he said Muslim nations must unite to resist the “Zionist Regime,” referring to Israel. He called the U.S. an accomplice in the resumption of Israel's strikes on Gaza and said the strikes by Israel have been carried out by “the U.S. permission, or support and green light.”

In a separate message, President Masoud Pezeshkian urged for domestic integrity, improving relation with neighbouring nations and other nations in the world.

The death toll from new Israeli strikes on Gaza has climbed to 58, according to hospitals in the territory.

Multiple homes were targeted in the middle of the night late Wednesday and early Thursday. The latest total of those killed was according to three hospitals in different parts of the territory. 

The strikes hit houses in the cities of Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza and the northern town of Beit Lahiya, they said.

The European Hospital in the southern city of Rafah said 26 people, mostly women and children, were killed in strikes on two family homes overnight. One of the strikes killed a father and his seven children, it said.

The Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis received the bodies of seven people killed overnight in an attack on a home. In northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital said it had received the bodies of seven people killed in a strike on a home in Beit Lahiya, a town near the border.

The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels early Thursday before it reached Israeli airspace, as air raid sirens and exploding interceptors were heard in Jerusalem. No injuries were reported. 

It was the second such attack since the United States began a new campaign of airstrikes against the rebels earlier this week.

Sudan 's military said Friday it retook the Republican Palace in Khartoum, the last heavily guarded bastion of rival paramilitary forces in the capital, after nearly two years of fighting. The seizure of the Republican Palace represents a major symbolic victory for Sudan's military against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

CAIRO (AP) — The war in Sudan appears to be reaching a critical juncture after nearly two years of fighting that has killed tens of thousands of people, driven millions from their homes and spread famine.

In recent months, the military has been making steady advances against its rival, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, and it says it has wrested back control of the capital of Khartoum, including the iconic Republican Palace, traditionally the seat of the country's president and government. A politician associated with the RSF acknowledged the loss, though the RSF later said its troops were still in the area and fighting.

While the war is unlikely to end soon, here is a look at what the developments could mean.

The war erupted in April 2023 between the military and the RSF with battles in Khartoum and around the country. The leaders of the two forces had been allies who were meant to have overseen the democratic transition after a popular uprising in 2019, but instead worked together to thwart a return to civilian rule. 

However, tensions exploded into a bloody fight for power.

Since then, at least 28,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. The war has driven more than 14 million people from their homes and pushed parts of the country into famine.




The military victory in Khartoum likely just moves the war into a new chapter, creating a de facto partition of Sudan into military- and RSF-run zones.

Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan has shown no sign of engaging in serious peace talks. The RSF, headed by Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has seemed to be determined to keep fighting.

The RSF still holds much of western Sudan, particularly most of the Darfur region. 

Also, Khartoum International Airport, only some 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) southeast of the republican Palace, has been held by the RSF since the start of the war. 

The advances in Khartoum may cause strains to break open in the military's coalition. The military has been backed by a collection of armed factions — including former Darfur rebels and Islamist brigades — that are historic rivals united only by the goal of fighting the RSF.

The RSF and its allies signed a charter in February in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, establishing a parallel government.

Burhan also has spoken of setting up a transitional government, raising the potential for two rival administrations jockeying for support as their forces battle — entrenching Sudan's effective partition.

The RSF's 16-page charter calls for “a secular, democratic and decentralized state,” maintaining what it called Sudan's “voluntary integrity of its territory and peoples” — a nod to Sudan's many communities demanding autonomy from Khartoum.

The RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, mobilized two decades ago by then-president Omar al-Bashir against populations that identify as Central or East African in Darfur. The Janjaweed were accused of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities.

In the current war, the RSF has been accused of numerous atrocities. The Biden administration slapped Dagalo with sanctions, saying the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide. The RSF has denied committing genocide.

The military has also been accused of abuses and denies that.

HELSINKI (AP) — Finland is the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report 2025 published Thursday.

Other Nordic countries are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings in the annual report published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.

Aino Virolainen, a digital commerce director, has lived abroad but always wants to return home to Finland.

“This is where I always want to come back to and where I want to, you know, grow my kids and grow old myself,” Virolainen said Thursday. “And I think it's because, you know, the peace and the quietness and the trustworthiness. You know, how we speak directly and the nature, of course. It's clean and the air is fresh and what's there not to love?” 

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Finland is again ranked the happiest country in the world, according to Thursday's World Happiness Report.

Country rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives. The study was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

“Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth — it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,” said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup. “If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”

Researchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

As an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.

Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

Alexandra Peth, a managing director, said Finnish culture prioritizes trust and connection.

“People trust each other in Finland and I think on many levels in the society, we try to support each other,” Peth said. “So I think the system makes it kind of that you can trust it somehow.”

Overall, researchers said that global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.

While European countries dominate the top 20 in the ranking, there were some exceptions. Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at eighth. Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at sixth and 10th respectively.

When it comes to decreasing happiness — or growing unhappiness — the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. The report states that the number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53% over the past two decades.

The United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.

Afghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women saying their lives are especially difficult.

Sierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking third from the bottom. 

In a concerning development, the study said that 19% of young adults across the world reported in 2023 that they have no one they could count on for social support. That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.

All countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations averaged over 2022 to 2024. 

Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as gross domestic product per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption.

Jouni Purhonen, a Helsinki resident, called Finns “really calm.”

“So we have the time to think about things like live our life really peacefully and I guess easily, if you will,” Purhonen said.

Kirsten Grieshaber reported from Berlin.

Storm Martinho causes widespread damage and flooding risks in Spain, with Madrid facing record rainfall and Galicia and Andalusia experiencing strong winds and disruptions.

Authorities in Madrid have issued a warning for potential flooding as Storm Martinho brings heavy rainfall to the Spanish capital. 

Emergency services have urged “maximum caution” in areas around the unchannelled sections of the River Manzanares. This March has already been confirmed as the wettest on record, and Madrid is on track to break yearly rainfall records.

In Galicia, the storm caused over 400 incidents overnight. Winds reaching 166 km/h uprooted trees and tore off rooftops. 

Meanwhile, in Andalusia, powerful gusts caused havoc in the coastal town of El Rompido, Cartaya, damaging homes and restaurant terraces. 

Authorities across Spain remain on high alert as Martinho continues to batter the country.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

        A strike on Odesa came shortly before a visit by President of the Czech Republic, Peter Pavel, who committed further aid to Ukraine's war-torn regions.
    

Ukrainian officials reported multiple regions came under Russian attack overnight — including the Black Sea port city of Odesa. 

Three people were injured and a residential high-rise building and shopping centre were damaged as Russian drones pummelled the city. Regional governor Oleh Kiper said the attack caused emergency power outages.

""This is another reminder to the whole world: the war continues and Ukraine continues to fight,"" the head of the Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, said in a statement.

He said blazes erupted at at least three locations after the attack late Thursday. ""Civilian infrastructure, commercial facilities are on fire, cars damaged,"" Kiper detailed.

Over 70 people and 20 fire engines were involved in extinguishing what the emergency services called ""massive fires.""

The attack came shortly before Czech Republic's President Petr Pavel visited the region to hold meetings with the city's leaders and officials from nearby regions.

Deputy Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine Oleksiy Kuleba wrote on Telegram that ""the Russian Federation launched three groups of Shaheds into the city"" during his meeting with Pavel.

A separate Russian attack near the city of Zaporizhzhia injured six people, including a 4-year-old boy, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. 

It added that the attack caused a large fire, affecting several cars and residential buildings. Three houses were destroyed and several others damaged.

Three drone attacks also struck Sumy, in northeastern Ukraine, causing fires to erupt but without reports of injuries. 

In total, the Ukrainian air force said that Russia fired 214 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks. It said 114 of them were intercepted and another 81 were jammed.

Separately on Friday, Russia accused Ukraine of attacking a gas metering station in Russia's Kursk region — an allegation that Kyiv denied.

The facility lies in Sudzha, a part of Kursk that Russia claimed to have retaken from Ukrainian troops last week. 

Ukraine confirmed its retreat from the Sudzha area, but refuted claims made by US President Donald Trump as well as his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Ukrainian troops were encircled by Russian forces in the region.

Moscow accused Ukraine of deliberately attacking the Sudzha gas metering station in an ""act of terrorism.""

In a post on Facebook, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine the ""station was repeatedly shelled by the Russians themselves,"" calling the attack a ""provocation"" from Moscow as part of a ""discrediting campaign against Ukraine.""

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after US President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remained to be seen what possible targets would be off limits to attack.

After a roughly hourlong call with Trump on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that “technical” talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected from attack under the agreement.

The three sides appeared to hold starkly different views about what the deal covered. While the White House said ""energy and infrastructure"" would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to ""energy infrastructure.""

Zelenskyy said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the agreement reached between Trump and Putin referred only to energy facilities, adding that the Russian military is fulfilling Putin's order to halt such attacks for 30 days.

""The Russian military are currently refraining from strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in accordance with the agreement reached between Russia and the United States,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.

        The package, which will allow for a large increase in military expenditure, passed through the Bundesrat despite objections from several smaller parties.
    

Germany's upper house has voted in favour of a landmark bill that plans to unlock hundreds of billions of euros for defence and infrastructure projects. 

The Bundesrat supported the measure with a more than two-thirds majority on Friday, paving the way for significant reform of the country's borrowing rules. 

The legislation will amend the country's constitutionally- enshrined fiscal rules allowing the government to massively boost military spending. It will also create a €500 billion special fund to finance infrastructure projects over the next twelve years. 

Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz, who leads the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), wanted to get the package approved before the start of the next parliament on 25 March, fearing it could be blocked by the Left (Die Linke) and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) parties, who will have a sizeable presence in the next Bundestag.

The proposed spending boost won the support of the Bundestag on Tuesday, before making its way to the Bundesrat, its final parliamentary hurdle on the way to becoming law. 

The Bundesrat, which represents Germany's 16 state governments, was not guaranteed to support the bill, as some smaller parties had voiced their objections to it.

However, it passed with 53 out of 69 votes in favour, far above the 46-ballot threshold required. 

In Bavaria, there had been concerns that the Free Voters — a junior coalition partner to the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) — would block the measure. 

Free Voters leader Hubert Aiwanger voiced reservations about the package, but ultimately said his party would agree.

""Demanding the sensible use of these funds is always better than saying I failed,"" Aiwanger told RTL Direkt. 

The states of Bremen and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania also agreed to the measure, despite the Left party being part of governing coalitions in both regions. The Left has voiced serious objections to additional defence spending. 

The historic agreement will mean billions more euros can be spent on Germany's defence sector. 

Under the legislation, defence spending above 1% of Germany's gross domestic product will be effectively exempt from the country's ""debt brake"", which was written into the constitution in 2009.

As well as the €500-billion special fund for infrastructure projects, Germany's 16 states will be given greater leeway to borrow the equivalent of around €15 billion.

After Merz made concessions to the Greens to gain their support for the deal, €100 billion in climate investment will be included in the infrastructure fund over the next twelve years. 

Merz's massive spending push is a stark reversal from the country's previous financial conservativism and a U-turn for his party, who previously opposed any reform of the ""debt brake.""

On Friday, Merz said of the bill: ""we are laying the foundation for targeted investments in freedom and progress. We are taking responsibility for Germany.""

Merz has previously justified his pivot by citing the “rapidly changing situation”, in particular, the ongoing peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia with US involvement.

The Sudanese army said on Friday it took control of ministries in addition to the Presidential Palace in Khartoum, a significant milestone in a two-year-old war between the army and paramilitary group RSF, which threatens to fracture the country.Sources said that the army was conducting search operations in areas around the palace in pursuit of members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).  The RSF was not immediately available for comment.Intermittent gunfire was heard in some central areas of the capital Khartoum, witnesses told Reuters.

Both sides have been accused of war crimes, while the RSF has also been charged with genocide. Both sides deny the charges.

Gadi Moses's captors lied to him that his partner Efrat was alive and his daughter, Moran, was held hostage while he was in Gaza captivity, the released hostage shared in an interview with Channel 12's Uvda on Thursday.  Moses was taken captive from outside his home on October 7 when Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived, was invaded by Hamas terrorists.   ""At some point, they gave me a page with pictures of all the hostages. I see Efrat, and he also shows her to me on his computer as one of the captives.""For her birthday, as well as Moran's, whom the terrorists claimed had been kidnapped, a terrorist said he would dispatch a birthday message to the two.

""Then my world collapsed,"" he said. ""I realized that he had lied to me, and I threw the radio at him, saying, 'You liar! Why are you lying? You didn't message her on WhatsApp, and she didn't reply to you. You probably lied to me about Moran too.'    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  That was when Moses decided his daughter had probably been killed too.

Force-feed me?' He punches me in the shoulder and says, 'You will eat.' I told him, 'Listen, if you touch me again, I will beat you to death, and I don't care what those weapons will do to me. But you will not touch me. No matter what, I will not let him humiliate me.'""In June of 2024, Moses was transferred to the Al-Mawasi area in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, which had been designated as a humanitarian zone. He was held in the area as the IDF eliminated Mohammed Deif, chief of Hamas's military wing, the Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades.""My guard explained to me, 'You don't understand one thing about Islam – I am obligated to protect you before I protect myself. But know this: if your army comes to rescue you, we will shoot you first and only then defend ourselves.'""  Moses shared his account of meeting with Arbel Yehoud prior to his release, 481 days after being by himself in captivity. ""I've known her since birth. It was a hug from a father and grandfather—everything you could imagine. It was a defining moment because I had been alone for 481 days, and I realized that Arbel had also been alone for 481 days. I felt like I was soaring out of that pit in the cemetery to embrace the flesh of my flesh. She said, 'You're not leaving me again.'""Release from GazaWith regard to the chaotic manner in which his release, along with that of Yehoud, was carried out in Gaza, he said, ""I was sure we were being taken to some arena where they would tear us to pieces.""They opened the door and told her [Yehoud], 'Come,' and I thought I was losing my mind. I couldn't see anything, just a crowd. I heard the shouting, and they took her. I was terrified that they had handed her over to the masses.""He was allowed to leave the vehicle only an hour later, ""I told myself, 'That's it, they've devoured Arbel, and now they're going to devour me.'""After his handover to Israeli forces by the Red Cross, he was told his daughter Moran was alive. ""That was the first time I realized she was alive and that I hadn't lost her or the girls.""I understand very well that I am the only elderly person who survived and returned alive,"" Moses, who marked his 80th birthday in Hamas captivity in Gaza in March, said.""But I also understand very well the suffering and the torture that everyone who was there endured—those who were released, those who died there, and those who are still there.""No one needs to invite you—you should be the first one here. People from all over the world are reaching out and wanting to help us—maybe our own government wants to help us, too?"" ""I believe there is a future.

A jury in New York convicted two foreign nationals on Thursday for the attempted assassination of journalist Masih Alinejad, an American-Iranian, in a murder-for-hire scheme in 2022, according to court documents.Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, said to be members of the Russian mafia, were found guilty, after three hours of deliberation,  on charges of murder for hire, firearms possession, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.Prosecutors believed the pair were ""hired guns for the government of Iran"" and claimed that the attempted assassination was funded to the amount of $500,000.   Alinejad fled Iran to the United States in 2009 and has since used her large platform to spread awareness of Tehran's abuse of women. Federal prosecutors believed that her efforts made the Islamic Republic label her as an ""enemy of the Iranian state,"" - which may have been a motive for Tehran to want her killed. Alinejad told Reuters she was the target of a previous alleged attempt by Iranian intelligence officers to kidnap her and take her to Iran.  American-Iranian journalist Masih Alinejad poses for a portrait in New York City, U.S., September 14, 2024. (credit: CAITLIN OCHS/REUTERS)Amirov and Omarov also allegedly tapped Azerbaijani mobster Khalid Mehdiyev to carry out the attack. Mehdiyev testified that the pair tasked him with the assassination and that he understood the funds had come from Iran. Mehdiyev reportedly failed to carry out the assassination when NYPD officers discovered an AK-47 and 66 rounds of ammunition in his car. Amirov and Omarov's defense claimed the evidence was flawed and their clients were innocent.FBI Assistant Director in Charge Leslie R. Backschies said: “The convictions of Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov send a clear message to all foreign governments who violate our laws and attempt to commit violence against Americans — they and their proxies will face justice for any attempt to silence Americans on U.S. soil.  The Iranian government's shameless conduct and attempt to violate our laws and assassinate a critic of their human rights atrocities will not be tolerated.

Qatari funding of the terrorist organization Hamas – and also the Israeli government and its partners – has been a consistent rumor.Indeed, a large portion of the criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when it comes to the current war is a consistent claim among his detractors is that he “allowed” this war to come about by permitting the transferring of Qatari funds, better known in Israel as “briefcases of money,” through Israel.  Now, the story we know as Qatargate has been blown wide open, and what was once a small point of contention is now one of the biggest stories of potential governmental corruption in the modern State of Israel.Last July, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) released documents that alleged that, twice in 12 years, funds were ordered to be transferred from Doha to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A Likud spokesperson fervently denied these reports. AdvertisementThen, at the beginning of this year, a series of media reports emerged in Israel, alleging commercial ties between members of Netanyahu's media team and Qatari state actors, including prominent Prime Minister's Office media team member Eli Feldstein, who was already under house arrest for leaking classified documents to the German newspaper Bild. Eli Feldstein, a suspect in Qatargate, arrives at the Tel Aviv District Court, March 11, 2025 (credit: YEHOSHUA YOSEF/FLASH90)Feldstein was allegedly hired by an international company funded by Qatar to promote the country's image in Israel based on its role in hostage negotiations. Likud Party spokespersons Yonatan Urich and Srulik Einhorn had also allegedly provided public-relations services to Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup, Haaretz reported in November.Investigation opened by Shin BetIn mid-February, the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) said it had opened an investigation, following suspicions of ties between senior officials in the Prime Minister's Office and Qatar.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Then, at the end of last month, Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara ordered the Israel Police and the Shin Bet to launch an investigation into officials within Netanyahu's office over their alleged ties to Qatar. The investigation is also looking into such connections within other governmental ministries. AdvertisementLess than two weeks after that, the Rishon Lezion Magistrate's Court, at the request of the Israel Police's Unit of International Crime Investigations, issued a gag order on all information regarding the investigation, allegedly out of concern over leaks that could lead to the investigation's “obstruction.”The gag order was widely criticized as being politically motivated to protect the members of Netanyahu's inner circle.Then, this past Sunday, when Netanyahu announced that he was firing Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, the latter said he would resign early, but only after, among other tasks, he has completed this investigation, now colloquially referred to as “Qatargate.”  If Netanyahu were to attempt to appeal this response through the High Court of Justice, the concern is that he would not have the support of Baharav-Miara, because she had instructed that the investigation be launched in the first place.Then, earlier this week, it was announced that Lahav 433, the National Crime Unit, had arrested two suspects. They were released Thursday morning under unknown conditions.The announcement came right after Israeli businessman Gil Birger admitted in recordings published by KAN Reshet Bet that he had transferred funds from a Qatari lobbyist to Feldstein. This was at the request of Jay K. Footlik, a US-based Qatari lobbyist who unsuccessfully ran for US Congress in Chicago and served as special assistant to former US president Bill Clinton in the White House, helping build support for a range of domestic and foreign-policy issues, he said.Birger's attorneys denied that the money had come from Qatar. Those funds had come from the Prime Minister's Office, they said.Netanyahu has been a voice of fervent denial surrounding the investigation, calling it a “fake scandal campaign” and a “desperate attempt to invent a baseless justification for an offense that does not exist.”Indeed, the extent of this investigation, so far, does feel like a broad conspiracy, echoing the expansive nature of inquiry in Hollywood.Nevertheless, the investigation must run its course. Regardless of whether one supports the government, the need to maintain a “clean” investigation is undeniable.While the country feels as though it is on the brink of civil war, an investigation such as this would give the public good reason to trust leadership. After all, if no wrongdoing occurred, why oppose confirming that to the public?Netanyahu's fervent opposition, as a result, only draws ire and suspicion.

Freed Israeli hostage Eli Sharabi visited the Ohel (gravesite) of the Lubavitcher Rebbe before testifying at the UN Security Council on Thursday to express his gratitude for surviving Hamas captivity—exactly a year after his brother visited the memorial tomb to pray for his return. Sharabi was held captive for 491 days after being kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas attacks in 2023. He was released during the recent ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and the terror group and has been open about his experiences of being tortured and struggling to survive in captivity.   Sharabi's visit to the Rebbe's Ohel held personal significance, as his brother, Sharon, had come to the same spot exactly a year before to pray for his brother's release. “We lost four members of the Sharabi family,” Sharon explained. “I came here [to the Ohel a year ago]  to ask for a blessing that we wouldn't receive a fifth coffin.""

Testimony at the UNSharabi's visit to the Rebbe's grave came just before after his powerful address to the United Nations Security Council.According to The Jerusalem Post's report on Tuesday, Sharabi detailed his 491 days of captivity in a Hamas tunnel, describing harrowing conditions and psychological torment.His testimony at the UN included emotional pleas on behalf of those still in captivity and a call to the international community to demand their release and to recognize the atrocities committed on October 7.Sharabi also explained how only after his release did he learn the full extent of the tragedy, which was that his wife and two daughters were killed on October 7.His brother Yossi and nephew Noam were also killed, and their bodies currently remain in Gaza.Sharabi's testimony Sharabi recounted his testimony story after his release in February on Channel 12's ""Uvda"" program.He emphasized during that interview that it was important for him to be transparent about his experiences, saying, “If there's one thing I've been saying to everyone from the start—family, medical staff, friends—it's this: Don't walk on eggshells around me.""Recounting what he endured, he said, “You're 50 meters underground.

Lucky that after 16 months, I was able to come back to my family. I'm lucky.” Sharabi said. Overcoming adversity through unity Sharabi's visit to the Rebbe's grave also included conversations with Chabad rabbis.Rabbi Kotlarsky of Chabad said about his conversation with Sharabi that “the unity Eli speaks about—you can see it right here. Since October 7, people from all backgrounds have come to the Ohel to pray for him and for the hostages.”Each day since the massacre, visitors have come to the Rebbe's resting place to pray on behalf of the hostages.

Testimony at the UNSharabi's visit to the Rebbe's grave came just before after his powerful address to the United Nations Security Council.According to The Jerusalem Post's report on Tuesday, Sharabi detailed his 491 days of captivity in a Hamas tunnel, describing harrowing conditions and psychological torment.His testimony at the UN included emotional pleas on behalf of those still in captivity and a call to the international community to demand their release and to recognize the atrocities committed on October 7.Sharabi also explained how only after his release did he learn the full extent of the tragedy, which was that his wife and two daughters were killed on October 7.His brother Yossi and nephew Noam were also killed, and their bodies currently remain in Gaza.Sharabi's testimony Sharabi recounted his testimony story after his release in February on Channel 12's ""Uvda"" program.He emphasized during that interview that it was important for him to be transparent about his experiences, saying, “If there's one thing I've been saying to everyone from the start—family, medical staff, friends—it's this: Don't walk on eggshells around me.""Recounting what he endured, he said, “You're 50 meters underground. The sanitary conditions are simply terrible. You shower once a month with a bottle of water, maybe half a bucket of cold water. The chains on my legs never left me from the day I arrived in Gaza until the last day. Some people were shackled only part of the time—I was chained for a year and four months, with thick, heavy locks that tore into my flesh.""However, during the interview, Sharabi also expressed that he held no resentment toward his situation and instead felt lucky to have survived.

Sharabi's visit to the Rebbe's grave came just before after his powerful address to the United Nations Security Council.According to The Jerusalem Post's report on Tuesday, Sharabi detailed his 491 days of captivity in a Hamas tunnel, describing harrowing conditions and psychological torment.His testimony at the UN included emotional pleas on behalf of those still in captivity and a call to the international community to demand their release and to recognize the atrocities committed on October 7.Sharabi also explained how only after his release did he learn the full extent of the tragedy, which was that his wife and two daughters were killed on October 7.His brother Yossi and nephew Noam were also killed, and their bodies currently remain in Gaza.Sharabi's testimony Sharabi recounted his testimony story after his release in February on Channel 12's ""Uvda"" program.He emphasized during that interview that it was important for him to be transparent about his experiences, saying, “If there's one thing I've been saying to everyone from the start—family, medical staff, friends—it's this: Don't walk on eggshells around me.""Recounting what he endured, he said, “You're 50 meters underground. The sanitary conditions are simply terrible. You shower once a month with a bottle of water, maybe half a bucket of cold water. The chains on my legs never left me from the day I arrived in Gaza until the last day. Some people were shackled only part of the time—I was chained for a year and four months, with thick, heavy locks that tore into my flesh.""However, during the interview, Sharabi also expressed that he held no resentment toward his situation and instead felt lucky to have survived. ""I'm not angry. I'm lucky. Lucky that I had [his wife] Leanne for 30 years. Lucky that I had those amazing daughters for so many years. Lucky that they didn't kill me. Lucky that after 16 months, I was able to come back to my family. I'm lucky.” Sharabi said. Overcoming adversity through unity Sharabi's visit to the Rebbe's grave also included conversations with Chabad rabbis.Rabbi Kotlarsky of Chabad said about his conversation with Sharabi that “the unity Eli speaks about—you can see it right here.

Other than Rachel Zegler's unflattering hairdo, the new Disney's Snow White bears little resemblance to the original and still-beloved 1937 feature cartoon, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The outline is there, but the spirit and charm are gone and it's all kind of bland.The romantic fairy tale at the center of the original story has been hollowed out, and the movie, which opened in Israel on Thursday and around most of the world on Friday, plays like The Hunger Games meets a Taylor Swift self-empowerment anthem meets a women's leadership seminar.   Snow White (Zegler) is the oppressed representative of an entire oppressed people (who dress in Hunger Games-style drab burlap), under the thumb of the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot), her vain, jealous stepmother. The Evil Queen wears jewel-studded black gowns – Gadot looks great – and tells her starving people that what they need are diamonds, not flowers, because diamonds are forever. But the people are not about to get either, much to their mean ruler's delight and Snow White's dismay. AdvertisementThe rumors, sparked by remarks that Zegler made to the press about how the new version is about the princess discovering “the leader she can be” rather than finding love are true: 2025's Snow White doesn't need any prince and doesn't sing the iconic “Someday My Prince Will Come.”  GAL GADOT (right) and Rachel Zegler present the award for Best Visual Effects. (credit: Courtesy of A.M.P.A.S.© 2025)Given that Zegler said she was uneasy with the original because the prince “literally stalked” the princess, the powers-that-be must have deemed the lovey-dovey lyrics of the beloved ballad cringey. Who needs romantic drama when you can fantasize about a future of happy townspeople working together for the greater good in farms and fields, square dancing, and smiling beatifically, which takes place – spoiler alert – in the finale here? The movie was dogged by rumors and issues, both that its co-stars weren't getting along due to politics and various reports about the dwarfs: that the dwarf characters represent offensive stereotypes and should have been dropped altogether and that the CGI dwarfs that were used should have been played by live actors. But when the lights go down, all the noise surrounding the release fades and the question is only: What's on the screen and does it work?   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Not 'an unqualified disaster'I wouldn't call Snow White “an unqualified disaster,” the famous phrase New York Times critic Vincent Canby used to condemn Heaven's Gate. Snow White has its moments, mainly Gadot's scheming and Zegler's singing, but I found myself wondering what a young child today who had never seen the original would make of all the chatter about leadership and justice that now fill the place of the romance and magic that propelled the plot of the original – and of every other fairy tale. There are several new songs, but although I only wrote this a few hours after watching the movie, I couldn't quote you a single line from any of them. AdvertisementThe good news is that Zegler has a beautiful singing voice. It made her a star after she appeared in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake, and it's perfect for Snow White. She has a sweet presence and performs songs in Snow White winningly. Gadot's Evil Queen is the only character who gets to have anything resembling fun, and she narrows her eyes and sets her jaw in anger when Snow White, now a scullery maid, dares to speak out on behalf of the oppressed people of the kingdom, then snarls when the mirror breaks it to her that she is no longer the fairest of them all.Gadot's singing is basically her talking with a certain musical lilt, a style perfected by Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady, and she does it just fine.   The movie begins with a prologue of Snow White's origin story, which clears up a point that bothered some fans, when a narrator explains she got her name because it was snowing the day she was born, not because of her skin color. Snow White and her parents live in an idyllic community where there is liberty and justice for all, until her mother dies and her father brings home the wickedest stepmother of all time. Her father goes off to war and never returns, and the Evil Queen reduces her stepdaughter to the position of a servant and gets rich by robbing all her subjects. Before the famous mirror utters the words that lead the queen to order her huntsman to kill Snow White, the princess meets a guy named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), a rather pallid prince substitute, who turns out to be a Robin Hood-type stealing potatoes. He robs from the palace to feed the bandits he runs with in the forest, one of whom turns out to be a non-CGI dwarf, which muddies the waters of the whole dwarf controversy, and is confusing because he looks very different from the CGI ones, who have enormous heads. The movie more or less works up to the point when Snow White awakens in the dwarfs' cottage and gets the place in order. The effects are nice and scary when she runs through the forest and, well, Disney sure knows how to do cute forest critters. But the dwarfs get a little creepy, as CGI characters often do. The Pixar animators' early genius was that they realized that humans and humanoids look weird in CGI and so they concentrated on toys, cars, and fish. But the dwarfs here get too many closeups.Once Snow White has tidied up the cottage and before the queen shows up with the poisoned apple, the movie fills time by giving Snow White a quest: She will join the bandits fighting the queen so that she can go off and investigate whether her father is truly alive somewhere, a storyline that peters out whenever it isn't needed.There's a bit of romance between her and Jonathan, but it's made clear that she calls the shots. She doesn't need saving: Message received.It would have been nice to see a little more of Gadot, but since she is the most fun character, her presence has to be rationed since this is a movie about virtue and any fun is incidental.  Disney keeps on creating live-action remakes of its animated classics and it seems that it's so that they can keep making money off their tried-and-true intellectual property. This trend also gives the studio the opportunity to update plot points that will seem dated, racist, or sexist to contemporary audiences. While a few live-action remakes have been good – Aladdin was probably the most fun – I think most children will always prefer the cartoon versions, and so will a lot of adults. But Snow White has gotten a much bigger plot overhaul than the previous live-action films and it's an experiment in whether reworking a beloved story to fit today's stringent social/political conventions can work. There's an expression making the rounds lately, “Go woke, go broke,” as many attempts at trendy entertainment that fit with today's political climate have failed. But with its massive multi-million-dollar global publicity machine, it's unlikely Disney will go broke with Snow White. Children will see the posters and the clips and will get their parents to take them. It might even turn a profit. But will children really love this film the way generations embraced the original, will they dream about it? That seems doubtful, but Disney, like the Evil Queen, will likely be content to enjoy the diamonds the profits from this film will allow them to purchase.

Disney keeps on creating live-action remakes of its animated classics and it seems that it's so that they can keep making money off their tried-and-true intellectual property.

While a few live-action remakes have been good – Aladdin was probably the most fun – I think most children will always prefer the cartoon versions, and so will a lot of adults. But Snow White has gotten a much bigger plot overhaul than the previous live-action films and it's an experiment in whether reworking a beloved story to fit today's stringent social/political conventions can work. There's an expression making the rounds lately, “Go woke, go broke,” as many attempts at trendy entertainment that fit with today's political climate have failed. But with its massive multi-million-dollar global publicity machine, it's unlikely Disney will go broke with Snow White. Children will see the posters and the clips and will get their parents to take them. It might even turn a profit. But will children really love this film the way generations embraced the original, will they dream about it? That seems doubtful, but Disney, like the Evil Queen, will likely be content to enjoy the diamonds the profits from this film will allow them to purchase. 
            



Snow White (Zegler) is the oppressed representative of an entire oppressed people (who dress in Hunger Games-style drab burlap), under the thumb of the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot), her vain, jealous stepmother. The Evil Queen wears jewel-studded black gowns – Gadot looks great – and tells her starving people that what they need are diamonds, not flowers, because diamonds are forever. But the people are not about to get either, much to their mean ruler's delight and Snow White's dismay.

(credit: Courtesy of A.M.P.A.S.© 2025)Given that Zegler said she was uneasy with the original because the prince “literally stalked” the princess, the powers-that-be must have deemed the lovey-dovey lyrics of the beloved ballad cringey. Who needs romantic drama when you can fantasize about a future of happy townspeople working together for the greater good in farms and fields, square dancing, and smiling beatifically, which takes place – spoiler alert – in the finale here? The movie was dogged by rumors and issues, both that its co-stars weren't getting along due to politics and various reports about the dwarfs: that the dwarf characters represent offensive stereotypes and should have been dropped altogether and that the CGI dwarfs that were used should have been played by live actors.

I wouldn't call Snow White “an unqualified disaster,” the famous phrase New York Times critic Vincent Canby used to condemn Heaven's Gate. Snow White has its moments, mainly Gadot's scheming and Zegler's singing, but I found myself wondering what a young child today who had never seen the original would make of all the chatter about leadership and justice that now fill the place of the romance and magic that propelled the plot of the original – and of every other fairy tale. There are several new songs, but although I only wrote this a few hours after watching the movie, I couldn't quote you a single line from any of them.

Red alert sirens sounded in Ashkelon on Friday. The details are under review by the IDF, the military said in a statement.

This is a developing story.

""If the government decides to lead Israel with open eyes into a constitutional crisis, we will shut down the companies and launch a public struggle together with all the strength of Israeli society,"" the Israeli High-Tech Headquarters, which includes dozens of the largest high-tech companies and leading venture capital funds, said in a statement Friday afternoon.

""We call on [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to stop a moment before falling into the abyss.""

""A violation of a High Court order or any court ruling is a red line from which there is no return. Such a breach would turn Israel into a third-world country, driving away foreign investors,"" the statement added.

Histadrut Chief Arnon Bar David warned on Friday of ""anarchy under government auspices,"" says refusal to comply with High Court ruling is a ""red line,"" and vows that he will not ""sit quietly while the State of Israel is being dismantled.""

Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a letter that a legal review will be conducted regarding his ability to be involved in the termination of the Shin Bet head, Ronen Bar, on Friday. 

""The required legal review regarding your ability to be involved in this matter, given concerns about a conflict of interest, will be completed shortly,"" Baharav Miara said.

She also stressed that the government is prohibited from making any decisions or taking any actions regarding the conclusion of the tenure of the head of the Shin Bet. 



""There will be no civil war!"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X on Friday, firing back at the former Supreme Court chief justice Aharon Barak. ""The State of Israel is a state of law, and according to the law, the Israeli government decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.""

The High Court of Justice on Friday froze the government's Thursday decision to fire Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chief Ronen Bar until the hearing on the petition against the move. 

The prime minister's decision came amid the Shin Bet investigation into Netanyahu aides who were allegedly involved in Qatargate.  

A majority of Gaza residents would leave if they had the opportunity, according to a Friday survey by Gallup International.

Conducted from March 2 to March 13, 2025, the poll found that 38% of respondents would opt for temporary relocation, 14% would move permanently, and 4% would send family members abroad.

The survey, which included 532 participants from Gaza, also underscored the ongoing deterioration in living conditions since the outbreak of war on October 7, 2023. Most respondents described their current quality of life as either “very bad” or “fairly bad.”



The High Court of Justice on Friday froze the government's Thursday decision to fire Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chief Ronen Bar until the hearing on the petition against the move. 

The move followed the cabinet's unanimous Thursday vote to end the agency's chief term, following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu's decision to put forward such a proposal to the cabinet. 

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded to the court's decision, saying, ""The court will not manage the war or choose its commanders. Period.""



Gadi Moses's captors lied to him that his partner Efrat was alive and his daughter, Moran, was held hostage while he was in Gaza captivity, the released hostage shared in an interview with Channel 12's Uvda on Thursday.  

Moses was taken captive from outside his home on October 7 when Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived, was invaded by Hamas terrorists. 

""At some point, they gave me a page with pictures of all the hostages. I see Efrat, and he also shows her to me on his computer as one of the captives.""



Freed Israeli hostage Eli Sharabi visited the Ohel (gravesite) of the Lubavitcher Rebbe before testifying at the UN Security Council on Thursday to express his gratitude for surviving Hamas captivity—exactly a year after his brother visited the memorial tomb to pray for his return. 

Sharabi was held captive for 491 days after being kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas attacks in 2023. He was released during the recent ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and the terror group and has been open about his experiences of being tortured and struggling to survive in captivity. 

Sharabi's visit to the Rebbe's Ohel held personal significance, as his brother, Sharon, had come to the same spot exactly a year before to pray for his brother's release. 



Senior Deputy Director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza Sam Rose remarked on Friday that the situation in Gaza is gravely concerning, emphasizing that this was largely due to Israel's reductions in the distribution of aid supplies.

""This is the longest period since the start of the conflict in October 2023 that no supplies whatsoever have entered Gaza. The progress we made as an aid system over the last six weeks of the ceasefire is being reversed,"" Rose told reporters, speaking from central Gaza.

Hamas said on Friday it is still discussing US envoy Steve Witkoff's proposal and various other ideas, claiming that it has the aim of reaching a deal to release prisoners, end the war in Gaza, and achieve a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Strip.

Last week, Witkoff presented a ""bridge"" plan to extend the ceasefire in Gaza into April beyond Ramadan and Passover and allow time to negotiate a permanent cessation of hostilities.","{'href': 'https://www.jpost.com', 'title': 'The Jerusalem Post'}"

Just days after the Hamas-led invasion and mega-atrocity on October 7, 2023, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had an explanation, or at least an excuse. The assault in which the invading terrorists murdered 1,200 people; abducted 251; and perpetrated a campaign of rape, mutilation, looting, and arson “did not happen in a vacuum,” Guterres declared.It was typical UN talk: When Palestinians attack Israel, there's an underlying sympathy; when Israel hits back, it's a crime against humanity.The “vacuum” that contributed to the conflict was created by the lack of UN support for Israel and its one-sided backing for the Palestinians and the terrorist regime in Gaza. It's a tale of double standards and hypocrisy.  For example, the UN Watch monitoring group last week noted the absurdity of Saudi Arabia's chairing the UN Women's Rights Commission during its annual session that ends on March 21.“One of the world's most patriarchal and misogynistic regimes now chairs the Commission on the Status of Women, which is touted on the UN website as the ‘principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women,'” said UN Watch head Hillel Neuer. A general view of the United Nations Security Council during a meeting on ''Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,'' at the UN headquarters in New York, US, May 4, 2023. (credit: REUTERS/DAVID 'DEE' DELGADO)Neuer pointed out that the commission had failed to adopt a single resolution against Saudi Arabia, which maintains its male guardianship laws; or Yemen, where child marriage is prevalent and which ranks at the bottom of the Gender Equality Index; or the Democratic Republic of Congo, which earned the harsh moniker “the rape capital of the world”; or Pakistan, with high rates of violence against women and domestic abuse but low rates of conviction; and, of course, against Iran, where women suffer not only from misogynistic discrimination but are subject to the harshly enforced “modesty laws.”Also, last week, UN judge Lydia Mugambe was convicted in the UK of forcing a young woman to work as a slave. Mugambe, from Uganda, initially claimed she had diplomatic immunity due to her UN position. In another story of modern slavery that was mostly overlooked last week, Israeli soldiers rescued 10 Indian laborers lured into a village in the Palestinian-controlled area of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria), where their passports were seized. The passports were being used to enter Israel illegally, possibly for terror-related purposes.UN's concern over the treatment of women is evident, however, when it can falsely accuse Israel of being the perpetrator. A 49-page report issued on March 13 by the “UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel” went as far as accusing Israel of “genocidal acts.” The commission's name literally says a lot. Ditto the name of the report: “More Than a Human Can Bear: Israel's systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence since 7 October 2023.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  When a report is based on the information provided by the Hamas regime in Gaza, it's no surprise that the result is a perversion. But they get full points for creativity: Among the allegations is the targeting of reproductive healthcare facilities, including maternity wards and Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, according to a statement by commission head Navi Pillay. This, “combined with the use of starvation as a method of war, has impacted all aspects of reproduction,” she claimed.No mention of Hamas terrorThere is no mention of Hamas's deliberate use of medical centers as terror bases. Images of detained [Palestinian] men stripped to their underwear are presented as sexual abuse, with no mention that it's to check that they aren't wearing suicide belts. Charges of abuse from the Sde Teiman detention facility were based on falsified video footage rather than the results of an ongoing official Israeli investigation. And as for the use of starvation – the canard that has starred during the 17 months of the Israel-Hamas war – it is the emaciated Israeli hostages who have been clearly denied food and medical care, not their captors. Even Pillay's commission was forced to admit that there was evidence that Hamas and other terrorist groups had carried out acts of rape and genital mutilation on October 7. Brave former hostage Amit Soussana and others have openly spoken of the sexual abuse they underwent and witnessed in captivity in Gaza. But it was not enough for the UN to issue a resolution of condemnation.Pillay and her partners should also note that Israeli women – particularly the thousands who were under intense rocket fire, displaced from their homes, with their husbands called up in the military reserves – were also impacted. Those undergoing fertility treatments faced almost impossible challenges.Hamas's disregard for human life, including that of its own people, can be seen in another shocking incident last week. Israeli soldiers spotted a four-year-old boy moving toward an army post in the Gaza security zone. The boy told the soldiers that he'd been sent by Hamas. He was later returned to Gaza in coordination with international organizations.It is not clear whether the four-year-old was sent to check the alertness of the troops or in a deliberate attempt to get the soldiers to open fire on the approaching child, thus launching another blood libel against the Israelis. Either way, I fear he'll likely face more jihadi-style child abuse and possible martyrdom.IDF operations in GazaOVERNIGHT ON Monday, Israel launched Operation Strength and Sword on Gaza, eliminating several top Hamas officials in airstrikes. The move is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining 59 hostages, half of whom are believed to be alive. Some called it a “surprise attack.” The surprise was that Israel was initiating action rather than waiting to be attacked and then hit back.As Khaled Abu Toameh wrote for the Gatestone Institute earlier this month: “For Hamas, a hudna is a temporary break from war – it does not indicate a desire to end it and achieve peace. While Hamas was talking, for 10 years before October 7, 2023, about its desire to reach a long-term truce, it was busy preparing for the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.“It is plainly uninformed to believe that Hamas would ever lay down its weapons and agree to end its jihad (holy war) against Israel.""“The Trump administration is advised to listen to what Hamas leaders say in Arabic to their own people, and not what they tell US officials during secret meetings in Qatar.”He cited senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri who had declared in Arabic: “The right to resistance is non-negotiable. The weapons of the resistance are a red line, and we won't exchange it for reconstruction [of the Gaza Strip] and humanitarian aid.”I HAD originally intended to write this week about “monkey business.” In recent weeks, the Israel Police working together with the Nature and Parks Authority have found multiple cases of smuggled animals – including 16 monkeys and four lion cubs. Most of the rescued animals were being held in Arab communities in inappropriate conditions – wild animals should be in the wild, after all, not chained up in someone's backyard. One of the young monkeys died of tetanus, the result of wounds from its chains. The lion cubs were suffering from malnutrition.It's easy to frame animal smuggling as a “light story,” appropriate for a slow news day (not that we're blessed with many of those). But it is deadly serious. Globally, the trade in smuggled wildlife is linked to arms and drug trading. It's lucrative, and the money can be spent on weapons and narcotics.Israel should see this latest spate of smuggling as a red flag for another reason. Some of the animals reportedly were dropped over the border with Egypt or Jordan by drones capable of carrying up to 70 kg. Not only is the money inextricably linked with illegal arms, so are the smuggling methods. Obviously, arms can be delivered in the same way. Before the war, there were known cases of lion cubs being smuggled across the Egyptian border into Gaza via tunnels.The pictures of the rescued animals brought to mind the famous statues of three monkeys: one covering its eyes, one its ears, and one its mouth. It reminds me of the UN policy regarding Israel. These are not the three wise monkeys but a parody, like the international body that turns a blind eye, a deaf ear, and refuses to speak out when Israel is the victim. “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” – unless Israel can be blamed.

The “vacuum” that contributed to the conflict was created by the lack of UN support for Israel and its one-sided backing for the Palestinians and the terrorist regime in Gaza. It's a tale of double standards and hypocrisy.  For example, the UN Watch monitoring group last week noted the absurdity of Saudi Arabia's chairing the UN Women's Rights Commission during its annual session that ends on March 21.“One of the world's most patriarchal and misogynistic regimes now chairs the Commission on the Status of Women, which is touted on the UN website as the ‘principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women,'” said UN Watch head Hillel Neuer. A general view of the United Nations Security Council during a meeting on ''Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,'' at the UN headquarters in New York, US, May 4, 2023. (credit: REUTERS/DAVID 'DEE' DELGADO)Neuer pointed out that the commission had failed to adopt a single resolution against Saudi Arabia, which maintains its male guardianship laws; or Yemen, where child marriage is prevalent and which ranks at the bottom of the Gender Equality Index; or the Democratic Republic of Congo, which earned the harsh moniker “the rape capital of the world”; or Pakistan, with high rates of violence against women and domestic abuse but low rates of conviction; and, of course, against Iran, where women suffer not only from misogynistic discrimination but are subject to the harshly enforced “modesty laws.”Also, last week, UN judge Lydia Mugambe was convicted in the UK of forcing a young woman to work as a slave. Mugambe, from Uganda, initially claimed she had diplomatic immunity due to her UN position. In another story of modern slavery that was mostly overlooked last week, Israeli soldiers rescued 10 Indian laborers lured into a village in the Palestinian-controlled area of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria), where their passports were seized. The passports were being used to enter Israel illegally, possibly for terror-related purposes.UN's concern over the treatment of women is evident, however, when it can falsely accuse Israel of being the perpetrator. A 49-page report issued on March 13 by the “UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel” went as far as accusing Israel of “genocidal acts.” The commission's name literally says a lot. Ditto the name of the report: “More Than a Human Can Bear: Israel's systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence since 7 October 2023.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  When a report is based on the information provided by the Hamas regime in Gaza, it's no surprise that the result is a perversion. But they get full points for creativity: Among the allegations is the targeting of reproductive healthcare facilities, including maternity wards and Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, according to a statement by commission head Navi Pillay. This, “combined with the use of starvation as a method of war, has impacted all aspects of reproduction,” she claimed.No mention of Hamas terrorThere is no mention of Hamas's deliberate use of medical centers as terror bases. Images of detained [Palestinian] men stripped to their underwear are presented as sexual abuse, with no mention that it's to check that they aren't wearing suicide belts. Charges of abuse from the Sde Teiman detention facility were based on falsified video footage rather than the results of an ongoing official Israeli investigation. And as for the use of starvation – the canard that has starred during the 17 months of the Israel-Hamas war – it is the emaciated Israeli hostages who have been clearly denied food and medical care, not their captors. Even Pillay's commission was forced to admit that there was evidence that Hamas and other terrorist groups had carried out acts of rape and genital mutilation on October 7. Brave former hostage Amit Soussana and others have openly spoken of the sexual abuse they underwent and witnessed in captivity in Gaza. But it was not enough for the UN to issue a resolution of condemnation.Pillay and her partners should also note that Israeli women – particularly the thousands who were under intense rocket fire, displaced from their homes, with their husbands called up in the military reserves – were also impacted. Those undergoing fertility treatments faced almost impossible challenges.Hamas's disregard for human life, including that of its own people, can be seen in another shocking incident last week. Israeli soldiers spotted a four-year-old boy moving toward an army post in the Gaza security zone. The boy told the soldiers that he'd been sent by Hamas. He was later returned to Gaza in coordination with international organizations.It is not clear whether the four-year-old was sent to check the alertness of the troops or in a deliberate attempt to get the soldiers to open fire on the approaching child, thus launching another blood libel against the Israelis. Either way, I fear he'll likely face more jihadi-style child abuse and possible martyrdom.IDF operations in GazaOVERNIGHT ON Monday, Israel launched Operation Strength and Sword on Gaza, eliminating several top Hamas officials in airstrikes. The move is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining 59 hostages, half of whom are believed to be alive. Some called it a “surprise attack.” The surprise was that Israel was initiating action rather than waiting to be attacked and then hit back.As Khaled Abu Toameh wrote for the Gatestone Institute earlier this month: “For Hamas, a hudna is a temporary break from war – it does not indicate a desire to end it and achieve peace. While Hamas was talking, for 10 years before October 7, 2023, about its desire to reach a long-term truce, it was busy preparing for the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.“It is plainly uninformed to believe that Hamas would ever lay down its weapons and agree to end its jihad (holy war) against Israel.""“The Trump administration is advised to listen to what Hamas leaders say in Arabic to their own people, and not what they tell US officials during secret meetings in Qatar.”He cited senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri who had declared in Arabic: “The right to resistance is non-negotiable. The weapons of the resistance are a red line, and we won't exchange it for reconstruction [of the Gaza Strip] and humanitarian aid.”I HAD originally intended to write this week about “monkey business.” In recent weeks, the Israel Police working together with the Nature and Parks Authority have found multiple cases of smuggled animals – including 16 monkeys and four lion cubs. Most of the rescued animals were being held in Arab communities in inappropriate conditions – wild animals should be in the wild, after all, not chained up in someone's backyard. One of the young monkeys died of tetanus, the result of wounds from its chains. The lion cubs were suffering from malnutrition.It's easy to frame animal smuggling as a “light story,” appropriate for a slow news day (not that we're blessed with many of those). But it is deadly serious. Globally, the trade in smuggled wildlife is linked to arms and drug trading. It's lucrative, and the money can be spent on weapons and narcotics.Israel should see this latest spate of smuggling as a red flag for another reason. Some of the animals reportedly were dropped over the border with Egypt or Jordan by drones capable of carrying up to 70 kg. Not only is the money inextricably linked with illegal arms, so are the smuggling methods. Obviously, arms can be delivered in the same way.

In another story of modern slavery that was mostly overlooked last week, Israeli soldiers rescued 10 Indian laborers lured into a village in the Palestinian-controlled area of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria), where their passports were seized. The passports were being used to enter Israel illegally, possibly for terror-related purposes.UN's concern over the treatment of women is evident, however, when it can falsely accuse Israel of being the perpetrator. A 49-page report issued on March 13 by the “UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel” went as far as accusing Israel of “genocidal acts.” The commission's name literally says a lot. Ditto the name of the report: “More Than a Human Can Bear: Israel's systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence since 7 October 2023.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

Charges of abuse from the Sde Teiman detention facility were based on falsified video footage rather than the results of an ongoing official Israeli investigation. And as for the use of starvation – the canard that has starred during the 17 months of the Israel-Hamas war – it is the emaciated Israeli hostages who have been clearly denied food and medical care, not their captors. Even Pillay's commission was forced to admit that there was evidence that Hamas and other terrorist groups had carried out acts of rape and genital mutilation on October 7.

He was later returned to Gaza in coordination with international organizations.It is not clear whether the four-year-old was sent to check the alertness of the troops or in a deliberate attempt to get the soldiers to open fire on the approaching child, thus launching another blood libel against the Israelis.

Some called it a “surprise attack.” The surprise was that Israel was initiating action rather than waiting to be attacked and then hit back.As Khaled Abu Toameh wrote for the Gatestone Institute earlier this month: “For Hamas, a hudna is a temporary break from war – it does not indicate a desire to end it and achieve peace. While Hamas was talking, for 10 years before October 7, 2023, about its desire to reach a long-term truce, it was busy preparing for the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.“It is plainly uninformed to believe that Hamas would ever lay down its weapons and agree to end its jihad (holy war) against Israel.""“The Trump administration is advised to listen to what Hamas leaders say in Arabic to their own people, and not what they tell US officials during secret meetings in Qatar.”He cited senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri who had declared in Arabic: “The right to resistance is non-negotiable. The weapons of the resistance are a red line, and we won't exchange it for reconstruction [of the Gaza Strip] and humanitarian aid.”I HAD originally intended to write this week about “monkey business.” In recent weeks, the Israel Police working together with the Nature and Parks Authority have found multiple cases of smuggled animals – including 16 monkeys and four lion cubs. Most of the rescued animals were being held in Arab communities in inappropriate conditions – wild animals should be in the wild, after all, not chained up in someone's backyard. One of the young monkeys died of tetanus, the result of wounds from its chains. The lion cubs were suffering from malnutrition.It's easy to frame animal smuggling as a “light story,” appropriate for a slow news day (not that we're blessed with many of those). But it is deadly serious. Globally, the trade in smuggled wildlife is linked to arms and drug trading. It's lucrative, and the money can be spent on weapons and narcotics.Israel should see this latest spate of smuggling as a red flag for another reason. Some of the animals reportedly were dropped over the border with Egypt or Jordan by drones capable of carrying up to 70 kg. Not only is the money inextricably linked with illegal arms, so are the smuggling methods. Obviously, arms can be delivered in the same way. Before the war, there were known cases of lion cubs being smuggled across the Egyptian border into Gaza via tunnels.The pictures of the rescued animals brought to mind the famous statues of three monkeys: one covering its eyes, one its ears, and one its mouth. It reminds me of the UN policy regarding Israel. These are not the three wise monkeys but a parody, like the international body that turns a blind eye, a deaf ear, and refuses to speak out when Israel is the victim. “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” – unless Israel can be blamed.
				



Pillay and her partners should also note that Israeli women – particularly the thousands who were under intense rocket fire, displaced from their homes, with their husbands called up in the military reserves – were also impacted. Those undergoing fertility treatments faced almost impossible challenges.Hamas's disregard for human life, including that of its own people, can be seen in another shocking incident last week. Israeli soldiers spotted a four-year-old boy moving toward an army post in the Gaza security zone. The boy told the soldiers that he'd been sent by Hamas. He was later returned to Gaza in coordination with international organizations.It is not clear whether the four-year-old was sent to check the alertness of the troops or in a deliberate attempt to get the soldiers to open fire on the approaching child, thus launching another blood libel against the Israelis.

Fear, said Canadian writer Margaret Atwood, is like love: it has a smell.Now that smell is here. The smell of fear – fear of truth, fear of justice, and fear of the people's wrath – is spreading from the prime minister's chambers to every corner of the Jewish state. No nostril can avoid its odor, and no mind can ignore its writ.And the writ is as simple as it is scathing. Benjamin Netanyahu has lost the ability to lead. Not because of the piling doubts concerning his morality, judgment, and vision, but because he is a coward.  Netanyahu was not born a coward. Cowards don't go to fight as commandos in the IDF. Cowards also don't slash social spending to the bone, as Netanyahu did when he was finance minister. But that was in 2003. Two decades later a different Netanyahu emerged.Netanyahu's cowardice emerged in all its ugliness immediately after October 7, when he failed to visit the Hamas massacre's biggest victims, the communities of Be'eri, Kfar Aza, and Nir Oz – which respectively lost 100; 64; and 38 of their members.  Netanyahu at the Tel Aviv District Court house  (credit: Noya Aronson)They, and another 19 kibbutzim and moshavim where an additional 127 people were massacred, have yet to see the face of the man who was their leader while their children, siblings, parents, and neighbors were machine-gunned, decapitated and/or burned alive.Winston Churchill, during the blitz on London, regularly emerged in its bombarded streets immediately after the German pilots' raids, and made a point of surveying the shattered buildings surrounded by their bombers' victims. “He did it often,” wrote The Smithsonian's David Kindy (“How Winston Churchill Endured the Blitz and Taught the People of England to Do the Same,” 24 February 2020), and the impact was profound. “The people would flock to him… this was leadership by demonstration. He showed the world that he cared and he was fearless.”Netanyahu's conduct would have appalled his hero. It runs against Churchill's idea of leading a people under attack, and is the inversion of the fearlessness he displayed. It's cowardice. Fear of the people. The same fear Netanyahu displayed in his failure since the war's outbreak to sit for one interview with an Israeli journalist.These shows of cowardice are about compassion, but Netanyahu's new cowardice spread further, to the realm of justice.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  With millions of citizens sharing an unending war's burden – as mourners, as refugees, as fighters, as wounded fighters, as fighters' parents, children and spouses, and as owners of shuttered businesses – most Israelis lost patience for ultra-Orthodoxy's draft evasion.A brave leader in Netanyahu's place would have gone to his ultra-Orthodox allies, and told them squarely: our deal was good for its time, but now it has become impossible to defend. The army needs you – the country needs you – and the people's resentment is ready to boil over. Enlist.But the younger Netanyahu's political bravery had vanished.

Now that smell is here. The smell of fear – fear of truth, fear of justice, and fear of the people's wrath – is spreading from the prime minister's chambers to every corner of the Jewish state. No nostril can avoid its odor, and no mind can ignore its writ.And the writ is as simple as it is scathing. Benjamin Netanyahu has lost the ability to lead. Not because of the piling doubts concerning his morality, judgment, and vision, but because he is a coward.  Netanyahu was not born a coward. Cowards don't go to fight as commandos in the IDF. Cowards also don't slash social spending to the bone, as Netanyahu did when he was finance minister. But that was in 2003. Two decades later a different Netanyahu emerged.Netanyahu's cowardice emerged in all its ugliness immediately after October 7, when he failed to visit the Hamas massacre's biggest victims, the communities of Be'eri, Kfar Aza, and Nir Oz – which respectively lost 100; 64; and 38 of their members.  Netanyahu at the Tel Aviv District Court house  (credit: Noya Aronson)They, and another 19 kibbutzim and moshavim where an additional 127 people were massacred, have yet to see the face of the man who was their leader while their children, siblings, parents, and neighbors were machine-gunned, decapitated and/or burned alive.Winston Churchill, during the blitz on London, regularly emerged in its bombarded streets immediately after the German pilots' raids, and made a point of surveying the shattered buildings surrounded by their bombers' victims. “He did it often,” wrote The Smithsonian's David Kindy (“How Winston Churchill Endured the Blitz and Taught the People of England to Do the Same,” 24 February 2020), and the impact was profound. “The people would flock to him… this was leadership by demonstration. He showed the world that he cared and he was fearless.”Netanyahu's conduct would have appalled his hero. It runs against Churchill's idea of leading a people under attack, and is the inversion of the fearlessness he displayed. It's cowardice. Fear of the people. The same fear Netanyahu displayed in his failure since the war's outbreak to sit for one interview with an Israeli journalist.These shows of cowardice are about compassion, but Netanyahu's new cowardice spread further, to the realm of justice.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at eliminating the US Education Department, which he had termed as a “big con job” last month.

Amid his sweeping actions, US President Donald Trump in February had called for the immediate closure of the federal Department of Education on, reiterating his desire to shut down the agency despite acknowledging the complexity of the process.

Donald Trump reportedly proposed shuttering it in his first term as president, but Congress did not act.

While Trump has derided the Education Department as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology, completing its dismantling is most likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979. Republicans said they will introduce legislation to achieve that, while Democrats have quickly lined up to oppose the idea, reported Associated Press.

The order on Thursday said the education secretary will, “to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities.""

It offers no detail on how that work will be carried out or where it will be targeted, though the White House said the agency will retain certain critical functions.

Donald Trump vowed to close the department beyond its ""core necessities,"" preserving its responsibilities for Title I funding for low-income schools, Pell grants and money for children with disabilities, the AP report said.

The Education Department, which oversees a range of educational support, employs over 4,200 people and has a budget that totaled $251 billion in the most recent year, a Reuters report had mentioned earlier.

Donald Trump had previously suggested he would seek to close the department through an executive order, though he recognised that achieving this goal would require support from Congress and teachers' unions.

The closure of Education Department comes with consequences, potentially disrupting billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools and college tuition assistance programmes, according to the report.

Donald Trump's executive order to eliminate the Education Department is the latest in the series of actions as part of his broader efforts to enact sweeping changes in US government operations.

Donald Trump has focused on reducing the size of the federal workforce and cutting costs, pushing for government employees to return to office jobs or leave, and targeting agencies like the US Agency for International Development (USAID) for closure.

""The Department of Education's a big con job,"" Reuters quoted Donald Trump telling reporters last month, doubling down on his long-standing criticism of the agency. Donald Trump had said that Linda McMahon, his nominee for education secretary, had been tasked with overseeing the department's closure.

This marks the second time Donald Trump has proposed ending the Education Department, having raised the issue during his first term from 2017 to 2021.

Congress, however, did not act on his previous proposals. Conservative think tanks advocating for the department's abolition have suggested that other agencies could assume responsibility for managing educational aid programmes and oversight.

Under US President Donald Trump's government, immigration enforcement has been reinforced, affecting green card holders and H-1B visa holders, especially if they travel abroad. Now, the question is, what omen does it carry for the Indian community across the Atlantic?

New York City-based attorney Naresh Gehi told Newsweek, “The administration is taking the law in their own hands with blatant disregard to the judiciary of the nation.” He also noted that many Indian professionals with green cards have reported being questioned more frequently.

Immigration attorneys have howled that lawful immigrants are being subjected to better scrutiny and pressure at ports of entry. The administration has relied on ensuring adherence to existing immigration laws on account of national security and border control.

“The Trump administration is enforcing immigration laws—something the previous administration failed to do,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security told Newsweek. “Those who violate these laws will be processed, detained, and removed as required.”

Earlier, Vice President JD Vance said during a Fox News interview that “A green card holder doesn't have an indefinite right to be in the United States.”

This has led to increased inspections at airports and border checkpoints, with some green card holders reporting being detained and questioned upon reentry. Legal experts advise permanent residents against spending more than 180 days outside the US, as it may subject them to scrutiny upon their return.

Last year, there was a case that received attention when Fabian Schmidt, a green card holder from New Hampshire, did not like the treatment he received at Logan Airport upon returning from Luxembourg. He was said to have been subject to an aggressive interrogation and pressured to surrender his status.

Hilton Beckham, Assistant Commissioner of Public Affairs at CBP, denied the claims to Newsweek, stating, “These claims [regarding Schmidt] are blatantly false with respect to CBP. When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.”

“The revocation of green cards and arrest and detention of individuals in the U.S. without giving them an opportunity to prove their lawful status is a violation of due process,” Seattle-based immigration attorney Kripa Upadhyay told the American weekly news magazine.

Upadhyay also flagged the case of an Indian executive who was denied entry after being suspected of working illegally while on a B-1 business visa. “It is not connected to criminal activity on their parts; rather, to the fear of being without status because of excessive delays in immigration processing,” Upadhyay added.

When a Wisconsin shipyard won the contract to build a new class of Navy frigate in 2020, the project was meant to address an embarrassing reality: The U.S. is now the global laggard in building warships.

 Stocked with high-tech weaponry to protect against enemy submarines, missiles and drones, the USS Constellation was expected to be ready for the open water in 2026. That was because the U.S. chose a proven design from Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri in an effort to speed the process.  Then the Navy started tinkering. The hull was lengthened by 24 feet to accommodate larger generators and reconfigured in part because the design was based on the relatively benign conditions in the Mediterranean, and the propeller changed for better acoustic performance, among other time-consuming adjustments. The effect: Like almost all other U.S. naval vessels, the Constellation is already years behind schedule and millions over budget. A rendering of what the USS Constellation will look like. The frigate is still under construction.Physical construction began in mid-2022, and after more than 2½ years, the project is only 10% complete, according to a person familiar with the timeline. At this pace, including the two years of design time before building began, the ship will be completed in a total of nine years—around twice as long as it took an Italian shipyard to build the vessels it is based on. The Constellation, the first in what is expected to be around 20 to be built, is projected to cost at least $600 million more than its original estimate of $1.3 billion. The Constellation's slow production and extra costs help explain why almost nobody wants to buy new American warships—even as allies clamor for U.S. fighter jets and other weapons. A festering problem for the U.S. has turned into an acute one, as the world order shifts rapidly and the Pentagon gears up for a potential conflict in Asia that experts believe would be fought in large part on the seas. The issue is top of mind for President Trump, who is racing to address the problem even as his tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum would likely increase the cost of the domestically produced metals shipbuilders use. Trump said in his speech to Congress this month that his administration wants to create a new Office of Shipbuilding, with the goal of producing more of both commercial and military vessels. The administration is also preparing an executive order aimed at reviving U.S. shipbuilding and cutting Chinese dominance in the industry. China years ago leapfrogged America in making naval craft faster and for less money. From 2014 to 2023, China's navy launched 157 ships while the U.S. launched 67, according to independent defense analyst Tom Shugart. The Chinese fleet is now the world's largest, although the U.S. Navy says the quality of its ships are still better. Most countries are faster at building. Of 20 different frigates made recently or set for completion soon in 10 different countries, all but one were or will be built in less time than the U.S.'s Constellation, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. Frigates are the medium-size warships used for submarine warfare and escorting larger ships, among other tasks. U.S. construction of destroyers, the larger, heavily armed warships, is also slower than other countries. “Every shipbuilding delay, every maintenance backlog and every inefficiency is an opening for our adversaries to challenge our [naval] dominance,” said John Phelan, Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Navy, to the Senate Armed Services Committee last month during his confirmation process. Fincantieri's American subsidiary, which owns the Wisconsin shipyard, recently reshuffled several senior U.S. positions, including its chief executive. The company said after winning the Constellation contract that it would invest more than $350 million to upgrade equipment in its Wisconsin yards. A spokeswoman for the Naval Sea Systems Command, the department that deals with shipbuilding, said nearly all the changes made to the Constellation happened during its design rather than construction. “Any modifications made during the design phase have been to enhance the lethality, survivability, and fleet commonality of the frigate for U.S. Navy operations,” she said.  The department said the pace of the Constellation's construction was intentionally managed to ensure smooth production and long-term quality. Trump's preferenceThe industry faces myriad challenges, including high steel costs that could rise further amid an ongoing trade war. The U.S. also lacks a commercial shipbuilding industry, which means military vessels can't share supply chains for many of the same or similar components, or for raw materials or workers. Shipyards also struggle with aging equipment—sometimes dating to before World War II—and labor shortages, especially in the skilled trades, aggravated by an almost complete ban on foreign workers for military shipbuilding that doesn't exist in most other countries. Making matters worse is the Pentagon's proclivity for meddling in designs. The Navy has made so many changes in the Constellation that a ship that was supposed to share 85% of the design of its Italian parent now has just 15% in common, according to Eric Labs, senior analyst for Naval Forces and Weapons at the Congressional Budget Office. “We have an insatiable demand for capabilities at times…we struggle to say stop,” said Brett Seidle, civilian deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, at a congressional hearing this month. Trump himself has weighed in on what he wants in ships—especially regarding their appearance. During his first administration, he summoned the Secretary of the Navy at the time, Richard Spencer, to the Oval Office. Spencer showed Trump several photo-boards of various Navy ships, including carriers, frigates and destroyers. Trump went through the photos, which ended up on the floor, lamenting the ugliness of the ships, according to people familiar with the episode. Spencer then showed him pictures of several other frigates, and Trump admired some of those belonging to Russia. But it was the long mothballed USS New Jersey, whose large guns, while impressive, are now obsolete, that caught his eye. “There!” Trump said, and pointed to the picture of the ship, which was built during WW2 and also served during the Vietnam War. “Why can't we build ships that look like this?” A White House official said the description of the episode wasn't accurate. Trump on the visit to Fincantieri in 2020. The Navy's most recent target is to increase combat ships from 295 today to 390 by 2054. Taking into account the ships that will be retired in that time, U.S. shipyards would need to produce substantially more than they have over the past 10 years, according to a January report by the CBO. Some estimates suggest the U.S. needs to roughly double its rate of production. The CBO predicts shipbuilding will cost around $40 billion a year over the next 30 years, or 17% more than the Navy estimates. Fighter jets, missilesU.S. fighter jets and some missile systems—while also plagued with high costs and delays—don't face the same type of international competition that U.S. shipbuilders face. As a result, Lockheed Martin's F-35 has become the world's most sought after fighter jet and the Patriot missile defense system, among other U.S. weaponry, has a multiyear foreign order book. But newly built American ships very rarely beat European and South Korean rivals when selling abroad. “American ships are fearsome weapons of war…but they are expensive to build and also expensive to run,” said Jeremy Kyd, a former vice admiral in Britain's Royal Navy who had U.S. ships under his command in joint exercises. Trump didn't announce details of what efforts an Office of Shipbuilding would make, other than rolling out tax incentives for U.S. makers. An early draft of the planned executive order, which hasn't been issued, included 18 proposed measures ranging from raising fees on Chinese-built ships entering the U.S. and investing that in domestic shipbuilding, to raising wages for nuclear-shipyard workers. Seidle defended the Navy and U.S. shipbuilders, despite the delays. “U.S. shipbuilders continue to produce the highest quality, safest and most advanced warships on the globe,” he said. Of the handful of nations able to make aircraft carriers, the U.S.'s are much larger and powered by nuclear energy. Much of the weapons and technology are still world leading. But U.S. naval shipbuilding has fallen behind in some key metrics. In the 2000s, attack submarines that used to take six years to build now take nine, and aircraft carriers that used to take eight years now require 11, according to the CBO. The delays have contributed substantially to massive cost overruns, only a third of which can be attributed to shipbuilding inflation, the CBO said. The Pentagon spent around $2.6 billion to build each nuclear powered submarine launched between 2010 and 2021. At the same time, Britain, a notoriously expensive manufacturer, was building a similar version for under $2 billion. Among the reasons: The U.S. subs were made in sections at two different companies' shipyards and then towed on barges some 500 miles to be connected, while the British subs were produced in one location. The U.S. Navy has different standards from foreign navies, often more exacting as it seeks to make ships more “survivable” when hit by weapons or bad weather. That can result in major differences, such as the type of weaponry, or minor variations. In one example, most naval ships have several generators spread around the vessel, so if one goes, equipment can still work. But the U.S. Navy typically wants the generator and its switchboard to sit together, according to a person familiar with the matter. The thinking goes that because one is useless without the other, separating them provides two targets, increasing the chance of one part taking a hit and rendering both useless. So generators and bulky switchboards that are separated in Italy's frigates were located together in the Constellation, causing a redesign of the engine rooms to accommodate the additional equipment, the person said. The Naval Sea Systems Command said locating the generators and switchboards together isn't a blanket requirement for all vessels but is based on operational requirements, among other factors. Fincantieri and the Navy began building the ship in August 2022 before its design had been finalized, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. More changes came as the building progressed. Officials insisted that the computer systems that control communications, weapons and other functions needed more cooling. That meant greater ventilation and larger so-called chill pumps, and another reshuffling of space. The overall changes caused the ship to gain weight, to 10% above the initial plans. That means the Constellation will be slower than the original design for the ship, already in use in French and Italian navies. The Navy and Fincantieri are still finalizing critical design documents that inform the 3-D modeling needed to build the ship, according to people familiar with the matter. The Secretary of the Navy, however, certified to Congress in 2022 that the basic and functional design was complete, according to the Congressional Record. Decision by committeeSome shipyards said the Navy can be overly bureaucratic and that it makes too many decisions by committee. They complain that U.S. officials are slow to approve new equipment. On the Constellation, multiple rounds of review by the Navy to approve technical requirements led to extreme slowdowns in construction, said Shelby Oakley, a director in the GAO. In one example, Fincantieri had to respond to over 170 critical comments from the Navy on one—out of hundreds—of supporting documents vetted by the military. “The Navy peeled back the onion and realized how far the design was from meeting the Navy's standards, and had to take a strategic pause to try and right the ship,” said Oakley. The Navy complains U.S. shipyards don't invest enough in staff and equipment. McKinsey analysts in a recent report on U.S. shipyards found equipment, including metal casting machines, cranes and transport systems, that was decades old, some harking back to before WW2. The report said equipment broke down, causing delays to contracts. In some cases, it was so old that replacement parts had to be fabricated from scratch because they were no longer commercially available. Some shipbuilding executives said European naval yards typically have more modern equipment than those in America. Some investments have made improvements. In the so-called panel-line at Fincantieri's Wisconsin yard, where major ship sections are joined together, the addition of robotic welders means that there are now six workers as opposed to the 24 previously needed. That is important because the U.S. industry has a dearth of experienced older shipyard workers—with the skills necessary for the complex fabrications. A third of workers in Fincantieri's U.S. shipyard are over 50, compared with almost 40% in Italy. Last year, the Navy blamed inexperienced new hands at a Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Virginia for faulty welding on 26 vessels. A welder worked at Fincantieri in 2020.

As a result, Lockheed Martin's F-35 has become the world's most sought after fighter jet and the Patriot missile defense system, among other U.S. weaponry, has a multiyear foreign order book.

But newly built American ships very rarely beat European and South Korean rivals when selling abroad.

“American ships are fearsome weapons of war…but they are expensive to build and also expensive to run,” said Jeremy Kyd, a former vice admiral in Britain's Royal Navy who had U.S. ships under his command in joint exercises.

Trump didn't announce details of what efforts an Office of Shipbuilding would make, other than rolling out tax incentives for U.S. makers. An early draft of the planned executive order, which hasn't been issued, included 18 proposed measures ranging from raising fees on Chinese-built ships entering the U.S. and investing that in domestic shipbuilding, to raising wages for nuclear-shipyard workers.

Seidle defended the Navy and U.S. shipbuilders, despite the delays. “U.S. shipbuilders continue to produce the highest quality, safest and most advanced warships on the globe,” he said.

Of the handful of nations able to make aircraft carriers, the U.S.'s are much larger and powered by nuclear energy. Much of the weapons and technology are still world leading.

But U.S. naval shipbuilding has fallen behind in some key metrics. In the 2000s, attack submarines that used to take six years to build now take nine, and aircraft carriers that used to take eight years now require 11, according to the CBO.

The delays have contributed substantially to massive cost overruns, only a third of which can be attributed to shipbuilding inflation, the CBO said.

The Pentagon spent around $2.6 billion to build each nuclear powered submarine launched between 2010 and 2021. At the same time, Britain, a notoriously expensive manufacturer, was building a similar version for under $2 billion. Among the reasons: The U.S. subs were made in sections at two different companies' shipyards and then towed on barges some 500 miles to be connected, while the British subs were produced in one location.

The U.S. Navy has different standards from foreign navies, often more exacting as it seeks to make ships more “survivable” when hit by weapons or bad weather. That can result in major differences, such as the type of weaponry, or minor variations.

In one example, most naval ships have several generators spread around the vessel, so if one goes, equipment can still work. But the U.S. Navy typically wants the generator and its switchboard to sit together, according to a person familiar with the matter. The thinking goes that because one is useless without the other, separating them provides two targets, increasing the chance of one part taking a hit and rendering both useless.

So generators and bulky switchboards that are separated in Italy's frigates were located together in the Constellation, causing a redesign of the engine rooms to accommodate the additional equipment, the person said.

The Naval Sea Systems Command said locating the generators and switchboards together isn't a blanket requirement for all vessels but is based on operational requirements, among other factors.

Fincantieri and the Navy began building the ship in August 2022 before its design had been finalized, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office.

More changes came as the building progressed. Officials insisted that the computer systems that control communications, weapons and other functions needed more cooling. That meant greater ventilation and larger so-called chill pumps, and another reshuffling of space.

The overall changes caused the ship to gain weight, to 10% above the initial plans. That means the Constellation will be slower than the original design for the ship, already in use in French and Italian navies.

The Navy and Fincantieri are still finalizing critical design documents that inform the 3-D modeling needed to build the ship, according to people familiar with the matter. The Secretary of the Navy, however, certified to Congress in 2022 that the basic and functional design was complete, according to the Congressional Record.

Some shipyards said the Navy can be overly bureaucratic and that it makes too many decisions by committee. They complain that U.S. officials are slow to approve new equipment.

On the Constellation, multiple rounds of review by the Navy to approve technical requirements led to extreme slowdowns in construction, said Shelby Oakley, a director in the GAO. In one example, Fincantieri had to respond to over 170 critical comments from the Navy on one—out of hundreds—of supporting documents vetted by the military.

“The Navy peeled back the onion and realized how far the design was from meeting the Navy's standards, and had to take a strategic pause to try and right the ship,” said Oakley.

The Navy complains U.S. shipyards don't invest enough in staff and equipment.

McKinsey analysts in a recent report on U.S. shipyards found equipment, including metal casting machines, cranes and transport systems, that was decades old, some harking back to before WW2.

The report said equipment broke down, causing delays to contracts. In some cases, it was so old that replacement parts had to be fabricated from scratch because they were no longer commercially available.

Some shipbuilding executives said European naval yards typically have more modern equipment than those in America.

Some investments have made improvements. In the so-called panel-line at Fincantieri's Wisconsin yard, where major ship sections are joined together, the addition of robotic welders means that there are now six workers as opposed to the 24 previously needed.

That is important because the U.S. industry has a dearth of experienced older shipyard workers—with the skills necessary for the complex fabrications. A third of workers in Fincantieri's U.S. shipyard are over 50, compared with almost 40% in Italy. Last year, the Navy blamed inexperienced new hands at a Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Virginia for faulty welding on 26 vessels.

North Korea said Friday it test-launched new anti-aircraft missiles, as its military threatened unspecified grave steps against the U.S. and South Korea over their joint military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal.

The official Korean Central News Agency said that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the tests Thursday and called the missiles involved “another major defense weapons system” for North Korea.

The missile launches, North Korea's sixth weapons testing activity this year, occurred on the same day that the U.S. and South Korean militaries concluded their annual Freedom Shield command post exercise. The 11-day training was the allies' first major joint military exercises since the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January, and the two countries held diverse field training exercises alongside the Freedom Shield drills.

U.S. and South Korean officials describe their combined military drills as defensive in nature, but North Korea slams them as a major security threat. Hours after this year's Freedom Shield training began on March 10, North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea.

On Friday, the North Korea's Defense Ministry alleged the recent U.S.-South Korean drills involved simulations to destroy underground tunnels in the North to remove its nuclear weapons. An unidentified ministry spokesperson said the U.S. and South Korea would face consequences if they perform similar provocative actions again.

“The accumulated reckless military moves of the U.S. and the ROK, seized with the daydream that they can jeopardize the sovereignty and security of a nuclear weapons state, can undoubtedly bring the gravest consequences they do not want,” the spokesperson said in a statement carried in KCNA.

ROK is the Republic of Korea, South Korea's official name.

North Korea often churns out warlike rhetoric and threats of attacks when the U.S. and South Korea militaries conduct big drills.

Trump has said he's willing to reach out to Kim to revive their diplomacy, but North Korea hasn't made any public responses to Trump's overture. Many experts say Kim, now preoccupied with his support of Russia's war efforts against Ukraine, won't likely embrace Trump's outreach anytime soon, but could seriously consider it when the war ends.

Kim and Trump met three times in 2018-19 to discuss North Korea's possible nuclear disarmament, but their diplomacy eventually fell apart due to disputes over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.

A US district court judge on Thursday blocked the deportation of Indian researcher Badar Khan Suri, following the arrest and threat of expulsion of the Georgetown University scholar for alleged Hamas ties.

According to a report by news agency AFP, judge Patricia Tolliver Giles of the Eastern District of Virginia Court ordered Suri ""shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the court issues a contrary order.”

The detention of Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University Washington DC, came as fears mount in the academic world that freedom of research and speech is being challenged two months into US President Donald Trump's new term.

Badar Khan Suri's lawyer demanded his release and denounced the arrest as a ""targeted, retaliatory detention"" that was intended ""to silence, or at the very least restrict and chill, his speech"" as well as that of others who “express support for Palestinian rights.”

Suri's case also got support from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has also filed an emergency motion to stop the deportation. The organisation said Suri was being held at an immigration detention center in Louisiana.

""Ripping someone from their home and family, stripping them of their immigration status, and detaining them solely based on political viewpoint is a clear attempt by President Trump to silence dissent. That is patently unconstitutional"" said ACLU immigrant rights attorney Sophia Gregg, AFP reported.

On Wednesday, the French government condemned the expulsion of a French space scientist meant to attend a conference in Houston, after officials searched his smartphone and found what they called ""hateful"" messages against US policy.

Georgetown University backed the detained scholar Badar Khan Suri, saying that the school wasn't aware of him being involved in any illegal activity.

""Dr Khan Suri is an Indian national who was duly granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,"" Georgetown University said in a statement.

Suri's lawyer also pointed out in a court filing that neither secretary of state Marco Rubio ""nor any other government official has alleged that Suri has committed any crime or, indeed, broke any law whatsoever.”

The filing accused the US government of having detained Suri ""based on his family connection and constitutionally protected free speech.""

Suri was arrested by federal agents on Monday night outside his home in Virginia. He has been accused of ‘spreading Hamas propaganda' and ‘close ties with a suspected terrorist'.

US President Donald Trump warned on Thursday that those who get caught sabotaging Tesla vehicles could land in prison for up to 20 years.

Donald Trump posted the warning on his Truth Social handle, saying that the authorities were ‘looking for you'.

“People that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes the funders. WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!” he wrote in the post.

The development comes as Tesla faces widespread protests across the United States ever since its CEO Elon Musk became involved in the corridors of power in Washington. Several Tesla vehicles have faced vandalism in recent weeks, with even molotov cocktails thrown at the company's dealerships and cars by those not happy with Musk's actions as the head of the newly-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The department has fired thousands of federal workers to reduce the growing government expenditure. Several states and organisations have used DOGE in courts across the country.

Donald Trump's statement is similar to the one issued by US attorney general Pam Bondi on Tuesday who called the attacks on Tesla vehicles “nothing short of domestic terrorism” and vowed to impose severe consequences for those involved in the crime.

The only difference in the two statements was the quantum of punishment for these transgressions. The attorney general proposed a lighter sentence than the President.

""The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism. The Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators with that in mind, including in cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences,"" Pam Bondi was quoted as saying by ABC News.

Bondi added that the authorities would continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, “including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes”.

The attorney's general's statement comes in the aftermath of a fire at a Tesla Collision Centre in Las Vegas early on Tuesday morning. Five Tesla vehicles were damaged according to police officials quoted by ABC News, in this latest attack on the electric vehicle company owned by Elon Musk.

Officials stated that not only were the vehicles burnt, but the word “RESIST” was spray-painted across the doors of the facility. Three rounds of bullets were also shot at the rest of the Tesla vehicles.

No one embodies the rise of Hong Kong as a global commercial center better than Li Ka-shing, who arrived as a refugee in 1940 and became one of Asia's richest businessmen.

 Now, in the twilight of a business career that has spanned eight decades, the 96-year-old billionaire is staring down a fusillade of criticism from Beijing, which is imposing ever-tighter control over the territory.  The standoff was triggered by the kind of deal that earned Li the nickname “superman” for his uncanny sense of when to buy—and sell. With the growth of trade threatened by Trump-era tariffs, Li's flagship company, CK Hutchison, announced a deal in early March to sell dozens of ports to a group led by BlackRock.  The $23 billion deal would limit Hutchison's exposure to a global trade downturn. But the assets for sale included politically sensitive ports at either end of the Panama Canal. President Trump, apparently referring to the two ports, said in his inaugural address that “China is operating the Panama Canal” and “we're taking it back.” Trump said the BlackRock group's purchase meant that the U.S. was starting to reclaim its rights. In Beijing, the deal stirred the opposite reaction. Chinese leader Xi Jinping fumed that he had lost a potential card in negotiations with Washington without getting a heads-up. The Panama Canal is a point of contention between the U.S. and China. Pro-Beijing Hong Kong media have published commentaries denouncing the deal, without mentioning Li by name. A nationalist commentator—Hu Xijin, former editor in chief of the state-run tabloid Global Times—took on the tycoon directly. “I'd advise the person in charge of CK Hutchison to stand up for himself and bravely contend with the threats from the U.S.,” Hu wrote recently in a blog post titled “What Should Li Ka-shing Do in the Eye of the Storm?” If the Hong Kong company was attracted only by the financial terms, Hu said, it was “trading integrity for profits.” Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, said asking for Beijing's permission was out of the question for Li because he never would have received it. “He would have lost the deal, and he would have confirmed to Donald Trump that Hutchison operates on behalf of the Communist Party of China,” Tsang said. The episode marks an unsettling coda to a business career that brought Li the ear of Chinese leaders and a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. Li Ka-shing has become the richest person in Hong Kong, with estimated wealth of $38 billion.Born in China, Li started his empire in Hong Kong in the 1950s manufacturing plastic flowers. His 1979 takeover of the trading group Hutchison Whampoa was considered a landmark because it put a local person in charge of the kind of business that had always been run by British nationals. Li built the company into a global conglomerate, with interests in ports, telecommunications, drugstores and more. He became the richest person in Hong Kong, with his wealth recently estimated by Forbes at $38 billion. Li is renowned for his sense of timing—whether buying Hong Kong real estate during downturns in the 1960s or selling Hutchison's controlling stake in the U.K. mobile-phone operator Orange in 1999 for about $15 billion, near the peak of the dot-com bubble. After Beijing's 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown on students led many investors to flee, Li signaled his belief in China's economic prospects by committing more than $1 billion in 1992 to develop a container-handling port in Shanghai—betting correctly that the mainland would compete directly with Hong Kong. As the mainland's economic power eclipsed the territory, Beijing grew assertive over national interests in business deals—especially after Xi took power in 2012. If Beijing had once consulted Li and Hong Kong's other tycoons, it now lectured them. Li Ka-shing was among Hong Kong business people who greeted Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2017.At times, it appeared that Li wasn't listening. In the midst of turmoil for China's financial markets in 2015, including a stock-market slide and a fumbled reset of the country's currency, Li pursued the sale of Shanghai property. To some in Beijing, it looked as though he was endorsing a charge toward the exits. “Don't Let Li Ka-shing Get Away,” declared a commentary at the time from a think tank affiliated with the official Xinhua News Agency. It described Li as a “monster with fangs” who had forgotten that his fortune derived from supportive government policies in ports, property and telecommunications. Li defended his business strategy and expressed confidence in the Chinese leadership, and the furor died down. People's Daily, the official Communist Party mouthpiece, showed sympathy for Li, saying in a commentary that it was natural for capitalists to seek profits. In 2018, shortly before his 90th birthday, Li stepped down as chairman of CK Hutchison and handed the reins to his son Victor Li, now 60. But he didn't fully retire. The next year, the elder Li raised Beijing's ire anew by trying to take a middle ground when fierce clashes broke out on Hong Kong streets between pro-democracy advocates and local authorities. He took out a pair of ads that wrapped the front pages of several Hong Kong newspapers. One addressed protesters, saying the best intentions can have the worst outcomes, while the other appeared aimed at authorities by referring to a Tang dynasty poem that called on an empress not to kill her own children. In recent years, CK Hutchison has trimmed its reliance on mainland China and Hong Kong while investing in Europe. Still, it continues to invest in the mainland and Hong Kong, and Li is widely admired as a philanthropist in both places for the billions of dollars his foundation has spent supporting education, health and other causes. Other Hong Kong tycoons will be watching whether Beijing interferes with the Panama ports deal and might consider moving more business out of Hong Kong if Li is punished too much over it, said Tsang at SOAS. “I think it's going to be counterproductive to what the Chinese government wants,” he said.

US President Donald Trump's billionaire backer Elon Musk will reportedly get access to the Pentagon's top-secret plans for a potential war with China. 

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) chief will visit the Department of Defence offices on Friday, The New York Times reported, citing sources.

The NYT report further added that the ‘unusual access' given to Musk ‘would be a dramatic expansion of his already extensive role as an adviser to President Trump and leader of his effort to slash spending and purge the government of people and policies they oppose'.

The top-secret briefing on the China war plan has about 20 to 30 slides and details the United States' plans to fight China if a war-like situation comes up, NYT reported. It includes ‘various options on what Chinese targets to hit, over what time period'. The plan will be presented to President Trump.

Neither the White House nor Elon Musk have confirmed the latter's Pentagon visit yet. Sean Parnell, the chief Defence Department spokesman, told the Times: “The Defence Department is excited to welcome Elon Musk to the Pentagon on Friday. He was invited by Secretary Hegseth and is just visiting.”

Musk is already facing scrutiny over his role within the Trump administration. The 53-year-old, who runs companies like Tesla and SpaceX, has spearheaded the government's cost-slashing efforts since Trump took office in January.

The tech billionaire, in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, addressed the backlash and anti-Tesla attacks in the past weeks.

""It turns out when you take away people's, you know, the money that they're receiving fraudulently, they get very upset,” he told Hannity, further adding that ‘they basically want to kill me'.

“And they basically want to kill me because I'm stopping their fraud and they want to hurt Tesla because we're stopping the terrible waste and corruption in the government. And, well, I guess they're bad people. Bad people do bad things,” Musk added.

President Donald Trump on Thursday refuted a New York Times report claiming that his adviser and DOGE chief Elon Musk will be briefed by the Pentagon on the US military's plan for a potential war against China.

This comes after Defense chief Pete Hegseth confirmed that officials will discuss ‘innovation, efficiencies and smarter production' with the tech billionaire on Friday.

""China will not even be mentioned or discussed,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

Earlier in the day, The New York Times cited sources to report that Elon Musk would be briefed about the United States's plans before they are presented to Trump. The report added that the alleged briefing would include 20 to 30 slides that lay out how the US would fight in a conflict with China.



Dismissing the report, Hegseth said on X: “We look forward to welcoming @elonmusk to the Pentagon tomorrow. But the fake news delivers again — this is NOT a meeting about “top secret China war plans.” It's an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production. Gonna be great!”

President Trump said the NYT report is ‘ridiculous'. “China will not even be mentioned or discussed. How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies. Anyway, the story is completely untrue!!!” he wrote



The report comes amid severe criticism of Musk's role in the Trump administration. 

Critics, particularly far-left Democrats, allege that the Tesla CEO has business interests in China and with the Pentagon. The White House has previously stated that the billionaire will recuse himself if any conflicts of interest arise.

Rapper Yella Beezy was reportedly arrested in Dallas on Thursday for with a capital murder charge in the death of rapper Mo3, TMZ reported. According to court documents obtained by the entertainment website, the 33-year-old, whose real name is Markies Deandre Conway, is accused of causing the death of Melvin Noble aka Mo3 on November 11, 2020.

The documents further show that investigators believe Beezy hired a Kewon Dontrell White to kill Noble. Fox 4 reported that the Dallas rapper was formally indicted by a Dallas County grand jury on Tuesday and arrested two days later.

A screenshot of the indictment surfaced on social media. It shows that White fatally shot Mo3 on a Dallas highway. He was chased on foot and shot multiple times on Interstate 35E.

 

 

TMZ further added that Conway provided ‘financial compensation' to the hitman. Kewon White has been arrested in connection to Noble's killing.

Texas law classifies capital murder with remuneration as an especially heinous offense. This category of capital murder involves a killing committed in exchange for money or other forms of compensation, elevating its severity under the Texas Penal Code.

If convicted, the defendant faces one of two possible outcomes: life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or the death penalty, depending on the decision of the court and jury.

Yella Beezy and Mo3's beef featured several diss tracks, threats and social media insults. In 2019, Beezy survived a drive-by shooting in Lewisville, Texas. However, the incident was not linked to Mo3.

Ishan Sharma, an Indian influencer who became embroiled in controversy for labelling New York's tipping culture a ‘scam,' is making headlines again due to a recent video of his interaction with Jensen Huang. People are irked by the question he asked the CEO at Nvidia GTC exhibits.

“Just met the Taylor Swift of tech!” Sharma wrote as he shared a short video. In the clip, Sharma says, “I want to ask you what is your biggest advice to people who want to build a startup or do something in the space of AI and hardware?” Huang simply replies, “Work hard.”

How did social media react?People were not impressed with the question Sharma asked Huang. Many remarked that he should have asked something specific rather than generic to “one of the biggest CEOs in the world.” “Calls him ‘Taylor Swift of tech'.

The fire that engulfed a minibus carrying employees of graphic design firm Vyoma Graphics in Hinjewadi on Wednesday morning, killing four and injuring five others, was not an accident but a planned act of revenge by the vehicle's driver, Hinjewadi police said on Thursday. 

By evening, the police had initiated the process of filing a first information report (FIR) and securing the driver's arrest. 

The incident occurred around 7.30 am when the bus was carrying 14 employees on their way to the office for the first shift. According to Vishal Gaikwad, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), the 52-year-old accused driver, Janardan Humbardekar, had deliberately set the bus on fire due to work-related grievances, including constant quarrel with employees he was ferrying. 

Initially, authorities suspected a short-circuit might have caused the fire. However, the theory was debunked following the driver's confession. 

“This was not an accident; it was a premeditated act,” Gaikwad said at a press conference at Hinjewadi Police Station on Thursday evening. 

Humbardekar, a resident of Warje area, reportedly smuggled benzene into the vehicle a day earlier, placed rags used for toner cleaning inside the vehicle, and ignited them with a matchstick when the bus reached a one-way stretch in Hinjewadi Phase 1. Before the fire spread, he exited the vehicle, ensuring his escape. Humbardekar too sustained minor burn injuries and was undergoing treatment at a private hospital. 

When the fire broke out, the driver had jumped from the bus while it was still in motion. The vehicle proceeded driverless for some 200 metres before it crashed into a tree. 

Kanhaiya Thorat, senior inspector attached to Hinjewadi Police Station, said Hambardekar, who has been working with the company since 2006, frequently argued with four to five staff members who regularly travelled in the vehicle. The police investigation revealed that he was agitated over salary deduction and denial of Diwali bonus, despite working overtime. 

“His frustration peaked on Tuesday when he couldn't find his tiffin and had to remain hungry. Already upset over pay cuts and workplace disputes, this incident pushed him over the edge. He decided to take revenge on the employees,” Thorat said. 

During the police questioning, Hambardekar allegedly confessed to planning the attack in advance, buying the flammable chemical and ensuring the emergency exit of the bus was faulty so that passengers would struggle to escape. The cops recorded his statement on Thursday morning. 

During the initial probe, the police had concluded that the employees died mainly because the emergency exit at the rear end of the minibus malfunctioned as they could not open it. 

According to Ruby Hall Clinic, Hinjewadi, where Hambardekar and two other victims are undergoing treatment, the driver sustained only minor superficial burns. Hospital officials said he is likely to be discharged in a couple of days. 

Four employees lost their lives in the blaze. The victims were identified as Shankar Shinde, 63; Rajan Chavan, 42; Gurudas Lokare, 45; and Subhash Bhosale, 44. The deceased were residents of Pune and held various roles within the company, such as supervisor, printing machine operator, courier, and paper cutting operator.

A US citizen who came to India nine years ago started his business, got married to a local woman, and settled in Goa all because he got frustrated with inflation harming his quality of life in America. In a LinkedIn post, he said that he now lives a comfortable lifestyle that costs him less than ₹1 lakh per month.

“I made a rare financial decision 12 years ago. And it has changed my finances (and life) forever. Most personal finance gurus tell you to: Budget your expenses. Invest and hold long-term. Build multiple streams of income. Then, you achieve: (F)inancial (I)ndependence (R)etire (E)arly,” Elliot Rosenberg wrote. He added that while onboard with these bits of advice, he faced a problem while living in America - he found the country very expensive. “Inflation is bad, but “lifestyle creep” is worse,” he added.

In the following lines, he discussed the societal pressure to spend money on fancy restaurants, concerts, shopping trips, etc. to avoid losing friendships. He explained that this pressure led him to decide to move out of the US. Initially, he travelled to Brazil and then to other South Asian countries. However, he finally decided to settle in India.

“I met my wife here, became close to her family, learned Hindi, have made lifelong bonds, and started 2 businesses,” he added.

He then went on to share where he currently lives and how much it costs him monthly to live comfortably with his family.

What did social media say?An individual wrote, “I loved your appetite to take risks and be adventurous... It has paid off, and I gather you are fulfilled. Thanks for sharing your story.” Another added, “Good to know that India is far better for healthy and safe living.” A third posted, “Love the story- kudos for having the courage to go pursue a life outside of the “‘norms!'” Also Read: Woman lists 8 things in India that make Americans uncomfortable, internet reacts: ‘Bidet better than your toilet paper'After completing his schooling, Rosenberg pursued a BS in Commerce and a second major in Latin American Studies from the University of Virginia.

A family travelling from London Gatwick to Lyon, France, faced an unexpected financial burden after being forced to pay an additional ₹13,200 (£126) at the airport due to check-in issues with Wizz Air, reported the Mirror.

Tristan Dudouet, 35, his partner Mona, 30, and their young daughter Naia had initially tried to check in online and book adjacent seats three days before their departure. However, technical glitches on the airline's website prevented them from doing so. Hoping to resolve the issue at the airport, Tristan was dismayed when staff informed him that he would need to pay an extra fee on top of their original ticket prices.

Believing the charge was necessary to sit together as a family, Tristan reluctantly made the payment. However, Wizz Air later clarified that the fee was actually a late check-in charge and had nothing to do with seating arrangements. The airline insisted that all passengers were informed of these policies in advance, according to the outlet. 

Tristan, who lives in Oxford, shared his frustration with Luxury Travel Daily, saying, “It added a lot of stress to the travelling. A lot of people are tight on money and would have to take their child home instead of going on holiday. I felt like they were looking at me like a piece of meat and wondering how much money they could get out of me. I was so frustrated and we didn't have a choice but to pay.”

Explaining his difficulty with Wizz Air's online check-in system, he added, “I'd tried to check in online a few days before but it wouldn't let me. Basically, you can't check in online with your toddler before 24 hours. The only window to check in online with your child for free is 24 hours to two hours before departure time, which is a tight window. So if you try too early, then you don't have the option to check in online for free with your toddler.”

Tristan also expressed frustration over what he perceived as a lack of clarity in the airline's policies, stating, “The rules aren't made clear, and it seems like they're meant to confuse the customer. I thought it was a problem with the website and I'd be able to sort it at the airport because we had to sit with our daughter. It feels like they're trying to catch you out.”

In response to the incident, a Wizz Air spokesperson told The Mirror that their system ensures at least one parent is always seated with a child under 14. They explained that while families can pay to select specific seats in advance, the airline does not guarantee that an entire family will be seated together unless seats are pre-booked.

Regarding check-in procedures, the airline defended its policies, stating, “Like many other airlines, Wizz Air encourages all passengers to check in online as early as possible before their scheduled departure time. We aim to make check-in simple for passengers and provide instructions during the booking process, on the Wizz Air website, and via email reminders on how to check in online to avoid fees.”

Wizz Air also clarified that passengers who do not check in online within the free 24-hour window before departure must check in at the airport, incurring additional charges.

The airline detailed the fees, stating that passengers can pre-book airport check-in for ₹1,200 (£11.50), while those checking in at the airport without pre-booking must pay ₹3,700 (£35.50). They advised customers to book directly through their website to ensure they receive all necessary updates regarding their flights and check-in processes.

Hans Niemann recently lost to GM Daniil Dubov in a 18-game blitz match in Moscow. The Russian GM won with a 9.5-8.5 score, and the loser was supposed to answer a single question in a lie-detector polygraph test.

The match took place after their controversy at the 2024 World Blitz Championship, where Dubov didn't turn up for the game, and Niemann by default.

Speaking on YouTube, the American GM complained that he would not take the lie-detector test due to disrespect from his opponent.

“I have no intention of giving someone like Dubov, who behaved like a child, the honor of asking me a question on the lie detector, which is pure pseudo-science, when I have nothing to prove,” he said.

“Despite all the things that have been done to me, I have continued to perform. I have nothing left to prove. The onus is on them to prove. These are terrible people who tried to destroy a 19-year-old kid's life because of a personal and sick vendetta.”

Niemann also accused Dubov of speaking and disturbing him during the match, followed by refusing to shake hands. “It's just mindboggling the level of disrespect from the chess world and chess players,” he said.

Niemann also revealed that Dubov wanted the test to be conducted in Dubai and the American would need to cover the expenses. “I'm not going to pay for an entire trip and put Dubov in a nice hotel just for this,” Niemann said.

Meanwhile, Dubov has already made it clear in an interview to a Russian news website, where he revealed that he would ask Niemann if he ever cheated over the board over the past five years.

Niemann will also be in action in the upcoming Paris Freestyle Grand Slam event, where he will take on the likes of Magnus Carlsen and D Gukesh. He is also set to appear in a Netflix documentary with Magnus Carlsen, where they will open up on their controversial cheating scandal. The documentary is set to be released in April.

Denmark recently took on Portugal in Copenhagen on Thursday in the first leg of the UEFA Nations League quarterfinal. Manchester United's Rasmus Hojlund came off the bench to score in the 78th-minute to give Denmark a 1-0 win, but also courted controversy with his celebration.

After scoring, the young striker ran towards the corner and performed Cristiano Ronaldo's iconic ‘Siu' celebration, while the Al Nassr star was on the field for Portugal and watched on.

Speaking to reporters after the match, Hojlund explained, “It's for my idol. It wasn't to mock him or anything. He's had such a huge impact on me and my football career. Maybe it's a bit ambivalent, but to score against him and Portugal, it's huge.”

“I remember him scoring from a free kick in 2011 when I went to watch the match, and since then I've been a huge Cristiano fan,” he added.

Meanwhile, Ronaldo, who is already 40-years-old, has been receiving criticism from some fans for his continued inclusion in the Portugal playing XI.

Recently, Portugal head coach Roberto Martinez explained his decision to continue picking Ronaldo. Speaking to Coaches Voice, he said, “When I talk about a player like Cristiano Ronaldo, I also evaluate him on the basis of these three key aspects. His talent is indisputable; he is one of the best in the history of football. His experience is also unique: the only player to play in six European Championships and to have more than 200 international matches.”

“But what stands out the most is his commitment. His passion for representing Portugal is contagious and motivates the entire team. He is not in the team today for what he has been, but for what he continues to be: the top scorer with 17 goals in the 21 games we have played in two years.”

A mother waiting for his deported son to come back home was shocked after she spotted him in a news report. According to the BBC, the Donald Trump administration deported her son for staying in the US illegally, and she assumed that he would return home to Venezuela's capital, Caracas. Instead, she saw her son in footage showing 238 Venezuelans who were sent to the Terrorism Confinement Centre, or Cecot, a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador for being an alleged gang member.

""I thought it was a good sign that he was being deported [to Caracas],"" Myrelis Casique López, mother of 24-year-old Francisco José García Casique, told the BBC.

The footage of the prison showed men surrounded by heavy security inside the prison. The alleged gang members with shaved heads had shackles on their hands and feet.

The mother told the outlet she was sure one of the detainees was her son. ""It's him. It's him,"" she said, pointing towards one of the men in the prison.

""I recognise his features,” she added. Though the men bowed their heads, the mom said she recognised her son's features and tattoos. She insisted on her son's innocence.

The Trump administration, despite a judge's temporary order, moved 238 Venezuelans to an El Salvador prison which, according to the Guardian, is “designed to disappear people.”

The Venezuelan immigrants to the US were transported for allegedly having gang affiliation. Some were also accused of drug smuggling, sex trafficking, and murders.

According to the BBC, many deportees did not have US criminal records. In the case of Francisco, his mother told the outlet, ""He doesn't belong to any criminal gang, either in the US or in Venezuela… he's not a criminal."" She continued, “What he's been is a barber.""

""Unfortunately, he has tattoos,"" she added, expressing that she thinks he was deported because he was inked. She further said that the tattoos are of roses and the names of his family members.

A political scientist at Emerson College, Mneesha Gellman, who researches human rights and violence, told the Guardian that the deportees would face “dire conditions and uncertain fates.”

“We don't know how any of this will play out, because it's never exactly happened before,” she said, adding, “Because these are Venezuelans being deported to a country most of them have never been.”

Lewis Hamilton smashed the Shanghai circuit lap record on his way to a stunning first sprint race pole for Ferrari in China on Friday, with Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen alongside on the front row.

The seven times world champion produced a best time of one minute 30.849 seconds with last year's winner Verstappen a mere 0.018 slower in the first sprint race qualifying of the Formula One season.

McLaren's Oscar Piastri qualified third with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc fourth, Mercedes' George Russell fifth and McLaren's championship leader Lando Norris sixth.

The sprint pole was Hamilton's first of any sort since joining Ferrari from Mercedes and marked a remarkable turnaround from finishing 10th in a disappointing season-opener in Australia last weekend.

""I didn't expect that result but I'm so happy and so proud,"" said the 40-year-old.

""The last race was a disaster for us and we knew there was more performance in the car but weren't able to extract it. I'm a bit in shock.""

Verstappen said second was a morale boost for the team but expected it would be hard to keep the McLarens behind even over a reduced distance.

""I'm very happy. In practice, we were quite a bit off so I'm very happy to be on the front row,"" he added.

Norris had looked set for a fast time but made a mistake and ran wide, forcing the Briton to abort his lap.

""I locked up in the last corner. We just struggled a bit more now, just not quick enough, simply. Struggled a lot with the car,"" he said.

""When the wind's blowing then we struggle a lot more....I think the car is still good and in a good window. Maybe not good enough for pole, but we can definitely go forward.""

Italian rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli will start seventh, ahead of Racing Bulls' Yuki Tsunoda, Williams' Alex Albon and Lance Stroll for Aston Martin.

British rookie Oliver Bearman made a strong return for Haas after an error-strewn opener in Melbourne and will line up 12th on Saturday's grid and ahead of Williams' Carlos Sainz in 13th.

The same could not be said for Red Bull's Liam Lawson, whose difficult start as Verstappen's new teammate continued with last on the sprint grid and complaining he could not get the tyres working.

Neither of the Alpines made it through the first phase of qualifying, with Frenchman Pierre Gasly lining up 17th and Australian rookie Jack Doohan 16th.

The parents of missing Indian student Sudiksha Konanki want their daughter declared dead to ""seek closure"", authorities told CNN.

""It supports the wishes of Ms Konanki's grieving parents to seek closure in their request that the Dominican law enforcement authorities acknowledge the death of their daughter by accidental drowning,"" the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office in Virginia, where Ms Konanki's family lives, told the outlet.

The final decision rests with Dominican authorities.

Ms Konanki's body has not been found since she vanished on March 6 from Punta Cana beach in the Dominican Republic. The Konanki family, in a letter obtained by CNN, said that initiating the legal process would help them grieve and address related matters.

Investigators believe their daughter drowned and no criminal evidence has been found so they urged authorities to ""proceed with the legal declaration of her death,"" they added.

Sheriff Mike Chapman said that while investigators believe Ms Konanki drowned, her death has not been officially confirmed, and the case remains open. Authorities in the Dominican Republic are continuing their investigation, and legal experts note that declaring someone dead without a body is a complex process in the country.



According to attorney Julio Cury, such a declaration would require special approval from Congress or the president.

The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office has offered assistance to the family in navigating the process, including judicial procedures if necessary. Personal injury and criminal defence attorney Phillip DiLucente explained that the family's request is likely driven by a need for closure. ""From a parental position, they want to honour their child and have it be respected,"" he said.

A legal declaration of death would also allow the family to settle financial matters, such as college savings plans and insurance policies. Until a death certificate is issued, these remain in legal limbo. If the family were to pursue legal action, the declaration would determine the type of lawsuit and potential damages even though the Konanki family has not indicated any plans to sue.

In an emotional interview with Fox News On Tuesday, Ms Konanki's father said, ""It is with deep sadness and a heavy heart that we are coming to terms with the fact that our daughter has drowned. This is incredibly difficult for us to process,"" he said, asking for prayers for their family.

A post shared by FOX 5 DC (@fox5dc)

Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student, arrived in Punta Cana on March 3 with five of her friends. Surveillance footage shows her drinking at the Riu Republica Hotel bar before heading to the beach with a group, including 'person of interest' Joshua Riibe. At 4:15 am, cameras captured the group entering the beach. By 5 am, all but Ms Konanki had returned.

Authorities in the Dominican Republic have confiscated the passport of Mr Riibe, the last person known to have been with Ms Konanki. He was interviewed for over six hours but is not considered a suspect.

During his fourth interview, Mr Riibe described a failed attempt to rescue her after they were pulled by a wave.

On Wednesday, the 22-year-old Iowa resident was released from detention but his passport remains with the authorities. Mr Riibe, a student at St Cloud State University in Minnesota, said the authorities detained him without any formal charges, adding he was treated unfairly during the investigation.

The probe is on and both US and Dominican authorities have classified this as a missing persons case rather than a criminal matter.

US President Donald Trump said on Friday that people who are caught sabotaging Tesla cars may stand a chance to go to jail for up to twenty years. He made the announcement in a post on Truth Social.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""People that get caught sabotaging Tesla's will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes the funders. WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!""

The statement by Trump comes after US Attorney General Pam Bondi has called the recent violent attacks on Tesla property ""nothing short of domestic terrorism"" and vowed to investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.

In a statement, Bondi stated, ""The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism. The Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators with that in mind, including in cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences.""

""We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,"" she added.

Bondi's statement came after five Tesla vehicles were damaged when a fire erupted at a Tesla Collision Center in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning. The incident was the latest of such incidents aimed at the electric vehicle company, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, ABC News reported.

Since Tesla CEO Elon Musk started serving as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations have been vandalised and faced protests in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, the US Department of Defence is set to brief Elon Musk on plans for a potential war with China, according to a report by The New York Times. The publication said that the access would be a major expansion of Elon Musk's government role and highlight his conflicts of interest. It said that the billionaire chief executive of both SpaceX and Tesla is a leading supplier to the Pentagon and has extensive financial interests in China.

Musk was also the largest financial supporter of the US President during the presidential campaign.

Billionaire Elon Musk, US President Donald Trump's close ally, is due to be briefed on Friday by the Pentagon on the US military's plan for any war that might break out with China, the New York Times reported on Thursday, citing US officials.

Access to the closely guarded military plan would mark a sharp expansion of Musk's role as a Trump adviser who has spearheaded efforts to cut US government spending.

It would also fuel questions about conflicts of interest for Musk, who as the head of both Tesla and SpaceX has business interests in China and with the Pentagon.

The White House has previously said Musk will recuse himself if any conflicts of interest arise between his business dealings and his role in cutting federal government spending.

The briefing for the China war plan has about 20 to 30 slides that lay out how the United States would fight such a conflict, the New York Times reported.

The Pentagon confirmed that Musk will be visiting on Friday but did not share further details. ""The Defense Department is excited to welcome Elon Musk to the Pentagon on Friday. He was invited by Secretary (Pete) Hegseth and is just visiting,"" a Pentagon spokesperson said.

Washington and Beijing have had tense relations for years over differences ranging from access to technology, trade tariffs and cybersecurity to TikTok, Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights and the origins of COVID-19.

The United States has released an official statement in which it has praised Intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard for her ""nuanced understanding"" of the Indo-Pacific region. The statement comes days after her visit to India, during which she held a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

During her visit Ms Gabbard had spoken exclusively to NDTV World, where she spoke on several issues in the region, including the situation in Bangladesh. She had mentioned how there has been a rise in ""persecution of minorities"" in Bangladesh and mentioned how the mentality of an ""Islamist Caliphate"" stems from extremism and violence. The statement was rejected by Bangladesh, which termed it as ""misleading"".



In an exclusive interview to NDTV World, United States' Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said, ""The longtime unfortunate persecution, killing, and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and others has been a major area of concern for the US government and President Trump and his administration.""

In her remarks she spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aim for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding that ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they chose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""

Bangladesh's interim government had responded by saying, ""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism.""

""Having been born and raised in the Indo-Pacific region, DNI Gabbard brought a nuanced understanding of the area's crucial partnerships and complex challenges,"" a DNI statement said.

It added that Ms Gabbard also ""explored opportunities to advance President Trump's America First policies across the Indo-Pacific region"".

The US Intelligence chief held several key meetings during her visit to India, including one with members of the Five Eyes security alliance. The meeting was hosted by Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, R&AW Chief Ravi Sinha, and Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief Tapan Deka.

She also had meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. ""This visit highlights the decades-strong US-India relationship that is bolstered by the leadership of and friendship between Prime Minister Modi and President Donald Trump,"" the US DNI statement said, adding that ""Gabbard's meetings in India focused on intelligence-sharing, defence, counter-terrorism, and transnational threats.""

Ms Gabbard also attended the annual global multilateral conference Raisina Dialogue in Delhi where she gave a keynote address on Donald Trump's vision. ""Securing peace through strength requires strong leadership with a clear-eyed and realistic understanding of global challenges and opportunities,"" she said.

Besides the statement issued by the US Intelligence department, the US State Department also backed her, saying that the United States reiterates its stance on the protection of minority communities in Bangladesh. The State department spokesperson however, also praised the efforts taken by Bangladesh in recent times.

""We condemn any instances of violence or intolerance directed toward members of minority communities in any country and have welcomed measures taken by Bangladesh's interim government to ensure safety and security for all in Bangladesh. That's what we're watching. That's what we expect. And that will be what continues,"" spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.

Tulsi Gabbard was on her first multi-nation visit as the Director of National Intelligence, visiting Hawaii, Japan, Thailand, India, and France.

An estimated 1,351 flights, including those operated by Air India, were cancelled or diverted Friday after London's Heathrow airport shut down for the day. This was after a fire at an electrical substation in the western part of the city triggered a widespread power outage.

There is no word yet on when power will be restored to the airport, authorities told the BBC.

Apart from chaos at Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world and largest of five serving London and nearby areas - more than 16,000 homes in the UK capital lost power.

As many as 120 flights were in the air over Heathrow, either having just taken off or about to land.

Among those due were the AI129 service from Mumbai and the AI161 from Delhi. The former will return and the latter has been diverted to Frankfurt in Germany, the Indian carrier said in a statement.

""All our remaining flights to and from London Heathrow, including AI111 (another Delhi-London service) have been cancelled for 21 March. We will update about resumption as soon as we have information.""

#ImportantUpdateDue to a significant power outage, London Heathrow Airport has been shut down until 23:59 on 21st March. All Air India flights to and from London Heathrow for 21st March have been cancelled.For more information or assistance, please call our Contact Centre at…

Flights to and from London's Gatwick, however, will be unaffected, and the airport, which is about 60km southeast of Heathrow, has said it will accept flights diverted from Heathrow.

Apart from Air India, numerous other airlines have announced cancellations and/or diversions, with Heathrow authorities also warning of ""significant disruptions over the coming days"".

British Airways, whose main hub is Heathrow, has advised passengers not to travel there till further notice. The airline told the BBC there will be ""a significant impact on our operation and our customers"".

The Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam said half of the day's 30 flights to and from Heathrow today had been cancelled. So far, one flight has been diverted to Schiphol, it said on X.

Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific Airways has also cancelled all its flights. It had six scheduled from Hong Kong to Heathrow for today. One service - CX257 - had already left and has been recalled.

Australia's flagship airline, Qantas, told the BBC it is ""closely monitoring the situation"". Two of its flights, the Perth to London service and from Singapore, have been diverted to De Gaulle in Paris, France.

US-based United Airlines has said its schedule has also been affected.

The fire that affected Heathrow and swathes of the UK capital was at a substation in Hayes in the city's Hillingdon borough. As many as 16,000 homes were left without electricity after the blaze, the Scottish and Southern Electricity Network, which supplies power to 3.8 million homes across the UK, said.

The London Fire Brigade deployed 10 fire engines and 70 firefighters to control the fire.

Visuals of the fire were shared online by Sputnik, Russia's state-owned news agency. It showed a blaze lighting up the night sky, with a massive plume of smoke rising into the air.

As of 11.34 am (India time) the blaze remains active, London fire officials said.

Here's What's Changing","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/oxford-ditches-800-year-old-latin-tradition-for-non-binary-students-heres-whats-changing-7974745","Fri, 21 Mar 2025 07:31:51 GMT","

Oxford University is all set to change its 800-year Latin ceremony to tailor it for the benefit of non-binary students. The university will be using gender-neutral language while conferring degrees to students to make it more inclusive. The Dons (university teachers) will vote on the proposal, deemed ""necessary"" to change the Latin ceremonial text on April 29, which will come into effect across all ceremonies from October, according to a report in The Telegraph.

""The changes involve stripping a Latin message of congratulations of words that are grammatically gendered masculine or feminine,"" the report highlighted, adding that a gazette had been issued to alert faculties about the planned changes.

Instead of referring to male students as ""Magistri' (master), the proposed text will use the term ""vos"" which is a neutral term for ""you"". The word ""doctores"" (doctors), which is also masculine, could be changed.

Additionally, for undergraduates, the word for ""who"", which has a masculine and feminine form, will be replaced with a neutral word.

""Similar changes have been proposed for the specific wording used in degree ceremonies for awards in arts, music, medicine, law, philosophy and other specialisms.""

Apart from the degree ceremonies, the gender-neutral language will also be used in other formal occasions. For example, in the ceremony for the admission of a new Vice-Chancellor, the retiring Vice-Chancellor will say a few words not about ""his/her"" tenure but about ""their"" time at the helm.

Dr Jonathan Katz, a Latin expert who serves as the university's public orator, has approved the linguistic changes.

""The proposed changes before Congregation create a single text for each ceremony, covering all options students now have for registering genders in line with legal reporting requirements for higher education,"" an Oxford University spokesperson said.

Ever since the Labour government came to power in the UK, the push for gender-neutral language has increased. Last month, the National Health Service (NHS) staffers in the UK were told to not call fat people ""obese, in a fresh guidance issued by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Three Indian nationals accused of drug trafficking aboard a Singapore-flagged vessel who have been detained in Indonesia since July 2024, face the death penalty, a media report said on Friday.

Raju Muthukumaran, 38, Selvadurai Dinakaran, 34, and Govindhasamy Vimalkandhan, 45, who have been working in the shipping industry in Singapore, were arrested for allegedly smuggling 106 kg of crystal meth aboard the Legend Aquarius cargo vessel.

All of them hail from Tamil Nadu.

Acting on a tip-off, Indonesian authorities intercepted the vessel in the Pongkar waters of Karimun district, about an hour from Singapore by ferry.

The trio faced a major setback on March 14 when the vessel captain, who was ordered to testify in person, failed to appear in court, reported Singapore's Friday weekly Tabla! In response to the testimony, the court summoned the captain to testify in person on March 14. However, he only appeared briefly via Zoom, preventing cross-examination by the defence.



The defence team insists that the captain's testimony is crucial to establishing their clients' innocence.

Prosecutors have demanded the death penalty, the maximum sentence under Indonesian law.

The trio are represented by Indian lawyer John Paul, managing partner of Indian law firm South Asia Lex Legal Services (SAL). According to a LinkedIn post, Paul is from Tamil Nadu.

The defence team, also led by an Indonesian firm Bambang Supriadi & Partners, argues that the charges are false.

Paul added: ""We are focused on presenting a robust defence and highlighting the inconsistencies in the prosecution's case."" To strengthen their argument, the defence presented retired Indonesian Navy officer and international maritime law expert Soleman B. Ponto as a mitigating witness, according to the Tabla!.

On February 25, Soleman testified that under Indonesian law the ship's captain holds sole responsibility for all cargo on board.

The defence contends that it is highly unlikely for such a large quantity of drugs to be smuggled without the captain's knowledge.

""We firmly believe that the actual perpetrators have been set free,"" said defence lawyer Yan Apridho.

""The case is under trial and crucial defence evidence, along with expert witness testimonies, is being presented to establish the innocence of the three detained Indian nationals,"" said Yan. ""The absence of the captain's evidence has raised questions about the prosecution's case."" The trial is ongoing, and a verdict is expected on April 15.

At a press conference in Batam on July 17, 2024, Indonesian National Narcotic Agency chief Marthinus Hukom alleged that the three were the drug owners and had commissioned the trip.

Lamborghini and Mercedes-Maybach plan to expand in India as a growing tribe of young, rich Indians splurge on super luxury cars, driving their sales to record levels.

Italian supercar maker Lamborghini, fresh from a year of record sales, is exploring a fourth showroom in India, while Mercedes-Maybach sees the country as a potential top-five market by sales, company executives said.

""India, for us, is an asset ... there is a huge potential for the future. There is the idea of having maybe a fourth dealership but this is still something in the early stages,"" Lamborghini's Stephan Winkelmann told reporters at a virtual roundtable.

The optimism is driven by ""a change in generation"" in the country with ""momentum from younger customers"", he said, adding that the average age of a Lamborghini buyer in India is below 40 years - making it the youngest market after China.

""You have a lot of startups in India which are very successful. You have very young, high net worth individuals which are stepping into this type of car. So this is positive for us,"" he said.

Rapid economic growth in India has wrought a fundamental shift in attitude towards luxury purchases among its younger generations that differs from their elders, who were more concerned with saving.

Executives at startups cashing out after record public listings and younger generations of a family business spending with less guilt are driving up sales of all things luxury - cars, watches, bags and even homes.

But luxury car sales in India make up just over 1% of the 4 million vehicles-a-year market, and super luxury cars are an even smaller percentage.

Lamborghini had its best year in India in 2024, selling 113 cars, up 10% on 2023. Winkelmann expects growth again this year, on the back of a strong order book lasting 18 months.

Its Urus SUV, which has a starting price tag of close to $500,000 before taxes, made up half its sales, with the rest coming from the Huracan and Revuelto sports cars.

Mercedes-Maybach achieved 145% growth in India in 2024, selling 500 of its super luxury cars priced upwards of $325,000 in a market where the average car costs about $15,000.

Daniel Lescow, head of Mercedes-Maybach, said India was already in its top 10 markets and had the potential to be in the top five, but the speed of growth would depend on how the luxury market develops.

""I'm convinced there's so much more potential ... so many opportunities here,"" Lescow told Reuters.

More than 11 years after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, the Malaysian government has approved a new search for the missing debris of the aircraft.

Malaysia announced the push for a renewed search last year, ten years after the tragedy that claimed the lives of 239 people.

Seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity, which conducted an unsuccessful search in 2018, prepared a new proposal to which Malaysia's government agreed in principle in December last year.

Now, the company has returned to the southern Indian Ocean 1,500 kilometres west of Perth - with a suite of new high-tech tools.

Ocean Infinity is involved in projects surveying for offshore oil and gas reserves, and for suitable locations for offshore renewable energy projects.

But it has also proved it is capable of locating underwater wreckage in the past. For example, in 2018, the company found a missing Argentinian navy submarine nearly 1,000 metres underwater in the Atlantic Ocean. And last October, it found the wreck of a US Navy ship that had been underwater for 78 years.

The new search area for MH370 is roughly the size of metropolitan Sydney. It was identified in collaboration with experts based on refined analysis of information received after the aircraft disappeared. This information included weather, satellite data and the location of debris attributed to the aircraft which washed up along the coast of Africa and islands in the Indian Ocean.

For this search, Ocean Infinity will be using a new 78 metre offshore support vessel, the Armada 7806. It was built by Norwegian shipbuilder Vard in 2023.

The Armada 7806 is equipped with a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles manufactured by the Norwegian firm Kongsberg.

These 6.2m long vehicles are capable of operating independently of the support vessel at depths of up to 6,000m for up to 100 hours at a time. They are equipped with advanced sonar technology, including sidescan, synthetic aperture, multibeam and sub-bottom profiling sonar.

Sonar systems are essential for underwater mapping and object detection surveys. They use acoustic pulses to look for echoes from the seafloor.

Sidescan sonar captures high-resolution images of the seafloor by sending out pulses of sound and detecting objects that reflect the sound pulses back.

Synthetic aperture sonar is a technique for combining the results from multiple ""pings"" to effectively make the scanner bigger and more powerful, seeing further, and producing more detailed images.

Multibeam sonar, in contrast, maps the seafloor topography by emitting multiple sonar beams in a fan-shaped pattern below the platform.

Finally, sub-bottom profiling sonar operates at lower frequencies and penetrates the seabed to reveal underlying geological structures. This is useful for archaeological studies, sediment analysis and identifying buried objects.

Together, these sonar technologies provide complementary data for underwater exploration, search and recovery, and geological assessments.

Camera systems and lights on the vehicles may be used to confirm potential targets. Once a target of interest is detected using sonar, the vehicles would be programmed with missions designed to operate significantly closer to the seafloor. This would allow them to capture imagery of the search area with which to identify the targets.

Such a search would only be conducted once a target of interest is identified, as the area covered by each image is significantly smaller than that covered by sonar, therefore requiring much denser survey tracks.

Since its previous search in 2018, Ocean Infinity has made significant advancements in its marine robotics and data analytics capabilities. It has demonstrated its capacity to simultaneously deploy multiple vehicles at depths of up to 6,000m.

This significantly increases the coverage area, as each vehicle covers its own patch of seafloor. This will allow for a more efficient and comprehensive survey of the designated search zone.

The data being collected by the vehicles will be downloaded once the vehicles are brought back onboard, and stitched together to provide detailed maps of the search areas.

Conditions in the search region are expected to be difficult. Weather on the surface will likely provide challenges for the support vessel and the crew. Underwater vehicles will have to contend with complex conditions on the seafloor, including steep slopes and rough terrain.

The operation is expected to take up to 18 months. Weather conditions are most likely to be favourable between January and April.

If Ocean Infinity succeeds in finding the wreckage of MH370, the Malaysian government will pay it US$70 million.

The next steps would be trying to retrieve the plane's black boxes, which would enable investigators to piece together what happened in the final moments before the plane plunged into the ocean. The Armada 7806 is likely to have remotely operated vehicles onboard equipped with cameras and manipulator systems, which may be used to verify the wreck site and in any future salvage operations.

If Ocean Infinity fails, it will receive no payment. And the investigation into the location of the plane will essentially be back to square one.

Pirate's Booty Snacks founder Robert Ehrlich claimed to be tiny Long Island community's mayor – voters disagreed

The popcorn mogul who founded Pirate's Booty Snacks tried to commandeer a New York village's local government, storming this minuscule municipality's office armed with a false statement claiming that he was mayor.

Robert Ehrlich strode into the town hall of Sea Cliff, a village of fewer than 5,000 residents within the larger town of Oyster Bay on Long Island, with all the finesse of a literal pirate on 10 March.

He “presented a statement falsely asserting his authority as mayor, demanding access to office space, and declaring that the entire village staff was fired effective immediately but could reapply for their jobs”, authorities said on Facebook.

Ehrlich, 66, cited a New York state law that permits local residents “to dissolve their town or reformulate it”, the New York Times explained. Under this legislation, one needs signatures from 10% of town voters.

Ehrlich brandished an envelope claiming that he had 1,800 signatures – but reportedly refused to show it to town workers, alleging that signatories were worried about blowback.

After his failed takeover, Ehrlich entered Sea Village's mayoral race as a write-in candidate. On Tuesday, Ehrlich lost heavily to the incumbent, Elena Villafane, in a 1,064-to-62 vote, according to reports.

Ehrlich's mutinous moves are reminiscent of the campaign by Donald Trump's key aide Elon Musk to slash federal spending as head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, an ad-hoc body created by the US president upon returning to the White House two months ago. Doge staffers have repeatedly arrived at federal agency offices demanding access to premises and computer data, while firing or putting on notice hundreds of thousands of public service employees. Many of his moves have been successfully challenged in court.

After village employees told Ehrlich that his proclamation was “invalid and unsupported by law”, they asked him to leave. But Ehrlich and his associates turned “increasingly confrontational and refused” the village said in a Facebook post.

The pushback left Ehrlich's timbers un-shivered. Although city staff kept calm, Ehrlich and his crew “raised their voices, used profane language, made outlandish claims, and engaged in direct harassment of Village personnel”, the post added – and would not raise anchor.

This created “a hostile and disruptive environment that required police intervention”. Village workers suffered “nearly an hour of escalating hostility before Mr Ehrlich and his associates left and order was restored”.

Village leaders thanked office staff for remaining cool-headed and respectful despite “being subjected to intense and outlandish behavior”.

“They are a credit to our Village and demonstrate the motto of ‘Keep Calm and Carry On,'” the Facebook post said.

After his loss, Ehrlich reportedly insisted “I'm still the mayor” and, like Trump since his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, claimed the village election “was rigged”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Progressive political stars say president and billionaire Elon Musk are turning US into oligarchy at rally in Arizona

Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivered a scathing rebuke of Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk at a huge rally in Arizona on Thursday, accusing them of “screwing over” working- and middle-class Americans as they turn the country into an oligarchy.

Speaking to an overflowing arena as part of his Stop Oligarchy tour – a series of events with the progressive New York congresswoman that has attracted huge attention among Democratic supporters disillusioned with what they feel is the party's otherwise tepid reaction to Trump's radical agenda – Sanders, the senator from Vermont, warned the president:

“We will not allow you to move this country into an oligarchy. We're not going to allow you and your friend Mr Musk and the other billionaires to wreak havoc on this country.”

Ocasio-Cortez put it differently: “We're going to throw these bums out and fight for the nation we deserve.”

Sanders, who is independent but votes with Democrats, trained some of his sharpest attacks on industry titans.

“You know who the biggest criminals are in this country? They are the CEOs of major corporations who are robbing us every single day,” he said.

“They are the fossil fuel industry that has lied to us for years about what they're doing to the planet. It is the drug companies who charge us the highest prices in the world and people die because they can't afford those drugs. It's the insurance companies who deny claim after claim. Those are major criminals.”

The rally was the pair's second of the day, following an earlier event in Las Vegas, as the progressive political stars continue on what has become a particularly high-profile tour that also features events on Friday in Colorado – including a town hall in Denver featuring Alvaro Bedoya, an FTC Commissioner who was abruptly fired by Trump this week. On Saturday, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will return to Arizona for a rally in Tucson.

During the event in Arizona on Thursday night the pair also offered a sharp critique of the Democratic party.

“This isn't just about Republicans, either. We need a Democratic party that fights harder for us, too,” Ocasio-Cortez said, drawing some of the loudest, most sustained applause of the event.

Several rallygoers said they would like to see Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat of New York, challenge the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, in a primary race after he relented and helped Republicans pass a funding bill last week to avert a shutdown.

Ocasio-Cortez made no explicit mention of Schumer or her future political ambitions, despite intermittent shouts of “Primary Chuck”.

She called on attenders to help elect candidates “with the courage to brawl for the working class” and praised Arizona voters for electing two Democratic senators. She then swiped the state's former one-term senator, Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic party while in office to become an independent, and then declined to seek re-election.
 “One thing I love about Arizonans is that you all have shown that if a US senator isn't fighting hard enough for you, you're not afraid to replace her with one who will,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
 Sinema recently resurfaced old comments by Ocasio-Cortez attacking the then-senator over her refusal to abolish the filibuster, a Senate rule requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation. Last week, House Democrats implored their Senate counterparts to use the filibuster to block a Republican-drafted funding bill.
 “Change of heart on the filibuster I see!” Sinema posted on social media.
 “Still no. In fact, the same Dems who argue to keep the filibuster ‘for when we need it' do not, in fact, use it when we need it,” Ocasio-Cortez shot back.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Executive order denounced as unconstitutional. Plus, Musk's daughter says his gesture ‘definitely Nazi salute'

Good morning.

Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that instructs the US education secretary, Linda McMahon, to start dismantling the Department of Education, seemingly attempting to circumvent Congress's approval to formally close a federal department.

The progressive wing of the House Democratic caucus denounced Trump's order as an unconstitutional attempt to evade seeking congressional approval in order to implement his political agenda.

The bulk of the education department's budget is made up of federal grant and loan programs, including the $18.4bn Title I program that provides funding to low-income K-12 schools and the $15.5bn Idea program that helps cover the education costs for students with disabilities.

The White House said those programs, as well as federal student loan payments, would not be affected by the order. It was not immediately clear what spending cuts the administration would be able to achieve without cutting those initiatives.

How has the department already been affected by Trump's state-shrinking efforts? The move comes after steps to undercut the department's authority by instituting a round of layoffs that has nearly halved its workforce and cancelled dozens of grants and contracts.

At least 91 people were killed yesterday and many more injured in a third day of Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to medical officials in the Palestinian territory who said a high proportion of the dead were women and children.

The timing of the strikes appears to have increased the proportion of women and children among the victims, with many sleeping when the missiles struck overnight or very early in the morning. Among those pulled alive from rubble on Thursday was a month-old girl, whose parents and brother were killed.

A first wave of airstrikes on Tuesday shattered a two-month pause in hostilities and killed more than 400 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza, in one of the bloodiest days of the 18-month conflict. The dead included 183 children and 94 women, Palestinian officials said.

Meanwhile, what's happening in Israel? Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets to call for a new ceasefire in Gaza and to protest against what they say is an attack on the country's democracy by the rightwing governing coalition of Benjamin Netanyahu.

Vivian Jenna Wilson, Elon Musk's eldest child, has spoken out publicly about her father, saying he “definitely [did] a Nazi salute” in January and he was part of a White House that was “cartoonishly evil”.

Speaking to Teen Vogue, Wilson, 20, said what her father was doing in the federal government was “fucking cringe”.

“The Nazi salute shit was insane. Honey, we're going to call a fig a fig, and we're going to call a Nazi salute what it was,” Wilson said. “That shit was definitely a Nazi salute.”

Meanwhile, Musk's company X has sued India's government over a content removal law the social media platform describes as censorship.

What else did Wilson say? She spoke out against attacks on the transgender community by her father and Trump, for instance the executive orders banning trans people from the military and from participating in women's sports. “As a trans woman, I am terrified of losing access to guaranteed medical care,” Wilson said.

A clinic in New Mexico cast doubt on when Betsy Arakawa died, claiming the classical pianist rang them on 12 February – the day after police say she died.

The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, warned the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, he would face “severe consequences” if he breached a Ukraine peace deal.

A district judge barred the Trump administration from deporting an Indian academic from Georgetown University, after the academic was accused of ties to Hamas.

Sudan's army has recaptured the presidential palace in the capital, Khartoum, in a highly symbolic battlefield victory over the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in the Sudanese civil war.

Retreating glaciers threaten the food and water supply of 2 billion people around the world, a Unesco report has warned, amid “unprecedented” rates of melting. Two-thirds of all irrigated agriculture in the world is likely to be affected, driven by the climate crisis.

The Trump administration claims tattoos prove membership of the Tren de Aragua gang, and has seemingly used the so-called evidence to deport scores of Venezuelans to El Salvador. But relatives describe the tattoos as tributes to God, family and the soccer club Real Madrid.

Researchers analysed the lungs of birds from 51 species, in China, and found microplastics in every bird. “The result that surprised me the most was the widespread contamination in all species that we sampled, regardless of body size, habitat preference and feeding habits,” said Shane DuBay, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, who was part of the research team.

Apple TV+ is losing $1bn annually, according to the news site the Information. The second most-watched show on the service is currently Ted Lasso, a dormant sitcom that has not put out a new episode in almost two years. But if Apple starts making hits – properly marketed shows that people actually want to watch – all this could change in a heartbeat, writes Stuart Heritage. “After all, how hard could it be to find the next Severance?”

Defense secretary says Musk was at Pentagon to talk about efficiencies; president says new F-47 jet has state-of-the-art stealth technology

Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that Elon Musk was not shown the Pentagon's plan for a potential war with China during the Tesla CEO's visit earlier today.

“Elon Musk is a patriot. Elon Musk is an innovator. Elon Musk provides a lot of capabilities our government and our military rely on, and I'm grateful for that,” said Hegseth, who added that reports Musk would be shown the plan were meant to “undermine whatever relationship the Pentagon has with” him.

“We welcomed him today to the Pentagon to talk about [the department of government efficiency], to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations. It was a great informal conversation. The rest of that reporting was fake. There was no war plans. There was no Chinese war plans. There was no secret plans. That's not what we were doing the Pentagon.”

Meanwhile, a top Venezuelan government minister denied that any of the more than 200 migrants the Trump administration deported to El Salvador last weekend weekend were members of the gang Tren de Aragua, Reuters reports.

Donald Trump and the justice department have insisted the migrants were members of the group, and therefore eligible for swift deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. From Reuters, here's what Venezuela's government thinks of that:

Venezuelan's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said on Friday that no one among the hundreds of deportees to a Salvadoran prison, whom Washington accused of being members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, were related to the criminal organization.

Cabello cited a list of names disclosed in U.S. and from one of his own sources, speaking in a podcast shared on his Telegram channel.

U.S. President Donald Trump had on Saturday invoked an obscure wartime law to rapidly deport people who were, according to the White House, members of the Venezuelan gang which Washington has declared a terrorist group and alien enemy.

Despite a judge quickly blocking the measure, Trump's administration deported 137 Venezuelans to El Salvador where they were detained in the country's massive anti-terrorism prison, for a period of a year subject to renewal.

Meanwhile, families and lawyers have been seeking answers about relatives and clients whom they could no longer reach, and demanding their return to Venezuela.

“I believe with absolute responsibility that not a single one (of the names on the list) appears on the organizational chart of the now-extinct Tren de Aragua organization, not a single one,” Cabello said.

Venezuela says Tren de Aragua was effectively wiped out after a series of raids in 2023, and that the idea that it still exists is based on a claim from the country's political opposition.

“It is a lie, a massive lie, and we have the means to prove it,” he added. “Now if the United States refuses to recognize this reality, that's their prerogative.”

Donald Trump has talked up the new tariffs he has promised to impose on countries worldwide on 2 April, so much so that he's taking to calling the date “Liberation Day”.

On that date, the president has ordered the United States to impose “reciprocal” tariffs on trading partners around the world, which will be equal to whatever levies they place on US goods. Exemptions from 25% tariffs that he has given Canada and Mexico will also end on that day.

It will likely amount to a a major reordering of the United State's relations with its trading partners, and have major implications for the US economy. Yet for all his talk of tariffs, Trump has indicated that he may change his mind.

The latest came just now in the Oval Office, where he said there will be “flexibility” with the new tariffs.

“People are coming to me and talking about tariffs, and a lot of people are asking me if they could have exceptions. And once you do that for one, you have to do that for all,” Trump said.

“The word flexibility is an important word. Sometimes there's flexibility, so there'll be flexibility.”

Trump has moved on, and is now, once again, talking about making Canada the 51st state.

But a reporter wanted to know if he was worried that Canada would be a blue state, if it was somehow admitted to the union. The president demurred:

I don't know about that. I think Canada is a place, like a lot of other places, if you have a good candidate, the candidate's gonna win.

Donald Trump, who is continuing to take questions in the Oval Office with Pete Hegseth by his side, said he would not have allowed the military's plan for a potential war with China to be shared with Elon Musk or anyone like him.

“I don't want other people seeing, anybody seeing potential war with China. We don't want to have a potential war with China, but I can tell you, if we did, we're very well equipped to handle it,” Trump said.

The possibility that Musk could see the plan raised alarms, as he has business interests in China. Trump said he was aware of that:

You know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that, but it was such a fake story.

Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that Elon Musk was not shown the Pentagon's plan for a potential war with China during the Tesla CEO's visit earlier today.

“Elon Musk is a patriot. Elon Musk is an innovator. Elon Musk provides a lot of capabilities our government and our military rely on, and I'm grateful for that,” said Hegseth, who added that reports Musk would be shown the plan were meant to “undermine whatever relationship the Pentagon has with” him.

“We welcomed him today to the Pentagon to talk about [the department of government efficiency], to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations. It was a great informal conversation. The rest of that reporting was fake. There was no war plans. There was no Chinese war plans. There was no secret plans. That's not what we were doing the Pentagon.”

The Trump administration carried out the high-profile deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members over the weekend, which may have violated a judge's order.

The deportees were sent to El Salvador, but since they arrived, their family members have offered evidence that they were not members of Tren de Aragua, the gang whose members Trump has targeted for rapid deportation under the Alien Enemies Act.

Asked about the possibility some of the deportees were not gang members, Trump said:

I was told that they went through a very strong vetting process, and that will also be continuing in El Salvador, and if there's anything like that, we would certainly want to find out. But … these were a bad group. This was a bad group, and they were in bad areas, and they were with a lot of other people that were absolutely killers, murderers, and people that were really bad, with the worst records you've ever seen.

Much of the Trump administration's case against the deportees seems to center on their tattoos:

Donald Trump is now taking questions from reporters in the room, and the first was a blunt ask for the president to “tell us who killed Kennedy”.

Earlier in the week, Trump released 80,000 pages of government documents related to the assassination of John F Kennedy. Trump did not answer the question of who killed Kennedy, instead saying of the documents: “I don't think there's anything that's earth shattering, but you'll have to make that determination.”

He also weighed in on why he allowed social security numbers and other identifying details to be revealed in the Kennedy documents, saying “I didn't want anything deleted.”

Trump added that he would release government documents concerning the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

Donald Trump is delivering his speech from the Oval Office, seated at his desk next to what appears to be an image of the F-47 fighter jet.

It's a little hard to make it out, though.

Donald Trump has now shifted to defense, unveiling the F-47 fighter jet program, which he promises will deliver a “state of the art” stealth jet.

“The F-47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built. An experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost five years, and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation,” Trump said.

“The F-47 is equipped with state-of-the-art stealth technology. It's virtually unseeable and unprecedented power, the most power of any jet of its kind ever made.”

Its designation may be an homage to Trump, who is the 47th president.

Donald Trump is speaking now in the Oval Office with defense secretary Pete Hegseth by his side, but began by elaborating on how he will implement his executive order yesterday ordering the dismantling of the Department of Education.

“I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio,” Trump said.

“We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans, tens of thousands of loans, pretty complicated deal, and that's coming out of the Department of Education immediately.”

He added that the Department of Health and Human Services “will be handling special needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else.”

Donald Trump spent much of this week touting his efforts to secure a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine. But as the Guardian's Andrew Roth reports, what Trump says and what his negotiating partners understand are often two different things:

Donald Trump's shuttle diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine has at times resembled a game of broken telephone, and the US president's disregard for the details suggests the ceasefire he seeks is further off than his bullish statements may suggest.

Consider the events of just the last week. After his call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Trump said that the two men had agreed to a partial ceasefire on “energy and infrastructure” targets, indicating that Russia would not target bridges, hospitals, railways or other civilian structures.

Hours later, a Russian drone slammed into a Ukrainian hospital. Russia's readout of the call said that it had agreed to a halt on strikes on “energy infrastructure”, suggesting that everything else was fair game.

By Wednesday, the White House press secretary was dodging the question of what was discussed, pointing reporters to the administration's readout without clarifying if Trump had misunderstood their discussion.

That day, Trump surprised the world by announcing that the US was proposing an American-led privatisation of Ukrainian power plants in order to provide a new security guarantee to the Ukrainians. Trump ordered his national security adviser Mike Waltz and secretary of state Marco Rubio to provide an “accurate” readout of the call (in itself a curious distinction). In it, they said Trump had told Zelenskyy that “American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure.”

Not so fast, said Zelenskyy on Thursday. The power plants are national property and “belong to all Ukrainians”. A takeover bid had never come up.

Reporters at the Pentagon have spotted Elon Musk leaving, after what the New York Times reports was an 80-minute meeting with defense secretary Pete Hegseth.

It is unclear if Musk, who leads Donald Trump's department of government efficiency initiative and has business interests in China, was briefed on the military's plan for a potential war with Beijing. But the Times reports that Musk's meeting with Hegseth did not take place in a secure Pentagon conference room where it was originally scheduled to take place.

Donald Trump and defense secretary Pete Hegseth are scheduled to at 11am deliver a joint address from the Oval Office, but the White House did not say what it will concern. The Wall Street Journal seems to have uncovered the answer: they will announce a new fighter jet program.

The new jet will be the most expensive in history, and operate alongside drones, according to the Journal, which adds the plane is geared towards fending off China's air force in the event of a war.

Here's more, from the Journal:

The piloted planes are to be fielded in the 2030s and would fight alongside semiautonomous drones, as the Pentagon seeks to gain a technological edge over U.S. adversaries.

The future of the program had been in doubt after the Biden administration opted to leave the final decision on how to proceed to the incoming Trump administration. Elon Musk, the billionaire and Trump ally, has publicly campaigned against manned aircraft, which he said were “obsolete in the age of drones.”

Musk arrived at the Pentagon Friday morning for sensitive discussions about China.

Air Force officials have argued that piloted planes are still vital for fighting the wars of the future, especially if they incorporate cutting-edge designs, sophisticated sensors, more powerful engines and control the semiautonomous drones that operate with them.

…

Fielding the plane will be expensive, as the new fighters could cost as much as several hundred million dollars each. The Air Force's current Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters cost about $80 million.

The F-35, which has been a Musk target, is a multi-role plane that is designed mainly for air-to-ground combat. The new fighter has been described as an air-to-air fighter that would replace the F-22 and would be able to fly in heavily defended environments.

Donald Trump is so excited about the reciprocal tariffs he plans to impose on 2 April that he has taken to calling it “Liberation Day”.

As he did in a Truth Social post this morning:

April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!! For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!

But a recent poll conducted for the Guardian shows that Americans are generally freaked out by the prospect of the United States imposing tariffs on countries worldwide, including a hefty share of Republicans:

Donald Trump is partaking in some royal intrigue with a social media post declaring his love for Britain's King Charles and saying he would welcome a reported “secret offer” billed as easing tensions with Canada.

On Truth Social, the president linked to a story in UK tabloid the Sun, which says:

KING Charles will reportedly make a “secret offer” to Donald Trump during his State visit.

The Royal proposal is said to potentially reduce tensions between the White House and Canada.

Plans are allegedly in the works to make the USA the next “associate member” of the Commonwealth.

The international association, which currently boasts 56 states, could welcome the US as a new member.

In February, a Tariff war began between the two countries with Trump signing orders to impose near-universal tariffs on goods from Canada entering the United States.

The US President revealed Canada could avoid higher taxes if it joined the United States of America as its 51 state.

Canada, of which the King is head of state, is part of the Commonwealth of Nations and including America may dampen the current conflict.

To which Trump responded:

I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!

But trade tensions with Canada are likely to grow worse on 2 April, when an exemption from 25% tariffs he imposed on the country expires.

Journalists at the Pentagon have spotted Elon Musk arriving for a visit where he will reportedly be briefed on the military's plan for a potential war with China.

Donald Trump and defense secretary Pete Hegseth have both denied the reports that details of the military's strategy against China will be shared with Musk.

The US government appears to have complied with a federal judge's request for a high-level official to confirm that it is considering invoking a nation security exemption to avoid sharing details of migrant deportation flights that may have violated a court order.

Justice department attorneys have been in a legal standoff with James Boasberg, a federal judge who over the weekend told the Trump administration not to allow three planes carrying suspected Venezuelan gang members to fly to El Salvador. The planes arrived anyway, and Boasberg has since been demanding details of the aircrafts' itineraries to determine if his order was violated.

The justice department has said the Trump administration may determine the information is a “state secret” that it cannot reveal to the judge. Yesterday, Boasberg demanded that the administration have “a person with direct involvement in the Cabinet-level discussions” submit a declaration. That declaration has now arrived, from Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general, who confirmed his “direct involvement in ongoing Cabinet-level discussions regarding invocation of the state-secrets privilege.”

The government now has until next Tuesday to decide whether to invoke the privilege. Here's more on the back-and-forth between the judge and the Trump administration:","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Three members of the pioneering band were detained and returned to the UK after flying to Los Angeles for a gig

Members of the punk rock band UK Subs have said they were denied entry and detained in the US, according to accounts from the band themselves.

Bassist Alvin Gibbs shared details of the incident in a Facebook post on Wednesday, which comes amid widespread reports of people being denied entry to the US, including a French scientist who said he was barred because of anti-Donald Trump comments he had made.

Gibbs, along with bandmates Marc Carrey and Stefan Häublein, were deported back to the UK following their detainment. Only vocalist Charlie Harper had been allowed entry. Harper ended up playing the band's scheduled show in Los Angeles with a group of stand-in musicians.

He recounted how after he landed at the LA airport with his partner, he was told he would be questioned after being flagged. He was informed the flagging was for two reasons: first, he was told he had an incorrect visa, but he was also told that there was another reason that the agents would not disclose to him.

“I can't help but wonder whether my frequent, and less than flattering, public comments regarding their president and his administration played a role – or perhaps I'm simply succumbing to paranoia,” he said.

The band, considered pioneers in the genre of British punk rock, have been outspokenly critical of Trump and his policies in the past. They are known to often make political statements during live performances.

“What followed was far from pleasant,” Gibbs said. “Two police officers escorted me to another section of LAX, where I found Stefan and Marc already detained in a cold holding pen, along with a group of Colombian, Chinese, and Mexican detainees. My luggage, phone, and passport were confiscated.”

He explained how he was eventually called for a second interview at 4am, hours after he had initially landed at 7pm.

Gibbs says his partner waited 25 hours for him to finally be released from the detention. “By the time we were escorted on to the flight at 8pm the next day, I had gone without sleep for well over a day, surviving only on a pot noodle and a couple of cups of tea.”

Though he expressed relief that Harper had been able to enter the country and perform the scheduled show, Gibbs is not keen on trying to come back to the US again. “It seems my relationship with the country is over for the foreseeable future,” he said.

The experiences of the UK Subs members are the latest in a long line of people who have experienced long hours of detainment and deportation upon entering the US, with the incidents frequently credited to vague or unspecified visa issues.

In a similar situation to UK Subs, a French researcher was denied entry to the US earlier this month after immigration officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticisms of the Trump administration.

In response to the news Philippe Baptiste, France's minister of higher education and research, said: “This measure was apparently taken by the American authorities because the researcher's phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration's research policy.”

 This article was amended on 21 March 2025 to correct the spelling of Alvin Gibbs's name.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Authorities' heavily armed ‘perp walk' of alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter may have aided in raising more than $700,000

The organizer of an online campaign that has raised more than $700,000 for Luigi Mangione's legal defense in connection with the fatal shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, believes the accused killer's infamous, post-arrest “perp walk” may have “backfired” on New York authorities and spurred some of his financial support.

In remarks on an upcoming podcast exploring Mangione's case, Sam Beard says the campaign eclipsed its goal by more than double after the public saw authorities “treating him like Hannibal Lecter”, referring to the fictional serial killer antagonist in the film The Silence of the Lambs.

“To just demonstrate the sheer power of this state and … to really just show how captured and how small this person is … a lot of us feel like that maybe backfired,” Beard says on Luigi, a four-episode Law & Crime podcast set to premiere on Monday – and an excerpt of which was shared with the Guardian.

Beard's comments are some of the most extensive yet about his work on the Luigi Mangione Official Defense Fund, which had raised about $748,000 as of Friday morning on the GiveSendGo platform.

As the podcast notes, critics of the campaign say it dangerously glorifies vigilante violence and disrespects the family of Thompson, whose killing on 4 December 2024 was seen by many as an extreme, illicit protest of both the US's rapacious private health insurance industry and the wealthy executives who profit off routine coverage denials.

Yet Beard and those who have supported the Mangione fund launched by his December 4th Legal Committee counter that everyone deserves a fair trial, including him. And, as a high-profile defendant, Mangione is grappling with a disproportionately intense prosecution, they maintain.

A clear instance of that, Beard says on the Law & Crime podcast, was when Mangione was extradited to New York from where he had been arrested in Pennsylvania. Beard alluded to the way dozens of New York police officers – including ones equipped with body armor and long guns – greeted a shackled Mangione at the helicopter in which he arrived and then escorted him to a waiting vehicle.

The group surrounding Mangione – clad in an orange prisoner's jumpsuit – was joined by the New York mayor, Eric Adams, as television news cameras recorded the dramatic scene, unfolding about 15 days after the Thompson shooting.

“We just saw how spectacular they really made that moment,” Beard remarks on the podcast.

Yet the show of strength did not isolate Mangione, who is facing state and federal charges of murder as well as terrorism – allegations which could mean the death penalty for him if he is convicted.

By late January, about 11,000 donors contributing roughly $30 each had helped the Mangione defense fund eclipse its initial goal of $300,000. That amount then more than doubled, prompting Beard's group to increase the campaign's goal to $1m.

In February, Mangione's attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, announced that her client – who has pleaded not guilty in the case – would accept the money raised for his legal defense.

“I know [that was] extremely meaningful to the well over 12,000 donors,” Beard says on the podcast. “I'm really grateful for the opportunity to help.”

Authorities allege that Mangione, 26, shot Thompson, 50, to death in plain view of a surveillance camera as he walked to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. A five-day manhunt led to Mangione's arrest in a Pennsylvania McDonald's.

Investigators say he had a gun that matched the one used to kill Thompson, fake identification that Mangione allegedly used to check into a New York City hostel before the deadly shooting, and a notebook expressing disdain for US healthcare companies' practices.

According to the insurer, Mangione was never a client of UnitedHealthcare. But he had cut himself off from friends and relatives in the months before his arrest, posting frequently in online forums about struggling with back pain – details which are examined on the Luigi podcast.

A poll published in late December by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago concluded that most people in the US believe the health insurance's frequent denials of coverage shared some responsibility for the death of Thompson, whose survivors include his widow and two teenage sons.

But the survey found most people in the US believed Thompson's killer had either “a great deal” or “a moderate amount” of responsibility for his death.

“It's horrible when anybody has their life cut short by another person, especially when it could have been prevented,” Beard says on Mangione. “But the same logic has to apply both ways, right?

“Preventing people from getting the healthcare that they need – that you and your company have access to and could provide them, but don't do so because it would threaten your business model – that's an act of violence too,” Beard says.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

The discrepancies between how the US and others are interpreting  Trump's calls are adding up 

Donald Trump's shuttle diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine has at times resembled a game of broken telephone, and the US president's disregard for the details suggests the ceasefire he seeks is further off than his bullish statements may suggest.

Consider the events of just the last week. After his call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Trump said that the two men had agreed to a partial ceasefire on “energy and infrastructure” targets, indicating that Russia would not target bridges, hospitals, railways or other civilian structures.

Hours later, a Russian drone slammed into a Ukrainian hospital. Russia's readout of the call said that it had agreed to a halt on strikes on “energy infrastructure”, suggesting that everything else was fair game.

In it, they said Trump had told Zelenskyy that “American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure.”

Not so fast, said Zelenskyy on Thursday. The power plants are national property and “belong to all Ukrainians”. A takeover bid had never come up.

“If the Americans want to take the station from the Russians and they want to invest there and modernise it, that is a completely different issue,” he said. “In terms of ownership [of the nuclear power plants], we definitely did not discuss this with President Trump.”

The discrepancies are adding up and Ukraine is looking to protect itself from a potentially catastrophic misunderstanding. On Thursday, Zelenskyy also announced that he would send a team of negotiators to Riyadh in order to supply US negotiators with a list of energy infrastructure that it wanted to be included in a partial ceasefire.

“I don't want there to be a different understanding of what the parties will agree on,” Zelensky said.

Trump has a habit of describing complex and sometimes compromising conversations in exultant, hyperbolic terms. He famously described one 2019 phone call with Zelenskyy as “perfect”. During it, he suggested that Ukraine launch an investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter in exchange for future military support.

Trump's recent phone calls, particularly with Putin, have been held in a similar black box. After they spoke this week, the Kremlin said it had demanded a cessation of foreign military aid with Ukraine as part of any long-term peace. That was never discussed, Trump claimed.

“We didn't talk about aid, actually, we didn't talk about aid at all,” Trump said. “We talked about a lot of things, but aid was never discussed.”

The US president has sought to control the information that comes out of his private discussions with foreign leaders. And in his recent discussions, particularly with Putin, the White House has not made clear which advisers were present on the calls.

Only Steve Witkoff, a real-estate mogul and friend of Trump's, has spoken directly about the call, saying it was “epic, transformational” and he was “proud to be an American sitting there listening to it”.

Next week's exercise in shuttle diplomacy in Riyadh may prove a moment when Trump can no longer paper over the cracks. “There are going to be proximity discussions meaning one group's going to be in this room, one group in this room and they'll sit and talk go back and forth sort of like shuttle diplomacy in a hotel,” said General Keith Kellogg, the Trump envoy to Ukraine. “And that's how it's going to work and then we'll find out where everybody stands.”

There is a degree of gullibility to the US approach as their business-facing dealmakers begin to encounter veteran Russian diplomats. When Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov met with US negotiators in Riyadh, they brought decades of experience and pointed to draft agreements to help shape the discussions. The US negotiators appeared outflanked.

Witkoff has said he believes that Putin is “acting in good faith” and that after the Trump-Putin phone call to prevent attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, the Russian military had shot down seven of their own drones. Some members of Russia's ultrapatriotic right have ridiculed him in subsequent days as gullible.

“The west believed that nonsense and that's great,” said Mikhail Zvinchuk, a popular Russian military blogger and propagandist, during an online stream. “Mr Witkoff said he was impressed by Russia's commitment to peace.”

Putin's negotiating team in Riyadh is to be led by a former FSB general who headed the department gathering intelligence on Ukraine, and Grigory Karasin, a former diplomat who negotiated the Minsk accords between Russia and Ukraine

Those agreements sought to halt the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed proxy forces in the country's south-east. But they were seen as deeply disadvantageous to Ukraine and were plagued by the details of which side had to provide which guarantees and in which order. Ultimately, they collapsed.

One question as Witkoff, Waltz, and Rubio prepare to travel to Riyadh for the high-stakes meetings on Monday is whether they can summon the expertise to wrangle the details of an 11-year-old conflict with some of Russia's most experienced negotiators sitting across the table.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

An investigation found thousands of white bags near Monterrey, but aerial footage shows a bigger problem

Call it the mystery of the white bags. After they were found to be sprawling across acres of land near the Mexican city of Monterrey, authorities ordered their “urgent” removal. Now visual evidence suggests the problem is more extensive than previously known.

An investigation by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab first identified the bags in January, piling up around a factory that recycles toxic waste imported from the US. Based on this finding, Mexican authorities demanded a cleanup of what they said was 30,000 tons of stored material with “hazardous characteristics”.

But aerial and Google Street View photography shows there is at least one more outdoor site related to the company where hundreds more of the white supersacks, typically used to hold industrial chemicals, appear to have been stored. Mexico's environmental enforcement agency said it would conduct an inspection.

The issue of imported US toxic waste – and related concerns, such as the white bags – have become a lightning rod in Mexico and Canada in recent months, with commentators questioning why they should take the US's discards as their countries face a new trade war instigated by the Trump administration.

In Mexico, attention has focused on the Monterrey-area factory, which is owned by a company called Zinc Nacional and recycles toxic dust sent to the country by the US steel industry.

According to the latest imagery, the company has now cleared all the bags located there following the order from regulators.

But new photography shows that the bags also cover more than an acre of land 15km (9 miles) away at the plant of a company called Meremex. Business records show that it is majority-owned by Zinc Nacional and has also been licensed to recycle hazardous waste.

Photographs taken on Wednesday by drone, in a collaboration between the Monterrey newspaper El Norte, the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, show that the giant bags remain stacked around the Meremex industrial yard, with blue tarps partially covering them.

Historical Google Earth and Street View photographs show that two more yards in the same industrial park were previously filled with bags that have been cleared over the last two years. They appear similar to the bags in the Meremex yard, and bags on a truck parked in front of one yard read “Made in Mexico by Zinc Nacional”.

Imagery of these bags from 2022 shows that they were, in places, stacked three bags high and that some of them were broken open and spilling powders on to the bare ground. That site is 600 meters (1,969ft) from a river.

Mexico's environmental enforcement agency, known as Profepa, said it would inspect the sites, saying: “We will also examine the type of material stored to decide whether soil sampling is required and whether remediation is necessary.”

At Zinc Nacional's plant, authorities initially gave the company 15 days to move bags spread across a 20-acre (8-hectare) industrial scrapyard. Satellite imagery suggests the company was still working to remove bags as recently as 14 March, and drone imagery indicates this yard has now been cleared.

Profepa says the company has told it that these bags contain zinc oxide, a final product that is extracted from the toxic waste and used in products such as rubber and fertilizer. Profepa says the material in the bags has “hazardous characteristics”.

The agency ordered the company to sample the underlying soil and develop a remediation plan for any contamination.

“The sacks are being placed in storage areas with reinforced concrete floors, walls, and steel sheet roofing,” said a statement from regulators at Profepa. It added that the environmental investigation was ongoing and that authorities were also reviewing the licenses of other companies that handle hazardous waste in the state of Nuevo León.

The findings follow an investigation by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, a Mexican investigative journalism unit, that revealed that the United States exports about 760,000 tons a year of its hazardous waste to Mexico – a practice that environmentalists say raises the danger that the toxic material will not be handled as safely as would be required in the US.

In Mexico, Zinc Nacional is one of the largest importers of US toxic waste, and recycles contaminated metal dust sent to the country by major US steel companies in order to recover zinc.

Toxicologist Martín Soto Jiménez, from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, conducted sampling in the neighborhood around the zinc plant and found high levels of lead, cadmium and arsenic in soil samples – including inside some homes and schools.

In response to questions from reporters, the company said it was working with local and federal authorities and was responding to points raised in inspections.

“We have successfully completed the removal of 100% of zinc oxide material from our operation yards,” it said.

It said Meremex had been shut down in 2023, and that “we will complete the removal of its inventory in the next weeks”.

In addition, the company said it had “serious concerns about both the methodology rigor and reliability of the study” by Soto Jiménez, and about the way it had been reported. It suggested that not enough sites had been tested for contaminants, that the resulting story selectively highlighted only the worst results, that many of the results had not been “alarming”, as the story said, and that the study had been inconclusive as to whether heavy metals found in the samples had originated in the company's factory.

After the original story was published, state and federal regulators began immediate investigations of the Zinc Nacional plant. Regulators said they shut down 15 unauthorized pieces of equipment at the plant, in addition to ordering the materials stored in the scrapyard moved.

Environmental experts said it is troubling to see so much chemical material accumulating around the property of a plant that is handling hazardous wastes.

“The volume itself is concerning,” said James Rybarczyk, a retired chemistry professor, who once served as an emergency responder to incidents involving chemical hazards in the US. “That's an enormous quantity of anything – and to just be sitting there?”

Rybarczyk, who has been looking into the activities of Zinc Nacional since the company proposed opening a plant in his home town of Muncie, Indiana, five years ago, said that such supersacks can easily leach chemicals or metals into the soil.

“Where could all this volume come from?” he said. “Why isn't it being sold? Why is it being stored? Those are my questions.”

Other experts said that places where the bags have been stored require further work to make sure no chemical hazards remain.

Javier Castro Larragoitia, a research professor of environmental geochemistry at the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí, said sampling would be needed to know the most appropriate next steps.

“If there is a contaminant in the soil, there is always the potential for it to move downward into the subsoil and eventually reach the underground water table,” he said.

The three sites in the industrial park where Meremex is located are in the watershed of the Pesquería River, which flows into the Rio Grande.

Zinc Nacional's plant is also near an important watershed, according to Mexican environmental attorney Francisco Javier Camarena Juárez. This, he said, “requires stricter oversight of the situation”.

The company said it hired a firm approved by regulators to determine whether there had been contamination from the white bags.

But relying on companies to hire their own investigators could be considered a conflict of interest, said Gonzalo García Vargas, a toxicologist at Juárez University.

“The community could organize and demand that the study be conducted by independent institutions, possibly a public university,” he said. “That's what was done in Torreón,” he added, referring to contamination around a notorious lead smelter in that city in northern Mexico.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Tigray's interim leader flees as rival faction seizes control, while Ethiopian  tanks and troops move to border of Eritrea

Aregawi was building a tour-guiding business when war struck Ethiopia's Tigray region in 2020. He spent the next two years fighting on the frontline. Now he is among those who fear Tigray is on the brink of conflict once more.

“We don't want to become a battleground, but it seems like war is near, maybe even inevitable,” he said.

The war between Tigray's rebellious rulers and Ethiopia's federal government ended in 2022, leaving about 600,000 people dead and nearly 10% of women aged between 15 and 49 living in Tigray raped, according to a British Medical Journal study.

But the failure to implement most of the ceasefire's provisions – including the return of nearly 1 million displaced people – and a scramble over resources has split the ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) party.

Tensions escalated this month when Tigray's interim president, Getachew Reda, tried to fire three senior military commanders, having previously accused his forces of attempting a coup.

A coup now appears to have taken place. Last week, a rival TPLF faction, led by the party chair Debretsion Gebremichael, installed its officials in provincial government offices. It also took over the mayor's office and the main radio station in the regional capital, Mekelle. Getachew fled to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital.

On Saturday a skirmish in Tigray resulted in three deaths. A few days before, another person was killed during a dispute in the town of Adi Gudem.

All week long queues formed outside Tigray's banks as people withdrew their cash, and flights out sold out. Armed men roamed Mekelle's streets at night, checking people's ID.

“Fear and uncertainty prevail,” said a resident, who asked not to be named. “My friends are planning to leave for Addis Ababa, Kenya and Uganda because of the fear of war.”

Against this backdrop, concerns are also increasing over tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Despite fighting alongside each other in Tigray, the neighbouring countries have been at loggerheads for months over the determination of Ethiopia's prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to regain access to the Red Sea, which Ethiopia lost when Eritrea seceded in 1993.

Having previously made overtures to the breakaway republic of Somaliland, Abiy set his sights on Eritrea's port of Assab. He has repeatedly said sea access was “existential” for Ethiopia, which with 130 million people is the world's most populous landlocked country. He described losing Eritrea's coastline as a “historical mistake”.

Eritrea has ordered a nationwide mobilisation and is trying to undermine Abiy by aiding rebels fighting Ethiopia's military in the Amhara region bordering Tigray. There are reports that Eritrean intelligence helped Debretsion's TPLF faction during last week's coup.

Ethiopia has sent tanks and troops to the Eritrean border, and state media have been amplifying voices justifying Ethiopia's claims over Assab port.

Last week, Gen Tsadkan Gebretensae, Tigray's vice-president, warned that war could erupt “at any moment” and the region risked “becoming a battlefield” again.

Payton Knopf and Alexander Rondos, the former US and EU special envoys to the region, described developments as “dry tinder waiting for a match that could ignite an interstate war between Ethiopia and Eritrea”.

Abiy said he wanted Ethiopia to regain the port peacefully. “Ethiopia has no intention to invade Eritrea to gain Red Sea access,” he said on Thursday. “Our desire is to talk about it under the principle of give and take, in a mutually beneficial manner, and according to commercial law.”

He spoke after meeting the rival Tigray factions. It appears Abiy declined to intervene in support of Getachew, which could have sparked fresh fighting.

Abiy could seek a deal to secure the support of Tigray, which still has a formidable 200,000-strong military force.

Tigray's new leaders, meanwhile, want to regain control of western Tigray, a fertile area with gold deposits that was seized by Amhara forces during the war. Any attempt to recapture it could also spark fresh conflict, said Ahmed Soliman, at the geopolitical thinktank Chatham House.

“The crux is how things evolve in Tigray and how Abiy responds,” Soliman said. “If there is no agreement, the situation could certainly escalate.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Amid uncertainty as to when part-ceasefire will take effect, Kremlin says it will cover only ‘energy infrastructure'

Waves of Russian drones pounded the Ukrainian port city of Odesa overnight, setting it ablaze in an attack that underscored Moscow's intent to continue aerial assaults despite agreeing to a temporary pause in strikes on energy infrastructure.

Videos circulating on social media showed fires erupting in several parts of Odesa.

The regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said Russian drones struck a high-rise residential building, a shopping centre, and several infrastructure targets.

The Czech president, Petr Pavel, was in the city when Russia unleashed the drone attacks. “Significantly, it was during our meeting that the enemy once again massively attacked the Odesa region,” Kiper said on the Telegram messaging app.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, a close ally of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrote on X that the strikes on Odesa “once again showed” that Russia “sincerely does not want peace”.

Ukraine and Russia have agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after the US president, Donald Trump, spoke to the countries' leaders this week. But uncertainty remains about how or when the part-ceasefire will take effect as Ukraine and Russia prepare to send delegations to Riyadh next week for parallel talks with the US.

It was immediately clear that the three parties had different views about what the pact entailed, with the White House saying “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin saying the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure”, and Zelenskyy saying he would also like railways and ports protected.

A senior Ukrainian official told AFP that Ukraine hoped to secure a part-ceasefire at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday. “We still want to agree on a ceasefire, at least on what we have proposed,” the source said, referring to calls for a halt to strikes on energy sites, civilian infrastructure and attacks in the Black Sea.

The source added it was “unclear” when any ceasefire could be implemented. “There have been no reciprocal steps from the Russians,” they said. “We need to agree on the main thing: what objects and what control. The Americans have enormous intelligence capabilities, so they see a lot,” they added.

On Friday, the Kremlin claimed Vladimir Putin's order for Russian forces to temporarily halt their attacks on energy infrastructure remained in force, but stressed the agreement only covered “energy infrastructure” and not “energy and infrastructure”.

Russia also accused Ukraine of violating the part-ceasefire, citing a strike that took place before Zelenskyy formally agreed to the truce.

Moscow's foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, told Russia's Channel One on Thursday evening that Ukraine had breached a proposed 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure by striking a Russian oil depot on Tuesday night, though that strike came before Zelenskyy's call with Trump the next day where he agreed in principle to the US-brokered proposal.

The Ukrainian side has accused Russia of violating its pledges. Hours after Putin's phone call with Trump on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said there had been “hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure”, including a hospital in Sumy.

Moscow appeared to be exploiting the window before any ceasefire takes hold, launching drones at Odesa as well as shelling the southern region of Zaporizhzhia.

In a separate incident, a pumping station that serves as a critical hub for Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine caught fire on Friday morning, with both sides trading blame. Moscow accused Ukraine of striking the facility, while Ukraine's general staff denied responsibility, claiming instead that it had been “repeatedly shelled by the Russians themselves”.

Russia's investigative committee said the gas station “was significantly damaged in the blast”.

While much of Europe has cut its reliance on Russian gas, countries sympathetic to Moscow – including Hungary and Slovakia – still buy it, with all supplies flowing through the town of Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region.

European leaders of the coalition backing Ukraine are expected to meet again next week, hoping to finalise plans to secure “credible security guarantees”.

After a meeting with western military planners near London on Thursday, Keir Starmer appeared to step back from his pledge to put boots on the ground in Ukraine, saying instead that allied forces would be deployed by sea and air in support of Kyiv's own forces.

The Trump administration has appeared lukewarm toward the idea of European troops in Ukraine and has been reluctant to commit to supporting them if they were deployed. Moscow has repeatedly ruled out the presence of western troops in Ukraine, calling it a red line it will not tolerate.

In an interview on Thursday, Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, suggested the US might advocate for troops from Saudi Arabia or India – two countries with relatively warm ties to Moscow – to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential security arrangement.

Zelenskyy, meanwhile, pushed back against a reported proposal by Macron, who was said to be exploring the idea of a UN-led peacekeeping mission to protect Ukraine.

“With all due respect, the UN will not protect us from occupation or Putin's desire to come again. We do not see the UN as an alternative to a contingent or security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said during a press conference with Pavel.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Arve Hjalmar Holmen, who has never been accused of or convicted of a crime, says chatbot's response to prompt was defamatory

A Norwegian man has filed a complaint against the company behind ChatGPT after the chatbot falsely claimed he had murdered two of his children.

Arve Hjalmar Holmen, a self-described “regular person” with no public profile in Norway, asked ChatGPT for information about himself and received a reply claiming he had killed his own sons.

Responding to the prompt “Who is Arve Hjalmar Holmen?” ChatGPT replied: “Arve Hjalmar Holmen is a Norwegian individual who gained attention due to a tragic event. He was the father of two young boys, aged seven and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020.”

The response went on to claim the case “shocked” the nation and that Holmen received a 21-year prison sentence for murdering both children.

Holmen said in a complaint to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority that the “completely false” story nonetheless contained elements similar to his own life such as his home town, the number of children he has and the age gap between his sons.

“The complainant was deeply troubled by these outputs, which could have harmful effect in his private life, if they where reproduced or somehow leaked in his community or in his home town,” said the complaint, which has been filed by Holmen and Noyb, a digital rights campaign group.

It added that Holmen has “never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen”.

Holmen's complaint alleged that ChatGPT's “defamatory” response violated accuracy provisions within the GDPR European data law. It has asked the Norwegian watchdog to order ChatGPT's parent, OpenAI, to adjust its model to eliminate inaccurate results relating to Holmen and to impose a fine on the company. Noyb said that since Holmen's interaction with ChatGPT took place, OpenAI had released a new model incorporating web searches – which has made a repeat of the Holmen error “less likely”.

AI chatbots are prone to producing responses containing false information because they are built on models that predict the next most likely word in a sentence. This can result in factual errors and wild assertions, but the plausible nature of the responses can trick users into thinking that what they are reading is 100% correct.

An OpenAI spokesperson said: “We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations. While we're still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

‘Turning point' as man on trial for raping or sexually assaulting 299 mostly young patients admits guilt

French investigators have begun a search for further victims of a paedophile surgeon on trial for raping or sexually assaulting 299 mostly young patients, after he admitted all the charges in what was described as a “turning point” in France's largest child abuse case.

Joël Le Scouarnec, 74, had said “I committed heinous acts” at the opening of the trial last month but previously only acknowledged the abuse on a case-by-case basis and had denied several of the charges.

His lawyer, Maxime Tessier, told reporters his client had admitted that all those mentioned in his handwritten notes – reported to be more than 300 names – had been abused. He said the surgeon had told the court, which was sitting in private: “I have a duty to tell the truth.”

The public prosecutor's office in Rennes has opened a fresh investigation to identify and trace other victims mentioned in Le Scouarnec's writings, one document of which was headed: “My paedophile letters.”

Le Scouarnec's admission came after 10 days of evidence from some of the 158 male and 141 female victims, most of whom were under the age of 15, at the trial in Vannes, western France. The court has heard how most of them were abused while under anaesthetic or recovering from operations between 1989 and 2014, when the surgeon worked in a dozen public and private medical establishments across Brittany and western France.

Tessier described it as “a moment of truth and justice … and a turning point” in the trial that came after he asked his client if he recognised that the people mentioned in the numerous notebooks seized by police were “all potential victims of his acts”.

Le Scouarnec replied: “Yes.”

Asked if he recognised that the 299 accusations at the centre of the four-month trial were criminal offences, the surgeon again replied: “Yes”.

“Monseur Le Scouarnec is aware of the consequences of this, that is to say the possibility of reopening investigations, of finding victims who would have been forgotten by the prosecution. This is an act that goes beyond all declarations of intent,” Tessier said.

Frédérique Giffard, a lawyer for 15 of the victims, welcomed Le Scouarnec's admission and said she believed the surgeon had finally realised the devastating impact of his abuse. “This recognition is a crucial step in allowing the victims to move forward,” Giffard said.

Since 2020, Le Scouarnec, described by members of his family as a “Jekyll and Hyde” character, has been serving a 15-year prison sentence for the sexual abuse of four young girls. It was while searching his home for evidence in this case that police came across notebooks and hard disks containing hundreds of thousands of photos and videos of child sexual abuse. Officers also discovered a collection of lifesize dolls.

The trial is examining how Le Scouarnec was allowed to work after his 2005 conviction for possession of child sexual abuse images when he was given a four-month suspended sentence. His hospital employers and the health authorities were aware but no action was taken.

Speaking before the trial, Francesca Satta, a lawyer representing several of the victims, described the surgeon as “extremely perverse” and said there could be as many as 400 victims. At least 12 cases were dropped because the allegations were out of time for prosecution.

Satta said the investigation had opened a “Pandora's box” for those treated by Le Scouarnec, most of whom are now in their 30s and 40s and who learned of the abuse only when police turned up at their homes.

“It has caused real distress. Many of the victims were five to 10 years old at the time, many were anaesthetised and incapable of knowing what happened. Most had absolutely no idea. In any case, they were children who wouldn't have recognised the difference between a medical act and sexual abuse. And he was a doctor. They and their parents trusted him,” Satta said.

Report co-authored by Irish government also finds tariffs could cause job losses and relocation of US multinationals

A trade war between the US and the EU could cost Ireland more than €18bn (£15bn), trigger waves of job losses and cause US multinationals to relocate, according to a report co-authored by the Irish government.

Ireland's GDP could shrink by 3.7% over the next five to seven years under the worst-case scenario, in which Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all exports on the EU and the EU retaliated with counter-tariffs, the study carried by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) found.

A Trump slump would be unavoidable whatever the tariff scenario, it found. If the US president imposes 10% tariffs on all global imports, the impact would be significant, with Irish GDP dropping by 3.2% compared with a no-tariff scenario, the study showed.

The ESRI said nearly all tariff scenarios would have a “significant negative impact” on the Irish economy, with a knock-on effect causing job losses and potential loss of US multinationals.

“Protectionist policies may also prompt multinationals to relocate to the US, posing further risks to the Irish economy and public finances,” Paul Egan, the report's author and a research officer at the ESRI, said.

Ireland is one of three EU countries with a surplus in goods trade with the US, with pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer and Eli Lilly driving many of its exports, booking the profits from sales across the Atlantic in Ireland – a practice that Trump wants to stop.

The Irish government is already nervous about the impact of Trump's threat of tariffs after the US president singled out what he considers to be the theft of jobs and investment by Ireland.

In a meeting with the Irish taoiseach in the Oval Office two weeks ago, Trump praised Ireland for being “smart” but said it had the “entire pharmaceutical industry in its grasp”.

Experts in Ireland have said that the threat of a tightened tax regime were more likely to incentivise pharmaceutical companies to book their profits in the US, rather than endure tariffs.

The impact of trade barriers on manufacturing sectors including pharma, medical devices, food production and the IT sector would have an impact on jobs but also income tax revenues for the state, the report, co-authored by the Irish finance ministry, said.

It forecast that the 3.7% reduction in GDP would equate to the loss of €18.4bn taking last year's GDP as the baseline. A shrinking economy could also trigger inflation, with higher import prices on goods affected by retaliatory tariffs.

By value, Ireland's biggest imports from the US are aircraft, because of the size of the budget airline Ryanair and Dublin-headquartered Aercap, the world's largest aircraft leasing company. Other significant imports include pharmaceuticals, machinery, optical and medical apparatus and energy, including liquid gas and oil.

Egan said his research team could not quantify the scale of the impact of uncertainty caused by Trump's threats of tariffs but said it would have an impact.

“The heightened uncertainty in the short run could actually magnify the impacts, kind of beyond what we discuss in the paper,” he told RTÉ's Morning Ireland.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Alleged assault at polar base shows the importance of research on cabin fever – including on future Mars missions

South Africa has a tight regime for scientists wanting to “overwinter” in Antarctica. The 13-month assignment to an isolated research base on the top of a cliff edge is, as the environment ministry drily puts it, “testing”. Average annual temperatures are -16C but drop much lower during the winter darkness.

All applicants are subjected to psychometric analysis “to ensure they are able to cope with the isolation, and can work and live with others in the confined space of the bases”, said the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment. “Only candidates who do not have any negative outcomes from all the background evaluations will be considered.”

But can humans ever fully prepare for long-duration remote scientific experiments? The crisis currently facing the overwintering crew at the Sanae IV station, more than 2,700 miles from Cape Town, suggests not.

Early in their stay, claims of physical assault, sexual harassment and a death threat have been made among the team of nine. Apologies have been made and psychologists from the mainland are now in “constant” contact with the team to guide them through the fallout.

The allegations might never have been noticed by the wider world had South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper not published an email sent by a researcher at Sanae IV accusing a male colleague of “creating an environment of fear and intimidation”.

A select few know what life is like on South Africa's Antarctic research stations, which can be accessed only during summer months by an ice-breaking supply ship.

Ken Rice, a physicist at the University of Edinburgh, is one of them, having overwintered at a station in the early 1990s. He went through similar psychological testing, and even had his wisdom teeth removed as a preemptive measure since there would be no practical way to do it once on the permafrost.

Rice's trip was to the station's previous location, Sanae III, a much smaller space buried under 20 metres (65ft) of ice that built up over the years. He spent much of his time outside, twiddling with nearby antennas and equipment used to measure the ozone and ultraviolet light. Rice spent hours filming the aurora australis, or southern lights, dancing in the sky. “The cabin fever, certainly in my case, I don't think that was an issue,” he said.

There were disagreements, of course, “but never, ever anything that was genuinely confrontational where you thought: ‘somebody's going to lose it'. So yeah, there were aspects that were not ideal, but we kind of got through them.”

Sanae IV, a three-module research station built on metal stilts, was completed in 1997 and is much bigger. Rice visited when it was erected. “There are very big living quarters, and I think there's a snooker room, but there's a couple of lounges and plenty of accommodation space.” That was the one aspect people did not realise about the station, he said: that there is space to get away from your colleagues.

The dynamics of how to keep humans living and working effectively together has been a fascination for centuries, particularly during the ages of global exploration at sea.

Antarctica is the location of perhaps the most celebrated story of teamwork under intense loneliness and stress. Ernest Shackleton's 1914 expedition failed its mission to make the first land crossing of the continent. Yet personal accounts suggest the crew remained shockingly united, despite enduring hundreds of days of hardship, including having to shoot and eat their canine companions. All 28 men survived.

A century later, a new frontier is driving interest in the impact of isolation: space. With years-long Mars missions looking more likely, and long-duration trips already happening on the International Space Station, scientists are once again investigating.

Several so-called “analogue” missions are under way, in which people are willingly locked away on Earth to simulate what it would feel like to travel deep into space.

Last year, a crew stepped out of a 3D-printed habitat in Texas after a 378-day simulated Mars surface mission. To add realism, artificial time delays to mimic communication lags to Earth – up to 22 minutes each way – were implemented. Nasa has not released details of the group dynamics, although the commander, Kelly Haston, said the worst they experienced were “crabby days”. A separate eight-month Mars simulation in Hawaii ended with one participant saying: “Not once did anyone use a personal insult.”

The largest-ever analogue experiment, a 520-day mission in Moscow, also appeared to have been a success, with six men emerging from their artificial Mars500 habitat looking tired and thin but happy. Nevertheless, its crew was reportedly all-male because a previous experiment had ended in a scandal when a Canadian scientist accused a male colleague of forcibly kissing her.

Accounts from research stations in Antarctica have also been seen as vital case studies – the continent has even been called “White Mars” because of its desolation – as have those from isolated communities. A 1983 US psychology study asked rural Minnesotans how they dealt with being cut off and found that just being aware of the concept of “cabin fever” helped people endure loneliness.

South Africa's environment ministry says the situation is now calm at the Sanae IV base, where recent developments have drawn comparisons with another incident at one of the country's Antarctic outposts – an alleged axe attack on a researcher's laptop by a colleague in 2017.

​Niel Malan, an expedition physicist who overwintered at Sanae IV in 1999, said people inevitably took time to get used to isolation and tempers could flare. “But humans adapt, and most teams work through their initial frictions and learn to work together effectively.”

The work at Sanae IV, he said, was no different from work anywhere else. “Most of it is routine and boring,” he said. “Personally, I was a member of a very successful team. We worked through our frictions without violence, and we're still brothers.”

Ultimately, interpersonal conflict may be a shared human problem, he said, whether people are on a cliff in Antarctica or in an office in central London.

“As far as I can see it's a story of violence in the workplace,” he added. “The only things that make it noteworthy is that it happened in an isolated place, and that the email with the complaint was leaked to the media.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Compound was last bastion in the capital, Khartoum, held by rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces

The Sudanese army has recaptured the presidential palace in the capital, Khartoum, in a highly symbolic battlefield victory over the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in the country's catastrophic civil war.

Videos posted on social media showed soldiers carrying assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers inside the partly ruined building. An officer wearing a captain's epaulettes announced the takeover of the palace in a video and confirmed that troops were inside the compound.

In a post on X, Khaled al-Aiser, Sudan's information minister, said the military had retaken the palace. “Today the flag is raised, the palace is back and the journey continues until victory is complete,” he wrote.

Intermittent gunfire could be heard throughout the capital on Friday, but it was not clear if it involved fighting or was celebratory.

Following the capture, RSF – led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – responded with deadly drone attacks. Shortly after state television broadcast scenes of fighters celebrating in the palace, three of its journalists were killed in a drone strike, an army source told Agence France-Presse.

In a statement on Telegram, the RSF said it had launched a “lightning operation” around the palace that “killed more than 89 enemy personnel and destroyed various military vehicles.”

“The battle for the Republican Palace is not over yet,” the militia vowed.

The RSF pledged to “continue to fight” to dislodge the army from areas it has retaken.

Its fighters are reportedly still scattered around the city centre, hiding in nearby buildings and stationed in part of the bombed out airport.

The seizure of the palace, which overlooks the Nile and was the seat of government before the war, follows months of steady advances for the army in the Khartoum area in recent months. Earlier this week, the army said its forces had merged from the north and south, hemming in the RSF.

RSF fighters, who seized much of the capital in the early stages of the war – forcing the army-aligned government to flee to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast – have been all but expelled from the city.

However, the army gain does not mean an end to the war is imminent. The RSF has consolidated control in the western Darfur region, hardening battle lines and moving the country towards de facto partition. The RSF is working to set up a parallel government in areas it controls, although that is not expected to receive widespread international recognition.

Late on Thursday, the RSF claimed it seized control of the Sudanese city of al-Maliha, a strategic desert city in North Darfur near the borders of Chad and Libya. Sudan's military has acknowledged fighting around al-Maliha but has not said it lost the city.

Al-Maliha is about 125 miles (200km) north of the city of El Fasher, which remains held by the Sudanese military despite near-daily strikes by the surrounding RSF.

The head of the UN children's agency has said the conflict in Sudan has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.

Sudan, in north-eastern Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of the longtime autocratic president, Omar al-Bashir, in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Dagalo led a military coup in 2021. The RSF and Sudan's military then began fighting each other in 2023.

Since the war began, the Sudanese military and the RSF have faced allegations of human rights abuses. Before Joe Biden left office, the US state department declared the RSF was committing genocide.

The military and the RSF have denied committing abuses.

The war has attracted external actors with interests in the country, including Chad, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Libya, Qatar and Russia. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been accused of providing financial and military support to the Sudanese army and the RSF respectively, but they have denied it.

Israel Katz orders army to ‘seize more ground' as he threatens ‘permanent occupation'

Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Friday he ordered the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and warned of partial annexation if Hamas does not release hostages held in the Palestinian territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“I ordered (the army) to seize more territory in Gaza … The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel,” he said in a statement in which he threatened “permanent occupation” of “buffer zones” inside the Gaza Strip.

Israel's defence minister said on Friday he has instructed the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and threatened to annex part of the territory unless Hamas releases the remaining hostages it holds.

Israel Katz's warning came as the army stepped up the renewed assault it launched on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages and brought relative calm since late January.

After retaking part of the strategic Netzarim corridor that divides Gaza's north from south, Israeli troops moved on Thursday towards the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah. The military said it had resumed enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City.

“I ordered [the army] to seize more territory in Gaza,” Katz said. “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel.”

Katz also threatened “to expand buffer zones around Gaza to protect Israeli civilian population areas and soldiers by implementing a permanent Israeli occupation of the area,” should Hamas not comply.

He said the army “will intensify the fight with aerial, naval and ground shelling as well as by expanding the ground operation”, which he said would include implementing Donald Trump's proposal to turn Gaza into a resort after the relocation of its Palestinian inhabitants to other Arab countries.

That's all from me, Tom Ambrose, and the Middle East crisis live blog for today. Thanks for following along.

Palestinian militant group Hamas is to blame for deaths in the Gaza Strip since hostilities resumed, the United States told the UN security council on Friday.

“Hamas bears full responsibility for the ongoing war in Gaza and for the resumption of hostilities. Every death would have been avoided had Hamas accepted the bridge proposal that the United States offered last Wednesday,” acting US ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea told the 15-member council.

Russian president Vladimir Putin has said he is “concerned” by Gaza escalation and is “ready to help cool tensions”, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

More details soon …

The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), one of the largest providers of food aid in Gaza, warned on Friday it only had enough flour to distribute for the next six days. “We can stretch that by giving people less, but we are talking days, not weeks,” Unrwa official Sam Rose told reporters in Geneva in an online briefing from central Gaza, reports Reuters.

Israel's supreme court on Friday froze the decision by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to sack Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, in order to review appeals filed against the dismissal. “It is hereby ordered that a provisional measure be taken to stay the effect of the decision subject to the appeals until another decision is made,” the court said in a document obtained by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

The head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, has been dismissed, a week after Benjamin Netanyahu said he had lost confidence in him, and despite three days of protests against the move. “The government unanimously approved prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA [Israeli Security Agency] director Ronen Bar's term of office,” a statement from the prime minister's office said.

Israel's government is due to meet Sunday for a no confidence vote on the attorney general, a vocal critic of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, marking the start of a lengthy dismissal process, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “We resolve to express our lack of confidence in the government's legal adviser, Gali Baharav-Miara, due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and the government's legal adviser,” said a cabinet meeting agenda on the website of the prime minister's office on Friday.

Less than half of Palestinian Red Crescent emergency vehicles are operating due to fuel shortages in Gaza, reports Reuters. Of 53 vehicles in total, 23 remain operational after aid supplies into Gaza, including fuel, were halted in early March, Tommaso Della Longa from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told reporters in Geneva.

The situation in Gaza is gravely concerning with massive reductions in distribution of aid supplies, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa) said, reports Reuters. “This is the longest period since the start of conflict in October 2023 that no supplies whatsoever have entered Gaza. The progress we made as an aid system over the last six weeks of the ceasefire is being reversed,” Sam Rose from Unrwa told reporters, speaking from central Gaza.

Hamas said on Friday it is still discussing US envoy Steve Witkoff's proposal and various other ideas, with the aim of reaching a deal to release prisoners, end the war in Gaza, and achieve a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territory. Witkoff presented last week a “bridge” plan to extend the ceasefire in Gaza into April beyond Ramadan and Passover and allow time to negotiate a permanent cessation of hostilities.

Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Friday he ordered the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and warned of partial annexation if Hamas does not release hostages held in the Palestinian territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “I ordered (the army) to seize more territory in Gaza … The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel,” he said in a statement in which he threatened “permanent occupation” of “buffer zones” inside the Gaza Strip.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Friday that Tehran has no proxies in the region and that the groups it backs act independently, reports Reuters. US president Donald Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Yemeni Houthi group that it says Iran supports.

The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), one of the largest providers of food aid in Gaza, warned on Friday it only had enough flour to distribute for the next six days.

“We can stretch that by giving people less, but we are talking days, not weeks,” Unrwa official Sam Rose told reporters in Geneva in an online briefing from central Gaza, reports Reuters.

The humanitarian situation in Gaza was once again alarming due to massive reductions in distribution of aid, Unrwa said.

“Six of 25 bakeries that the World Food Programme were supporting had to close down. There are larger crowds on streets outside bakeries,” Rose said.

“This is the longest period since the start of conflict in October 2023 that no supplies whatsoever have entered Gaza. The progress we made as an aid system over the last six weeks of the ceasefire is being reversed,” Rose added.

Israel's supreme court on Friday froze the decision by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to sack Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, in order to review appeals filed against the dismissal.

“It is hereby ordered that a provisional measure be taken to stay the effect of the decision subject to the appeals until another decision is made,” the court said in a document obtained by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

It added that the freeze will remain in place until the appeals are presented to the court before 8 April.

The Israeli supreme court has stayed the government's decision to sack Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

As we reported earlier, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, has been dismissed, a week after Benjamin Netanyahu said he had lost confidence in him, and despite three days of protests against the move.

“The government unanimously approved prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA [Israeli Security Agency] director Ronen Bar's term of office,” a statement from the prime minister's office said.

According to the statement, Bar will leave his post when his successor is appointed, or by 10 April at the latest. You can read more on this story in Lorenzo Tondo's latest piece:

France opposes any kind of annexation by Israel of the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, the French foreign minister said on Friday, after Israel's defence minister threatened to annex parts of Gaza unless Hamas released Israeli hostages.

“France is opposed to any form of annexation whether it concerns the West Bank or the Gaza Strip. We have a very clear vision of the future of the region – a solution of two (Israeli and Palestinian) states living side-by-side in peace,” foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot told reporters in the eastern city of Dijon, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Agence France-Presse (AFP) has a bit more detail on Israeli defence minister Israel Katz's orders to the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza.

“I ordered (the army) to seize more territory in Gaza … The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel,” he said in a statement.

Should Hamas not comply, Katz also threatened “to expand buffer zones around Gaza to protect Israeli civilian population areas and soldiers by implementing a permanent Israeli occupation of the area”.

Katz vowed to step up the assault, using civilian as well as military “pressure points” to defeat Hamas. He added:

We will intensify the fight with aerial, naval and ground shelling as well as by expanding the ground operation until hostages are freed and Hamas is defeated, using all military and civilian pressure points.”

He said these included implementing president Donald Trump's proposal for the United States to redevelop Gaza as a Mediterranean resort after the relocation of its Palestinian inhabitants to other Arab countries.

On Thursday, the Israeli military said troops had begun “conducting ground activity” in the Shabura area of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city near the Egyptian border. It said it had also closed off the territory's main north-south route as it expanded the ground operations which resumed on Wednesday.

Israel's government is due to meet Sunday for a no confidence vote on the attorney general, a vocal critic of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, marking the start of a lengthy dismissal process, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“We resolve to express our lack of confidence in the government's legal adviser, Gali Baharav-Miara, due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and the government's legal adviser,” said a cabinet meeting agenda on the website of the prime minister's office on Friday.

Muhammad Arshad, from Pakistan, was a foreman building Aramco Stadium in Al Khobar, one of 11 new venues for 2034

A migrant worker has died while working on a new stadium being built for the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia, the Guardian can reveal.

Muhammad Arshad, from Pakistan, fell to his death from an upper level during the construction of the Aramco Stadium in the eastern city of Al Khobar on 12 March, according to sources with knowledge of the incident.

His death is the first-known death of a migrant worker linked to the 2034 World Cup and comes just three months after the Gulf kingdom was named the host of the tournament by Fifa.

The move was fiercely opposed by human rights groups, which warned of the risks migrant workers would face on World Cup construction sites, with Amnesty International saying: “Migrant workers will face exploitation and many will die.”

Arshad's death was confirmed by Besix Group, a Belgian construction multinational, whose subsidiary Six Construct is one of the main contractors at the stadium.

“A team of three workers was engaged in formwork operations [creating moulds for concrete] at height when the platform they were working on tilted. While all three were equipped with personal fall-arrest systems, one worker was not connected to an anchor point at the time of the incident and fell, sustaining severe injuries,” the company said in a statement. Emergency services were immediately called, but “the worker sadly succumbed to his injuries in hospital”.

It is unclear how long Arshad had been working at the stadium, where it is understood he was employed as a foreman, but social media posts show him on the site from last September.

After his death, workers were allegedly called to a meeting and ordered to delete any video footage of the incident and not to talk to anyone about it, according to a source who was present.

Besix said: “Out of respect for the victim's family, workers were asked not to share images of the consequences of the tragic accident on social media.

“Safety is and remains our absolute priority … The authorities are conducting a full inquiry, and we are fully cooperating to determine the exact circumstances of this tragedy,” the company said.

Arshad's body was flown back to Pakistan on Tuesday, where his coffin was buried near his home in the north-west of the country. “We have just fallen from the sky to the ground. The whole family is in a state of shock,” Arshad's father, Muhammad Bashir, told the Guardian.

Arshad, who was in his mid-30s, had three sons aged between two and seven. “It will have a long-lasting impact on their lives. Arshad's income was their only source of living. We will have to bear their living and educational expenses. We will try to meet their needs,” said Bashir.

On Monday, Bashir said he had not yet been contacted directly by his son's employer, but had been assured by a relative in Saudi Arabia that his family would receive Arshad's outstanding salary and benefits.

Under Saudi labour law, employers must also pay compensation in the event of a death at work. Besix said it had taken steps to support the family and ensure all payments were, “handled in a timely and respectful manner”.

Construction of the 47,000-seater Aramco Stadium is at an advanced stage, with thousands of migrant workers, many from Bangladesh and Pakistan, working at the site in two shifts. It is being developed by Aramco, the state-owned oil company, which recently became Fifa's most lucrative sponsor.

An investigation last year revealed that some migrant workers employed at the stadium were enduring highly abusive conditions. They alleged they were saddled with staggering debts from the illegal fees they were forced to pay to get to Saudi Arabia. Housed in grim, cramped rooms, they toiled for 10 hours a day in the scorching 45C (113F) summer heat for paltry wages, which some said were withheld for months.

The stadium is one of 11 new venues being built for the 2034 World Cup, alongside a huge expansion of the country's transport infrastructure and hotel accommodation to meet the demands of an expanded 48-team tournament.

World Cup-related construction is just one part of a building boom under way in Saudi Arabia as the Gulf kingdom seeks to rebrand itself on the global stage. The construction is almost entirely dependent on a vast army of low-wage migrant workers, who largely come from south Asia.

In a statement, Besix said it had “made significant strides” in protecting workers' rights wherever it operated, adding that sub-contractors were required to comply with welfare standards that “encompassed the full spectrum of workers' welfare, from safety and wages to living conditions”. It acknowledged that “some local contexts have proven challenging”, and had taken additional steps to improve these standards. “Our priority is to ensure that all workers are treated with dignity and fairness,” it said.

Aramco said the safety and wellbeing of employees was “our highest priority”.

“The company follows industry best practices in managing and reporting incidents, including determining the facts, sequence of events and root causes,” it said in a statement.

More than 500,000 people sign petition after ‘powerful sonic impact' allegedly directed towards rally in Belgrade

More than half a million people have signed an online petition calling for an independent investigation into whether security forces in Serbia used a sonic weapon – what the petition described as a “sound cannon” – during Saturday's huge anti-corruption rally.

Days after as many as 325,000 people took to the streets of Belgrade, rights groups and opposition parties continue to allege that protesters were targeted with some sort of auditory device that briefly sowed panic and left some with symptoms that lingered long after the rally.

Serbian politicians and police have denied the allegations. Earlier this week, the country's increasingly autocratic president, Aleksandar Vučić, described the claim as a “wicked lie” that was aimed at “destroying Serbia”.

The allegation has added pressure on Vučić as he faces his biggest challenge yet to his decade-long grip on power. Since November, near-daily protests have taken place over the collapse of a train station roof in the northern city of Novi Sad. The tragedy, which killed 15 people, soon became a flashpoint as people across the country seized on it to demand greater government transparency and express their broader dissatisfaction with Serbia's increasingly authoritarian rule. Saturday's protest was the movement's strongest show of force to date.

Video captured on Saturday evening showed people standing in the street, observing 15 minutes of silence for those killed in the rail station disaster. The video then appeared to show the crowds part suddenly – the Associated Press noted that a piercing sound shattered the silence – triggering a panicked scramble for cover.

Campaigners claimed the video captured the moment in which protesters were targeted with what they described as a crowd control device. Several people who attended the rally later said on social media that they were suffering from lingering headaches, nausea and ringing in their ears.

As questions swirled over what exactly had taken place, the focus landed on a photo from Saturday's protest that appeared to show a police vehicle with a large piece of equipment fixed to the bonnet.

Serbia's interior minister, Ivica Dačić, on Wednesday denied the equipment had been used against protesters. The vehicle had “remained stationary, and the device was not used elsewhere, nor was sound played from it, except during preparations, drills, and what's necessary for the operation of these units”, Dačić said, according to Agence France-Presse. “Its use as a sound cannon is prohibited,” he added.

Aleksandar Radić, a Belgrade-based military analyst, told AFP that the equipment resembled an American-made long-range acoustic device capable of delivering high-frequency sound waves over significant distances. It could be used for “crowd control, repelling attacks on critical infrastructure, or even in anti-piracy operations”, he added.

Soon after Saturday's protest, the opposition Move-Change movement launched a petition addressed to the UN special rapporteurs on the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression as well as the Council of Europe.

By Thursday, more than 590,000 people had added their names to its call for an international, independent investigation into the events. “The use of illegal means against civilians represents a serious violation of the constitutional and internationally recognised rights of citizens, which requires an urgent response by international bodies,” the petition said.

The call for action was heightened by six NGOs in Serbia which said they had joined forces to collect testimonies from the day. More than 3,000 reports had already poured in, with witnesses detailing “a powerful sonic impact, accompanied by a wave of heat or wind”, the organisations said in a statement.

Some described the sound as a “deep roar” akin to a jet engine or a train in a tunnel, “combined with a high-frequency whistle, a cannon blast or an explosion”.

The organisations called on Serbian prosecutors to also gather testimony from those who attended, but said these witnesses needed to be protected with confidentiality guaranteed.

“Based on the collected testimonies, it is evident that a strong sonic impact occurred during the protest, causing a range of physical and psychological reactions among those present,” they said. “We call on the competent institutions to urgently investigate these allegations and inform the public of their findings.”

Zelenskyy says he will not discuss US ownership of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station; US to hold separate meetings with Russian and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. What we know on day 1,122

Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States would sign a minerals and natural resources deal with Ukraine soon and that his efforts to achieve a peace deal for the country were going “pretty well” after his talks this week with the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. “We're doing very well with regard to Ukraine and Russia. And one of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly with respect to rare earths with Ukraine,” he said during an event at the White House. A day earlier, the White House had said it had “moved beyond” the idea of taking possession of Ukraine's mineral wealth as part of negotiations, while Trump told the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that the US could own and run Ukrainian nuclear power plants, including Zaporizhzhia power station, as part of a ceasefire.

Zelenskyy on Thursday said he could not legally negotiate ownership of the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. “We will not discuss it. We have 15 nuclear power units in operation today. This all belongs to our state,” Zelenskyy told a news conference in Oslo, where he held talks with Norway's prime minister, Jonas Gahr Store.

Zelenskyy also said Ukrainian and US officials would meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday to make progress on a proposed halt in Russian and Ukrainian strikes on energy facilities. His announcement came shortly after the Kremlin confirmed that Russian officials would also hold talks with the US in Saudi Arabia on Monday.

EU leaders – apart from Hungary's Viktor Orbán – said they were ready to increase pressure on Russia through further sanctions. Meeting in Brussels, the bloc agreed it was ready to levy further sanctions on Russia and strengthen existing measures after talks with Zelenskyy, who joined by video link. The show of unity was marred by Orbán refusing to support an EU text declaring support for Ukraine.

Despite declaring their backing for Ukraine, the leaders did not immediately endorse a call by Zelenskyy to provide at least €5bn for artillery ammunition purchases. “We need funds for artillery shells and would really appreciate Europe's support with at least €5bn ($5.42bn) as soon as possible,” Zelenskyy told them. The bloc's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, had also called on leaders to match words of support for Kyiv with deeds. Summit chair Antonio Costa said EU members had promised €15bn in aid for Ukraine in recent weeks and he believed they would increase those pledges.

Senior military officers from more than 30 countries across Europe and beyond met in England on Thursday to flesh out plans for an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine as details of a partial ceasefire are worked out. 
    UK prime minister Keir Starmer said he didn't know whether there would be a peace deal but “we are making steps in the right direction” as a “coalition of the willing” led by Britain and France moves into an “operational phase”. He also threatened Russian President Vladimir Putin with “severe consequences” if he breached any potential peace deal. He did not repeat his promise to put boots on the ground in Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron said leaders of the coalition would meet again next week, hoping to finalise plans to secure a potential truce in the war with Russia. Macron – who along with Starmer has said he is willing to deploy troops to Ukraine – said the meeting next Thursday will be a chance to “fine-tune” work on ensuring any truce is durable.

The Financial Times reported that Europe's biggest military powers are discussing how to take on greater responsibility for Europe's defence. Countries including the UK, France and Germany aim to present Donald Trump with a plan to shift the financial and military burden to European capitals, in the hope of a managed transfer over five to 10 years, the paper reported.

Ukraine struck a major Russian strategic bomber airfield on Thursday with drones, triggering a huge blast and fire about 700km (435 miles) from the frontlines of the war, Russian and Ukrainian officials said. Videos verified by Reuters showed a huge blast spreading out from the airfield, wrecking nearby cottages. Other verified videos showed a giant plume of smoke rising into the dawn sky and an intense fire. The base in Engels, which dates back to Soviet times, hosts Russia's Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear-capable heavy strategic bombers, known unofficially as White Swans.

Russian forces launched a mass drone attack on Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa late on Thursday, injuring three people and damaging a high-rise apartment building and a shopping centre, the regional governor said. Oleh Kiper, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said there had been strikes in three locations that triggered fires, while three districts of the city were suffering from power cuts.

Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that Ukraine had already violated a proposed ceasefire on energy sites in the three-year-old war by attacking a Russian oil depot. Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya. The depot is a rail terminal for Russian oil supplies to a pipeline linking Kazakhstan to the Black Sea. A statement issued by authorities in the Krasnodar region on Thursday evening said efforts were continuing to bring the blaze under control.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Order to remain in place until court hears petitions against Ronen Bar's dismissal as protests continue into fourth day



Israel's supreme court has frozen the decision of Benjamin Netanyahu's government to fire the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency amid protests against the move.

The order will remain in place until the court can hear the petitions that have been filed by Israel's opposition and an NGO against the dismissal of Ronen Bar, who was sacked after an overnight vote by the government.

The Shin Bet has been investigating Netanyahu's close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.

In a letter made public late on Thursday, Bar said his dismissal was motivated by Netanyahu's “personal interests”. The security chief referred to the conclusions drawn by his agency's investigation into the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, which said “a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup”.

He added: “The dismissal of the head of the service at this time at the initiative of the prime minister sends a message to all those involved, a message that could put the optimal outcome of the investigation at risk. This is a direct danger to the security of the state of Israel.”

The court ruling said the freeze on his dismissal would remain until the appeals were presented to the court before 8 April.

According to the earlier government statement announcing his dismissal, Bar was supposed to leave his post when his successor was appointed, or by 10 April at the latest.

Bar, whose tenure was meant to end next year, was appointed by the previous Israeli government, which briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.

His relations with the prime minister had been strained even before the 7 October Hamas attack, which sparked the war in Gaza, notably over proposed judicial reforms that had split the country. Relations worsened after the 4 March release of the internal Shin Bet report on the attack, which acknowledged the agency's own failures but also pointed to wider policy issues in the run-up.

In a statement on Friday, a Netanyahu spokesperson said: “The Israeli government, which is in charge of the Shin Bet, has lost all confidence in Ronen Bar, who continues to cling to his seat while cynically using the families of the kidnapped and politically incorrect use of his position to fabricate futile, unfounded investigations.

“Ronen had the opportunity to retire with honour after his searing failure on October 7 … But [he] preferred not to attend the government meeting dealing with his case.”

A series of high-ranking officials seen as responsible for mistakes and misjudgments in the period before the Hamas attack have resigned. Netanyahu himself has not accepted any responsibility for Israel's worst ever security disaster, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and has resisted calls for a powerful commission of inquiry.

After the government vote against Bar, Israel's opposition and an NGO said on Friday they had filed a petition against the decision. Their initiative was upheld by the supreme court, ruling as the high court of justice on state decisions, which subsequently issued a temporary injunction.

The NGO, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, had denounced “an unlawful decision … posing a real risk to the national security of the state of Israel”, while the opposition leader Yair Lapid's centre-right party denounced what it called “a decision based on flagrant conflict of interest”.

The communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, said in response to the ruling that the judges had no right to interfere in the government's decision to fire Bar.

“Bar will end his tenure on April 10 or earlier, with the appointment of a permanent head of the Shin Bet,” he said. “You have no legal authority to interfere in this. This is the government's authority. Your order is void.”

A former head of the Shin Bet, Yoram Cohen, on Friday condemned Bar's sacking in an interview with Israel's Channel 12, and alleged that the prime minister had compelled him to carry out acts of questionable legitimacy when he was in charge of the agency.

He has previously alleged that in 2011 Netanyahu asked him to wiretap the government's top defence officials to ensure that “they were not leaking information from a particularly sensitive security meeting”, the Times of Israel reported.

In a separate move on Friday, Netanyahu's cabinet said it would debate on Sunday a motion of no confidence in the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, accusing her of acting “as the long arm of the government's opponents”.

Baharav-Miara previously warned Netanyahu he could not fire Bar before her office had reviewed his motives for doing so.

Netanyahu is facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. The 75-year-old politician, who came to power for the first time in 1996 and has served 17 years as prime minister, is giving evidence twice weekly.

On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators protested for a fourth consecutive day against the move to sack Bar, joining protesters angry at the decision to resume fighting in Gaza while 59 Israeli hostages remain in the Palestinian territory.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Marcin Majerkiewicz, 42, killed Stuart Everett, 67, at their home and scattered his victim's body parts in Salford parks

A man has been found guilty at Manchester crown court of murdering his friend and cutting his body into dozens of pieces that were discovered in parks and nature reserves across Greater Manchester.

Marcin Majerkiewicz, 42, killed Stuart Everett, 67, known as Benny, in a “brutal attack” at the house they shared in Eccles on 27 or 28 March last year, the court heard.

After dismembering Everett, who was described by friends as “jolly” and “someone who everyone got on with”, Majerkiewicz used his phone to communicate with relatives, even sending birthday cards in an attempt to cover up his crime.

He was traced by police after a part of Everett's body was found at Kersal Dale nature reserve by a member of the public on 4 April 2024.

A police investigation was launched in which detectives spent thousands of hours trawling through CCTV footage to identify a person they referred to as “heavy bag man”, who was seen struggling to carry a large shopping bag near where the first body part was found.

They traced the man to a housing estate in Eccles and while going door-to-door for information an officer spotted Majerkiewicz, who matched the description of “heavy bag man”, getting on a bus. When they searched him, they found Everett's phone and bank cards, which allowed them to identify the victim.

During the trial, which lasted two and a half weeks, the jury heard how Everett had referred to Majerkiewicz as his “partner” in emails with a friend, and others had observed the pair seemed “close”.

Everett, who was born to Polish parents and originally from Derby, had known his killer for more than a decade. They had their own bedrooms in the house, which Polish-born Majerkiewicz moved into after splitting with his ex-partner.

It is not known what led Majerkiewicz to kill Everett and he did not put forward a defence in court.

A Home Office pathologist told the court it was possible to piece together the remains of Everett's head, which showed evidence he was hit with a hammer-like weapon and is believed to have been cut up with hand tools.

After the Kersal Dale discovery, further body parts were found in other green spaces, with one of the packages containing remains discovered by a member of the public.

Majerkiewicz assumed the identity of his victim, using Everett's phone to text his family, friends and the landlord – and even sending two handwritten birthday cards to family members. He used Everett's bank accounts “as if they were his own”, the prosecution said.

“By that time, he was, we say, already dead, and his body, including his face had been cut up by the defendant,” Jason Pitter KC, for the prosecution, told the court.

On 3 April, Majerkiewicz researched the address of Everett's brother in Derby, and sent him a birthday card pretending to be Everett. The card had the defendant's fingerprints on, the prosecution said, and read: “To Rich, happy birthday and all the best my old man :) Benny xxxx.”

The victim's brother Richard Ziemacki gave a witness statement saying he had initially “not noticed anything unusual”, going by his messages and the card he received.

However, on reflection, he told police: “I do not recognise the handwriting as belonging to my brother,” adding that his brother would not have used the phrase “my old man”.

The senior investigating officer, Det Ch Supt Lewis Hughes, said: “This is a case of rarely seen complexity and scale, with detectives initially responding to partial human remains found deep within a secluded wood.

“But we said from the start that we wouldn't give up and the victim and their family remained at the forefront of our minds and actions throughout. We have been focused on both ensuring justice in this case, but also ensuring the victim could be returned to his family and laid to rest.

“We knew from the beginning that we had a family somewhere that would one day learn the most distressing news that a family could ever hear, and ultimately from that moment onwards our duty was to recover and identify the victim in a respectful and dignified manner and this was just as important as solving the case and catching the killer.”

Majerkiewicz will be sentenced at a later date.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Parties call for intervention after ACCC report found Australian grocers among most profitable in world amid cost-of-living crisis

The Coalition and Greens are renewing calls for Labor to embrace powers to forcibly break up supermarket chains such as Coles and Woolworths despite the competition watchdog shunning the idea in its review of the sector.

The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, challenged the government to allow supermarket competition laws – which include divestiture as a “last resort” – to be debated and passed when parliament returns next week for the pre-election budget.

But the government continues to resist the big-stick legislation, with the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, adamant the “risks outweigh the benefits”.

The political row over supermarkets reignited on Friday after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) published its final report into the sector.

The 441-page report described Coles, Woolworths and Aldi as among the most profitable grocers in the world, finding their margins had risen during a five-year period in which shoppers were struggling through a cost-of-living crisis.

Acknowledging there was no “silver bullet” fix, the ACCC made 20 recommendations, including to force the chains to publish all prices on their websites and allow online comparison tools to access the data to inform shoppers.

But it did not recommend divestiture powers, laws that could force Coles or Woolworths to sell off stores as punishment for price gouging.

The Coalition and the Greens were undeterred, forming a unity ticket to again call for the intervention, with Taylor saying it was “just wrong” that supermarkets weren't subject to “serious competition regulation”.

The Greens economic justice spokesperson, Nick McKim, said the ACCC's findings justified divestiture powers.

“Without laws to force more competition and make price gouging illegal, the supermarket duopoly will keep driving up grocery prices while raking in billions of dollars in profits,” he said.

But Chalmers said divestiture was not the answer, arguing, as an example, that if one chain was forced to sell a store it might just be bought by another big player.

“It's got hairs all over it, frankly. That's why it's not recommended on any one of the 441 pages of this report,” he told ABC TV.

Labor has accepted the report's 20 recommendations in principle.

The treasurer and the assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, said the government was taking “very significant steps” to crack down on supermarkets, which included its new food and grocery code and extra funding to the ACCC to police misleading pricing tactics.

Woolworths released a statement to shareholders on Friday morning saying it acknowledged the report and would “carefully consider” its findings and recommendations.

In the statement, Woolworths said it had “already taken action” on many of the ACCC's interim recommendations such as having “simplified” promotional programs and making specials clearer through improved ticketing.

The Woolworths Group chief executive officer, Amanda Bardwell, said the company welcomed recommendations that improved transparency for customers “where they don't have unintended consequences or increase costs”.

“Our experience, in store and online, is that the Australian grocery sector is very competitive,” she said.

In its response to the ACCC report, Coles also emphasised its claim that the Australian supermarket sector “is highly competitive”.

“Coles welcomes any recommendations that improve transparency for suppliers and customers but cautions against measures that will increase red tape and drive up costs,” the supermarket said. “We will review all of the recommendations in detail.”

The Choice chief executive officer, Ashley de Silva, said “ The ACCC's report confirms this is a highly concentrated market, with the major supermarkets appearing to be among the most profitable in the world during a cost of living crisis”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Indonesia's 1,700m Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki erupted for 11 minutes on Thursday, causing ash cloud but no damage to nearby villages on the island of Flores

At least seven international flights from Indonesia's resort island Bali have been cancelled, an airport official said on Friday, after a volcano in the archipelago nation's east erupted, shooting dark ash 8km into the sky.

Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, a 1,703m (5,587ft) twin-peaked volcano on the tourist island of Flores, erupted for 11 minutes and nine seconds late on Thursday, authorities said, raising the volcano's alert status to the highest level.

As of 9:45am on Friday, “seven international flights had been cancelled, six of them are Jetstar flights bound to Australia and one Air Asia flight to Kuala Lumpur,” Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport spokesperson, Andadina Dyah, said in a statement.

Several other flights – domestic and international, including to Thailand, Singapore and Australia – had been delayed, it said.

The local airport in Maumere, on Flores, the closest to the volcano, has not been affected by the ash, according to the transportation ministry.

“The ash column was observed grey to black with thick intensity,” Indonesia's volcanology agency said in a statement about the eruption, which began around 11pm on Thursday.

There were no reports of damages to nearby villages, but the agency warned residents of the potential for volcanic mudflow due to heavy rainfall.

The long eruption prompted the country's geological agency to raise the volcano's alert level to the highest of the four-tiered system.

Authorities imposed an exclusion zone between 7 and 8km (4 to 5 miles) around the volcano, the agency added.

In November, Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki erupted multiple times, killing nine people, cancelling scores of international flights to Bali and forcing thousands to evacuate.

Laki-Laki, which means man in Indonesian, is twinned with a calmer volcano named after the Indonesian word for woman.

Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific Ring of Fire.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Australia grew into the game against Indonesia and clinical finishing helped them to 5-1 before Tuesday's game in China

The Socceroos not only have their noses in front in the race for direct qualification to the 2026 World Cup, but they might just be timing their run to perfection as coach Tony Popovic makes his mark on the squad. With an emphatic victory over Indonesia on Thursday night, Australia now have their hopes of booking a ticket to the showpiece event in North America firmly in their own hands as results in Group C of the third round of Asian qualification continue to fall their way.

Australia first had to weather a storm that started brewing when a sea of red in the stands at Sydney Football Stadium belted out the Indonesia national anthem, then turned into an onslaught of intense pressing and all-out attack as the visitors set out to impress in their first game under coach Patrick Kluivert. A sharp save by goalkeeper Mat Ryan and a missed spot kick from Indonesia midfielder Kevin Diks kept the Socceroos hanging on, until Martin Boyle converted a penalty at the other end and Nishan Velupillay doubled the lead just two minutes later.

A 2-0 scoreline after 20 minutes was a barely believable reflection of how the opening stanza had played out but in the end the 5-1 result pointed to a ruthless edge that the Socceroos have been craving for years. The final margin was the most comprehensive of Popovic's relatively short tenure as the side finally clicked to tighten their grip on the critical second spot in the group behind runaway leaders Japan.

As clinical as the Socceroos were with their five goals coming from nine shots, while Indonesia found the net once from 11 attempts, the hosts had an unusually meagre 40% possession on home turf. The pattern was in stark contrast to the 12 shots to three, and 63% possession, that Australia enjoyed even when frustrated by Indonesia in a 0-0 draw in Jakarta last September.

Both teams have experienced a changing of the guard since then with Popovic taking over from Graham Arnold in the wake of that stalemate and Indonesia later parting ways with head coach Shin Tae-yong and handing the reins to Kluivert in January. Popovic has had six months to put his imprint on the Socceroos, while the longer the game went the more apparent it was that the Dutch great has had limited time with his charges.

Kluivert has arrived with a clear plan to play on the front foot but also carried a touch of naivety into his new role as Indonesia allowed the Socceroos to get the game on their preferred terms. With the visitors looking to dominate and push forward at any opportunity, Australia grew in confidence by turning back to the approach that so often works well against top-tier nations, and waiting to exploit the open spaces behind the Indonesia defenders with pace.

Partly due to an injury crisis in defence as much as Popovic's selection calls, the Socceroos had four starters in Sydney – Ryan, Aziz Behich, Cam Burgess and Jackson Irvine – who had also kicked off in Jakarta. Indonesia had six starters return from the previous meeting even amid their own aggressive naturalisation program. Craig Goodwin was relegated to starting among the substitutes with Velupillay handed a first international start up front alongside Adam Taggart and Martin Boyle, but with all four players – as well as player-of-the-match Irvine and Lewis Miller – having a hand in the goal rush there are signs that Popovic's grand plans are working.

“I aim quite high, so I'd say they're not where we want to be but that's not a negative, that's a positive,” Popovic said after the victory. “They're taking strides forward and it's not easy to do what they did tonight, five goals is difficult against anyone. We played a good opponent, it's a World Cup qualifier, we always want to get better and try to improve the game style. That will happen with more games together.

“Unfortunately with a lot of injuries, a lot of changes, it's hard to build that continuity, but what we are building is squad depth. This window is the first time I felt in training and just around the hotel that this group is now starting to build into something.”

The Socceroos remain one point ahead of third-placed Saudi Arabia, who beat China 1-0, as their resounding win over Indonesia has perhaps most crucially lifted them to a seven-goal buffer over their nearest challengers with three matches to play.

China are unlikely to play into the Socceroos' hands on Tuesday night in the same way that Indonesia did, when another win for Popovic's side could take them to the brink of direct World Cup qualification with Japan hosting Saudi Arabia at the same time. But there is little margin for error with a pair of crunch clashes against the latter two sides still to come in June. If Australia were to tumble to third or even fourth-place in the group, they would head to an all-too familiar fourth round of Asian qualifiers. While Popovic's side is improving with every outing that is a long and winding road to the World Cup that the coach will be keen to avoid.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

“Canada should respect the spirit of the rule of law and stop interfering in China's judiciary sovereignty,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.

Canada on Thursday “strongly condemned” China's execution this year of four Canadians over drug offenses, underlining its objection to China's use of the death penalty against its citizens, which was publicly confirmed the day before.

“Canada strongly condemns China's use of the death penalty, which is irreversible and inconsistent with basic human dignity,” Charlotte MacLeod, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, a government department that oversees the country's international relations, said in a statement Thursday.

MacLeod said Canada had repeatedly called for clemency for the Canadian nationals “at the senior-most levels.”

A spokesperson for China's embassy in Canada said in an emailed statement Thursday that China always imposes “severe” penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a “‘zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem.” It said the evidence against the Canadian nationals is “solid and sufficient.”

“We urge the Canadian side to respect the rule of law and China's judicial sovereignty, stop making irresponsible remarks, work in the same direction with China,” it said.

After news of the executions was reported Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters in Ottawa that she had been following the issue closely for months and that both she and then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had personally asked China for leniency. “We made sure to press on China how much we need to ensure that ultimately these Canadians would be safe,” she said.

She did not confirm when the executions happened but said she was in contact last week with a team in China and Ottawa that is supporting the families through “these difficult moments.” She has also been in contact with the families. Global Affairs Canada also continues to provide “consular assistance to the victims' families,” the department said.

Joly said she could not go into further detail because the families asked for privacy, but she confirmed that the Canadians who were executed were all facing “charges linked to criminal activities, according to China, linked to drugs.” She also said all four were dual citizens, though China does not recognize dual citizenship.

She told reporters that Canada will continue to “not only strongly condemn but also ask for leniency for other Canadians that are facing similar situations.”

Ottawa has opposed the death penalty for decades and avoids extraditing arrestees who could face the death penalty abroad, including in the United States. Canada “remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere,” Global Affairs Canada said.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning did not confirm the executions directly but when asked about them at a news briefing Thursday said: “Combating drug-related crimes is the responsibility of all countries. China is a country that upholds the rule of law. The law treats everyone the same regardless of nationality.” She said Chinese judicial authorities “handle those cases justly in strict accordance with the law,” including by protecting the defendants' rights and Canadian consular rights.

“Canada should respect the spirit of the rule of law and stop interfering in China's judiciary sovereignty,” Mao added.

China leads the world in executions, according to Amnesty International. Thousands are believed to be executed in the country every year, Amnesty said, but it noted that the complete extent of use of the death penalty there is unknown, as such data is considered a state secret. It's followed by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and the United States, in terms of the highest number of executions in 2023.

China maintains a strict policy against drugs, with punishments of a 15-year sentence, life imprisonment or death for the charges of smuggling or manufacturing large quantities of narcotics, including more than 50 grams of heroin or amphetamine.

But the country rarely executes Westerners.

In 2019, another Canadian, Robert Schellenberg, was sentenced to death after he was convicted of drug smuggling by a Chinese court. He was accused of being involved in a scheme to smuggle more than 200 kilograms of methamphetamine to Australia, but he has maintained his innocence and said he was a tourist enmeshed in a conspiracy by his interpreter. Canadian officials have condemned the ruling against Schellenberg, with Trudeau accusing China of “arbitrarily” applying the death penalty.

He was not among the four executed this year. Global Affairs Canada said Thursday that it continues to advocate clemency for Schellenberg and provide him and his family consular assistance.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Israel's military said it launched a ground operation along the coastal route in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, while local health authorities reported 85 killed.

BEIRUT — Israeli attacks killed scores of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, authorities there said, as troops expanded ground operations inside the shattered enclave and the Trump administration expressed its full support.

At least 85 people were killed, the Gaza Health Ministry said, and more were trapped under the rubble. The strikes brought the death toll over the past 72 hours to more than 500 people, the ministry said, 312 of them women or children. Israel said it had “eliminated” the head of Hamas's General Security Forces and its chief in its Khan Younis sector.

Hamas fired back with rockets for the first time since Israel resumed strikes on the territory this week, breaking an internationally mediated ceasefire, as the conflict threatened to return to all-out war.

Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, described the launches as retaliation for the “massacres against civilians.” The Israel Defense Forces said three projectiles were fired from Gaza. One was intercepted, the IDF said; the others fell in open terrain, causing no injuries.

Israel announced fresh ground incursions and threatened strikes elsewhere as the day unfolded. The IDF was operating in the southern city of Rafah and along the coastal highway in the northern city of Beit Lahia. Gazans were again prohibited from moving between north and south on Salah al-Din, the enclave's main road, a spokesman said. He warned residents in the southern municipality of Bani Suheila, where he said militants were firing rockets, to head west for their own safety.

Israel blocked all food, fuel and aid to Gaza more than two weeks ago. An estimated 70,000 Palestinians have fled Israeli strikes and the renewed ground offensive so far, deepening the misery of a shocked and exhausted population that has been displaced multiple times.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had warned Hamas there would be “hell to pay” if the militants did not release the 59 hostages whom they and other groups have been holding in Gaza since their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Of the 59,  24 are believed to be alive.

“The president has made it very clear that he wants all of those hostages to come home, and he fully supports Israel and the IDF and the actions that they've taken in recent days,” Leavitt told reporters in Washington.

Family members of the hostages have called repeatedly for a deal to secure their release. Many relatives expressed horror at the possibility that the resumption of fighting this week could further imperil their relatives. Protesters at demonstrations around the country have warned that time is running out to save those who are still alive.

Crowds tried to breach barriers near one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residences in Jerusalem. Police responded with water cannons and knocked a former member of parliament to the ground, local media reported.

The offensive is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release more hostages, Israeli officials said. They said Thursday that they had killed General Security Forces leader Rashid Jahjuh and Khan Younis sector chief Ayman Atsalih.

But Israeli and U.S. analysts said the likelihood of extending the ceasefire was low and the chance Israel would resume an all-out assault was soaring. Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior U.S. intelligence official, said the conflict was quickly barreling toward an end scenario of an Israeli military occupation of Gaza that would last months, if not years.

Netanyahu and other officials have vowed publicly in recent weeks to fully eliminate Hamas's influence. “The default is going to be an Israeli military occupation of Gaza,” said Panikoff, now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “There's nothing that says Hamas is ready for a new deal immediately, or that the Israelis are ready. Both the current Israeli government coalition and Hamas are in maximalist positions that do not have meaningful overlap.”

Itamar Ben Gvir, the leader of the far-right Jewish Power party, said this week that he welcomed Israel's return to “intense fighting” and would rejoin Netanyahu's coalition government ahead of a critical vote to keep it in power.

The return to war follows plans drafted over recent weeks that allow the army to escalate in phases to pressure Hamas back to negotiations, Israeli officials said.

At least six of the dead in Gaza in recent days were employees of the United Nations, officials said. An explosion at a U.N. guesthouse in Deir al-Balah on Wednesday killed a Bulgarian national and wounded five others. Five others have been killed since Tuesday, the head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency said Thursday, bringing the total since the war started to 284.

“They were teachers, doctors and nurses: serving the most vulnerable,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on X.

Israel recaptured part of the Netzarim Corridor that bisects Gaza and deployed an infantry brigade along the enclave's perimeter Wednesday, officials said. The ban on crossing the corridor Thursday sparked panicked discussions among Gazans about where, if anywhere, was safe. Many worried that if Israel besieged the north, they could again be separated on either side of the enclave indefinitely.

Ahmed was on the move Thursday trying to find refuge in Gaza City. He spoke on the condition that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy.

Ahmed, who returned to the north last month, was staying in a shelter on a road near the Netzarim Corridor. The area was the site of frequent violence during the war, and he feared it was unsafe now.

He had a lead on a clinic where he might stay elsewhere in Gaza City. But every move brings complications. He has spent the war trying to protect his two prized cars from airstrikes and thieves. Relocating his family was costly and dangerous each time.

Another resident, Ghadeer Ayoub, 33, said she had felt “constant anxiety” since Israel renewed its attacks. Her parents left Deir al-Balah at the start of the ceasefire in January to return to their home in Beit Lahia; she stayed to work. On Thursday, she said, they told her clearly: They would not leave their land again unless the north faces another ground invasion or a siege. It had been too difficult for them to get back there.

“It's not easy for them to leave their land,” she told The Washington Post by text. “They will stay in the north for as long as they can.”

But the thundering resumption of attacks moved more quickly than her parents had anticipated. Within hours, Ayoub said, they were grappling with what to do. “They can't make a decision,” Ayoub said.

Gazans could still move south using the coastal road, the IDF said Thursday, but some expressed fear they could be shot along the route.

“Maybe they could set up a tent in Gaza City, or somewhere else that's empty,” Ayoub said. But she was also grappling with where she might go if troops advanced toward her location. In Deir al-Balah, news footage Thursday showed long bread lines forming.

Loveluck reported from London. Shih and Berger reported from Jerusalem. Mohammed El Chamaa in Beirut and Lior Soroka and Shira Rubin in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

While the Wright brothers are widely recognized as the fathers of flight, Brazilians believe the true inventor of the airplane was one of their own.

PETRÓPOLIS, Brazil — Who invented the airplane?

Questions don't get much simpler. But in Brazil and the United States, the answer you'll get isn't likely to be the same.

In 1903, U.S. schoolchildren are taught, the Wright brothers piloted their Wright Flyer into the air in Kitty Hawk, N.C., and soared into the history books.

Brazilians hear a different story: that the true inventor of the airplane was Alberto Santos Dumont — commonly described here as “the father of aviation.”

For more than a century, ever since he steered his 14-Bis into the Paris sky in 1906, the country has been trying indefatigably to give their man his due, regardless of the academic consensus. Santos Dumont's mustachioed visage has graced Brazilian currency. One of Rio de Janeiro's airports is named after him. A replica of his airplane, piloted by a Santos Dumont look-alike, swooped through the Opening Ceremonies of the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Now Santos Dumont truthers have found a new and powerful champion: Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In his third presidential term, amid a slew of foreign and domestic crises, Lula has repeatedly found time to trumpet Santos Dumont, and even take a few swipes at the Wright brothers.

“I can't even pronounce their name,” he scoffed in July.

In comments to The Washington Post, the Brazilian president went further, delving into the minutiae of early 20th-century aerospace engineering and mourning what he described as the wrongful denial of Brazilian valor.

“Everyone knows that Santos Dumont was the first to make something heavier than air fly, in an autonomous way, without any assistance,” he vented. “But the Americans have the movie industry and were able to promote the Wright brothers.”

“It's essential to restore aviation history and duly attribute Brazil's role,” Lula added. “A nation needs to have values.”

While in many ways a harmless kerfuffle, the dispute raises important questions about nationalism, the stories countries tell about themselves — and the limits of any universal truth. In other words, both sides are dug in.

“This is a very Brazilian thing,” said Peter Jakab, an emeritus curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. “And in some ways, it's sad.”

“This is a typical American thing,” said Henrique Lins de Barros, a Brazilian physicist who has written three books on Santos Dumont. “If it's not them, it can't be anyone.”

So the question, again: Who invented the airplane?

In the spring of 1900, Wilbur Wright set out to find a windy location to test his aviation theories. “I'm afflicted with the belief that flight is possible to man,” he wrote a colleague, soliciting suggestions for a “suitable locality where I could depend on winds” to test his “flying machine.” His search ultimately led him to Kitty Hawk, on the North Carolina coast.

On its sand dunes 3½ years later, in winds that reached 27 mph, the Wright Flyer I rolled down a 60-foot rail and lifted off, carrying his brother Orville 120 feet. Three more flights were made that same day, the final one lasting nearly a full minute and traveling 852 feet.

“The airplane had been invented!” is how the National Air and Space Museum summarizes the moment.

Not so fast, Brazilians counter. How can the world be sure that this flight was legitimate, that the Flyer would have lifted off without a boost from Mother Nature?

“That was a region that was rich in wind,” said Rodrigo Moura Visoni, a historian of Brazilian aviation.

But the brothers weren't done. The next year, the Wrights' Flyer II pushed into the air in a field in Dayton, Ohio. And the year after that came the Flyer III. It achieved a flight that lasted for nearly 40 minutes and 24.2 miles — encouraging enough for the Wrights to propose the sale of the design to the U.S. government.

Because the Flyer II struggled to reach the air without Kitty Hawk's strong gusts, and because the Ohio prairie afforded less open space for a runway, the brothers used a catapult when testing their next-generation flying machines so they could quickly reach the velocity needed to achieve liftoff. (Though a few brief wobbly flights, Wright historians note, were apparently achieved by the Flyer II without the catapult.)

To Brazilians, the catapult should be disqualifying.

“They didn't take off on their own,” said Márcio Bhering Cardoso, the former director of the Brazil's national aerospace museum. “They needed help.”

Seconds Lula: “The help of equipment and tracks.”

Presented with these claims, Jakab, who has written or edited three books on the Wright brothers, could barely contain his exasperation. Brazil's “argument,” he said, “is so easily deconstructed it's not even really an argument.” He said it was “preposterous” to claim that the Wright brothers' flights didn't count because of a catapult. Navy jets, he noted, still use a catapult system when lifting off from short runways on aircraft carriers — and no one says they're not real planes.

Moreover, he said, the Flyer III sustained itself in the air for nearly 40 minutes.

“It's just patently ridiculous, on its surface,” Jakab said. “They're just trying to negate everything the Wright brothers did before 1906.”

That was the year Santos Dumont stepped out onto a field in Paris for a crucial test. The scion of a Brazilian coffee magnate had relocated to Europe, where he was famed for his debonair dress, fine dining habits — and aviation engineering. First came his affair with ballooning, and then the construction of his single-passenger airplane, the 14-Bis.

On that day in November, before a gathering of judges and reporters, Santos Dumont climbed aboard his plane and sped down the field. As a headwind bore down, according to historian Lins de Barros, the plane lifted off, traveling 722 feet.

“It took off by itself,” Lula said. “Without depending on external devices.”

At first, since the Wright Brothers had been toiling in relative obscurity, French aviators heralded Santos Dumont's flight as the world's first. Now, much to Brazil's distress, the French and most of the world look differently upon that day.

“There is no doubt,” said Marion Weckerle, the aircraft collections manager at France's Air and Space Museum, “that the Wright brothers flew before Santos Dumont.”

On a recent overcast day in the mountainous town of Petrópolis, about 40 miles northeast of Rio, a tall man of regal bearing stepped up to the house Santos Dumont built atop a steep granite slope.

As the aviator's closest living relative, Alberto Dodsworth Wanderley has spent much of his life steeped in the debate over who invented the airplane. He believes to his core that Santos Dumont deserves the credit, and has spent decades advocating that position. But now, at age 81, with his wife ill, he no longer thinks the argument matters all that much.

“What's the importance?” he wondered. “Will this dispute bring us anywhere?”

He walked through Santos Dumont's old home, now a museum. The inventor spent his final years here, horrified over the use of airplanes in war, before taking his own life in 1930. As Dodsworth Wanderley looked at the images of his great-uncle on the wall and the replicas of his inventions, word of his presence began to spread through the museum.

Soon, people were crowding around him. They were shaking his hand. Touching his arm. Asking to take his picture. Someone whispered that he was a celebrity. His visit was front-page news in the local newspaper.

“It's an honor to know you,” one person told him. “Your DNA is very important.”

“What a privilege,” said another.

In this throng, there was no doubt who invented the airplane. But it was more an act of faith than a matter of fact.

“It's now an ideological problem,” Dodsworth Wanderley said. “Pick your side and you'll find the arguments you need to stay there.”

The bloodletting between Alawites and forces backing Syria's new government surprised many. But tensions had been building since the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.

FAHIL, Syria — As the pickup truck carrying the body of the dead general wound through this mountainside village, residents lined the roadside. No one dared lift a phone to record. Officials from Syria's new government had decreed no videos, residents said.

The deceased, an officer from the ousted regime of President Bashar al-Assad, had been killed along with 15 others as government forces swept through the community hunting for weapons and “remnants” of the old regime.

The killings in late January came weeks before the recent eruption of violence in Syria's coastal region, which has left hundreds of people dead. But the events in Fahil and other villages like it were a portent, reflecting the often-fatal undercurrents roiling Syria. Now, the forces that overthrew Assad are trying to root out those still loyal to him, amid a communal thirst for retribution and justice, as well as deep-seated sectarian wounds.

Villages like Fahil that are home to members of the Alawite sect — an offshoot of Shiite Islam — often find themselves at the center of the violence. Assad's family belongs to the Alawite minority, and the sect's members formed the backbone of his brutal security forces. The soldiers now supporting interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa are largely Islamist fighters from the Sunni Muslim majority that opposed Assad.

The coastal unrest that flared this month did not come out of nowhere. An insurgency led by Assad loyalists had already been brewing, and its attacks against government forces prompted a large deployment of soldiers to crush the rebellion.

Sharaa has blamed Assadists for triggering the violence, while also acknowledging that the extrajudicial killings that followed represented “violations.” It remains unclear how much of this violence was committed by government security forces or armed factions that back the government, raising questions about how willing or able the government is to control the bloodshed.

The violence had been simmering since Assad's fall in December. In coastal areas, armed Assadist factions launched sporadic attacks on convoys and checkpoints. And in Alawite mountain villages, locals complained of kidnappings or, in the case of Fahil, extrajudicial killings during operations led by Syria's new security forces, though it remains unclear exactly who was responsible for the deaths.

Ghaith Mousa, 52, a former brigadier general, was the last of the 16 villagers to be buried in the graveyard in Fahil after gunmen swept through this community of about 6,000 in Homs province. Most of the victims had been officers in Assad's military.

Sectarian fault lines, however, cut deeply across the slopes below Fahil, where hillside roads lead to Sunni communities on the plains below.

Thirteen years ago, it was Alawite villagers in the area who were accused of one of the darkest chapter of Syria's civil war: the massacre of Sunnis in the nearby region of Houla. More than 100 people — mostly women and children — were killed. Babies wrapped in white funeral shrouds became one of the most indelible images of the war.

Some of the gunmen who went house-to-house in Fahil in January, dragging Alawite men to their deaths, were from Houla, said a local official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. He pointed out a spot in an olive grove on the outskirts of the village where nine bodies were found hours after the raids. Empty bullet casings were still strewn on the ground and the grass was reddened by blood.

“One hundred percent” the killings were related to sectarian fault lines of the past, he said.

It was around 8 a.m. when the convoy of SUVs and pickup trucks, some mounted with machine guns, arrived in Fahil amid a cacophony of gunfire, residents recounted.

Mousa's widow, Badiya Zaydu, 46, said she clung to the legs of one of the masked gunmen that entered her home, pleading for her husband to be spared. “I said my husband is innocent. He only served in one position, in an office — he never served on a front line,” she said.

The next time Zaydu saw her husband's face in was in a photo from the morgue, his beard clogged with dirt and blood.

“Under whose law can they kill him just like that?” she asked, sitting in a room filled with mourners, her face drawn and showing the toll of grief and sleepless nights. “If they suspect him, they should interrogate him and judge him.”

When Sharaa's militant group, Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham, came to power in December, he promised amnesty for those aligned with the Assad regime without “blood on their hands.” Reconciliation centers opened, and former regime soldiers and supporters, like Zaydu's husband, could hand over their weapons and be investigated to ascertain whether they had been directly involved in Assad's killing machine.

“We didn't worry too much because he'd done reconciliation, and he didn't have any weapons,” said Zaydu.

Alaa Ibrahim, a 33-year-old civil engineer was traveling by bus to Fahil to visit his family for the weekend when fighters descended on the village. He had never served in the military, having been exempted as an only son.

“Are you Alawite?” he was asked before being pulled off the bus at a checkpoint near the village, according to witness accounts provided to his family. His belongings, including his bag and identity documents were left behind on the bus. His body was found a day later near the checkpoint.

“Why did they steal the light from my eyes, the hope from my heart?” implored his father, Ghussan Ibrahim, 69, a retired English teacher, as his wife and two daughters wept beside him. “Now life for me is nothing. To kill him in cold blood with a pistol on the forehead. What did we do?”

As anger boiled in Fahil and the surrounding area, Sharaa dispatched an official delegation to the village the day after Mousa's funeral. The crowd, bundled up in black, filled the main street. Some stood on walls. They leaned over the sides of balconies. A man held up signs with the names of the dead and seven villagers who were still missing.

“Be peaceful,” a community leader instructed the crowd over a loudspeaker. “You can chant for a free Syria, and for the martyrs only.”

The crowd raised their voices in unison: “One, one, one, the Syrian people are one.”

Privately, some expressed their fears that Alawites don't have a place in Sharaa's new Syria.

Seven miles away on the Houla plains is the town of Taldou, the site of the 2012 massacre. Residents blame irregular forces known as “shabiha” from surrounding Alawite villages for carrying out the killings, as Assad's army looked on.

Most of the deaths here took place on a single street. One woman, Samira Suwaihi, recalled how the perpetrators killed 45 members of her extended family, mowing down dozens of people — relatives and visitors — in her living room.

Two gunmen dragged her husband outside and shot him before opening fire at the family watching from the window, she said. Her 6-year-old grandson dropped to the floor, gripping the gunshot wound to his neck. “He showed me the blood on his hand. He was trying to stand — he could not balance,” she said, adding that she managed to escape to the cowshed and hide.

So when the Assad regime fell, people in “the neighboring villages ... they thought we'd kill them,” said Nidal Abdulrazzak, 45, who lost his wife and three of his four children — ages 2, 4 and 7. “But religion and logic mean we are waiting for the law,” he added, saying the area had already lost too much.

But attitudes in Taldou have been hardened by war. “This is the time for swords,” reads a freshly painted sign on the local clock tower.

And not all feel as Abdulrazzak does.

“If you shoot a bullet, you can't expect kisses in return,” said Faisal al-Shaikh, who lost 14 relatives in the 2012 massacre, most of them women and children.

He gestured toward Alawite villages in the hills. “If only it was allowed, we'd flatten the mountains,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

“The Daily Show” host Jordan Klepper didn't hold back Thursday as he clowned President Donald Trump's administration for not being able to do a “classic DEI purge right.”

Klepper turned to an “ABC World News Tonight” report on the Pentagon's removal and swift restoration of a story on baseball icon Jackie Robinson's U.S. Army service. The move was part of the Trump administration's push to get rid of “diversity, equity and inclusion” in the federal government.

A senior U.S. military official told ABC News' Rachel Scott that the Pentagon uses digital software to scrub “DEI” content from its websites and the stories on the player that broke Major League Baseball's color barrier were “removed by mistake.”

Klepper didn't waste time mocking the Defense Department's explanation: “Oh, don't blame us. Blame our racist software. We should have never used ChatKKK. Classic mistake.”

He added that it wasn't the “most embarrassing anti-DEI flub,” however, before playing a clip noting photos the Pentagon flagged for removal because their file featured the word “gay,” which was reportedly the case with a snap of the Enola Gay aircraft — which dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II.

“That's how lazy they were with this, they just control f'd for gay-sounding keywords and deleted anything that showed up,” Klepper quipped.

“Now kids won't know about the Enola Gay, they won't know about transport planes, and they'll never hear about the heroic service of Captain Grindr McScissoring. Tragic. What's extra tragic is this could have all been avoided if they had just named the plane Enola Gay No Homo, you know?”

Constitutional law attorney Katie Cherkasky joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss President Donald Trump's DOJ moving to drop charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams and the Democrats praising the courts for pushing back against his agenda.

The Justice Department said Friday it is considering invoking the state secrets privilege in its ongoing court battle over the Trump administration's deportation flights to El Salvador, a tool that could allow them to withhold certain information for national security purposes.

In a declaration filed Friday morning, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg that he is aware of the Cabinet-level discussions invoking state secrets privilege. 

Invoking that privilege ""is a serious matter that requires careful consideration of national security and foreign relations, and it cannot properly be taken in just 24 hours,"" Blanche said. 

The declaration came after Boasberg had issued a Thursday deadline for the court to file information about deportation flights that sent Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador over the weekend, around the same time he issued an emergency court order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from doing so.

Boasberg said in a blistering order Thursday evening that the Trump administration both failed to comply with the noon deadline for information – even after he gave the administration the option to file the information under seal – and noted that the court was instead sent only a six-paragraph declaration from a regional ICE officer in Texas, who said that the Trump administration is considering invoking the ""state secrets privilege"" in the case. 

Boasberg decried that declaration as ""woefully insufficient,"" noting Thursday that regional ICE officers cannot be talked to inform the court of high-level Cabinet discussions and suggested someone higher up in the federal government should do so. 

Blanche's filing comes just hours before government attorneys are due in court Friday afternoon to testify before Boasberg in a hearing over their motion to vacate the case.

Boasberg noted in a blistering order Thursday that the government had ""again evaded its obligations"" in failing to submit materials he requested about the flights, even after he extended the deadline for them to do so and said they could file the materials under seal.

At issue is whether the government failed to comply with his emergency restraining order Saturday, which blocked the Trump administration from using a 1798 wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the gang Tren de Aragua, for a period of 14 days. Boasberg also ordered any flights in the air to return to U.S. soil immediately.

Hours later, however, a plane carrying hundreds of U.S. migrants, including Venezuelan nationals removed under the law in question, arrived in El Salvador. 

In the days since, government lawyers have refused to share information in court about the deportation flights, and whether the plane (or planes) of migrants knowingly departed U.S. soil after the judge ordered them not to do so, citing national security protections. 

Boasberg previously asked government lawyers to submit information on how many planes departed the U.S. on Saturday carrying people deported ""solely on the basis"" of that proclamation, how many individuals were on each plane, where the planes landed, what time each plane took off from the U.S. and from where.

Trowbridge's ‘cheese grater' benches have caused another stir in the town centre, after they were branded by mysterious and divisive stickers.

The new seats are part of the £16.3 million Future High Street Fund and have been installed along Castle Street and other parts of the town centre, sparking public debate and confusion among residents.

The street furniture, the benches in particular, has been hit with criticism and inspired bemused reactions, with some online likening the backless benches to ‘cheese graters'.

Public debate about the new street furniture launched them to the national media, and social media users frequently post photos of the benches with twists that show their creative side.

Now, photos of the benches in the town centre show a number of them have been branded with yellow, blue, and white stickers featuring a cheese grater, and the term ‘Trowvegas' emblazoned over the top of the graphic.

‘Cheese grater' and the mysterious term ‘Mexican Handbags' are also posted underneath.

The user commented: “There is no need to put derogatory stickers on the new town benches. The pigeons are leaving their mark. Isn't it enough that Trowbridge made the national news for the wrong reasons? It's just graffiti that will cost to have removed. Get a life. You want to complain about the cost of the benches? How much to troll the benches?”

The post sparked a number of different reactions, with people both supporting and criticising the unhappy reaction.

One commentor seconded the original poster's irritation, writing: “I do find it sad someone spent money on these stickers. Clearly a lot of time on their hands and thought it was a cool idea. I personally very much dislike our town being called Trowvegas.”

Another user wrote: “It's weird how people can actively hate a bench. They are designed to be sat on and they achieve that. The holes prevent water build up and allow them to dry quicker my only flaw is the colour of them.”

By way of explanation behind the stickers, another response to the post read: “How is this derogatory? Mexican Handbag refers to a wordplay game invented by Johnny Vaughan on his radio show. The person is riffing off the game.

""Johnny Vaughan, a radio presenter, and his team on Radio X often challenge listeners to think of alternative meanings for unusual terms or phrases, which they've dubbed ‘Mexican Handbags'.”

Another user believed that it was all part of some light-hearted fun, writing: “I think they're just having a laugh. I don't think it's that deep, it's just nice having something to smile at and have a natter about!”

According to the council, the total cost of the benches was £55,510, which includes the backless seats branded as looking like ‘cheese graters' at £22,510.

It also includes other furniture, complete with backs and arms, and the bins also installed at a total of £33,000.

The production company run by Gordon Ramsay has seen a dramatic surge in its turnover as its profit continued to climb during its latest financial year.

Humble Pie Productions, which trades as Studio Ramsay, has posted a turnover of £60.6m for the 12 months to 30 June, 2024, while it reported a pre-tax profit of £7.1m.

The figures compare to a turnover of £43.1m and pre-tax profit of £5.6m the company achieved in the 18 months to the end of June 2023.

The new results, which have been filed with Companies House, come after Gordon Ramsay's business reported a turnover of £7m and pre-tax profit of £226,459 in the 2021 calendar year.

After a joint venture was signed with Fox in September 2021, the business has been commissioned to produce shows including Trailblazers for the BBC, Gordon's Food Stars of Fox and Next Level Chef for both ITV and Fox.

The company said the commissioning of these shows has “significantly contributed to the significant increase in the turnover during the period”.

Gordon Ramsay's company, which has bases in London and Glasgow, added that the decrease in its gross profit margin, from 27 per cent to 18 per cent, was “driven by the increase in productions during the year”.

It also said that “the high margin achieved from the distribution and participation revenue streams have little or no costs of sale”.

The company's other productions include Gordon Ramsay's Future Food Stars, Gino's Italian Family Adventure, and The F Word.

In May 2024, City AM reported that Gordon Ramsay's restaurant empire made a turnover of £95.6m for the year to August 27, 2023, up from £78.9m.

The group's pre-tax losses also widened from £1m to £3.4m over the same period.

The group has an interest in 56 restaurants – 34 in the UK as well as 22 licensed locations in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

They include Gordon Ramsay's flagship restaurant, the three Michelin-starred flagship site in Royal Hospital Road, London, as well as the one-starred Petrus.

The group also counts three restaurants at the Savoy Hotel, which includes the one-starred 1890 by Gordon Ramsay, and two Lucky Cat by Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Mayfair and Manchester.

In July 2024, City AM also reported that Gordon Ramsay had teamed up with Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp to invest $100m (£77m) in HexClad, a maker of nonstick cookware.

The deal saw Studio Ramsay take a minority stake in the business. Michelin-starred Ramsay personally acquired a stake in US-based HexClad in 2021.

Conor McGregor deserves to fade into obscurity following his criminal acts, instead he's being paraded by Donald Trump as the face of Ireland on St Patrick's Day, says Maria Ward-Brennan

Once the most celebrated Irish sportsman, Conor McGregor is now one of the most hated – and he only has himself to blame.

There was a time when McGregor was in his prime as a MMA fighter, rocking up to press conferences, throwing out line after line, all while wearing suits that emblazoned f**k you.

He became a sensation for Irish sport, a big name across the Atlantic, and gave Irish people a sense of pride when draped the tricolour around him.  

But those days are dead.

Hundreds of businesses have ended their associations with him – supermarkets are no longer stocking his brands, the company that bought his Proper No Twelve whiskey will no longer use his name or likeness and even Ireland's National Wax Museum has removed his figure.

Even Ireland's National Wax Museum has removed McGregor's figure

For us ordinary Irish people, even the sight of his name evokes a sense of embarrassment. Unfortunately for us, that name was everywhere on Monday, thanks to his visit with Donald Trump.

Most normal people know that every action has consequences, especially when you do something wrong.

Yet instead of being punished for his appalling behaviour, McGregor is paraded around the White House on St Patrick's Day.

This is the same man who is fresh out of a civil courtroom in Dublin, where a jury ruled he was liable for sexually assaulting a woman. Nikita Hand claimed McGregor raped her in a hotel in 2018. A court ordered him to pay her over €248,000 (£206,000) and legal costs, estimated at €1.5m (£1.24m). He is currently seeking to appeal.

The same man who was caught on CCTV in 2019 punching an old man in a pub in Dublin. The Garda (Irish police) said they were investigating the matter, but no arrests were made. The video, released by TMZ, attracted much attention, prompting him to grovel and apologise.

He was also arrested in Florida in 2019 after he attacked a fan for taking a picture, but criminal and civil actions were dropped following an out-of-court settlement.

McGregor is someone who thinks rules are for others and not him.

He narrowly avoided jail last year over his continuing dangerous driving incidents in Dublin. He drives through the streets of Dublin, racking up dozens of traffic convictions – and, luckily, has avoided killing somebody so far.

However, in normal times, a person like this would fade into obscurity. But those are no longer the days we live in; if anything his criminality is boosting his appeal among a certain demographic.

This was bought into the spotlight on St Patrick's Day when he was fawned over at the White House, from meeting the US President, officials – and Elon Musk – to standing at the podium answering journalists' questions.

This was significant because St Patrick's Day is about much more than watching parades and wearing green. It is the time of the year when the Irish government pulls out all the stops for its ‘soft power' play. Ministers and State representatives are sent to 90 cities across 40 countries as part of a robust diplomatic push.

Traditionally, the Taoiseach of Ireland (Prime Minister), Micheál Martin, goes to Washington DC for a meeting with the US President to reaffirm our countries' historic ties and trading relationship.

After watching how the previous visitor, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was treated, Martin went for the ‘keep your head down' approach, which had mixed opinions from the Irish media.

But his official visit was long forgotten about amid Conor McGregor's comments that “Ireland is on the cusp of losing its Irishness” and that an “illegal immigration racket” was “running ravage on the country”. The Taoiseach had to come out to condemn his comments.

Many in Ireland expressed concern about such a man apparently representing their country in Washington, so much so that a new meme was born ‘Andrew Tayto' – he is Ireland's Andrew Tate.

Ireland does need to have an open and honest conversation about immigration – but it does not need this criminal to be its voice. He deserves to be forgotten about.

Mexico's Club Leon have been kicked out of the 2025 Fifa Club World Cup over multi-club ownership rules.

The 2023 CONCACAF Champions League winners Leon are owned by the same group – Grupo Pachuca – that owns fellow Mexican side Pachuca, who are also in this year's Club World Cup.

And due to rules banning clubs with the same owners taking part in the competition, Leon have been withdrawn.

A replacement has not yet been announced.

“Following disciplinary proceedings opened against CF Pachuca and Club Leon, the chairman of the Fifa disciplinary committee decided to refer the case directly to the Fifa appeal committee,” a Fifa statement read.

“Having evaluated all evidence on fire, the chairman of the Fifa appeal committee has decided that CF Pachuca and Club Leon failed to meet the criteria on multi-club ownership for the Fifa Club World Cup 2025.

“Fifa has determined that Club Leon will be removed from the competition, with the club to be admitted as a replacement to be announced in due course.”

It means the CONCACAF contingent currently sits at three teams – Monterrey, Seattle Sounders FC and Pachuca – with a replacement likely to come from the same umbrella of clubs that covers central and North America.

Grupo Pachuca owner Jesus Martinez said in December that he would be willing to sell a controlling stake in Leon if it meant them staying in the Club World Cup.

“We plan to give up the majority stake in the club [León] before 2027. However, I think we're going to maintain some kind of sports control. What we want is to contribute to the growth of the Mexican league, and if they see that multi-property can have a negative impact, we're willing to help in every way,” added Martinez.

Leon's first game was supposed to be against Chelsea at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The London club, Tunisia's Esperance de Tunis and Brazil's Flamengo will await their new opponent.

Fellow Premier League club Manchester City opens against Morocco's Wydad AC before matches against Abu Dhabi side Al Ain and Italy's Juventus.

, Forbes Staff. 

When Hurricane Milton slammed into Florida in October, peeling the roof off Tropicana Field like a ripe orange, the Tampa Bay Rays were left to scramble to find a stadium for the 2025 season. It ultimately took them just five weeks to announce their new home: Tampa's George M. Steinbrenner Field, a minor league ballpark and the New York Yankees' spring training complex.

Then came the real race against the clock.

The Rays had four months to get ready for Opening Day—and that meant much more than shipping some bats and balls across the bridge from St. Petersburg or redecorating the players' clubhouse. The team's 300 or so employees, needing a new headquarters, moved to a temporary office space less than a mile from the Trop and got to work rebuilding their ticketing infrastructure and coordinating with Major League Baseball to get Steinbrenner Field ready for national television broadcasts.

The Rays would also have to rejigger sponsorships—which, at best, typically take three months to come together, and sometimes years—to fit their new inventory of signage space. They would have to adjust to a new concessions operator, speeding up a process that took them a year and a half the last time they switched vendors, and decide whether they needed trailers or additional cold storage space. They had to figure out how to ship merchandise from their warehouse at the Trop and start planning for kiosks on the stadium concourse to compensate for the smaller footprint of the team stores. And they had to connect with a different city police department and county sheriff's office, plus a new fire inspector.

“It was almost like standing up a new business, frankly, in the span of a few months,” says Bill Walsh, the Rays' chief business officer. “Whatever the baseball analogy of building the plane while you fly it is, I think, is fair to say.”

The sprint to the finish will be next week. The Rays are not permitted to move into Steinbrenner Field until the Yankees move out, leaving only around 120 hours between the end of New York's spring training game on March 23 and the start of Tampa Bay's regular-season opener against the Colorado Rockies on March 28 (a matchup that was pushed back a day to allow for a little extra time). Those five days will be an around-the-clock rush by 50 workers from five companies as well as more than 80 team staff members to mount more than 3,000 signs and other marketing assets—not just corporate logos but also Rays-themed “see something, say something” and “watch for foul ball” placards. The giant “YANKEES” lettering plastered on each side of the stadium will be covered up, the pinstriped merchandise in stores swapped for Tampa Bay blue, and the security screening process ironed out.

There will be no avoiding a revenue impact this season as the Rays move from Tropicana Field—which has been configured to hold roughly 25,000 fans since 2018, with 54 luxury suites, and can be expanded to around 42,000—to a 10,046-seat minor league ballpark with 13 suites. That's more bad news for a franchise that ranked 27th (out of 30) on Forbes' 2024 list of MLB's most valuable teams at $1.25 billion, with estimated revenue of $301 million. But the Rays are confident that their busy offseason will minimize the disruption—and even lead to some new money-making opportunities.

Home Away From Home: The Rays will spend the 2025 regular season at Steinbrenner Field, the Yankees' spring training complex in Tampa, about 20 miles from their usual headquarters in St. Petersburg.

NEW YORK YANKEES/GETTY IMAGES

This situation isn't entirely unprecedented for Tampa Bay, which had to shift its spring training home to Orlando in 2023 after its facility in Port Charlotte was damaged by Hurricane Ian. And other pro teams have had to make unexpected moves at the last minute. For instance, Covid-19 travel restrictions forced the Toronto Blue Jays to move for 2020 and parts of 2021 to Buffalo, New York, and Dunedin, Florida, where their minor league affiliates usually play. Fifteen years earlier, the NBA team then known as the New Orleans Hornets and the NFL's Saints temporarily relocated in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

But that history does little to mitigate the challenge facing the Rays, who learned relatively quickly that 35-year-old Tropicana Field could not be repaired before the end of the 2025 season. Wanting to stay in the region, they struck a deal with the Yankees, reportedly for $15 million, although insurance is believed to be covering at least some of that fee.

In a bit of lucky timing, Steinbrenner Field recently completed a two-year renovation, but even so, “it's not turnkey,” Walsh notes. For instance, more room had to be created to accommodate major league umpires and players' families, and the stadium's lighting had to be improved. Tampa Bay also had to cover the costs of upgrades to a practice field on the property that will now serve as the home of the Class A Tampa Tarpons, Steinbrenner Field's usual summer tenant.

In perhaps the most conspicuous change, MLB altered the Rays' schedule to prevent conflicts with the Tarpons and with the NFL's Buccaneers, who play down the street at Raymond James Stadium, and to avoid the rain that tends to drench the region in the summer months. Tampa Bay will play 19 of its first 22 games at home and be on the road for 69 of 103 to end the season.

But the Rays, who have played home games under a dome since they made their MLB debut in 1998, also see playing outdoors as a chance to experiment with their business. They expect to add fireworks to their game-day experience and can now sell sponsorship space on the tarp used during rain delays, as well as video-board spots that pass the time until the game can resume. Air conditioning will be a major draw for Steinbrenner Field's suites, and Orlando Health, which became the Rays' official healthcare partner coming out of the pandemic, will place branded sunscreen and hydration stations around the concourse to combat the summer sun.

That attitude of turning lemons into lemonade permeates the organization—and occasionally covers other kinds of fruit. “Our sponsors kind of understood, ‘Hey, I'm not going to get an apple, I'm going to get an orange, but I like oranges, too,'” says Walsh, acknowledging that Steinbrenner is a much smaller facility than the Trop to adorn with company logos. While some marquee ad placements—such as the outfield wall or behind home plate—are comparable, other relationships have required a different mix of signage or hospitality offerings, or an accommodation in the form of a deal extension or deferred payment.

The Rays have installed LED boards around Steinbrenner to carry more ads, and their sponsorship team also had an all-new perk to dangle thanks to the field's location: signage outside the stadium facing Dale Mabry Highway, one of Tampa's busiest streets.

“Those eyeballs on our brand and impressions are such an easy way for us to prove ROI,” says Orlando Health senior director of sports partnerships Ultima Espino, adding, “I think I was prepared to be more nimble than I really had to be.”

Orlando Health's investment in its sponsorship is roughly flat from last year, and that isn't uncommon across a Rays portfolio that has seen a retention rate perhaps even better than usual. “Very close to all folks have indicated a path forward to get everything transferred over, and some folks have even stepped up and done more,” Rays vice president of corporate partnerships Anthony Rioles says. “And for the very few handful of folks that for one reason or another made sense for us to take a slight break this year, it's not full stop—we're keeping the long-term relationship intact.”

Tampa Bay had to go through a similarly painstaking process to adapt its ticketing for the 2025 season, starting with reassembling its customer history within Tickets.com's management system. The Rays had already completed their season-ticket renewal process by early September, so they had to figure out how to transfer those fans to a new ballpark configuration.

“We sat down in a group of eight or 10 of us—for many, many hours each session—and literally manually moved dots on the map into what we felt would be the most comparable location,” Walsh says. “And then we invited those folks to view that location and either accept them or decline.”

The Rays ranked 28th in MLB with average home attendance of 16,515 last season, but even that relatively small step-down to Steinbrenner Field's capacity would translate to a revenue loss of more than $14 million over a full season, assuming the average ticket price held steady, according to Forbes estimates. The inevitable result of the scarcity: Tickets are more expensive this season. Walsh says it would be too difficult to come up with an average increase—“I think we have 25 or 30 different pricing codes,” he says, and single-game tickets went on sale only recently—but the Tampa Bay Times found one fan whose season package was rising 39%, to $26,325.

Despite that jump, the Rays' season-ticket base is larger than it was last season, and 45% of those fans are new this year, Walsh says. Tampa Bay also created new types of partial-season plans and even rethought its strategy around giveaways. For one thing, it is planning to hand out items that could be useful outdoors, such as hats and sunglasses. More importantly, the team is shifting its promotional calendar from a “peak on peak” model—trying to make attractive matchups even more desirable—to one that emphasizes games that might otherwise be more difficult to sell.

Quick Turnaround: During the Rays' first trip to Steinbrenner Field this year, for a spring training game against the Yankees, they were the visitors. Across five days next week, they'll move in as the home team.

“That was another area that was leave no stone unturned,” Walsh says. “I don't think we coasted on anything, really, in any aspect of the business.”

This massive effort may be for just this regular season—but it could be for longer. There has still been no decision made on where Tampa Bay would play postseason games this year, and while the front office is generally operating under the assumption that the Rays will be back at Tropicana Field next season, that future is somewhat uncertain as well.

An assessment in November found that the St. Petersburg City Council could repair the Trop for roughly $56 million in time for 2026's opening day, but the Rays, who have been seeking public funding for a new ballpark for years, have voiced complaints that the plan would cover “only the bare minimum” and indicated that the stadium has sustained additional damage in the months it has remained without a roof.

Longer term, the outlook is even murkier. In September, the Rays announced an agreement with St. Petersburg and Pinellas County for a public contribution of roughly $600 million toward a $1.3 billion ballpark to replace Tropicana Field, which is now among MLB's oldest stadiums and widely considered one of the worst major pro sports venues in North America.

But after an offseason of sniping between the team and city and county officials—much of it ostensibly over delays in the process and potential cost overruns—the Rays withdrew from the project on March 13. It called to mind an earlier deal for a new stadium in the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa, which met a similar end in 2018 when Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg abruptly said the plan was no longer viable. (A year later, he made a bizarre proposal to split the season between the Tampa Bay area and Montreal.) In recent days, the Rays have floated the idea of a more significant Tropicana renovation that could extend the ballpark's lifespan by 10 years, although it was immediately met with skepticism by Mayor Ken Welch of St. Petersburg.

A permanent solution is clearly a priority for MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, who has publicly expressed support for keeping the Rays in the region while saying the team's stadium situation must be solved before the league can fulfill its goal of adding expansion franchises. Last week, the Athletic reported that Manfred and other team owners were pressuring Sternberg to sell the Rays.

It's one more hurdle for Tampa Bay's business executives, but few front offices have had as much practice dealing with adversity.

“We have a culture here of embracing opportunity through disruption,” Walsh says. “That's part of our culture and part of our DNA. The [2025 season] is perhaps a different scale and a different timeline, but the muscle memory for many of us remains similar, and it's just about finding opportunities through the differences.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

Marc Filippino, Chris Giles and Peter Foster

PublishedMarch 21 2025

This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘UK races to avoid Trump tariffs'

Marc Filippino Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, March 21st, and this is your FT News Briefing. Nato is considering how to move on from the US, and the UK is racing to avoid Trump's tariffs. Plus, the Federal Reserve used to be the leader of global monetary policy. 

Chris Giles There is a phrase which is that if the US sneezes, the UK catches a cold. 

Marc Filippino Bless you. But that seems to be changing. I'm Marc Filippino and here's the news you need to start your day. European countries are working on plans to replace the US in the Nato alliance. That's according to FT sources. The UK, France, Germany and the Nordics are some of the powers putting their heads together. The idea is to increase military investments to match most of what the US spends now. But that would take like five to 10 years. US diplomats have been telling their European counterparts that President Donald Trump is committed to staying in Nato, but he's been sceptical of the alliance, and European countries want to find a way to fill the financial void in case the US does pull out. 

[MUSIC PLAYING] 

The US and the UK are negotiating a trade deal, although it wasn't exactly Britain's choice. The idea is to strike an agreement that prevents US President Donald Trump from imposing tariffs on UK imports. Here to explain where things stand is the FT's public policy editor, Peter Foster. Hey, Peter. 

Peter Foster Hey, good to be with you. 

Marc Filippino So how significant is this trade deal that they're talking about? 

Peter Foster The trade deal in and of itself is not that significant. It's quite a narrow deal they're trying to fix around AI, tech co-operation, etc. But the real value of this deal is that it might avoid or at least reduce or dilute the feared tariffs, which Trump has threatened to bring in from April the 2nd across the world on any measures that the administration considers to be unfair or inimical to US companies trading abroad. 

Marc Filippino All right, so what's on the table for this deal? What could the Americans potentially get out of it? 

Peter Foster One of the things that the US wants to get rid of is the digital services tax. That's a tax that was introduced in order to try and stop Big Tech companies from doing business in countries and not paying any tax. That tax worth about 800mn to the UK Treasury. The UK Treasury's pretty cash strapped at the moment. So we know that that is one of the areas that the US is demanding on, and which the UK, for now, is digging its toes in on. 

Marc Filippino What about the UK? Would it get anything out of the deal besides, you know, avoiding tariffs? 

Peter Foster Well, that's a pretty big besides because it's pretty clear that the White House is going to go hard after Europe. And so for Labour, the idea that we get a sweetheart deal with Washington, that we can avoid the worst of tariffs, that's going to be a victory for Keir Starmer. And it will vindicate his belief that the UK can have a strong relationship both with US in Washington and with Brussels. Of course, that's not without its risks, because if the US demands too much from Starmer, that could have two effects. One is he could give away things like the digital services tax that are popular with British voters and will make him look like he's kowtowing to Donald Trump. 

There's also a risk that if he gives too much to Washington to get this deal, that then that causes problems with his relationship with the EU. And of course, the UK is also trying to reset its post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. And so Starmer's trying to walk a delicate line here, trying to walk a balance, try to avoid things that are going to make his life difficult, both with his party at home and with his relationship with the EU. 

Marc Filippino Where does this trade deal ultimately leave the relationship between the countries? Do we still have, you know, that special relationship that Winston Churchill called it? 

Peter Foster Yeah. The old special relationship. It leaves it in a very delicate place. I think the trouble is going to come when the price of a deal with the US starts to crystallise. And so this idea that we're all talking, we can all be friends comes to a dead stop, potentially, when either we say, nope, we just can't accept the US demand to get rid of our digital service tax, or we make concessions to the US that make life very difficult with the EU. And so the question, I think, is just where the balance is going to land and frankly, how hard the US is prepared to push its demands. The US has or is defining tariffs incredibly broadly. So it's not just that there's a straight tariff on a particular good. It's anything that might be construed as inimical to trade. So that VAT is one of the areas that they're looking at. And so in that sense everything is on the table. 

Marc Filippino Peter Foster is the FT's public policy editor. Thanks so much, Peter. 

Peter Foster My pleasure.

Marc Filippino It was kind of a uniquely boring week in the land of central banks. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England all met, and they all kept interest rates on hold. But if you zoom out, there's a bigger change happening in global monetary policy right now. And it has to do with whether the Fed is still leading the way for other central banks. Here to explain this divergence is the FT's economics commentator Chris Giles. He also writes the newsletter Chris Giles on Central Banks. Hi, Chris. 

Chris Giles Hey, Marc. 

Marc Filippino So give us some details here. How different is the Fed's current monetary policy than other central banks? 

Chris Giles Well, the Fed's got its interest rates at between four and a quarter and four and a half. And it's held those there for a little while now. But what it really is the Fed's on pause because it's not clear which way interest rates should go, whereas other central banks — it's quite unusual — are doing their thing. So the European Central Bank is cutting rates. The Bank of England is also cutting rates, but it's been going much more gradually. The Bank of Japan is in a rate-rising cycle. So you can see that in the big advanced economies, things are, you know, going in quite different directions in different places. 

Marc Filippino Right. So we've got this basically scattered mishmash of central bank monetary policy around the world. But before that it was much more synchronised and the US was leading the way. Why was that, Chris? 

Chris Giles I think it's because essentially the US, it was always and always has been the most important economy in the world, partly because of its size, mostly because of size, and because other countries are more open to trade than the US is. And its trends tend to affect and tend to be similar to other countries' trends. There's a phrase which is that if the US sneezes, the UK catches a cold. And that's just exactly the phrase that says that you are not as divorced from the US as you might think you are, because even though you're running an independent monetary policy, independent government policy, actually most governments are doing roughly the same thing at roughly the same time. 

Marc Filippino So how did that change? Why is the Fed no longer leading the way on monetary policy? 

Chris Giles Well, I think the key reason is that the conditions are different. If you take the two big advanced economies of the US in the Eurozone. Whereas in the US, inflation is sticky and is going in the wrong direction, just not terribly badly, but it is going in the wrong direction. It's going up again. And the economy slowing so you're getting a whiff of stagflation there. In the Eurozone, it's all pretty much on the downside. So the economy has been weak, but inflation really does look as if it's pretty much under control. So it's only a question of how much and how quickly does the European Central Bank need to cut rates. So you can see that the Fed is there sitting, you know, nervous about which direction even interest rates should go next, whereas the ECB has got quite a clear path ahead. 

Marc Filippino What does this mean for the Fed's position on the global stage, given that it typically is the leader among central banks? Does it need to get back to that place? 

Chris Giles On one level, the US — and the US has run monetary policy — always in the interests of the US and the US alone. It's just that now, when the US administration, it's not really what the Fed is doing. When the US administration is so different from the rest of the world, and then other countries are having to react to that, that it means that sort of by default, the Fed is no longer leading the way for monetary policy. So there's a lot of thinking going on now about how you can arrange your affairs without necessarily the Fed being or the US being part of it. And then people might like to put their money in a very stable area called the Eurozone. 

Marc Filippino Chris Giles is the FT's economics commentator. Thanks, Chris. 

Chris Giles Thanks, Marc.

Marc Filippino Before we go, yesterday we told you about the International Olympic Committee's presidential election. Well, it happened and the new president is sure to make a splash. It's Zimbabwe's two-time swimming gold medallist, Kirsty Coventry. Coventry is currently the country's sports minister and will be the first female president of the IOC. She officially takes over in June.

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve provided relief to markets on Wednesday as the central bank continued to project a path for two interest rate cuts in 2025. But the one-day stock rally didn't hold on Thursday and Friday, reflecting the feeling among many market strategists that the main issues plaguing the stock market over the past month have remained largely unchanged.

22V Research president Dennis Debusschere told Yahoo Finance that now that markets are through the Fed meeting, the focus will shift back to President Trump's tariffs and the possibility of reciprocal duties.

And figuring out how any of those policy plans could impact corporate profits this year is ""absolutely what the market's been struggling with"" amid the S&P 500's (^GSPC) recent 10% decline, per Debusschere. This struggle was front and center on Friday too, as both Nike (NKE) and FedEx (FDX) stocks dropped after the companies warned that looming economic headwinds such as tariffs could weigh on profits this year.

The market's tariff concerns have many layers. There's the question of which companies will be impacted by tariffs. There's the question of which companies could be impacted by counter-tariffs. And then there are further questions on how any potential price increases in some industries could also raise prices for other products. Broadly, there are fears that the answers to all of these questions could weigh on consumer spending and economic activity as a whole.

All of this has led to jerky market action as investors struggle to price in a moving target. As of now, the bulk of President Trump's tariff plans have been delayed until April 2. In a social media post on Wednesday, Trump described April 2 as ""liberation day in America.""

But exactly what will happen remains an open question for markets.

""Until we get to April 2, we're kind of sitting and waiting for some direction and for some clarity,"" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance.

Kantrowitz argued that policy uncertainty was the leading factor in the recent market sell-off, as that unknown has now clouded the outlook for the Federal Reserve and potentially for corporate earnings. Typically, Kantrowitz said, markets would want more clarity on the initial catalyst that sparked the sell-off before moving higher.

""Usually, [when] the primary catalyst that stops becoming a problem, essentially, that allows the market to find its footing,"" Kantrowitz said.

But the S&P 500's 10% fall into correction territory wasn't all about investors selling stocks that could see earnings impacts from tariffs. Largely the index has been weighed down by a rerating of the most popular trade of the past two years, with the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks having their worst quarter compared to the S&P 500 since 2022. 

Morningstar's chief US market strategist David Sekera described the recent market action as a ""bear market in artificial intelligence stocks."" Given large-cap tech's outsized position in the S&P 500, some strategists are concerned further downside in those stocks could send the S&P 500 into its own bear market.

""A key reason we have been forecasting a slump in the S&P 500 in 2026 is an assumption that fading enthusiasm for AI would prompt a valuation-driven slide in the index then rather than in 2025,"" Capital Economics chief markets economist John Higgins wrote. ""Accordingly, it is possible the bursting of the AI bubble is just happening sooner than we had envisaged.""

Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk held an impromptu company all-hands Thursday night, giving an update on the progress of a number of products while also attempting to assuage fears that the CEO is ignoring his post.

Tesla stock has been in free fall since the start of the year, with sales slipping in key regions like Europe and China and even in the US. Though the changeover to the new Model Y SUV has been seen as a drag on sales, Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe has seen Musk — and Tesla's brand — suffer. Protests both in the US and abroad at Tesla showrooms are growing, as are acts of vandalism on Tesla EVs.

After delivering some opening remarks and a few quick updates on Tesla's milestones, such as 7 million EVs produced and the new Model Y's status, Musk addressed the elephant in the room: blowback to the Tesla brand from Musk's foray into politics and leadership of the President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative.

Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action.

""If you read the news, it feels like Armageddon. I can't walk past a TV without seeing a Tesla on fire,"" Musk said, referencing protesters setting Tesla vehicles on fire at dealerships and vandalism at Supercharger locations. ""I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable.""

Musk and Attorney General Pam Bondi have labeled the attacks as domestic terrorism, with Bondi claiming swift retribution was coming for the perpetrators.

Overall, Musk maintained that the news was ""good"" for Tesla and urged employees and others to hold on to their Tesla stock because, in his eyes, the future is bright.

""Autonomous Teslas will be everywhere. In five years probably we will have regulatory approval, I think globally, so you will have autonomous Teslas on every continent taking people on trips, and almost the entire fleet — which will pass 10 million vehicles next year — is capable of full autonomy,"" he said.

The bet on robotaxis and autonomous driving is one of the key catalysts for Tesla's future growth, and Musk again laid out his audacious vision. However, the company is a long way from that future, with the latest news that California issued a preliminary permit for Tesla to begin ride-hailing testing with a driver, and only with employees.

Key to the company's autonomous vision is the Cybercab robotaxi, slated for production in 2026. Musk said the factory was already beginning preparations for production using its ""unboxed"" assembly technique, which would resemble a ""high-speed consumer electronics line,"" rather than an automotive production line.

""The line will move so fast that people can't even get close to it — I think it'll be able to produce a car, ultimately, in less than five seconds,"" Musk added.

Speaking of future product production, Musk said Tesla built the ""first Optimus at the Optimus production line in Fremont,"" adding that the humanoid robot would be available for sale in 2026, initially to Tesla employees, after internal company use.

""This year, we hopefully will be able to make about 5,000 Optimus robots,"" Musk said, with a goal of 50,000 robots in 2026.

""But since it's a totally new product, everything is totally new. I will say we are succeeding if we get half of the 10,000, but even 5,000 robots, that's the size of a Roman legion,"" Musk said.

Turning back to the here and now, Musk predicted the Tesla Model Y — the company's most important current product — would once again be the top-selling car in the world following its new update.

Softness in data points like new car registrations and Musk's time in Washington has hit Tesla stock hard — which is down around 50% since hitting highs in late December.

""It's very difficult for people in the stock market — especially those that look in the rearview mirror, which is most people — to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million-vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,"" Musk continued. ""So what I'm saying is hang on to your stock.""

Musk's call to hold on to Tesla stock follows Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's eyebrow-raising call earlier this week to buy Tesla shares on a valuation call.

Nevertheless, Wall Street bulls are relieved to see Musk back at Tesla, at least for now.

""Challenges clearly remain for Musk and Tesla to navigate this volatile period but last night was the first step in doing this for employees, shareholders, and partners,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note Friday morning. Ives had called for Musk to address some of these issues earlier this week.

""Brand is key to Tesla, and it's very important to make sure the current brand crisis does not morph into a permanent black eye for the Tesla brand,"" Ives added.

Oops, something went wrong

Volatile times in markets require extra precision, says Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin.

In a new note on Friday, Kostin offered three recommendations for investors dealing with topsy-turvy markets ahead of the spring:

Own US stocks ""insensitive"" to drivers of ongoing market volatility.

Favor stocks with a high percentage of US sales and avoid companies with outsized overseas sales.

Own second-derivative AI stocks; for example, those in the software services sector.

Several well-known stocks that exhibit these characteristics include Costco (COST), Kroger (KR), Eli Lilly (LLY), Visa (V), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and Alphabet (GOOG), Kostin said.

The markets have whipsawed this year, especially in March as investors digest a flurry of tariff headlines and slowing economic data. Warnings on demand this month from big companies Nike (NKE), FedEx (FDX), and Delta (DAL) have added to the investor angst.

""The current environment, however, is adding uncertainty to demand. We continue to work closely with our customers to help them adapt to this evolving market,"" FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said on a Thursday evening earnings call.

Watch: How to trade the Mag 7

A sell-off in the popular ""Magnificent Seven"" names — led by noted double-digit percentage drops in faves Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) — has also dented sentiment.

Year to date, all three major stock indexes are in the red. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) has led the way lower with an 11% decline. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) are down by 2% and 6.3%, respectively, this year.

The average decline for the three in March has been 5%.

Investors have sought out perceived safe havens.

Consumer staples — companies that sell soda to those offering healthcare services and energy — continue to attract their fair share of inflows as traders seek out businesses less tied to economic cyclicality.

The iShares US Healthcare ETF (IYH) is only down 2% in March, but top holdings Merck (MRK) and Amgen (AMGN) are each up about 2.5% in the month. The ETF is up 5% year to date.

The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) — comprised of key US utilities like Duke Energy (DUK) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — is up about 0.3% in March. It has advanced 4% on the year.

""In a moment where we've got uncertainty from policy and tariffs and things like that the markets are reacting. It was to be expected,"" Edward Jones CEO Penny Pennington told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above). ""So what we are saying to investors is, let's put in place a plan — a good plan is better than a bad prediction.""

Pennington recommends leaning into portfolio diversification as markets enter mid-year.

Oops, something went wrong

New York Federal Reserve president John Williams on Friday stressed the uncertainty of the US economic outlook, saying he expects lower growth this year amid a lot of unknowns about the impact of new trade, fiscal and immigration policies.

""It's hard to know with any precision how the economy will evolve,"" Williams said in a speech at the Macroeconometric Caribbean Conference in the Bahamas.

""Uncertainty is high, and there are many scenarios that could play out, depending on fiscal and trade policies and geopolitical and other developments.”

The comments came after the Fed held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Powell raised eyebrows on Wednesday when he said his ""base case"" is that any higher inflation from tariffs will prove transitory, reviving memories of the Fed's slow response to inflation coming out of the pandemic and sparking questions of whether the Fed could repeat the same mistake.

But Williams said Friday it's unclear about whether the effects prove to be transitory this time around, noting that it really depends on the different circumstances and the details.

""Tariff direct effects might be short-lived, but we have to be looking at more at what's happening in the economy...and kind of adjusting our view on the path of policy based on what we're learning along the way,"" Williams told Yahoo Finance during a media availability Friday.

To bolster his point about the uncertainty ahead for the economy, Williams on Friday noted that the range of Fed officials' new estimates for GDP growth are between about 1-1/2 and 2 percent. For inflation, the range wisbetween about 2-1/2 and 3 percent, noting that any of those are possible.

Williams anticipates lower immigration will constrain the increase of workers in the job market, putting a damper on growth. And while inflation has continued on a ""bumpy path"" toward the Fed's 2% goal, he noted the future is highly uncertain.

The New York Fed president characterized the current level on the Fed's benchmark interest rate as “modestly restrictive,” noting that the current range of 4.25%-4.5% is “entirely appropriate” given the “solid” labor market and inflation still running “somewhat” above their 2% goal.

Though he also stressed, “measures of policy uncertainty have increased sharply in recent months.”

Williams also addressed short-term inflation expectations, which have risen considerably in the wake of President Trump's proposed tariffs.

Williams acknowledged the increase in expectations, but noted “there are no signs of inflation expectations becoming unmoored relative to the pre-pandemic period.”

Elsewhere, this week the Fed announced it will slow the rate with which it lets Treasury securities roll off its balance sheet to $5 billion, down from $25 billion starting next month. Williams emphasized that the decision to slow the runoff “is a natural next step to smooth the transition from abundant reserves to a level that is somewhat above ample.""

He added, “this action has no implications for our intended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the medium term.”

The yield on the 10-year Treasury has dropped since the Fed's balance sheet announcement. Retaining more Treasuries, means more demand, pushing down yields.

Oops, something went wrong

Disney (DIS) stockholders stood by the company's participation in a controversial rating system that evaluates how it treats LGBTQ employees, consumers, and investors — doing so even as the company backs away from some diversity programs.

Disney becoming the fourth such case this year where investors pushed back against anti-DEI proposals at prominent companies. Other anti-DEI proposals were voted down at Apple (APPL), Costco (COST), and John Deere (DE).

Investors on Thursday rejected a proposal from the conservative group, Free Enterprise Project, that would have required Disney to reconsider its participation in the Corporate Equality Index (CEI).

The index, published each year by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, became a popular tool over the past two decades for companies to assess their inclusion of people who identify as LGBTQ.

The system, which grew from 319 corporate participants in 2002 to 1,449 in 2025, evaluates companies on a scale of 0% to 100%, taking into account their workforce LGBTQ protections, benefits, culture and social responsibility, and behavior towards the community.

Disney has received a perfect score on the CEI since 2007.

The vote rejecting a reexamination of Disney's CEI participation comes after Disney backed away from other diversity policies as political heat around the issue intensifies across corporate America.

The company last month joined a growing list of businesses that have removed or altered diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives after President Trump issued two executive orders aimed at undoing federal DEI programs within the US government.

According to the company's latest 10-K filing for the full year ending Sept. 30, 2024, it did away with two DEI programs previously listed under its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion section of its report.

The nation's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), announced a similar move on Friday.

In a memo to staff, JPMorgan chief operating officer Jennifer Piepszak said the lender was changing the word ""equity"" to ""opportunity"" in a organization previously known as ""diversity, equity & inclusion.""

Piepszak also said the company would reduce diversity-oriented trainings, and integrate initiatives that the former group handled into its human resources and corporate responsibility departments.

""We remain committed to our core principles, which includes our belief in the power of a diverse workforce that strengthens our business and attracts and retains the best talent,"" she said in the memo.

""We've always been committed to hiring, compensation and promotion that are merit-based; we do not have illegal quotas or pay incentives, and we would never turn someone away because of their political or religious beliefs, or because of who they are.""

The latest guidance issued Wednesday by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is that certain DEI-related employer practices may be illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that outlaws employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, or sex.

The US Justice Department joined one of two documents published by the EECO saying employees should file charges if they believe they've been subjected to DEI-related discrimination.

Employment law experts from Seyfarth advised companies to take note.

""Employers whose current or recent DEI practices may be implicated...should consider conducting privileged reviews of their current DEI initiatives,"" the firm's lawyers said.

""While not every DEI initiative is at risk, the [guidance] reflects the EEOC's focus on unlawful DEI programs and foreshadows its upcoming enforcement and litigation efforts.""

The issue of DEI is a widespread thus far during 2025's shareholder meeting season as investors vote on a variety of measures that could change how their companies operate. Both champions and critics of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies have been sponsoring proposals to either bolster or diminish those policies.

So far, in addition to the latest vote at Disney, none of these proposals have garnered support from investors at Apple (APPL), Costco (COST), and John Deere (DE).

That's not expected to change as more votes are tabulated at more company shareholder meetings, according to experts who follow these votes.

""I don't expect this year that we will see many, if any, get majority support,"" Elizabeth Bieber, head counsel for shareholder engagement and activism defense at Freshfields, told Yahoo Finance earlier this Month.

This year's early surge in anti-DEI measures could be a signal that opposition proposals are on the rise, Bieber said.

It could also lead to a rise in dueling DEI proposals going to a vote within the same company, as happened in February at John Deere (DE). Deere shareholders voted down both pro-DEI and anti-DEI measures.

""DEI, as of last year, is certainly one issue where companies were receiving [proposals] on both ends of the ideological spectrum,"" Bieber said

So far, neither pro- nor anti-oriented measures have gained much majority support. In fact, Bieber said, support levels among S&P 500 companies dropped for both pro- and anti-DEI proposals over the last couple of proxy seasons.

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

In politics, the vibes are everything. They cost Biden's successor the election and helped Trump throw the Democrats out of power. But as the ""vibecession"" taught us, we will complain about prices and jobs while spending big and going to work.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell demonstrated this week that the political lesson of the vibecession isn't to shove economic data into people's faces and expect them to change their minds.

But the takeaway also isn't to downplay solid indicators just to placate a negative mood. There's a way to acknowledge public perception — and even validate it — while also waiting on more objective metrics to tell a more complete story. Something to keep in mind as we get March's reading of the Consumer Confidence index on Tuesday.

Your gripes are real, Powell seemed to say, but in the new context of an economic slowdown and tariff inflation, where fear of the unknown is driving panic, they can also be a distraction.

“The relationship between survey data and actual economic activity hasn't been very tight,” Powell said at the Fed's press conference earlier this week. “There have been plenty of times where people are saying very downbeat things about the economy and then going out and buying a new car. But we don't know that that will be the case here.”

Powell reassured the market the economic picture is sound, even as he left room to acknowledge that anxiety might be the appropriate response. And, further, that the sentiment may turn into something more sinister at a moment's notice, given the nature of data lags.

Central bankers do care about the soft data of consumer sentiment surveys and business testimonials and monitor them closely. We've written about how important expectations and sentiment are in this very column many times — including this week. But their role is a yellow light and not a red one.

“We are obviously aware of the softening sentiment data and high uncertainty,” Powell said. After all, expectations about inflation can be self-fulfilling. Trying to reassure Americans that prices will remain stable is core to the Fed's mission. Managing the vibes is Powell's job.

But the central bank is mostly waiting for signs of weakness to migrate from the surveys and into the hard data of prices and jobs. And Powell emphasized the Fed can afford to wait.

As pessimistic surveys and Wall Street commentary bring the potential of another round of price hikes and deteriorating growth to everyone's attention, unemployment is still low. And projected to stay low, even with the Fed's own downward GDP adjustments.

If April arrives and, with it, pricing pressures and job losses, the Fed can step in. Otherwise, Powell and his colleagues risk getting ahead of themselves. While investors have the ability to buy in or sell out at a moment's notice, the Fed and its crude tools have the agility of an oil tanker. Changing course will require more conviction in the economy's direction.

Expecting worse outcomes isn't a dark omen in itself. So, in the face of tanking sentiment, the central bank is choosing restraint.

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said he isn't expecting tariffs to hurt the company's financial outlook. During a press briefing following his keynote at Nvidia's GTC 2025 event, the executive explained that he believes his company's supply chain is agile enough to withstand the threat of a duty on chips.

""I think in the near term, based on what we know, we're not expecting significant impact to our outlook and our financials,"" Huang said.

President Trump has threatened to levy upwards of 25% tariffs on chips manufactured outside the US, putting companies like Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and others at risk of having to either eat some or all of the increased costs of bringing their chips to America or pass it on to their customers.

But Huang said Nvidia's network of suppliers is nimble and distributed among a number of countries, which could help the company deal with tariffs.

""They're kind of distributed in a lot of places, and it depends on what gets built, what gets purchased in the United States, and where [is] the final destination of the product,"" Huang explained. ""And so, there's just a whole lot of equations involved and it depends on which country gets tariffed.""

Over the long term, Huang said he wants to increase Nvidia's manufacturing capacity in the US.

""The simplest way to think about that is our agility is terrific today, missing onshore manufacturing,"" the CEO said. ""If we add onshore manufacturing by the end of this year, we should be quite good.""

Nvidia, like many chip giants, relies heavily on Taiwan-based TSMC (TSMC34.SA) to build its hardware. And while the semiconductor manufacturer has a massive presence in its home market, it's building new facilities in the US and abroad.

In early March, the company announced plans to increase its investment in the US from an already announced $65 billion to $165 billion. The additional $100 billion, the firm said, will go toward the construction of three new fabrication plants, two packaging facilities, and an R&D center.

Still, TSMC has to provide capacity to a number of customers, meaning it won't be able to allocate all that new manufacturing capability to Nvidia's needs.

In addition to tariffs, Nvidia is dealing with the threat of increased US export controls on chips headed for the Chinese market. The moves come after China's DeepSeek revealed that it developed its V3 and R1 models using Nvidia's below-top-of-the-line chips, raising fears that the country could outpace the US in AI advancements.

	A small clinical trial suggests the treatment could help keep pancreatic cancer from returning

With the help of an mRNA vaccine, the immune system can learn to spot pancreatic cancer cells (shown in a false-color scanning electron micrograph) in the body.

3 hours ago

A new mRNA vaccine could prevent pancreatic cancer from returning — potentially for the long haul.

In a small clinical trial, some patients who received the vaccine remained cancer-free for more than three years, researchers reported February 19 in Nature.

That is “pretty remarkable,” says Aaron Sasson, who directs the Pancreatic Cancer Center at Stony Brook Medicine in New York and was not involved with the work. Despite facing a notoriously lethal cancer, these patients lived “a lot longer than we would have otherwise expected,” he says.

The new research, which is still in the proof-of-concept stage, suggests that a cancer vaccine strategy could one day offer patients a long-lasting treatment option. 

The results come amid recent news that officials at the National Institutes of Health are telling scientists to avoid mentioning mRNA vaccine technology in grant applications. It's a move that could significantly hamper the advancement of mRNA vaccines in cancer research and patient care, Sasson says.

Unlike a traditional vaccine — such as the annual flu shot — which helps our bodies ready defenses for future viral encounters, this type of cancer vaccine acts therapeutically, after someone has already developed cancer. It works by teaching patients' immune cells what pancreatic cancer looks like. Those educated cells can then seek out and destroy tumors. This approach is part of a growing field of cancer immunotherapies that enlist people's own immune systems in treatment.

Dozens of similar cancer vaccines are in the works. Researchers are testing the new mRNA cancer vaccine in melanoma and colorectal cancer as well as other vaccines in even more cancers. Excitement about this technology has been brewing in the cancer vaccine field, says Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City who led the recent pancreatic cancer vaccine trial.

He hopes the work could offer a blueprint for developing effective vaccines against even more types of cancer. Science News spoke with Balachandran and Sasson to understand how cancer vaccines work, the future of the field and why some researchers are focusing on pancreatic cancer.

Doctors already have a set of therapies for treating pancreatic cancer. The problem is, they just don't work very well, Sasson says. “A lack of effective therapy has really plagued the field.”

Diagnosing pancreatic cancer can be tricky; it kills more than 450,000 people globally every year, so patients often learn they have the disease at an advanced stage. The pancreas is a flattened, pear-shaped gland tucked away inside the body, behind the stomach. That makes it difficult for doctors to manually check for lumps, unlike breast cancer. And some symptoms, such as weight loss and fatigue, aren't obvious clues that someone has the disease.

Current treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and drugs that attack cancer cells. Nevertheless, the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is around 13 percent, meaning that five years after diagnosis, 87 out of 100 patients will have died.

“If you're diagnosed with pancreas cancer,” Sasson says, “the odds are extremely high you're going to die from pancreas cancer.”

Sponsor Message

Cancer vaccines may extend patients' lives and are part of an expanding class of therapies that harness our bodies' own defenses to fight disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved dozens of such immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, which rev up the immune system; therapeutic antibodies, which help the immune system spot cancer; and T-cell transfer therapy, which involves supercharging a patient's own immune cells.

The common thread here is the immune system, Sasson says. “Our immune system is a very, very efficient killing machine.”

Cancer vaccines like the one Balachandran's team is testing, which was jointly developed by the biotechnology companies BioNTech and Genentech, take a different approach. They show patients' bodies a tiny, nonfunctional piece of their tumor, serving as a Bat-Signal for the immune system. In response, the body produces immune cells called T cells that can recognize cancer as something that's not supposed to be there — something that's to be destroyed.

The cancer vaccine works similarly to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but instead contains instructions for building cancer proteins rather than coronavirus proteins and is given after the disease develops, rather than before. There's another major difference: The cancer vaccine is personalized for every patient.

“Each individual tumor has a unique combination of genetic mutations,” Balachandran says. To create the vaccine, doctors first surgically remove a patient's tumor and analyze its DNA for genetic errors. Some of these errors produce mutant tumor proteins, which the immune system can recognize like red flags warning danger. Patients receive a personalized vaccine containing RNA sequences that encode those red flags, Balachandran says.

This process teaches patients' immune systems to be on the lookout; when immune cells see the red flags, they know it's time to strike. Your body makes “these cells that can recognize the cancer, kill the cancer, and last in the body for long periods of time” in case the cancer ever comes back, Balachandran says.

In a small clinical trial involving pancreatic cancer patients, the vaccine spurred a strong immune response in eight out of 16 participants, generating a legion of red flag–targeting T cells. Balachandran's team reported those results in 2023. At the time, the prevailing wisdom was that “you could not teach the immune system to recognize pancreatic cancer,” he says.

Many scientists thought pancreatic cancer did not create enough red flags to alert the immune system. The team's results challenged that view. Scientists now know that the cancer produces these red flags — and they can identify them, build a vaccine around them and use that vaccine to grow an army of T cells that hunt for pancreatic cancer.

But an effective cancer vaccine requires more, Balachandran says. “Not only do you need to make the cells, but the cells need to last and retain function long-term.” His team followed the 16 patients for up to about four years; all had undergone surgery and subsequently received an immune checkpoint inhibitor, their personalized vaccine and a standard chemotherapy regimen. Of the eight people who mounted an immune response to the vaccine, only two saw their cancers return. In contrast, seven of the eight who did not respond saw their cancer return after about a year.

“It's a big deal,” Sasson says, because it suggests the vaccine can generate immune cells that patrol the body like guard dogs even several years later.

Balachandran can't say for sure why the vaccine didn't work for everybody, though it's possible the spleen may be involved. Some patients had their spleens removed prior to vaccination. The organ is part of the immune system and helps generate immune responses. Without it, the immune response to the vaccine may be weaker.

He and his colleagues are now enrolling patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering and other sites around the world in a larger trial to test whether the vaccine is safe and effective.

	A taste for silky shark versus stingray may drive migration behavior

Smaller fish surround this great hammerhead shark. The sharks' taste for different foods might have a surprising conservation impact. 

Annie Guttridge

By Melissa Hobson

11 hours ago

Great hammerhead sharks are known for their long migrations, but scientists have now discovered that some individuals in the Bahamas instead spend all year snacking without leaving their plentiful and protected home waters. Why would some individuals take off if others are happy to stay put?

The answer to this mystery might be their favorite foods, researchers report March 21 in Frontiers in Marine Science.

Great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) have been recorded making 3,000-kilometer journeys between Bimini, the Bahamas and offshore Virginia. But tracking tags and tissue samples from hammerheads in Andros, Bahamas, reveal that the country, designated as a shark sanctuary in 2011, could be more than just a part-time haven.

“Resource availability is a key driver,” says shark ecologist Tristan Guttridge, founder of the marine nonprofit Saving the Blue, which does most of its research in Andros. “But why don't all of them stay if food is so abundant?”

Food choices could influence hammerheads' travel habits, in the same way that you can be surrounded by pizza joints but still drive across town because all you're craving is a poke bowl.

From 2018 to 2024, 78 hammerheads were observed or captured. Scientists measured and took tissue samples from 22 of them and put satellite tags on seven. Although some sharks made long-distance migrations away from the Bahamas, as is typical for the species, others stayed in Andros year-round.

When Guttridge and his colleagues analyzed where atoms in the sharks' tissue came from, they found that different sharks prefer different prey. One hammerhead munched on silky sharks for nearly two-thirds of its meals, while others chowed down on mainly barracuda and stingray. 

The different habitats of these fish — silky sharks are largely found in the open ocean while stingrays tend to live on the seabed and barracuda can lurk in both environments — could indicate the types of places where the sharks are feeding. “We found evidence of individual variation in their diets, so deciding whether to stay or go might depend on what they feed on,” Guttridge says.

As these critically endangered animals migrate across immense distances, they can travel into waters where they're at risk of being harmed or killed by industrial fisheries. “The global population of great hammerheads is thought to have reduced by more than 80 percent over the last three generations,” Guttridge says.

Understanding hammerhead diet preferences may help protect the long-distance travelers. “Although some individuals reside year-round in protected waters, others do not, emphasizing the need for international collaboration on conservation efforts for these mobile species,” Guttridge says.

	In Memory Lane, two psychologists lay out the vagaries of how we remember

A new book proposes that human memory is like a Lego tower, built from the ground up, broken down, put away and rebuilt each time it's called to mind.

Memory LaneCiara Greene and Gillian MurphyPrinceton Univ., $29.95

There are countless metaphors for memory. It's a leaky bucket, a steel trap, a file cabinet, words written in sand.

But one of the most evocative — and neuroscientifically descriptive — invokes Lego bricks. A memory is like a Lego tower. It's built from the ground up, then broken down, put away in bins and rebuilt in a slightly different form each time it's taken out. This metaphor is beautifully articulated by psychologists Ciara Greene and Gillian Murphy in their new book, Memory Lane.

Perhaps the comparison speaks to me because I have watched my kids create elaborate villages of Lego bricks, only to be dismantled, put away (after much nagging) and reconstructed, always with a similar overall structure but with minor and occasionally major changes. These villages' blueprints are largely stable, but also fluid and flexible, subject to the material whims of the builders at any point in time.

Memory works this way, too, Greene and Murphy propose. Imagine your own memory lane as a series of buildings, modified in ways both small and big each time you call them to mind. “As we walk down Memory Lane, the buildings we pass — our memories of individual events — are under constant reconstruction,” Greene and Murphy write.

In accessible prose, the book covers a lot of ground, from how we form memories to how delicate those memories really are. Readers may find it interesting (or perhaps upsetting) to learn how bad we all are at remembering why we did something, from trivial choices, like buying an album, to consequential ones, such as a yes or no vote on an abortion referendum. People change their reasoning — or at least, their memories of their reasoning — on these sorts of events all the time.

Modern dilemmas also come up, such as whether fake news and deepfake videos have particular sway over our memories or even create false ones. Don't panic, the authors write. Digital fakes can influence memories, sure. But so can written stories, gossip from a neighbor or a leading question from a cop. “We don't need to generate technophobic fears of a digital future where our memories will be distorted — our memories can already be distorted very effectively by nondigital means.” The sentiment is alarming, but also strangely comforting.

Greene and Murphy offer another comforting message again and again: Our memories are fallible and flawed, but these slips are features, not bugs. These imperfections are a product of a flexible memory system that allows us to learn from the past, plan for the future and respond to unexpected events. Forgetting may make our brains more efficient by jettisoning extraneous fluff so we can focus on the important memories. It may even keep us happier by allowing time to ease the sting of painful experiences, the authors write. “Instead of attempting to force your memory to be something it is not, we advocate accepting it just the way it is — flaws and all.”

	Common coot nests preserve layers of plastic dating back decades

Biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra excavates a common coot nest he and colleagues collected in Amsterdam. City birds have been making their nests out of plastic waste for decades, the team's research shows.

One man's trash is a common coot's treasure, at least when it comes to plastic.

In Amsterdam, the birds have been constructing nests out of plastic food wrappers, masks and other waste for at least 30 years, researchers report in the February Ecology. The revelation shows not only how much plastic now litters the environment but also the power of using human-made products to learn about the natural world.

“It's ironic to think that many of these plastic single-use items have just been used for minutes by people, yet these coots have used them for decades,” says Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands.

Hiemstra has been studying nesting materials used by city birds for years. He's documented coots adding face masks to their nests during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — a building material that coots and other birds still use — and found rebellious magpies and crows that built their homes out of antibird spikes. Many birds these days use human trash as nest-building material, Hiemstra says.

In 2021, Hiemstra and colleagues excavated a common coot (Fulica atra) nest built on a wooden beam poking out of Rokin canal in Amsterdam. The nest had multiple layers of plastic waste, especially food packages. By analyzing the expiration dates on the coots' collection, Hiemstra used the plastic the way an archaeologist would use fossils, to build a history of the nest layer by layer.

Coots typically build their nests out of plant material that quickly decays, so the birds can't reuse nests year after year. With the incorporation of plastics, however, the nests become much more stable, so the coots can return to old nests and build upon their solid foundations.

In total, Hiemstra's team found 15 nests that had plastic dating to multiple years, indicating the birds had been reusing them.

Using expiration dates to understand nest history can be imprecise. Since plastic lasts so long, old pieces of it can find their way into recent nest layers. For instance, Hiemstra found a bag of paprika chips from a 1970s brand toward the top of one nest. But when packages with similar expirations are bunched together, Hiemstra says, it builds confidence that that part of the nest was constructed around that time.

In the deepest part of the Rokin nest, he found several wrappers dating to the early 1990s, including a Mars Bar wrapper promoting the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

“Weirdly enough, the wrapper is in pristine condition, as if it were littered yesterday,” Hiemstra says. “Yet you know it is 30 years old. It really shows plastic is here to stay.”

The Neurosurgeon Who Advised Severance Breaks Down Its Science

A neurosurgeon who has acted as a consultant for Severance explains the science behind the show's brain-altering procedure—and whether it could ever become reality.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Naeem Amarsy & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Today we're talking about the science of Severance.

What if instead of struggling to find work-life balance, you could completely separate your professional identity from your personal one? That question kicks off the Apple TV+ show Severance, which just wrapped up its second season.

In the world of the show, a company called Lumon Industries requires certain employees to undergo its “severance” procedure, which its spokespeople say means you'll never have to take work home with you again. It also means you have to get a microchip implanted into your brain.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

To help make the procedure and its effects as realistic as possible, the folks behind Severance brought on a real-life neurosurgeon to consult on the show. Vijay Agarwal is chief of the [Division] Skull-Base [and Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery] [and Director of Brain] Tumor Center at Montefiore Einstein [Medical Center]. We sat down with him to get the inside scoop on the science of severance.

Before we get into that chat, just a brief spoiler warning: we did our best to avoid any super-specific spoilers for recent episodes, but we'd recommend waiting until you've watched at least episode seven of season two before listening.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Vijay Agarwal: Yeah, my pleasure.

Feltman: So tell me how you got involved with the show Severance and what that's entailed.

Agarwal: You know, it's sort of hard for people to believe, but it really was just a call out of the blue. Just one day at work I got a call that they were looking for someone for a concept for a show that hadn't come out yet. That was pre-COVID, in a very different world ...

Feltman: Right.

Agarwal: Than we live in now. And it was just as simple as that. It was just a thought at that stage—you know, “We wanna develop a procedure that implants a chip that separates your work life from your social life, from your everyday life.” And we were off to the races.

Feltman: Yeah. What were your initial thoughts and reactions when you first heard that premise?

Agarwal: I thought it was a very cool concept, and I think I just directly went into how that could be a reality. You know, one of the things that Ben Stiller was really strict on was that he wanted this to be as believable as possible ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: As real as possible. There are some sort of creative allowances that happen as part of this process, but he really wanted the science to be real and to be believable, and I think that's part of the reason that people have really bonded with the show and in particular the science.

Feltman: Yeah, well, that's a great segue to my next question, which is: What are some of the, the real science concepts and, you know, factual medical procedures that you've baked into the concept of the severance procedure?

Agarwal: I made a statement a while ago that I don't think we're far off from things like this happening, and I really firmly believe that. And we're actually much closer than when I made that statement.

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: So if we had told somebody a few years ago that we would be implanting electrodes in the brain to stimulate the brain to treat people who are paralyzed and allow them to be able to walk again or treat their obsessive-compulsive disorder, their addiction, their severe suicidal depression, obesity, things like that, we would think people are crazy, but those things are actually happening currently in science. And almost every major academic center around the world is doing these sorts of procedures every day, in particular to help people with diseases like Parkinson's disease. And so it seems like a very science fiction-type concept, but it's part of our everyday life as neurosurgeons and neuroscientists.

Feltman: Well, and can you walk me through, you know, in creating the concept for the severance procedure, where did you sort of pepper in factual details, you know, for example, the placement of the chip?

Agarwal: I actually think that that scene is very, very realistic.

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: And so we—I borrowed from the science and the surgeries that we do today, even. So some of the navigation equipment that we use, I had that equipment shipped in. And so when I started, it really was just a concept: “How do we develop the severance procedure? How do we ‘sever' people?” Then we sort of developed the science, and I remember very—in the early days of the show sitting at a, you know, a big conference table with Ben and Dan [Erickson] and a lot of the producers, and we just had a whiteboard in it, and we would just spitball concepts ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Until we found one that was, you know, really believable and the one that people liked and the one that Ben thought would fit with his vision.

And so we really implant in an area that is able to process memories but, interestingly, associates those memories with emotion. It's the amygdala and hippocampus, so those sort of middle part of the structures, on the left side of the brain, which is the dominant side of the brain for most people. So what a great area to stimulate to really facilitate this ability to separate our “innies” from our “outies”: number one, the ability to process memories, but then, number two, the ability to, to associate those memories with emotion. So that was a perfect place to do it. And then, actually, the procedure was very realistic. So how we put the hole in the skull, the needle with which we use to implant the chip, those are things that we use every day in neurosurgery and neuroscience currently.

Feltman: And you actually appear on camera to do the procedure, is that right?

Agarwal: Season one, episode two—so when we implant the chip in Helly. So we really designed that set. So, you know, Ben had a very specific vision in mind, and then our goal was really to try to make that vision become a reality. And so everything was important on that set, from the scientific accuracy to the lighting to the cinematography. And so it was all specifically laid out to capture a purpose. And so that's the episode that I appeared in and very proud with the, the way it came out.

Feltman: Yeah. So just to really spell out the actual neuroscience here, which I think is so cool, in your mind—pardon the pun—what is that chip doing in there, in that part of the brain?

Agarwal: As I mentioned before there are se—multiple companies trying to do something on a different scale, which is trying to stimulate the brain to alter the way that it functions: so Elon Musk's Neuralink; a lot of my friends are working on this technology at different centers around the country; Synchron is another company based out of New York that's trying to do something similar in terms of being able to modify the function of the brain by inputting electrical stimulation.

And Elon, he gave a talk at one of our recent neurosurgery meetings, and he's compared the brain to a big circuit board. And then he likened the work that they're doing with Neuralink is really adjusting the electricity that's going into the circuit board to modify the way that it fires, to change the way that it fires and really dictate how that circuit board functions to make your computer run a certain way, your TV run a certain way. And I think that's really the best way to look at what we're doing in the severance procedure.

If you look at the brain as, as one big computer, if you change the way that you, instruct the computer to function by really changing the way you're putting electricity in, by firing all of these neurons across the brain, you can really affect the way that your brain processes or pulls memories from its memory bank—and then also to potentially modify what emotions are associated with those memories as well.

And that's what the amygdala and hippocampus does: so the amygdala is very famous for fear responses and things like that, very profound emotion. And if you followed season two, I think this concept of fear and these really dark emotions are really prevalent in this season. And so when—one of the recent episodes, where we follow Cobel going to where she grew up, it's a very kind of dark, fearful episode. And so that's exactly the type of brain and the emotions that we're trying to conjure, is the stimulation of this amygdala and hippocampus.

Feltman: Yeah, speaking of season two—I mean, back in season one, we were introduced to this concept of “reintegration,” where the severed consciousnesses kind of come back together, and we've seen a lot more of the messiness of that process in season two. Did you weigh in at all on what that might look like from a neuroscience perspective?

Agarwal: Yeah, so I was actually on set for a lot of that work in terms of the reintegration, just to make sure that work was being done well. I worked with Adam Scott, who plays Mark, on some of the things, such as, in one of the recent episodes ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Agarwal: He had a seizure, and I thought he did an absolutely brilliant job portraying that, and, you know, it really shows sort of the academic stint a lot of the actors and Ben take in the show; I think Adam Scott and Ben Stiller in particular really look at this as almost homework, to try to really understand it. And so I helped Adam, and I was, you know, send—texting with him after that episode because I was just so proud with how that seizure came out. It was, you know, it was very realistic, and that's a hard thing to capture.

So we worked on that, and then the reintegration procedure, I had a lot of input with how that would work—you know, what sort of science would go into something like a reintegration procedure—so I remember sending and reviewing ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Articles from the literature about being able to do things that would be likened to reintegration or to really enhance things like electrical stimulation. We were able to use almost like a transmagnetic stimulation-type device. We were able to really use very realistic scientific methods to incorporate into this reintegration.

Feltman: Yeah, and for listeners who don't know, could you talk a little bit about what TMS is and how it relates to what we saw in that reintegration episode?

Agarwal: Yeah, transmagnetic stimulation, it's an amazing technology, and it's basically putting these magnetic fields into the brain to alter the way that your brain fires. And there's very good data to show that people who have become paralyzed can regain some functionality—so some ability to move—in areas that are either weak or paralyzed.

And so there's a lot of different uses for transmagnetic stimulation, and it's delivered very similarly to the way that we saw in one of the earlier episodes, where Reghabi is reintegrating Mark in his basement. And so there's actually, today in society, transmagnetic stimulation medical spas ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: That you could go to to receive this very intense therapy. And so there's a lot of people who feel that this is really gonna be a major advance for us to use against things like paralysis and depression and things like that.

Feltman: Yeah, that's super interesting.

Speaking of reintegration we've seen some random acts of basement neurosurgery [laughs] in this season. From a neurological standpoint what kind of risks would someone like Mark be facing in that situation?

Agarwal: I think there was a bit of a red herring—so in one of the earlier episodes this season, where Reghabi was reintegrating Mark, you could see, as she was delivering this transmagnetic-type stimulation on the left side of the brain, his right hand start to shake ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Really the left side of the brain controlling the right side of the body. And so the same risks that we saw, namely seizure, which we saw him have a very sort of total body seizure, those sorts of things would be a big risk. So bleeding in the brain: the brain didn't—doesn't like anything sort of entering into the brain or disturbing the brain; it's about a 1 percent risk of what we say is hemorrhage. Infection: so there being a big infection in that area, that's also a possibility. But I think irritating the brain is one of the most common side effects of a procedure like that. And when the brain is irritated, oftentimes it'll manifest by seizing ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Which means really firing electrons abnormally in the brain, which is what we saw.

Feltman: So we've talked about season two a little bit and about fear and, and emotion in memory. Obviously, in one of the kind of biggest and most impactful episodes of season two, we saw a character who seemed to be severed many times over and have this, like, very compartmentalized consciousness and was experiencing a lot of emotions that were then cut off when they emerged from, you know, that area of the floor they were on. How much more complicated do you think that would be than sort of a standard severance floor chip behavior we've seen so far?

Agarwal: You mean in real life?

Feltman: Yeah.

Agarwal: I think it would actually be less complicated ...

Feltman: Oh, yeah?

Agarwal: So currently, right now, there's these amazing videos—people who wanna go to YouTube and see this, they can—these very amazing videos of people with Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disease, and oftentimes one of the biggest symptoms they have is uncontrollable shaking. So we actually, as part of the standard of care of treating these patients, we'll put electrodes into very specific parts of the brain and deliver electricity, and when you turn it on they'll almost completely stop shaking. And when you turn it off, which is a flip of a switch externally, they start shaking uncontrollably, to the point that they can't care for themselves, they can't shower, they can't eat, they can't function in society—just from a flip of a switch externally.

So imagine you're able to do that from, like, your phone, anywhere in the world. But then it all—you know, it begs the question: “Who is the one flipping that switch? And ethically who should have the right to flip that switch?”

Feltman: Yeah. Last question: you know, Severance is one of those shows that inspires so many fan theories, more and more with every episode. I'm just curious, when friends and patients talk to you, how often do you get people trying to, you know, pull some secret Severance info out of you or get you to weigh in on their theories?

Agarwal: Yeah, you know, it's—I think people have strayed away from doing that. What I've noticed is that I actually rarely get asked, and that's good because my response is always, “Well, I guess you'll just have to see the rest of the season,” so I've been trained well.

But I actually have more people, even in the general community, just wanna talk about ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: The show, not specifically trying to figure out what happens in the later episodes; they're just so fascinated with the show and the concept and the way that it's written and the work that, you know, Ben, Dan and Mark have done—and the rest of the team as well. And it's really amazing to see the response to the show 'cause people just wanna talk about it.

It's like when people read a good book and they wanna talk to other people who have read the book and they just really delve into, you know, “What did this mean? What do you think this means?” And people just wanna talk about the show. And I absolutely love it 'cause I think it's brilliant, I love the show, I love watching the show, and I, you know, love talking about it. And so I actually don't get people really poking about what happens later on in the show. I get people who really genuinely enjoy it and actually just wanna talk about it, just wanna talk shop, and I enjoy that as well, and I think that really speaks to the response the show has had.

Feltman: Absolutely. Well, thank you so much for joining us to chat. As a Severance fan I have really loved this, so we really appreciate it.

Agarwal: Yeah, my pleasure, and I'm excited for you guys to see the rest of the season.

Researchers have counted the number of trees in China and mapped their distribution across the country using a laser-based technique called lidar.

A new estimate suggests China is home to 142.6 billion trees, meaning the country has roughly 100 trees per inhabitant.

These numbers are considerable, given how densely populated China is, an expert told Live Science. Still, the total figure may be an underestimate due to the limitations of the technology used to count the trees, the authors of the new study said.

""The actual number could be higher,"" said Qinghua Guo, a professor in the Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System at Peking University and the lead author of the study. China's Ninth National Forest Resources Inventory counted an average of 426 trees per acre (1,052 trees/hectare) across the country in 2019, which is much higher than the new study's estimate of 279 trees per acre (689 trees/hectare), Guo told Live Science in an email.

The true number of trees could be somewhere in the middle, but more research is needed to figure out what it is, he said.

An accurate estimate of China's tree population is crucial to evaluating forest ecosystem conditions and the amount of carbon that is being locked away in trees, Guo said. He and his colleagues also created a detailed map showing the distribution of China's trees, which they say will help the country hit its ecological and climate targets.

""The study represents the first high-resolution mapping of tree density across China,"" Guo said. ""Ultimately, this research contributes to China's approach to global sustainable ecosystem management and restoration.""

To produce the estimate, the researchers used a laser-based mapping technique called lidar (light detection and ranging). The team has been collecting lidar data from drones since 2015, amounting to an area covering 540 square miles (1,400 square kilometers).

For the new study, the scientists counted the number of trees in this area using software called Lidar360 that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI). They then extrapolated the resulting tree density estimate to obtain a national figure, with the results published Feb. 6 in the journal Science Bulletin.



The technology is cutting-edge, but some features need ironing out, Guo said. For example, Lidar360 cannot detect trees growing below thick canopies. ""In densely forested areas, overlapping canopies obstruct the accurate detection of mid-story and understory trees, leading to lower-than-actual tree counts,"" Guo said. Incorporating terrestrial lidar data and improving the software could provide more accurate tree counts, he added.

Despite certain limitations, the results broadly align with researchers' previous understanding of China's tree population, said Tom Crowther, an assistant professor in the department of environmental systems science at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. ""Globally, there are closer to 400 trees per person, but in such a densely populated region, it makes sense that this number is lower,"" Crowther, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.

China's tree population may soon increase, however, because the country is planting seedlings at a dizzying rate. Tree counts could skyrocket this spring as drones are deployed to seed the ""Great Green Wall"" — a huge belt of trees in the north of China that is being planted to prevent the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts from expanding. The Great Green Wall project — also known as the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program — started in 1978 and is due to be completed in 2050, by which point it could hold 100 billion trees. The wall is already the world's largest seeded forest with more than 66 million trees, but its success in staving off desertification is debated.

The technology used for the study not only helps to count and map trees, but it could also optimize where China chooses to focus its tree-planting efforts.

""The fusion of high-precision data and intelligent models ensures that every tree can be planted in the most suitable location,"" Guo said.

MRAM can be energy-intensive, but a new generation of this technology will enable greater computing power and resilience, as well as much lower energy requirements.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Scientists in Japan have developed a new kind of ""universal"" computing memory that is much faster and less energy-hungry than modules used in the best laptops and PCs today.

Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is a type of universal memory device that can overcome some of the limitations of conventional RAM, which can slow down at peak demand due to a relatively low capacity. Universal memory is a storage format that combines the speed of existing RAM and the ability of storage to retain information without a power supply

Universal memory like MRAM is a better proposition than the components used in computers and smart devices today as it offers higher speeds and much greater capacity, as well as better endurance.

This new technology operates at faster speeds and with greater capacity than conventional RAM, but overcomes the problem of high power requirements for data writing — which has previously been a challenge for MRAM.

MRAM devices consume little power in their standby state but need a large electric current to switch the direction of magnetization vector configurations of magnetic tunnel junctions, thereby using the direction of magnetization to represent the binary values in computers. That makes it infeasible for use in most computing systems and to achieve low-power data writing, a more efficient method for switching these vectors was needed.

In a paper published Dec. 25 2024 in the journal Advanced Science, researchers reported developing a new component for controlling the electric field in MRAM devices. Their method requires far less energy to switch polarity, thereby lowering the power requirements and improving the speed at which processes are performed.

The prototype component they built was called a ""multiferroic heterostructure"" — a ferromagnetic material and piezoelectric material, but with an ultrathin vanadium between them — that can be magnetized by an electric field. This differs from other MRAM devices, which did not have the vanadium layer.

Structural fluctuations in the ferromagnetic layer meant that it was difficult for a stable direction of magnetization to be maintained in previous MRAM devices. In order to overcome this stability issue, the Vanadium wafer between the ferromagnetic and piezoelectric layers acts as a buffer between the two.

—'Crazy idea' memory device could slash AI energy consumption by up to 2,500 times

—Ultrafast laser-powered 'magnetic RAM' is on the horizon after new discovery

By passing an electric current through the materials, the scientists demonstrated that the magnetic state could switch direction. The materials could maintain their shape and form, which previous versions could not do. Furthermore, the magnetic state was maintained after the electric charge was no longer present, allowing a stable binary state to be maintained without power.

The study did not cover the degradation in the switching efficiency over time. This tends to be a common problem with a wide range of electrical devices. For example, a common complaint with rechargeable household batteries is that they can only be charged a certain number of times (approximately 500) before their capacity degrades.

Ultimately, the new MRAM technology could enable more powerful commercial computing while also offering a longer use life, the scientists said. That's because the new switching technique requires far less power than previous solutions, has a greater resilience than current RAM technologies and does not require moving parts.

There have been hundreds of measles cases reported in the U.S. since the beginning of the year. Here's what you need to know about measles immunity.

Hundreds of people have caught measles in the United States this year, with the majority of the cases tied to outbreaks of the disease. So far, Texas has been the hardest hit, with the highest number of reported illnesses.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 301 people in the U.S. have had confirmed measles infections this year, as of March 13. Additional, probable cases have been reported by various states, but they've yet to be independently confirmed by the CDC.

Kids under 5 years old account for 34% of the confirmed measles cases, with a further 42% affecting children and teens ages 5 to 19. In total, 17% of the cases have resulted in hospitalization.

There has been one confirmed death related to the outbreaks, and a second remains under investigation. The first fatal case was in an unvaccinated school-age child in Texas, marking the first death from measles in the U.S. since 2015. The second deadly case was reported in a New Mexico resident by local health authorities, but the CDC has yet to conclude its own investigation of the case, which would help confirm its connection to ongoing outbreaks.

The vast majority of the confirmed measles infections — 95% — have been in people who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most of the infections have been reported in Texas, with data from the Texas Department of State Health Services showing that 279 measles cases were identified between late January and March 18.

Experts say the Texas outbreak is likely related to low rates of vaccination in the state. For instance, data suggest that around 18% of school-age children in Gaines County have been exempted from at least one vaccine, and 191 measles cases have occurred in that county so far. Meanwhile, Gaines' neighboring counties of Dawson, Yoakum, Terry and Martin have reported 11, 11, 36 and 3 cases, respectively.

As measles continues to spread, here's what to know about the protection of the measles vaccine, how long it lasts, and how to know if you're immune to the disease.

Measles can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella; or the MMRV vaccine, which additionally protects against the chickenpox-causing varicella virus. The CDC recommends that children receive their first dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine between the ages of 12 and 15 months and their second dose between 4 and 6 years old.

(For measles protection, the MMR vaccine is generally recommended over the MMRV vaccine, because it's less likely to trigger fevers in children. For those who get the MMR shot, a separate vaccine is recommended to protect against chickenpox (varicella).)

Unvaccinated older children and adults are also advised to receive two doses of a measles vaccine, at least 28 days apart.

One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are 97% effective, according to the CDC. The MMRV vaccine offers the same level of measles protection.

""It's probably one of the best vaccines that we have,"" Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton in the U.K., told Live Science in an email.

""For example, the COVID-19 vaccines are very good at reducing mortality, but less good at preventing a mild COVID-19 infection,"" Head said. The measles vaccine is highly protective against measles infections of all severity levels.

Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 thanks to widespread vaccination against the disease. The CDC defines ""elimination"" as the ""absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area."" Measles is not yet ""eradicated"" worldwide, meaning it still spreads regularly in other countries and can be imported to the U.S.



The MMR vaccine provides long-lasting measles protection for most people, with immunity typically being lifelong after two doses, according to the CDC. However, one 2024 study published in the journal The Lancet Public Health reported that measles immunity does fade slightly over time.

""Like with COVID vaccines, antibody levels do reduce over time,"" Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science via email. Antibodies are protective immune proteins that appear in the days and weeks after a person receives a vaccine, but these proteins are expected to disappear over time.

""However there is likely continued immunity with memory immune cells that can be activated as needed (as we have seen in COVID vaccines),"" Chin-Hong added. When exposed to the measles vaccine, the body generates ""memory"" cells in the immune system, which can quickly mount an immune response and make new antibodies if a person encounters the measles virus.

""In general, protection once immunized against measles, wanes very little,"" Chin-Hong said. The Lancet study suggested that, on average, measles immunity waned by about 0.039% per year after the age of 5.

Yes, if a person survives a bout of measles infection, they typically have lifelong immunity against the virus. However, even as the immune system mounts a powerful response against measles, its guard against other infections gets lowered.

Many studies find that measles infections induce a kind of ""immune amnesia,"" in which memory cells tasked with remembering pathogens are lost and the body is unable to rev up its antibody responses, as it used to. This leaves a person at increased risk of other infections for years following their brush with measles.

Other complications of measles infection include a rare but deadly central nervous system condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which can develop seven to 10 years after the infection. Some people can also experience brain swelling (encephalitis) during a measles infection, which can cause convulsions, permanent hearing loss and intellectual disability.

The measles vaccine provides lifelong immunity against the virus without these dangerous complications associated with measles infection.

If you've received two doses of the MMR vaccine, you're considered immune for life in most cases. Additionally, if you've had a confirmed case of measles in the past, you're likely immune for life.

If someone is still unsure whether they've either been vaccinated or had the disease, there's a test that checks for measles-specific antibodies in your blood. The type of measles antibody it screens for belongs to a broad class called immunoglobulin G (IgG), which protects the body from infection by binding to pathogens.

If enough measles-specific IgG antibodies are present, compared to a standard threshold, a person has immunity.

""You can check an antibody level with the help of a health care provider,"" Chin-Hong said. The test will give you a number back that's called a ""titer""; this is a measure of your antibody levels. However, the test will not pick up memory cells, Chin-Hong said, so it could miss that additional layer of evidence that you're immune to measles.



If a person is unsure about how protected they are against measles, they can get a booster shot of the vaccine to bolster their immunity.

""It is perfectly safe to have another dose,"" Head said. ""The recommendation to get an extra dose will typically come from public health teams, and it's always best to see the advice of a healthcare worker if anyone is unsure.""

If someone has had two doses of the measles vaccine in their lifetime, there is likely no need for a booster shot. The exception is a group of people who received the measles vaccine in the 1960s, who would need an additional MMR vaccine to ensure their protection.

That's because the measles vaccine used in the U.S. between 1963 and 1967 was less effective than modern measles vaccines. Unlike the current shots, which contain live-but-weakened viruses, the old shot contained an inactivated virus, so it was completely ""killed."" In response to the old vaccine, the immune system did not develop long-lasting memory cells, unlike the vaccines used today. Many people who received the old vaccine lost their immunity within a few years, leaving them vulnerable to measles later in life.

In addition to people who received only this old vaccine, anyone who has gotten only one dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine is recommended to get the recommended second dose.

The CDC started recommending two doses of the MMR shot in 1989, Chin-Hong noted, so those vaccinated before that time may need a second dose.

Individuals traveling to areas experiencing measles outbreaks, including within the U.S., can also consider getting another dose even if they're fully vaccinated, Chin-Hong said.

Additionally, health care workers, immunocompromised people and those who live with them, and college students should check their vaccination records to confirm they've received two MMR doses, and perhaps get an immunity test if they are unsure, Chin-Hong suggested. Individuals can speak with their health care provider about getting a booster shot, if they're interested in receiving one.

Fully vaccinated people may still catch measles, but only in rare circumstances.

About 3% of fully vaccinated people may still develop measles symptoms after an exposure to the virus, according to the CDC. However, people who have been fully vaccinated tend to experience milder symptoms than unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, and they are also less likely to spread the virus to others.

These ""breakthrough"" cases become more likely in the context of large outbreaks or high-exposure settings — when an individual has prolonged, close contact with an infected person. About 5% of total measles cases in the U.S. are breakthrough cases, according to the CDC.

Additionally, people with weakened immune systems — due to medical conditions or medications — might not maintain full protection, even if they're fully vaccinated. So they can be more prone to breakthrough cases.

In the current Texas outbreak, there were a ""handful"" of people who contracted measles after having only one shot,"" Chin-Hong noted. In a study that looked at measles cases in California between 2000 and 2015, most of those infected were unvaccinated, but 11% of the total cases were among people who had gotten two doses of measles vaccine. The fully vaccinated group did have milder disease, however.

Herd immunity refers to when a high percentage of a population is immune to a disease, making it difficult for the infection to spread. Reaching this collective level of immunity protects even those who can't be vaccinated, such as newborn babies, pregnant people or immunocompromised people.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, and because of that, at least 95% of a given population needs to be immune to prevent major outbreaks.

—US has already had more measles cases in 2024 than all of 2023

—Measles deaths jumped over 40% from 2021 to 2022, CDC reports

""Measles is so infectious, with very high levels of transmission. Typically, we refer to 95% coverage as the magic number of that 'herd immunity threshold,'"" Head told Live Science. ""At this level of coverage, there may still be individual case[s], but the majority of the population is protected, and the outbreaks will remain small and very localised.""

MMR coverage among U.S. kindergartners has declined in recent years, according to the CDC. In the 2019-2020 school year, 95.2% of kindergartners had received two doses of the MMR vaccine, but in the 2023-2024 school year, that coverage dropped to 92.7%. That marked the ""fourth consecutive year"" that national coverage had been below the targeted 95%.

Several states — including Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia and Florida — had less than 90% coverage during the 2023-2024 school year.

The Los Angeles Lakers have managed to tread water without LeBron James. Despite Thursday's 118-89 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, they are still 3-3 since the four-time MVP injured his groin against the Boston Celtics. Fortunately, even without the legendary forward, the Lakers aren't completely bereft of players named LeBron James.

After all, they also have his son, Bronny James, who got 30 minutes of playing time on Thursday and managed to make the most of them. In those 30 minutes, he scored 17 points on 7 of 10 shooting. While he tied with Dalton Knecht for the team lead in scoring, his biggest highlight, like so many of his father's, came on a pass. 

The elder James is known for his hit-ahead passes in transition. Bronny had one of his own, setting up teammate Markieff Morris for an easy layup in the second quarter.

The younger James hasn't been able to carve out significant playing time even with this recent rash of injuries for the Lakers. Prior to Thursday, he had never played more than 15 minute and 43 seconds in an NBA game, nor had he reached double digits in scoring.

But Thursday represented a perfect storm for him in his quest to prove he belongs in the NBA. The Lakers were missing not only his father, but all of their other starters except Jaxson Hayes. That created plenty of backcourt minutes, and James played well enough within those minutes not to cede them to other reserves. The result was his biggest step forward as a professional. Well, at least at the NBA level. 

BRONNY JAMES CUTS IT TO SINGLE DIGITS!!LeBron and the Lakers bench loving it 👏👏 pic.twitter.com/cTjguHDnNZ

James has thrived in the G-League this season, scoring over 20 points per game in nine appearances. He still has a ways to go before he can share the court with his father consistently. He is small for a defensive-minded guard, coming in below 6-2, and his jump shot is still a work in progress. 

But James was once considered a possible first-round pick, and Thursday was a glimpse at why. Slowly but surely, he's improving. That won't get him into the playoff rotation for the Lakers, but it's a promising sign of what could come.

Over the last few years, the Pittsburgh Steelers struggled pretty badly to put together a competent offense. From 2022 through 2024, they ranked 23rd, 25th and 23rd in yards, and 26th, 28th and 16th in points. They were not successful throwing the ball, and they were not successful running it. 

According to former Steelers running back Najee Harris, who signed with the Los Angeles Chargers in free agency, Pittsburgh's offensive woes weren't necessarily an accident.

""It was just a team where we lost Ben [Roethlisberger], we lost the O-line, we just didn't know anything on offense really, we didn't have any identity,"" Harris said during an interview with local Los Angeles TV station KCAL. ""We had a young guy coming in at QB. I was young. The team was young. I really didn't have nobody to almost learn from on the offensive side. I think the veteran guy on that team was a two-, three-year vet. And he's still learning himself.""

During Harris' rookie season, Roethlisberger was still on the team and slinging the ball around, and the team's offensive identity was indeed built around him -- just as it had been for most of his career. That offense wasn't too successful, either, having checked in 21st in yards and 23rd in points. 

The team Harris is joining this upcoming season was a bit better offensively, even if it wasn't elite. The Chargers had the 20th-most yards, but the 11th-most points in the league. And Harris feels like the veteran leadership the group has will make for a better fit than the one he had with the Steelers.

""And I'm coming in and I'm just trying to look for people to pick their brain and it was just defensive guys,"" Harris said of Pittsburgh. ""So I'd go to the defensive guys and talk to them, but there wouldn't be too much they could tell me about offensive things. So, through my years, I've learned a lot that only I learned first-hand. And I feel like [in L.A.], like we've got a lot of veterans that I can learn even more stuff from, even at the quarterback position, and the O-line position. So it was an interesting year there, I'll just say that. Interesting year.""

Losing to Panama again in a competitive match is a sign of concern for the United States men's national team, but it's also not a moment that shows that they're doomed at the 2026 World Cup. Even when it comes to World Cup preparation, they'll get to face either Mexico or Canada in the Nations League third-place game making it a much bigger affair than the average third-place game. 

Mauricio Pochettino acknowledged that there is much work to be done, listing off mistakes like lack of pressing, long shooting, and intensity but capped things off succinctly. 

""This responsibility is the responsibility of everyone and we need to find a way to compete better and that's it,"" Pochettino said.

This team does need to perform better and they'll have a chance on Sunday to show that improvement or changes could be coming to the squad ahead of the Gold Cup. Pochettino has previously spoken about trust in the squad, both in having the trust of the squad himself but also in him being able to trust players and what they'll do individually. It's clear that players like Patrick Ageymang and Jack McGlynn gained that trust during January camp while others still have work to do to earn it.

Ahead of the World Cup, Pochettino needs to know the strengths and weaknesses of his entire squad and losses like this one to Panama can be more telling of what needs to be improved than victories, but let's take a look at a few reasons why the USMNT still have plenty of hope moving forward:

After Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson has arguably become the second-most important player to the USMNT. The Fulham man is able to provide defensive guile while also joining the attack and stepping into midfield when needed. There aren't many fullbacks in the world that can do what Robinson is capable of and there was a lot lost on the left side with Joe Scally operating between a third center back and as a left back. Sure, there are concerns that Robinson has no true back up, but even the number two left back -- starting right back Sergino Dest -- wasn't in this camp. With both of them on the pitch, this is a completely different side. With both out (Dest just returned from injury), they were missed.

The USMNT would love to have more depth but that doesn't just happen overnight and if any member of the core misses out, it creates a void that can't be filled without changing the system. Chopping and changing things constantly isn't sustainable for a team of the USMNT's level. Folarin Balogun was also a big miss leading the line because even when he doesn't touch the ball, his movement pulls players out of position to create space for the rest of the attack.

Most teams would struggle with their third-choice left back and striker in a match but the knock-on effect from both at the same time makes balancing a squad tough. 

Time works a few different ways. On one hand, it's under 500 days until the World Cup, and that can be a moment to panic. But, there are 500 days until the World Cup, so there is time for growth, for players to move to new teams and challenge themselves and also for Pochettino to become more ingrained in American soccer. He has learned a lot in a short time since taking over in October of 2024 and will continue to soak up as much as possible in the remaining days between now and the World Cup. The players will also learn what he wants from them or end up on the fringes of the squad. Dest and other players will return to the squad and should only help. 

If these issues are still cropping up later in 2025, that's when concern will grow but there's a lot for the USMNT to learn and one excellent finish from a Panamanian attacker can't undo the good defensive work that the team did in this match. If Sargent's shot goes in instead of hitting the post, it's a different match which is where perspective is important. 

If the USMNT won or lost this match, they'd face Canada or Mexico and that's still the case. Competition is what the team makes of it and while things can mean more with a trophy on the line, if the players need a trophy to motivate themselves under Pochettino, there's no point in even raising expectations for the World Cup. Already facing Türkiye and Switzerland in the summer ahead of Gold Cup play, the USMNT are scheduling the best matches that they can right now. Teams will still bring competitive squads to face the USMNT and there will be plenty to learn from those matches.

As long as they schedule high-level friendlies and World Cup tune-ups, there will be no shortages of challenges, and the Gold Cup could also have a stronger squad than normal with it being the final competitive set of matches before the World Cup. While the loss will sting for the fanbase, it's better that it happen now and serves as a learning experience for what's to come.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The transparency king of college basketball was rewarded for his candidness on Thursday. 

Because what's happening with Will Wade and McNeese is basically unprecedented in these ever-paranoid times in the sport.

Every March, there are hot-name coaches who guide their teams to this tournament. Privately, as this is happening, they and their agents talk to other schools about the prospect of taking another job. It's quite literally what's transpiring elsewhere with a number of vacancies right now. 

Normally, everyone keeps it hush-hush — or at least tries to until the jig is forced to be up.

With Wade, there is no jig. He is jig-less. The most publicly honest coach in the sport has not run nor hid from a would-be awkward situation. Instead, he's leaned into the blunt truth (what a concept!) and it's helped his McNeese Cowboys make history in the process. Wade is in line to be the next coach at NC State. We only know this because he hasn't tried for a second to make anyone think otherwise. 

Going into Thursday's game against fifth-seeded Clemson, plenty thought that a supposedly distracted McNeese team might get pushed out by a 27-6 Tigers team that won more games this season than any previous one in its history. 

Nope.

McNeese refused to have its season end Thursday. Wade's 12th-seeded Cowboys upset Clemson 69-67 to improve to 28-6 and advance to Saturday's second round, where No. 4 Purdue awaits. It's the school's first NCAA Tournament win ever and it's the Southland Conference's first NCAA conquest of an ACC opponent — ever.

""We're not worried about any of that stuff,"" Wade said outside the team's locker room, re: NC State. ""I mean, here's the thing: We can sit here and lie about it, but it is what it is. Our guys aren't worried about it, I ain't worried about it, none of our administration's worried about it, nobody's worried about it. We've been honest with everybody. It's great! Keep winning! Keep going!""

We only know all of this because Wade isn't afraid to talk about it. To the media, to his athletic director, to his president, to his players.

""I think when you're in the loop and both ends are transparent about things, there's not too much room for conflict,"" McNeese senior Christian Shumate said. ""Everybody is aware of everything that's going on, and when there's a clear understanding, everybody keeps the same angle in the front of mind. We'll worry about all of that stuff later.""

For now: jubilance.

Once the game went final, Wade was as joyful and celebratory as any coach we'll see Thursday or Friday. You can be a cynic and think he's just headhunting for a bigger gig, or you can watch this and see a man reacting in real time to what he considers the most rewarding moment of his jagged career.

After the game, Wade traded off responding to questions about how his team beat Clemson (his alma mater, by the way) and how he's handled all of the NC State chatter. 

""I could have gone in there (to the press conference) and lied to everybody,"" Wade said to a small scrum of reporters outside the McNeese locker room. ""If you don't know how we operate day to day, then you can't judge how we how we do things. And so we have a transparency that most people don't have.""

This is the payoff. With Wade, what you see is what you get. He is so frank, it is jarring. There is no filter on that 42-year-old mouth. There is no one like this guy in college basketball. 

""You may not like what I've got to say but I'm going to tell you what I think,"" Wade said. ""Our guys know that. That's what (Qadir) Copeland was laughing about in the press conference. Sometimes he tells me, 'My man, can you sugarcoat the truth a little bit?' Like, it's just too direct.""

You know what else was direct? The way McNeese punked Clemson. The Tigers were overwhelmed. They saved face with a desperate second half push that got the final margin to two, but Brad Brownell's team was effectively finished in the first 20 minutes. The Cowboys clobbered the Tigers 31-13 by halftime, marking the second-fewest points in the first half of an NCAA Tournament game ever by an ACC program. (Wake Forest: 10, in 2001.) 

Wade pulled out a surprise: He deployed a 2-3 zone defense for the first time this season. Clemson was shook. It got down by as many as 24 in the second half and didn't have enough time to pull off the comeback. 

""We've been saving that zone all year,"" Wade said. 

McNeese, in this tournament for a second straight season and now with 58 wins over the past two years, was champing at the bit to be the bracket-busting Cowboys out of Lake Charles, Louisiana. 

""It don't got nothing to do with Clemson,"" Copeland said. ""We could have beat any team in here. It's just amazing to win with these guys.""

His players are just as honest as he is. Clemson just happened to be the victim; it could've been nearly anyone.

Whenever McNeese's season ends, Wade will be off to NC State within days. There are other coaches in this tournament who have been in frequent contact with job openings; those guys are either hiding from that reality or fillibustering around it.

""There are five coaches right now negotiating with other schools! I mean, c'mon, It's true! Villanova is trying to hire a coach  out of the NCAA Tournament right now!"" Wade said, a completely out-of-pocket comment. 

It's also a true statement. 

The guy is different. He's operated on his own agenda dating back to when he got his first shot to run a program at Chattanooga 12 years ago. He won big there, then went to VCU. He won big there, then went to LSU. He broke NCAA rules, was eventually fired from the university and paid a price — a one-year banishment from college coaching.

The things he was party to then are basically legal now.

And now this is Will Wade's world. When news broke Wednesday about his impending hiring at NC State, Wade's players weren't caught off-guard. They were practicing at Brown University's Pizzitola Center. When everybody went to check their phones after practice they came back to hundreds — thousands, maybe — of collective texts. 

Truth is: Wade had already told his team the deal days before, when they gathered in the film room of McNeese's basketball facility. 

""People don't know how we operate,"" Wade said. ""We operate really well when the chips are down. We operate well in chaos because we just narrow in. We operate well when there's outside noise that, 'Oh, you're not going to be focused, you're not going to be prepared.' F--- that. We're going to be prepared. We're going to be focused. We're going to be the more focused team."" 

All of that was on display in Providence. The Cowboys made Clemson look like the middling mid-major, beating the Tigers with 44 points in the paint (Clemson was allowing just 28.3 paint points heading into the game), 19 points off turnovers, 18 offensive rebounds and 16 second-chance points on their way to a 12th straight win. Wade's team has one loss since mid-December. 

""The bigger the game, the narrower your focus"" is Wade's mantra. 

To the end, McNeese was itself. It played with aggression. Clemson pushed hard. It put the game in doubt late with shots taken too quickly, instead of bleeding the clock. But McNeese had enough to hold on. The Cowboys won their way.

""That's who we are: The Bayou Bandits, baby!"" Wade said. ""You ain't winning playing conservative. You ain't being anybody. If you're gonna win a game like this, you've got to be aggressive for 40 minutes. ... You're not going to beat a team from the ACC if you're if you're on your heels or you're reacting to them, you got to go.""

Things have changed drastically in college athletics in the past three years. You can make a case few are more equipped to handle the choppy waters better than Wade. 

""You know how many schools are in these guys' DMs right now?"" Wade said. ""I mean, damn, this is great for them. Their market just went up in the transfer portal.""

Who else is talking like this on the record? Nobody. Honestly, it's refreshing. Wade made a lot of enemies with how he handled his business at LSU. Truth is, he never gave a damn. He was who he was and if people didn't like that it never bothered him and he never held it against anyone. It's why McNeese athletic director Heath Schroyer wasn't afraid to hire him two years ago. He did so while Wade was still awaiting NCAA punishment. Wade had to sit to start his career. 

Two years later, it was the best possible thing Schroyer could have done for McNeese and the Southland.

""We're all going in the same direction with the same vision, and we have great supporters. And when you have great alignment and great support, you can accomplish amazing things,"" Schroyer told CBS Sports. ""I think we have the best alignment in the country, if you want to know the truth.""

Schroyer, who previously was a head coach at Portland State, Wyoming, UT Martin and McNeese before coming the school's AD in 2021, said he and Wade have ""been very transparent with each other from the start.""

He knows he's losing his coach. He's basically as up-front about the reality of the situation as Wade is. Being a former coach goes a long way to creating such a healthy dynamic. 

""I've never had a coach/AD relationship like this one,"" Schroyer said. ""Most of the people in the country thought I was insane. No one knew if he was going to coach again.""

Not only did Wade return, he came back to an NCAA landscape built, in many ways, just for him. This is who Wade has always been: a baby-faced renegade carrying a hard handshake and even harder competitive edge. Similar to Rick Pitino, a lot of people could have taken a chance on him but were afraid to pull the trigger. Schroyer embraced Wade for who he was and now McNeese is having its biggest moment in school history.

""They thought we were a little wacky when we did it,"" Wade said. ""But, hey, who's laughing now?""

That would be Wade and his Cowboys, who are riding into weekend as the refreshingly honest and uniquely compelling early Cinderella story of this tournament.

It's been a rough two weeks for the New York Knicks without Jalen Brunson. They are just 3-4 in his absence, and only one of those games came against a team currently holding a top-six playoff seed. On Thursday, things hit a new low when they embarrassingly lost 115-98 to the lowly Charlotte Hornets, their second consecutive loss. Were it not for a miraculous Mikal Bridges buzzer-beater in Portland, the Knicks would be 2-5 without their best player and in danger of losing the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference.

Fortunately, it seems as though Brunson is on track to return during the regular season. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed Thursday that Brunson is out of his walking boot and doing some light shooting, an important step as he works to recover from the sprained ankle he suffered against the Los Angeles Lakers earlier this month.

The initially reported timeline on Brunson's return was roughly the end of March or early April. The regular season ends on April 13, so if Brunson recovers on schedule, he should be back reasonably soon. Factoring into this, obviously, is New York's seeding. The Knicks (43-26) currently lead the Indiana Pacers (40-29) by three games for the No. 3 seed. The bigger that lead is, the more cautious the Knicks can be with Brunson's health.

The goal of course is to have Brunson back at full strength in the playoffs, where he has been sensational with the Knicks. In 24 playoff appearances with the team, Brunson has averaged 30.3 points and 6.6 assists per game while leading New York to the second round in consecutive seasons. This season, Brunson was in the running for a First-Team All-NBA selection as he and Karl-Anthony Towns have formed one of the most dangerous offensive duos in the NBA.

As the past few weeks have shown, New York's offense isn't the same without Brunson. Towns needs a pick-and-roll partner. Bridges, Josh Hart and OG Anunoby are all role players who need a star to orbit around. Getting Brunson back before the playoffs would give him time to warm up before the games start to count. 

The Knicks can't have a limited Brunson if they hope to make any playoff noise. He'll need to recover to 100% if New York is going to compete for a championship, and returning during the regular season would be a good start.

The United States men's national team were shocked in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals on Thursday, falling 1-0 to Panama thanks to a stoppage-time goal by Cecilio Waterman. The Americans had their chances but were wasteful all night, failing to take the lead in a game that they controlled for the majority.  The USMNT had chances with Josh Sargent hitting the post and Patrick Agyemang testing the keeper off the bench but they weren't able to break down Thomas Christiansen's 5-4-1 to get an eventual winner.

It's a flashback to Copa America where the United States also lost to Panama during the group stage,leading to crashing out of that tournament. They'll need to show growth between now and Sunday when they'll face either Canada or Mexico in the third-place game of this competition.

Given that it'll be a rival that they'll face in that match, it will be a meaningful experience even with it not being for a trophy. 

The result means the U.S. won't win the competition for the first time in history, taking a step back in a competition that was supposed to be a springboard ahead of the 2026 World Cup. 

It's a substitute Cecilio Waterman who cuts through the counter catching Joe Scally out and putting an excellent finish past Matt Turner. Panama then went over to to bring Thierry Henry into the celebration and the USMNT is up against it. 

He'll want that one back as Christian Pulisic's pass was into an excellent area. The Charlotte man wasn't able to get a strong finish on it and we're inching closer to extra time with three minutes plus stoppage time remaining. 

After a Panama turnover, Agyemang was able to force a strong save out fo Panama by bodying a Panamanian defender. He brings something a little different to the match and it showed as he made something happen out of nowhere. With seven minutes remaining, the USMNT will dial up the pressure.  

He received treatment after going up for a header and will be replaced by Mark McKenzie. It could've also been a change from an abundance of caution with Richards also on a yellow card.

Needing to generate attack the MLS cavalry enters the match. Josh Sargent and Tanner Tessmann exit with Patrick Agyemang and Jack McGlynn entering. Sargent didn't see a ton of the ball in the match but with this shift, the USMNT will get a little more dynamic in build up.

As the game goes on without the USMNT finding a goal or a way through the middle of the pitch, it does call for changes and someone like Luna's direct nature could help make something happen in this clash. 

The USMNT midfielder has been there to clean up every attack that has come his way. It's quite an important role especially when some of those are coming via mistakes in possession. 

No changes for the USMNT out of the break but it will be a time to see if the USMNT can break down Panama's defense by making adjustments. 

It's nice to finally get a look at how Pochettino's attempt at troubleshooting considering the absences in the team, especially on the wings with Musah and Weah playing relatively new roles on the wing for the national team. They will definitely be happy about the fact that Panama didn't manage a single shot on target but with just one shot on target (from Josh Sargent 19 minutes in, who was unlucky not to score at some point this half), there's definitely room for improvmeent htere.

The USMNT headed into the tunnel at halftime to some boos, potentially from the Mexico fans who are trickling into SoFi Stadium.

More than 35 minutes into the first half, the USMNT is holding a possession advantage over Panama with Carrasquilla being the ball-dominant player on the position as expected. Sargent has been in good spaces but hasn't found his goal yet while the USMNT press is making it quite tough for Panama to advance the ball forward.

Tim Weah was flagged offside in the build-up with Sargent putting the ball in the back of the net. It was an excellent finish from the Norwich man and as this game goes on, it's clear that the USMNT has enough in possession to net a few goals. They just need a little more space.

So, so close for Sargent as excellent movement created a great attacking chance. The USMNT couldn't convert it into a goal but it was their best moment of this young match. That could be enough to spark them to life after a tepid start.

Is cut out by Tyler Adams. Chris Richards got pushed off the ball but the USMNT was aware enough to clean that up for a corner kick. The defense can't afford these kinds of mistakes but it's also when it's great to have a player like Adams back in the fold.

In possession, Musah is pushing as more of a wing back with Joe Scally falling in line as a third center back to press Panama. Considering the USMNT's strength in possession, this could create some trouble for los Canales

A spot in the Concacaf Nations League final is on the line.

Even with absences in the squad, the USMNT will be able to emerge with a victory at home as a clear style begins to emerge under Pochettino. Pick: United States 2, Panama 0

While he's gotten the lion's share of minutes for the national team, Turner has only played 360 minutes of soccer for Crystal Palace since the last Nations League match in November. That's in comparison to Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte both logging over 3,500 minutes each for their clubs. Turner hasn't shown signs of rust yet which is a credit to his preparation but at what point is a change between the sticks warranted?

Checking in with about an hour until kickoff in Inglewood, and Panama are already out for warm-ups ... even if there's almost no one sitting in their seats just yet. The fans will undoubtedly trickle in closer to kickoff and especially so in the buildup to Canada-Mexico, but there's no denial that a 4 p.m. local kickoff on a Thursday is going to be brutal for attendance at the first game. Not quite the crowd one might expect for the USMNT's opening game at the World Cup in this very stadium in a year-plus, I'd guess.

Improving under Thomas Christensen, Panama have quietly become the fourth best team in Concacaf and since 2020. With Adalberto Carrasquilla in midfield, this is a team that can control the pace in midfield and Anibal Godoy brings steel alongside him which is where this is where the match will be won or lost.  

While the USMNT will enter this match with confidence, it's also the first camp for multiple players under Pochettino. In preparation for the 2026 World Cup, Pochettino will need to see as many players as possible to figure out their strengths and weaknesses which is where there is also a lot to gain from this camp without players like Robinson. It will help Pochettino figure out what depth he can trust and where he may need to work during the Gold Cup window. The USMNT have dominated Concacaf play recently but their one home loss to domestic opposition in their last 30 matches was also to this very Panama side.  

This one's a bit curious on if it's a back four with Tim Weah in defense or if Tyler Adams will actually be needed in defense for the USMNT with the absentees from this squad.

USMNT Starters: Matt Turner, Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Joe Scally, Yunus Musah, Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, Tanner Tessmann, Christian Pulisic, Josh Sargent, Tim Weah

Nations League play returns and expectations are high for the USMNT as they're the only team to have won this competition in its brief history. Mauricio Pochettino will look to find a winning formula without Antonee Robinson but with Tyler Adams back into the XI and Josh Sargent leading the line, the USMNT will have plenty to push Panama during the match.

Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry exited Thursday night's 117-114 win over the Toronto Raptors and was quickly ruled out with a pelvic contusion after a hard fall in the third quarter. The injury came as Curry attempted to drive to the basket. As he made a pass back out to the perimeter, he got knocked onto the floor by Raptors rookie Jonathan Mogbo.

There was no foul on the play, and Mogbo went straight up to try to contest what he thought would be a Curry layup. Things went wrong when Curry hit the ground, seemingly landing hard on his backside and immediately feeling quite a bit of pain. 

Curry first went to the bench before gingerly heading back to the locker room. He was ruled out a short time later, finishing the night with 17 points in 25 minutes.

After the game, Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters that Curry was undergoing an MRI on his ""pelvic/tailbone area."" He had no immediate update on Curry's condition, but did say Curry was hoping to return to the court in the fourth quarter.

""He was trying to come back. He thought he might be able to come back and we just decided not to risk anything. Hopefully it's not bad,"" Kerr said via Anthony Slater of The Athletic. 

Curry has been on a tear for the red-hot Warriors. In their first 14 games after acquiring Jimmy Butler, he has averaged nearly 30 points per game as Golden State rattled off a 12-2 stretch -- now 13-2 after Thursday night's win. The weight of carrying an enormous burden for most of the season before Butler's arrival, however, has seemingly taken a toll lately. He missed a game earlier this week against the Milwaukee Bucks, and in the three games prior, shot just 18 of 50 from the floor.

Now the Warriors will have to hope that Curry can recover quickly. They improved to 41-29 with the win Thursday night and have only a slight lead on the Minnesota Timberwolves and Los Angeles Clippers for the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference. And with that top-six spot comes the ability to avoid the Play-In stage. 

If Curry misses time, the odds of Golden State having to fight its way into the playoffs get much higher.

The first round of the 2025 Valspar Championship was an absolute grind as players had to battle inclement weather, heavy winds and the always difficult Copperhead course at Innisbrook Resort. The combination of steady 15-20 mph winds (gusting up to 30 mph) and the small greens at Innisbrook made for a challenging day as evidenced by the leaders sitting at 4-under -- the second-highest first round leading score in tournament history.

The morning wave seemed to get the better of the weather draw Thursday as four of the five co-leaders came from the early set of tee times. The afternoon wave got rocked by a pop-up shower that combined with the heavy winds to give players fits for a few holes before it ultimately passed through.

The lowest any player got Thursday was Keith Mitchell, who pushed his score to 6under going into No. 8 (his 17th hole). After finding the front of the green on the tough par 3, Mitchell left his first putt woefully short and ended up with a three-putt bogey. Another bogey followed for a 67 that felt like it should have been even better. 

""It's crazy to say you left some out there when it's windy, but I mean, I don't want to say that because you're going to make mistakes, you're going to hit shots that you wish you could have over or putts that you had over,"" Mitchell said. ""All in all, I kept it together. No. 8 was playing really hard today, and 9, the wind just off left I couldn't get it started far enough left and made bogey there. But you take those two out of the round and sprinkle them somewhere else, I'm feeling good.""

The lone player to join the group at 4 under from the afternoon wave was Sami Valimaki, who handled the rain better than most with three pars on Nos. 2-4. 

""Yeah, it wasn't the best time to be on the golf course,"" Valimaki said of battling sideways rain in the middle of his round. ""But [I] just managed to make it especially we had the rain 2nd, 3rd and 4th, it was tough in that time but managed to make a couple pars.""

The first round was called due to darkness at 7:39 p.m. ET with four groups still on the course. They will return to finish their rounds at 9 a.m. with the second round beginning as scheduled at 7:35 a.m.

1. Keith Mitchell, Jacob Bridgeman, Stephen Jaeger, Ricky Castillo, Sami Valimaki (-4)

Mitchell's bogey-bogey finish took some of the wind out of his sails, but he seems confident in his game and comfortable on the course. Bridgeman had the inverse of Mitchell's round as he got hot on his second nine, shooting a 32 that included an eagle at the first to get into that lead group. 

Jaeger and Castillo had to contend with the Snake Pit to close their round with each dropping a shot at the 16th but bouncing back with birdies on 18 -- Jaeger also made birdie on the 17th. It's the second time in three years that Jaeger has held a share of the first-round lead at the Valspar, but he'll hope for a stronger finish compared to his T27 in 2023. 

Valimaki had a mostly clean card in the tougher afternoon wave, with the exception of a double bogey on 14, as he is in the mix early yet again after being T2 at the Cognizant after the first round two weeks ago. His 2-under run through the Snake Pit was the best of anyone on Thursday.

With the leaderboard bunched, there figures to be plenty of movement ahead Friday. Mitchell, Bridgeman, Jaeger and Castillo will all know whether there are low scores to be found or it'll be another day of trying to avoid big numbers by the time they tee off in the afternoon. 

T6. Ryan Fox, Nico Echavarria, Nick Hardy (-3)T9. Davis Riley, Harry Hall, Billy Horschel, Andrew Putnam, Victor Perez, Jeremy Paul, Nate Lashley, Sam Stevens, Luke List, Sahith Theegala, Andrew Novak, Justin Lower, Rasmuss Neergaard-Petersen, Kevin Velo (-2) 

There are an astonishing 22 players within two shots of the lead going into Friday, which provides a lot of opportunities to move up or down the leaderboard before the weekend. Fox was with the group at 4 under until a rough three-putt bogey (his only one of the day) on the 18th dropped him back. Echavarria successfully posted a clean card with a bogey-free 68, and Hardy had the second-best round of the afternoon wave. 

Behind that trio is a group of 14 players all at 2-under, with Kevin Velo still waiting to complete his round as he has to play the 18th on Friday morning before starting his second round. Both Velo and Theegala had it to 4 under on Thursday before backing up late in their first rounds. 

Friday will be an interesting day at Innisbrook as a lot of the marquee names in the field have work to do if they're going to see the weekend. The Jordan Spieth rollercoaster was in full effect on Thursday as he opened with an eagle but promptly gave that back with bogeys on the next two holes on his way to a 3-over 74, putting him in a tie for 103rd. He was playing with Justin Thomas, one of the three betting co-favorites before the tournament, who didn't fare much better. Thomas shot a 73 to sit just outside the cut line after the first round as the overall vibes in the Spieth-Thomas featured group were rough. 

They weren't alone in struggling with some tough conditions out at the Copperhead course as a bunch of the players that sat at the top of the pre-tournament odds sheet find themselves well off the pace after Round 1. Tommy Fleetwood had an oddly dreadful ball-striking round (120th in strokes gained approach) and missed a few short putts on Thursday; he's just inside the cut line at 1 over going to Friday. Xander Schauffele, seeking his 60th straight made cut on the PGA Tour, scratched his way to a 1-under 70 (good for T23), but he was clearly not happy with his ball-striking throughout the round. Schauffele went straight to the range after his round with caddie Austin Kaiser taking videos of his swing to figure out what wasn't synced up. That figures to be worth monitoring when he gets back on the course Friday afternoon. 

Past champion Sam Burns also carded a 1-over 72, while Tom Kim and Adam Scott each posted 74s to give themselves some serious work to do on Friday to make it to the weekend.  The good news for all of those players? With the leaders only at 4 under, there's an opportunity to make up serious ground on Friday ... if they can show a different gear than they had Thursday. 

A tough year for Patton Kizzire continued Thursday as he got off to a 3-over start through eight holes before withdrawing from the tournament, citing a back injury. Prior to that withdrawal, Kizzire's frustrations with his play boiled over after a short missed putt as he punted his putter to the moon, breaking the shaft in the process. Kizzire hadn't made a cut in his last six starts coming into this week, but does at least now lead the PGA Tour in putter hang time,

Unreal hang time on this putter punt 👏 pic.twitter.com/WuQvbfr0el

Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook

Mitchell is, without a doubt, the most accomplished of the players atop the leaderboard, but in his two most recent appearances at the Valspar he's had nightmare final rounds. Schauffele, as mentioned, doesn't look comfortable with his swing at the moment, but the fact he was able to grind out a 70 without anything close to his A-game means if things click soon he could make a quick move up this leaderboard. 

I personally like Straka at 16-1 as he's been playing great on the Florida swing, and I feel more confident in him sticking around the top of the leaderboard than most of the guys he's chasing. Theegala at 28-1 has some value given he was tied for the lead before a couple rough closing holes. Further down the odds sheet, I was impressed with Valimaki's round given the conditions he faced in the afternoon. At 65-1 and tied for the lead, I wouldn't hate a little nibble going into Friday.

Filed under:

Columbia's Megan Griffith embraced an idea from college football. It has offered clarity for the Lions and misdirection for their opponents.





CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — It was easy for eyes to wander to different places in Carmichael Arena on Thursday night as the Columbia Lions faced the Washington Huskies in a First Four battle of No. 11 seeds in the NCAA Tournament.

Some were drawn to the floor, where Kitty Henderson was wreaking havoc on defense and dishing out highlight-worthy assists. Others remained focused on the 3-point line, where Riley Weiss was effortlessly swishing long-range jumpers. Some looked at the scoreboard, where Columbia had erased a 13-point deficit to take a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.

And then some folks couldn't stop looking at Columbia's bench, where players and coaches for the Lions took turns hoisting cardboard signs in the air, slapping them and waving them, to signal different things to the players on the floor. One had the word “NEON” written on it. Another featured a green mushroom from the Super Mario Bros. video games. And a third showed a Columbia player flexing.

There were others too. And while fans in the crowd, media members on press row and the Huskies on the opposite bench might've been confused, every member of Columbia's women's basketball team knows the meaning of every one.

“I think in this program, we're just big on the details. It's just another way to communicate to your team,” Henderson said. “When we're all on the same page, it's a huge advantage, and like – why not just be very clear with what we're doing?”

All season long, those signs have offered clarity for Columbia and misdirection for their opponents. On Thursday in Chapel Hill, they played a small but crucial role in helping the Lions defeat the Huskies 63-60, in a victory that was significant in so many ways.

It marked not only Columbia's first-ever win in the NCAA Tournament, but also its first victory over a Big Ten squad. And for Henderson, one of the best players to ever walk through the doors of the Ivy League program – one who has been there for every step leading to this history-making moment – it was her 100th win in a Lions' uniform.

But back to those signs. Because they're a little bit weird and silly and unorthodox, right?

These sort of images are very popular in college football, where paranoid coaches do everything they can to prevent their opponents from knowing what they're going to do next. Flip on any Power 4 game in the fall and you'll see men in quarter-zips wearing different colored hats all making signals on any given play. You'll see staffers holding up different signs, some covered with internet memes or stills from movie scenes.

But there's a reason college football teams keep doing it. Because it works. Because the players and coaches inside the program know what those symbols mean and no one else does. It would be too much work to figure out – much more complicated than simply staring at a catcher to steal pitching signals.

Still, in college basketball, this sort of practice is incredibly uncommon.

Columbia head coach Megan Griffith – a 39-year-old alumna of the university now in her ninth season leading the team – bills herself as a football fan. She likes the game because it's complicated. There's 22 players on the field, each with a different job.

She too noticed the assistant coaches who don't wear team colors and who hold up signs with wild-looking images.

“I think the game of football is really intriguing, because there's so many details and such a high level of communication coordination that happens,” Griffith says. “There's people that are having signs and hats that are throwing the other team off. I think we've learned a lot from that.”

The way Griffith tells it, the idea to utilize signs on the bench came from assistant coach Allie Bassetti. One day, she took the plan to Griffith and said, what if we did that? Griffith thought it was a great idea, particularly because Columbia likes to switch its defensive schemes up often.

“If we're going to be this multiple press team and we want them to have a greater awareness of when we're about to be in the bonus or they're about to be in the bonus, why don't we just visually show them? I'm a big believer in communication,” Griffith says. “I think the best teams, the best leaders communicate at the highest levels, and that's really hard to do just verbally. So let's visually bring that in so there's a nonverbal and a verbal for everything that we do and every way we communicate.”

As Columbia began to make dents into Washington's lead, different signs were hoisted into the air. The One-Up Mushroom was held up after one of Weiss' five 3-pointers. The “NEON” symbol was raised after Henderson dished out one of her seven assists. On and on and on, until the buzzer sounded and the Lions celebrated at mid-court after making program history.

Aside from the fact that this was a team from the Ivy League with zero scholarship players upending a squad from the rich and mighty Big Ten, Columbia's victory was improbable in several ways.

The Lions were down by double digits at halftime. The Huskies led for nearly 32 minutes. And in the first half, Washington's Dalayah Daniels was absolutely owning them on the glass, grabbing 10 rebounds in 18 minutes of play over the first two frames.

Daniels wound up playing almost 38 minutes. But as Columbia stormed back in the second half, the 6-foot-4 fifth-year forward corralled just one more rebound, finishing with 11 for the game. The Lions actually won the battle on the glass, 30-29.

The message at halftime for Columbia was simple: stop letting Daniels grab misses. The Lions locked in and got it done.

Was there a sign for that?

“Yeah, it's a big stop sign,” Henderson said with a grin. “It was a really physical game, so I think we just adjusted to that and just went up and had to win those 50-50 balls. That's what you have to do to win.”

Next up for Columbia is a battle with sixth-seeded West Virginia. The signs will again be present on the bench. Henderson will be making plays, Weiss will be hitting deep shots, and the Lions will do whatever is necessary to put another tally in the win column.

Filed under:

Cam Ward is looking more and more like the first overall pick. Let's scout the Miami QB.

In Minecraft, when you enter creative mode the world is absolutely in your hands. With no requirements to hold any of the resources in your rolodex to create, you're only limited by your own mind. However, that doesn't mean you can't create a TNT block and blow your project up, and then your replica Viking longship you took three days to build is ruined. With all the great tools in your arsenal, it comes with a lot of fun--but in the wrong circumstances and a really difficult mod, the experience can turn nasty really quick.

Think of Miami QB Cam Ward as a player who is in Minecraft creative mode on the hardest mods. After a college football career that spanned stops at FCS Incarnate Word and Washington State, Ward turned a phenomenal season at Miami into potentially being the first player picked off the board in the 2025 NFL Draft. After taking a look at what Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders brings to the table, let's look at Ward and what he can be at the next level.

What immediately stands out about Ward is his feel for playmaking and productivity outside the pocket. If every QB has a superpower, Ward's is his ability to extend plays. Despite not being a dominant or overwhelming athlete by any means, Ward has an innate ability to make nothing into something late in the down and do the creative stuff we talked about in Minecraft. On 69 attempts outside the pocket, Ward is first among draft-eligible QBs such as Sanders, Ole Miss' Jaxson Dart, Alabama's Jalen Milroe and Louisville's Tyler Shough in Boom Rate, meaning plays that end with an EPA over one on the play. His knack for the incredible outside the pocket shows up under pressure as well, where he uses that athleticism to make throws like this one:

Or this one:

What else really stands out about Ward is the upper body mechanics and release, especially in the quick game. Cory Kinnan extensively charts and scouts QBs, and Ward's ability to hit in the quick game is about average sitting at about 85%. He has a flexible release and is very similar to a shortstop, working and manipulating different arm angles in the RPO game to massive success. He's able to drop his arm to fit passes around defenders and make wonky looking passes that every high school quarterback in America is going to try and do (and fail).

While he can access the netherite sword that is these arm angles and plays outside the pocket, his decision making has improved a bit since his time at Washington State. Ward used to be a guy who would not cook by the book. However, he's shown flashes of some big boy quarterbacking from inside the pocket and process that you can at least work with. While it's not super consistent (we'll get to that later), you can see the vision when he's playing composed and has his mechanics in check (we'll also get to that later). Of all the impressive throws Ward made at Miami, this touchdown against Virginia Tech is one of my favorites. 

To his right, he's got a bunch formation with the outside receiver running an out, his tight end running a sit route and his slot receiver running a corner. What I love so much about this throw is the little shoulder shimmy he gives to the outside corner, to make him hesitate towards the out route, then throw this corner behind him in the void. That's Sunday QB'ing.

This one against Syracuse is pretty nice as well, with Ward working to this frontside dig after looking off the backside linebacker. From the end zone view, you can see how Ward manipulates LB #8 by looking him over to grass, then coming back to his receiver breaking across the middle of the field. This is nice stuff from the Hurricanes' QB.

Where Ward can fall short comes back to Minecraft. In Minecraft, you can fly too close to the sun in creative mode, and end up blowing up something you were working on. When you're in survival mode, you might think you're able to go and get some more iron ore that you see over the river, but then you get over there and it's dark and there are monsters around. Ward is just a good athlete with a good arm, with his release and arm angles working more than his arm strength. When we talk about Ward being reckless, it starts a bit with his mechanics and base, which saps his arm strength. 

When charting Ward, Kinnan also noted that the Miami QB finished 18/43 on deep passes this season, a 41.86% number that comes in well below the mark for first round QBs he's charted over the last three years. In addition to that, Ward is below average when throwing to the boundary as well. Despite having a good arm, I kept wondering why Ward would have just these really weird misses, and I think it comes down to his feet.

Ward has a very Air Raidy lower half when it comes to mechanics. With all due respect to the late Mike Leach, the lower body mechanics of Air Raid QBs are very ... vibey. Ward has a tendency to drift in the pocket and his base will become compromised because every throw is off platform. Unless you're Green Bay Packers' QB Jordan Love (who has a rocket for an arm), that's not a sustainable way to live in the NFL. 

Ward will sometimes shut off his torque by literally stopping his motion. It's like slamming the brakes on an F1 car, sure you might still move forward, but it won't go nearly as far with nearly as much accuracy. My colleague (and QB expert) Mark Schofield said that Ward's front leg is locking, and not finishing through his front foot. 

Ready for an exercise? Get up and pretend to throw the ball like an NFL QB. Everything for the most part feel normal, right? Now, try and do it without bringing your back leg through. That's what Ward is doing, and I think it's messing with his ball placement. Ward's small hands might play into his lack of accuracy outside the numbers, but I think it's more just wonky lower body mechanics. You can see how Ward's body sort of jams up when he throws the ball, and it leads to sailed passes like this one.

Look at this vertical pass outside the numbers for Ward. Again, you see his lower body lock out, and the accuracy dips. This happens a lot on throws outside the numbers, which is part of why I think he can be even better at the NFL level--with the proper coaching.

You can get away with some flawed mechanics if you have an elite, elite arm (see: Love, Jordan), but in Ward's case, some of that stuff has to be cleaned up. The good thing is, we've seen that Ward can be good mechanically. I think for the most part on the quick game work and most passes over the middle, his lower body is much more in sync. Look at this throw against Virginia Tech. All his cleats are in the ground, and he unlocks his front leg, showing off some really nice ball placement.

The holding on to the ball stuff is something that I think I worry less about when it comes to Ward, however. Yes, he's holding on to the ball, but I think what an NFL team will tell Ward at the next level is to know when to fold. Ward is never going to let a play die, and while it comes with highlight plays like we got at the top, we also get moments like this:

We've seen Ward make throws where he manipulates second level defenders, and he's got the opportunity to here with the MIKE, but he ends up drifting from the Cal 45 to Miami's 45 and eating a sack. That can't happen in the NFL.

Where I also think Ward will work in the NFL is being able to succeed as a scrambler. He's a thicker player at 219 pounds, and is incredibly tough. Among all college QBs last year with at least 20 scrambles, Ward was first in the country in First Down Rate as a scrambler and had an 87% Positive Play Rate. That's pretty damn good, and an indicator that he can make timely scrambles.

Ultimately, Ward's NFL trajectory depends on one thing, in my opinion. The first of which is if he's a good enough athlete to compensate for some of the wonky mechanics and tendency to break some of the rules at the position. Jordan Love is one of the purest examples of this, a guy who doesn't always cook by the book but has the athletic talent to make it work anyway. Ward is going to pass up on easy completions to look for the big play, he's gonna hunt for the touchdown — which is good! But can he be a good enough athlete at the position to live like that? And if not can he grow as a passer? 

I think it's worth the risk for Ward, who is seemingly running away with QB1 right now. While I think the margins are much thinner between he and Sanders, Ward can win in the NFL--with the right coaching.

For pregnant women in the U.S., the use of oral health services during pregnancy remains low, with fewer than 40% seeking preventive oral health care. So reports a new study conducted by the Oral Health Workforce Research Center, part of the Center for Health Workforce Studies at the University at Albany's College of Integrated Health Sciences, which was featured on the cover of this month's issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association.

UAlbany researchers analyzed data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a longstanding data repository maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2016 and 2020. Disparities in gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders were highlighted, with higher odds of these pregnancy complications among lower-income and minority women. 

Lack of regular preventive oral health care and delaying dental treatment during pregnancy increases the risk of developing dental diseases such as periodontal disease, which is potentially associated with gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders.

The research team found that pregnant women who received preventive oral health care or visited a dentist or a dental clinic for oral health problems during pregnancy did in fact have a lower risk of developing gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders.

Our findings reinforce the connection between oral health and overall health. Integrating oral health education and services into maternal health care and expanding the oral health workforce through training, better distribution and interprofessional collaboration with prenatal care providers can improve access to oral health services for pregnant women - especially in underserved populations - and help reduce the risks of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders.""

Challenging assumptions about infant memory, a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study shows that babies as young as 12 months old can encode memories, researchers report. The findings suggest that infantile amnesia – the inability to remember our first few years of life – is more likely caused by memory retrieval failures rather than an inability to form memories in the first place.

Despite infancy being a period of rapid learning, memories from this time do not persist into later childhood or adulthood. In general, humans cannot recall events from the first three years of life – a phenomenon known as infantile amnesia. Why grown humans have a years-long blind spot in their episodic memory for the period of infancy remains a puzzle. One theory suggests this occurs because the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for episodic memory, is not fully developed during infancy. However, research in rodents challenges this idea, showing that memory traces, or engrams, are formed in the infant hippocampus but become inaccessible over time.

In humans, infants demonstrate memory through behaviors such as conditioned responses, imitation, and recognition of familiar stimuli. However, whether these abilities rely on the hippocampus or other brain structures remains unclear. In a study using fMRI to scan the brains of infants aged ~4 to 25 months while performing a memory task, Tristan Yates and colleagues aimed to determine whether the hippocampus in infants can encode individual memories. The memory task, adapted from a well-established method for adults, involved showing images to infants – faces, scenes, and objects – followed by a memory test based on preferential looking, all while undergoing neuroimaging. The findings show that the infant hippocampus has the capacity to encode memories of individual experiences beginning around 1 year of age, providing evidence that the capacity to form individual memories develops during infancy.

According to the authors, the presence of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during infancy – despite their ephemeral nature – suggests that infantile amnesia is more likely due to failures in memory retrieval mechanisms. These insights align with recent studies in rodents, which demonstrate that memories created during infancy can persist into adulthood but remain inaccessible for retrieval without direct stimulation of hippocampal engrams or reminder cues, the authors note. In a Perspective, Adam Ramsaran and Paul Frankland discuss the study in greater detail.

Cardiff and Vale University Health Board have announced a no visiting policy due to a norovirus outbreak. In a statement, the health board say that have been experiencing ""exceptional pressure"" due to a ""significant increase"" in norovirus cases over the last week.

The outbreak has affected a number of wards and resulted in a series of bed closures. Cardiff and Vale UHB said: ""As a result of this challenging position, we have made the difficult decision to implement a no visiting policy and close the health board to all general visiting to manage this outbreak.

""This is not a decision we have taken lightly, but one that is imperative to protect our patients, staff and visitors and reduce the spread of infection."" The health board added that they will be reviewing the restrictions next week if the situation has improved. Stay informed on the latest health news by signing up to our newsletter here

Exceptions will be considered in some cases, particularly for those patients who are critically ill or receiving end of life care, birthing partners and the Children's Hospital for Wales. The policy also does not affect outpatient appointments which will be going ahead unless you have been contacted by the department directly to explain otherwise.

Cardiff and Vale UHB manage the following hospitals in and around the capital: University Hospital of Wales, University Hospital Llandough. UHL Ward Visiting Times. Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales, Barry Hospital, St David's Hospital, Hafan y Coed Mental Health Unit, Cardiff Royal Infirmary and the University Dental Hospital.

Those who are able to visit hospitals are expected to maintain good hygiene practice by washing their hands thoroughly with soap and water and by adhering to infection prevention and control precautions. Those who are feeling unwell are being asked to remain at home until you have been clear of symptoms for at least 48 hours.

The health board said: ""Most norovirus cases can be managed at home with rest, fluids and self-care and symptoms typically improve within 2 to 3 days. If you are unsure of your symptoms, you can check them using the NHS 111 Wales online symptom checker, which has a wealth of information, advice and guidance for a range of different conditions.

""If you think you need urgent healthcare advice or to access out-of-hours services, please call 111 first and speak with a clinician. Please remember, our Emergency Unit should only be used for emergencies.

""Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping to keep our patients, staff and visitors safe.""

Flu levels are now at their lowest for more than three months.

The Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano in south-central Indonesia erupted three times into Friday, sending an ash column 8,000 meters (26,000 feet) high and prompting authorities to expand the danger zone around the volcano.  The volcano on the remote island of Flores in East Nusa Tenggara province has had hundreds of earthquakes and visible volcanic activity has significantly increased in the last seven days.  An eruption followed by an explosion was heard Thursday evening as far away as Larantuka and Maumere, two cities about 50 kilometers (30 miles) to 85 kilometers (53 miles) from the volcano.

LL Cool J is returning to NCIS!

The rapper and actor, 57, shared via an Instagram post Thursday, March 20, that he will reprise his role as Sam Hanna on an April episode of NCIS season 22.

“Guess who's back,” read a video message jointly posted by LL Cool J and the NCIS Instagram account. A mysterious figure is then seen wiping the screen to reveal himself as LL Cool J.

“Back on set, baby. NCIS. Let's get it,” he said in the video.





A post shared by The NCISverse (@ncisverse)



The video concluded with the air date for LL Cool J's return episode: April 21.

LL Cool J first played former Navy SEAL Sam on an episode of NCIS season 6 in May 2009. That episode acted as a backdoor pilot for NCIS: Los Angeles, which premiered on CBS that September and ran for 14 seasons through May 2023.

After NCIS: Los Angeles concluded, LL Cool J reprised his role as Sam on NCIS: Hawai'i seasons 2 and 3. The show, also starring Vanessa Lachey, was canceled in April 2024 after three seasons. CBS cited the cost of the show and its ratings as the reasons for the cancelation.

“It is incumbent on us to always keep the schedule fresh, keep momentum going. We had to make some really tough choices this year,” CBS Entertainment president Amy Reisenbach said in May 2024, per Variety. “Everything came back [from the Hollywood strikes] really strong, but ultimately we have to look at the cohesiveness of the schedule flow. We have to evaluate the financials and the performance overall, and we make tough decisions.”

Lachey shared her reaction via her Instagram Story at the time. “Gutted, confused, blindsided,” she wrote over the NCIS: Hawai'i logo. “Grateful, confident, beloved fans!”

“Processing this news and still being present with my family. I Love You all! Mahalo Nui Loa,” she added.

A couple of days later, Lachey said she was having a hard time explaining the cancelation to her daughter, Brooklyn, 10. (Lachey also shares sons Camden, 12, and Phoenix, 8, with husband Nick Lachey.)

“Trying to explain this news to my daughter … and she makes me Mickey ears so I can ‘smile,'” Lachey shared in an Instagram Story post. “This decision was bigger than a TV show.”

Southern Charm star Venita Aspen is moving on from Jarrett “JT” Thomas and has her eyes on a One Chicago cast member.

“There is a man that is on NBC that I have my eye on,” Venita, 31, revealed during a Thursday, March 20, appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “He's a Chicago P.D. [star].”

Venita also told host Andy Cohen that she's currently single, but did slide into the mystery man's Instagram DMs.

“I just found him a couple of weeks ago and I think he's handsome,” she continued. “I slid in his DMs and I said, ‘It's so funny we work for the same network but we never ran into each other.' I got a follow and a response.”



Social media users were quick to wonder if Venita was referring to LaRoyce Hawkins, who has played Kevin Atwater on the NBC show since its 2014 debut. Us Weekly can confirm that Venita and LaRoyce follow each other on Instagram — and we don't see any other cast members on her follow list!

Venita has been candid with details regarding her love life after fellow Southern Charm cast member JT did her “so dirty” when they briefly dated.

“We started dating when I got back from New York in September [2024]. It was from September, October, November,” she told Us exclusively earlier this week. “Trying to figure out, ‘OK, are we doing this? Do we actually like each other? Is it because we're around each other all the time?'”



A post shared by Watch What Happens Live! (@bravowwhl)



JT posted his girlfriend, a woman named Ali Pereless, on Instagram, which is how she found out he was dating someone else. (JT, for his part, has downplayed his relationship with Venita. The pair will hash it out at the upcoming reunion.)

“I think it would've been nice to just have him be like, ‘Hey by the way, I'm dating someone else, and I've decided to go with her versus you,'” Venita continued. “I would not have cared. I'm like, ‘Oh my God, I appreciate you so much for saying something, being kind about it.' But he didn't do that.”

Ventia further claimed that season 10 of Southern Charm, which aired its season finale last night, has made her look like a “homewrecker” amid JT's current romance.

“It's so messy,” Venita added, noting that she wishes JT would speak out and admit he “caused all this.” When it comes to the future of their friendship, Ventia told Us that there's no way back.

“Now the door's completely shut. Closed and barred. Padlocked. No one's getting here,” she said. “I was still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and be like, just communicate with me and talk me through it.

Justin Baldoni is responding to Blake Lively's latest legal move.

Blake filed a motion to dismiss Justin's defamation lawsuit on Thursday (March 20) and cited a California law protecting individuals who report allegations of sexual misconduct from retaliatory lawsuits. If granted, Justin's claims would be dismissed, and he could be required to cover Blake‘s legal fees.

Through a statement released by his attorney Bryan Freedman, the actor is responding to the motion to dismiss his lawsuit against Blake.

Keep reading to find out more...

""Ms. Lively's recent motion to dismiss herself from the self-concocted disaster she initiated is one of the most abhorrent examples of abusing our legal system,"" Freedman said in a statement provided to JustJared.com.

The statement continued, ""Stringent rules are put into place to protect the innocent and allow individuals to rightfully defend themselves. Laws are not meant to be twisted and curated by privileged elites to fit their own personal agenda. As we said yesterday in response to Mr. Reynolds' same cowardly measures, we will continue to hold Ms. Lively accountable for her actions of pure malice which include falsely accusing my clients of harassment and retaliation. Her fantastical claims will be swiftly debunked as discovery moves forward, easily disproved with actual, evidentiary proof.""

Ryan Reynolds‘ legal team also just filed paperwork to dismiss the Justin Baldoni complaint against him.

The first season of Shifting Gears, a new ABC comedy series, came to an end this week and we have some details to share about a potential second season.

ABC has not yet renewed Shifting Gears for season two, but it seems likely to happen and the show's executive producer Michelle Nader is already coming up with ideas for the storyline.

The show follows a widower Matt (Tim Allen) who runs an auto shop, who reluctantly takes in his estranged daughter Riley (Kat Dennings) and her two children.

Keep reading to find out more...

At the end of the first season, Matt shared a kiss with Eve, played by guest star Jenna Elfman. She's confirmed to return if the show is renewed!

""Yes to more Eve! We are so lucky to have Jenna in the show. And Eve and Matt are such unlikely animal friends. Their chemistry is very spicy so I am personally dying to see where this goes,"" Nader told TVLine.

Eve was the one who made a move on Matt and kissed him, which was a surprise to him. So, will he be ready to pursue a relationship in season two?

""Matt was very in love with his wife and was in a relationship for his whole life. Dating another woman is going to be a hard for a guy like him. But yeah, he definitely is intrigued by Eve. How could he not be,"" Nader said.

Riley hasn't yet kissed Gabe (Seann William Scott), so will that happen in season two?

""We are rooting for Riley and Gabe but timing is going to be the issue for them. I'll leave it at that for now!"" Nader said.

It has also been confirmed that Lucas Neff's Jimmy will return for season two and Riley's brother Sam will be introduced. ""We hope to introduce Sam in Season 2.  We think he will be another fun casting opportunity and a great character for everyone to complain to!"" Nader said.

So, what does Kat have to say about the next season?

“If you have kids or were in a long relationship and it ends, you realize that you used to be a certain thing and now you feel distanced from that. So who are you now?” she told TheWrap. “I'd be so excited to see her branch out with hobbies, trying to make friends… not just another boyfriend coming in.”

Ben Foster and Laura Prepon are in the middle of a messy divorce and they both have allegations about the other in newly-filed court documents.

The former couple split last year after six years of marriage and Ben filed for divorce in November 2024, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the split.

Now, Ben has filed an amended divorce petition in which he accuses Laura of ""inappropriate marital conduct.""

Keep reading to find out more...

In the court documents, which were obtained by In Touch, Ben says the ""irreconcilable differences"" have made him and Laura “unable to live together successfully as husband and wife.”

Ben's lawyer said, “[Ben] would respectfully show that [Laura] has been guilty of such cruel and inhuman treatment or conduct (i.e.; inappropriate marital conduct) towards [Ben] … which renders further cohabitation unsafe and improper.”

Ben wants his pre-nup with Laura to be enforced and for the court to determine a custody schedule for their two children. He also will pay the child support amount determined by the court. 

Laura is responding to the accusations and denies being guilty of inappropriate conduct in the marriage.

 “[Laura] asserts the affirmative defense to any allegations brought against her that the ill conduct of [Ben] was a justifiable cause for any conduct complained of against her and [Laura] therefore requests that this court dismiss [Ben's] cause of action for divorce,"" her lawyer said.

Laura has accused Ben of “cruel and inhuman treatment or conduct” and being guilty of “habitual drunkenness."" She hopes to be named the “designated the primary residential parent” of their kids.

Ben's lawyer responded by saying, “Laura Prepon's filing is the definition of falsehood and a disturbing fiction... [Laura's] decision to engage in a direct character attack on [Ben] in her response is perfectly illustrative of [Laura's] compulsion to seize and maintain control over every aspect of family life — regardless of who it hurts — and is also a shining example of why [Ben] chose to file for divorce.”

Oscar-winning Forrest Gump writer Eric Roth is set to write the script for the movie, based on Joe Cote's Reddit story, titled, ""I pretended to be a missing girl so I could rob her family.” 

The movie ""centers on a young woman who shows up at a family's doorsteps ten years after their 18-year-old daughter went missing. Her plan is to convince the family she is their missing child, and stay just for one night — long enough to steal some valuables and get away.""

Sydney is actually the one who brought the writer on board, and Warner Bros has won the rights to distribute the film. She will produce through her Fifty-Fifty Films production banner, with the author of the original Reddit story, Joe Cote also executive producing.

The actress has a handful of projects in the works, including  The Housemaid, the Christy Martin biopic and the upcoming third season of Euphoria.

The new musical Buena Vista Social Club is now open on Broadway and a star-studded group of celebs attended the special performance!

Lupita Nyong'o, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Eva Longoria, Ariana DeBose, and so many more attended the opening event on Wednesday (March 19) at the Schoenfeld Theatre in New York City.

Inspired by true events, the new Broadway musical brings the Grammy Award-winning album Buena Vista Social Club to thrilling life—and tells the story of the legends who lived it. A world-class Afro-Cuban band is joined by a sensational cast in this unforgettable tale of survival, second chances, and the extraordinary power of music. 

Lin‘s father Luis Miranda is one of the show's producers, alongside Orin Wolf, John Styles, and Tony winners LaChanze and John Leguizamo, who were all at the opening.

Lupita was at the event to support her childhood friend Saheem Ali, who is the director of the new musical. On Instagram two years ago, she revealed, “When I was 14 years old, Saheem and I met onstage in Kenya – he was Mercutio, I was Juliet. We didn't become friends until 15 years later when we met in NY, both out of college and trying to figure out life as immigrants.”

More celebs who attended included Margaret Qualley and Jack Antonoff, Sara Bareilles, Wilmer Valderrama, Jim Parsons, Nile Rodgers, Daphne Rubin-Vega, and others.

Joey Bada$$ is back on Power Book III: Raising Kanan, though his character, Unique, was nearly killed off in the show's third season.

A fan-favorite on the cast, he tells ABC Audio it was ""actually dope to see how much love and appreciation people have for the character in the event of his 'demise.' But it was also cool to see how people felt when they found out, 'Oh, s***, he's actually not gone,' too.""

As seen in the first two episodes of season 4, Unique survived with the help of an under-the-radar doctor, who warned his injuries could lead to personality changes if he didn't receive professional help. Those changes are coupled with his desire to seek vengeance against Raq and all those who he felt had conspired against him.

Joey says it's different than the vengeance Unique's brother sought in season 3 because Ronnie had ""more of, like, a social disorder."" While he notes that they had similarities in their anger and frustration, he says Unique was previously ""able to contain that and use it to his advantage and, like, be smart about it.""

""I think now with the brain injury he's way more prone to flying off the handle,"" Joey adds. That showed up when Unique killed Raq's lawyer after secretly seeing the two and assuming they were together. When asked whether any of that had to do with Unique loving Raq, Joey says, ""There's a lot of conflicting ideas, thoughts and emotions going on in his head, but I think they're all scrambled because of the brain injury.""

Oh, hey, also - not a huge deal - but if you see my innie, please don't mention any of this to him. Thanks.”

Organizers of the Toronto-based Departure Festival announce the event's rebranding from Canadian Music Week at an event in this November 2024 handout photo. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO - Departure Festival, George Pimentel Photography

TORONTO - The founder of Canadian Music Week is taking the new owners of Departure Festival to court, alleging they've breached their contract and failed to pay fees tied to their acquisition of his music industry conference.

Former CMW president and creator Neill Dixon filed a notice of action in an Ontario court earlier this week seeking more than $435,000 in damages and another $50,000 in punitive and aggravated damages.

Dixon alleges Loft Entertainment and developer Oak View Group failed to live up to their side of the $2-million purchase of his Toronto music industry festival, which ran for more than 40 years before he announced his retirement and its sale last June.

He says the defendants began paying him through an Ontario numbered company they co-owned, but that $378,928 has remained outstanding since last December. He also says they owe him another $56,000 in unpaid consulting fees.

None of the allegations have been tested in court. 

Loft Entertainment was co-founded by Randy Lennox, the former head of Bell Media and a one-time Canadian record label executive. Oak View is a Denver-based company that recently opened offices in Toronto.

On Thursday, Lennox sent an email to staff at Loft Entertainment assuring them the festival is moving ahead this year.

""We see things very differently,"" he said of the legal action. ""We stand firm in our position of integrity, beliefs and values.""

A representative for Departure, who forwarded Lennox's email, told The Canadian Press he would not provide further comment on the allegations. 

Dixon did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent by email to him and his lawyers. 

The four-day CMW was founded in 1982 and built a reputation as one of the music scene's leading industry events, hosting conferences, awards shows and live performances.

Since buying CMW last year, the event's new owners have rebranded it as Departure Festival and Conference, expanding its scope to include stand-up comedy and technology.

The inaugural Departure event is planned to begin May 6 and run for six days, with celebrity speakers that include pop duo Tegan and Sara, Arkells frontman Max Kerman and rocker Bryan Adams.

Dixon was previously announced as the recipient of a Departure lifetime achievement award to help kick off the first year.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 21, 2025.

Coco 2 is in development at Pixar Animation Studios.

Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger confirmed during the company's annual meeting of shareholders that the sequel, a follow-up of the 2017 original, is in ""the initial stages"".

He said: ""While the film is just in the initial stages, we know it will be full of humour, heart and adventure.

""And we can't wait to share more soon.""

The original movie — which won two Oscars, for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for Remember Me — told the story of 12-year-old Miguel, who dreamed of becoming a musician, despite his family's generations-old ban on music.

However, Miguel headed to the Land of the Dead to unlock the real story behind his family history.

Coco 2 will feature a reunion of the team behind the original movie, with Oscar-winning director Lee Unkrich and co-director Adrian Molina returning to helm the motion picture.

What's more, Mark Nielsen will produce the forthcoming film.

Anthony Gonzalez voiced the role of Miguel in the first film, and Gael García Bernal was Hector, Miguel's great-great-grandfather in the Land of the Dead.

Edward James Olmos portrayed Hector's friend Chicharrón in Coco, and he previously told how he was ""in heaving sobs"" after reading the script for the first film.

Speaking to Collider, Olmos said: ""They [Disney] came to me and invited me to Pixar, where they literally wined and dined me at their studio, and then they told me about the story. They didn't tell me everything about it and what the twists were, which I'm very grateful for. That way, I was caught just like everybody else. I remember sitting there in heaving sobs, thinking about my own grandmother, my own relatives and those that have gone already.

""Emotionally, it was just like, 'wow'! The whole idea was achieved and attained. My character, which I was very proud of playing, is in one scene, but people who see the movie understand the depths of what we're talking about, in that moment.

""If no one thinks about you anymore or remembers you, you disappear and vanish. I hadn't thought about my grandparents in a while, but I started to think about the stories that I could tell about my life with them and what I remember.

""My father is gone and my mother is 91, and we already tell stories about her. It's fun!""

In an emotional Instagram post, Amaal explained how his mental health has been deeply affected by the actions of ""near and dear ones,"" including his parents, composer Daboo Malik and singer Jyoti Malik. He said that the situation had diminished his self-worth and left him emotionally drained. Despite these struggles, he acknowledged that the toll it has taken on him was primarily personal, and while he would continue to love his family, he chose to distance himself from them for the time being.

Amaal's message did not stop there. He also addressed the media, asking them not to sensationalize his vulnerability. He expressed his gratitude for the love and support he had received from fans but emphasized the importance of respecting his family's privacy. ""I would request the media portals to not harass my family... Please don't sensationalize & give negative headlines to my vulnerability,"" Amaal wrote, urging the media to handle his personal matters with sensitivity.

Despite the ongoing personal turmoil, Amaal made it clear that his relationship with his younger brother, singer Armaan Mallik, remains unchanged. ""Nothing changes between us brothers, Armaan and I are one and nothing can come between us,"" he assured fans. Amaal's message of peace and love for his family signified that while he is stepping away for his mental well-being, his bond with Armaan remains as strong as ever.

Amaal's open admission of his struggles with depression resonated with many of his followers, who expressed their support. His decision to distance himself from family ties, though difficult, was seen as a necessary step towards healing. The composer, known for his music in films such as Jai Ho, Khoobsurat, Roy, and MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, has always been open about his personal life, and this latest post further sheds light on the mental and emotional toll he has been grappling with.

As he continues to navigate his personal challenges, Amaal has requested that the media allow him and his family the space to heal, emphasizing that his focus remains on maintaining peace and love in his life.

Comedian and YouTuber Samay Raina has announced the rescheduling of his much-anticipated India tour, leaving fans disappointed but understanding. The move comes amidst the ongoing legal controversy surrounding his comedy show India's Got Latent, which has caused a stir on social media and attracted significant attention from law enforcement.


In a story on Instagram, Samay Raina wrote, “Hello guys, I am rescheduling my India tour. You all will get the refunds shortly, see you soon.”

Samay Raina's comedy show ‘Unfiltered,' which was set to take place at Delhi's Talkatora Stadium recently, was cancelled amid the India's Got Latent controversy. Both the shows of Samay Raina were sold-out before they were cancelled.

It has not been easy for Samay Raina after he found himself at the centre of a controversy after a YouTube episode of India's Got Latent, where fellow YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made controversial remarks about parental sex, triggering laughter but also widespread outrage. The clip quickly went viral, sparking a nationwide debate and leading to an FIR being filed against several YouTubers, including Raina, Ashish Chanchlani, and Allahbadia, for allegedly promoting obscenity and inappropriate content.

The incident has drawn significant backlash, and the controversy continues to unfold, with the involved parties facing legal scrutiny. The Maharashtra Cyber Police are currently investigating the matter, having already summoned over 30 individuals for questioning.

Raina has yet to give his statement to the Maharashtra Cyber Cell, which has already questioned Ashish Chanchlani and Ranveer Allahbadia. Meanwhile, the controversial episode, which featured Allahbadia making comments about parents and sex, has led to multiple police complaints against the show's creators.

As part of the fallout, Raina cancelled his shows in Delhi, scheduled for March 21 and 23, as well as shows in Gujarat earlier this year. Additionally, Raina deleted all episodes of India's Got Latent from YouTube.

Despite the controversy, some fans have defended the comedians, arguing that their edgy humour should not be censored. Others, however, believe the content crossed the line. The ongoing investigation and the attention this case is attracting highlight the growing tension between free expression and moral standards in today's digital entertainment landscape.

As the case progresses, Raina and his colleagues remain at the centre of a storm that continues to unfold in the public eye.

Plus, a look at the new watch servicing program.

Sotheby's has just announced a partnership with WatchCheck, a relatively new but intriguing company that launched last year. The partnership aims to provide an easier, seamless servicing process for over 38,000 models. WatchCheck gives customers access to servicing partners in the United States that were previously largely accessible only to commercial clients.

I had a chance to check out the process for WatchCheck last year, and it's quite intuitive and reduces many of the issues that often cause repairs to be a headache (especially if you don't live in a big city). The project was founded by Linden Lazarus (founder of vintage retailer Oliver and Clarke) and Will Haering. When you go to WatchCheck's site, you have to input a few bits of information about the make and model, upload some pictures of the watch, and describe the issue. After providing your address, you'll get an estimate from the company and receive a shipping kit. Inside the box is a pre-labeled external shipping box and a padded internal box with yet another foam insert where you place your watch. Slide it back inside and drop the watch off for shipping, and you're pretty much set.

While WatchCheck facilitates the service, Stoll & Co. in Dayton, OH, evaluates and services the watch. They offer various services, from simple repairs and battery replacements to grand complications and case refinishing (if that's your thing). Stoll & Co. is an authorized US repair center for several brands, but their expertise extends beyond the companies on their website.

Stoll & Co. is also a part of eBay's Authenticity program. A little search on Google shows you that the program hasn't been without its faults. However, with over 40 years of experience and 40 trained watchmakers, they're one of the most experienced companies of their kind in the United States.

After receiving the watch and making an inspection, WatchCheck will update you with a final price for service, which you can approve or decline. When the watch is returned to you, it comes in the internal box you shipped it with, which will also contain your receipt and warranty information.

While a lot of us (including many at Hodinkee) think of auction houses like Sotheby's as the place you go looking for the most untouched example of rare vintage watches, the fact of the matter is that modern and neo-vintage pieces make up a large portion of the volume Sotheby's sells. They also have a lot of customers who might not be enthusiasts who enjoy watches that look worn, nor do they have the contacts with watchmakers to service the watches they've picked up at auction (or through Sotheby's pre-owned selection). A service like this will make a lot of sense for those kinds of customers.

For more information, visit WatchCheck's website or Sotheby's Service website.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news","Tesla springs last-minute public all hands on staffers, confusion ensues","https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-springs-last-minute-public-all-hands-on-staffers-2025-3","Fri, 21 Mar 2025 02:41:00 GMT","

Tesla notified employees of an all-hands shortly before the event, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.

The company sent employees a link to a Teams chat and an X livestream on Thursday night with the message ""Join the Company All Hands to hear about Tesla's recent achievements and how we're making the impossible possible.""

The event was set to kick off at 9:30 p.m. ET.

Some workers expressed confusion about the event and the short notice for the company meeting, according to Teams messages viewed by BI. Typically, Tesla hosts all-hands during regular work hours, and it is the first all-hands the carmaker has streamed publicly.

""It feels a bit hasty. No one was expecting this tonight and we're all just trying to catch up,"" a Tesla engineer told BI, adding that some employees heard about the event on social media first and were questioning whether it was real.

Another worker told BI the event felt like a ""publicity stunt.""

""This is for the investors, not the workers,"" the employee said.

Adding to the confusion, Tesla posted a livestream link before the event was set to kick off, only to end the livestream and delete it about 30 minutes later. During the livestream, a man's voice could be heard saying several seemingly random things, including ""Dylan on stage"" and ""Stock parts. Joe. That's the best I can do.""Some workers said they tried to access the livestream but the link on X didn't work, as Tesla sent a link to a livestream that had been deleted.

Tesla restarted a new livestream shortly before 9:30 p.m. ET, but the livestream remained silent for nearly 30 minutes.

Elon Musk tweeted a link to the event at 9:45 p.m. ET.

Tesla all-hands live presentation  https://t.co/jQOt6WB2LN

The event began streaming at 9:58 p.m. and ended at 11:00 p.m. ET. Musk's private jet arrived in Austin just two hours before he addressed workers in the Texas Gigafactory.

Musk spent the first half of the hour-long call providing updates on Tesla, touching on the company's safety record, delivery figures, and its progress in autonomous driving and robotics.

He then spent the rest of the session taking questions from his employees.

Tesla has been facing headwinds in recent months. The carmaker's stock is down more than 37% year-to-date and a series of protests have erupted across Tesla sales and service centers over the past few weeks.

""If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?"" Musk said on Thursday night.

""Listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable,"" he continued.

Musk also talked about Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions during the meeting, saying that self-driving will unlock the company's true value.

""It's very difficult for people in the stock market — especially those that look in the rear-view mirror, which is most people — to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,"" Musk told his workers.

""So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'"" Musk added.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets provisionally closed lower on Friday, led by declines in the travel sector which was down 1.6% after the closure of Heathrow airport.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 and French CAC 40 were both about 0.6% lower by 4.40 p.m. London time, while the the German DAX shed 0.5%. London's FTSE 100 was about 0.6% lower.

The travel and leisure sector lost about 1.6% after London's Heathrow Airport closed on Friday following a fire at a nearby electrical substation. British Airways-owner International Airlines Group was trading around 1.9% lower.

Basic resources — including stocks such as ArcelorMittal and wood pulp processor Stora Enso — were down about 2.3%.

European investors digested monetary policy updates that came from multiple central banks in the region, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve, this week.

The Bank of Russia held its key rates at 21% on Friday, citing high inflationary pressures. On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank trimmed interest rates by 25 basis points, while the Bank of England held rates steady in the U.K. and Sweden's Riksbank also opted not to alter interest rates.

""Since [our] previous meeting, global trade policy uncertainty has intensified, and the United States has made a range of tariff announcements, to which some governments have responded,"" the Bank of England said on Thursday. ""Other geopolitical uncertainties have also increased and indicators of financial market volatility have risen globally.""

It came after the Fed also kept its key interest rate steady on Wednesday. Although the central bank said it still sees two rate cuts happening this year, officials cut their 2025 economic growth forecast for the U.S. and noted that uncertainty had increased, with tariffs poised to add inflationary pressure.

— CNBC's Sophie Kiderlin and Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Fabrizio Palermo, CEO of Italian utilities company ACEA, said the world is not prepared for the water consumption demands of running artificial intelligence.

""Estimates by year 2030 are saying that basically, the water consumption linked to AI can reach a level as high as the full consumption of the US,"" Palermo told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe. ""This is significant, and clearly the world is not ready for that.""

""The situation is critical. We are going towards what can be called the new water era ... we need to be prepared for this new water transition,"" he added.

Palermo also said that AI can help with water management, such as predicting future water availability. He added that  awareness of the demand for water was ""rising,"" with the European Commission's appointment of a commissioner for water resilience.

JPMorgan's Head of Global Multi-Asset Strategy John Bilton said markets will likely be in a ""better place"" next year.

""If we take a step back and think: 'Where are we going to be a year from now?' chances are we're probably still going to be in a better place, and that starts to inform how you think about taking risk in these markets,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday.

Bilton referred to moves from Germany to reform borrowing rules and ""reasonable"" corporate profit expectations as more positive data points.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could cause ""a little bit more chop"" to markets ahead of the duties coming into effect on April 2, Bilton said, adding that he expected more positive news to come on fiscal boosts and deregulation, which could provide a ""boost"" in the second half of 2025.

— Lucy Handley

Aviation expert Anita Mendiratta said the implications of the fire and power outage causing the closure of London's Heathrow Airport on Friday were ""very wide.""

""The growth of the [aviation] industry is happening faster than the growth of infrastructure,"" said Mendiratta, founder of consultancy AM&A, speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday. ""All of this is a very dramatic learning curve,"" she said.

Mendiratta described the growth of aviation globally as ""massive.""

""It is extreme in terms of how it has grown far beyond even 2019 rates,"" she said. This raises questions over the industry's resilience to unplanned weather or geopolitical events and whether the surrounding infrastructure can support it.

The three major averages traded lower in the U.S. Friday morning.

Just after the opening bell, the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 321 points, or about 0.8%.

— Sean Conlon

In a note to clients after German lawmakers passed public borrowing reforms that will pave the way for higher national defense spending, economists at Deutsche Bank declared it ""time to bake this fiscal regime shift into macro forecasts.""

The analysts now expect Germany's GDP growth to accelerate to 1.5% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027.

""That said, it will take time for the fiscal impulse to kick in, and we slightly lower our growth forecast for 2025 to 0.3% in light of stronger global cross-currents than we had previously expected,"" they said.

The German lender had previously forecast German economic growth of 0.5% for 2025 and 1% for 2026.

— Chloe Taylor

The Bank of Russia held its key rate unchanged at 21% on Friday, citing high inflationary pressures.

""The Bank of Russia estimates that the achieved tightness of monetary conditions creates the necessary prerequisites for returning inflation to the target in 2026,"" it said in a statement on Friday. ""Achieving the inflation target will require a long period of maintaining tight monetary conditions in the economy.""

The central bank's board of directors noted that maintaining a long period of ""tight monetary conditions in the economy,"" will allow inflation to return to target in 2026.

""If disinflation dynamics do not ensure achieving the inflation target, the Bank of Russia will consider raising the key rate,"" it said.

The central bank said Russia's annual inflation was 10.2% as of March 17 and could slim down to 7-8% in 2025, before returning to 4% in 2026 and staying at this target further onward.

""According to the baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia expects that inflationary pressures will continue to decline in the coming months. This will be supported by a cooldown in lending and high saving activity,"" it added.

Russia's economy has been battling high inflation and economic constrictions as a result of Western sanctions, which have particularly curtailed Moscow's key energy exports.

— Sawdah Bhaimiya

British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca on Friday said that it will invest $2.5 billion in a research and development center in Chinese capital Beijing.

The new hub is expected to take AstraZeneca's Beijing workforce to around 1,700 employees.

The investment in Beijing comes as part of a partnership with the city's Municipal Government and the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area Administrative Office, AstraZeneca said.

Under the deal, AstraZeneca will enter research and development collaborations with biotech firms Harbour BioMed and Syneron Bio and will launch a joint venture with BioKangtai to develop, produce, and market vaccines for respiratory and other infectious diseases.

Anita Mendiratta, founder of consultancy Anita Mendiratta and Associates, discusses the consequences of the fire at London Heathrow Airport.

Citi issued a note on Friday over the potential impact of the Heathrow airport closure on IAG, the owner of British Airways:

""1) the 2017 IT outage cost ~£80m, including £30m in lost revenue; however, we believe much of the cost was compensation - today's fire would appear to be outside of the airline's control, so compensation may not be payable (although they will need to provide food and water and possibly hotel accommodation),"" Citi said in the note.

""2) it would appear to be one-off in nature, so we'd argue deserves a one times multiple (£80m is about 0.5% of market cap post tax; 3) if the airport does not open overnight, the costs would increase proportionally.""

— Sawdah Bhaimiya

A fire at a nearby electrical substation caused the closure of Heathrow Airport on Friday, affecting hundreds of flights in and out of the London transport hub. Here are some of the biggest movers as of 8:45 a.m. London time:

London's Heathrow Airport closed on Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage, airport officials said.

""Heathrow is experiencing a significant power outage across the airport due to a large fire at a nearby electrical substation. Whilst fire crews are responding to the incident, we do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored,"" a Heathrow spokesperson said.

""We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,"" the spokesperson said.

The airport will remain closed until at least 11:59 p.m. local time on Friday.

""We know this will be disappointing for passengers and we want to reassure that we are working as hard as possible to resolve the situation,"" a Heathrow spokesperson said.

London's FTSE 100 is expected to see little change at the open, according to IG, while Germany's DAX index and the French CAC 40 are slated to shed 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.- Johnson & Johnson (J&J) says it will expand in the United States in a big way.

On Friday, the healthcare and med-tech giant announced investments of more than $55 billion over the next four years in manufacturing, research and development, and technology.

The expansion includes four new U.S. manufacturing facilities; J&J broke ground on one of those facilities on Friday in Wilson, North Carolina, which will manufacture ""next-generation medicines for people living with cancer, immune-mediated and neurological diseases in America and around the world,"" the company said, in a news release.

Johnson & Johnson didn't reveal the location of the other three manufacturing sites. It did say it also would expand several existing sites across its medicine and med-tech businesses that will create high-paying, high-technology jobs.

J&J, which is headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, said the overall $55 billion in investments represents a 25% increase compared to the previous four years.

Johnson & Johnson is the second major pharmaceutical company in recent weeks to announce a boost in domestic manufacturing. Late last month, Eli Lilly, based in Indiana, said it would invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing sites in the U.S. 

President Trump has made it a priority to increase manufacturing in the U.S. He has raised the possibility of extending tariffs to the pharmaceutical industry.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, speaking at a company meeting on Thursday, said ‘it feels like Armageddon' after seeing news coverage of his dealerships and vehicles being targeted with violence. (YouTube/Tesla)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk urged his company's staff to ""hang onto your stock"" during an all-hands meeting in which he admitted that ""it feels like Armageddon"" after seeing news coverage of his dealerships and vehicles being targeted with violence. 

Speaking at the company's Texas gigafactory on Thursday night, Musk reassured workers by saying ""overall, it's good"" for Tesla, touting recent sales figures for its Model Y and Cybertruck vehicles. However, he added, ""If you read the news, it feels like Armageddon."" 

""I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. You're like — what is going on?"" Musk said. 

""Some people it's like, listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down — that's a bit unreasonable, you know. This is psycho,"" he continued, drawing laughs from the audience. ""Stop being psycho, OK?""

Tesla's stock price has plummeted in recent months as Musk's presence has become more frequent in Washington, D.C., leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for the Trump administration. 

As of early Friday, Tesla shares were around $236 in pre-market trading, down from a peak of nearly $480 in mid-December. 

Musk suggested during the meeting that employees should stay patient. 

""Autonomous Teslas will be everywhere. In five years, probably, we will have regulatory approval, I think globally, so you will have autonomous Teslas on every continent taking people on trip,s and almost the entire fleet — which will pass 10 million vehicles next year – is capable of full autonomy,"" he said.

""It's very difficult for people in the stock market — especially those that look in the rearview mirror, which is most people — to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million-vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,"" Musk continued. ""But it will compute in the future... so what I'm saying is, hang onto your stock."" 

The meeting took place Thursday after the Justice Department announced that three people were charged in federal cases involving attacks on Tesla properties in the U.S.

""People that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes the funders,"" President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!""

        The results are in for a test Google carried out in eight European countries.
    

Google has said that news is unprofitable for its adverting business following the results of an experiment it ran in eight European countries. 

The tech giant removed news from search results for 1 per cent of users for 2.5 months and on Friday announced the results of the test. 

“The study showed that when we removed this content, there was no change to Search ad revenue and a <1% (0.8%) drop in usage,” Google said. 

Paul Liu, Google's director of economics, said in a statement that they have ""seen a number of inaccurate reports that vastly overestimate the value of news content to Google"".

The company added in the report that the actual ad revenue impact “could not be statistically‬‭ distinguished from zero, either overall or by country”.

The experiment was carried out in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.

The test was also intended for France, but a French court blocked the move and warned Google would be fined for breaking an agreement with the antitrust authority. 

Google said the test was being carried out as part of the company's compliance with the European Copyright Directive (EUCD), one of the European Union's legal frameworks, and its licensing programme for EU news publishers.

The European law states that Google and similar bodies must pay news publishers for using parts of their content. However, the question of how much that content is worth could be an argument Google uses in negotiations.

France's competition watchdog fined Google €250 million last year for breaches linked to intellectual property rules for news media publishers. 

There were also concerns over Google's AI service using news publisher content to train its AI models for free.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Thursday walked back comments he made in January, when he cast doubt on whether useful quantum computers would hit the market in the next 15 years.

At Nvidia's “Quantum Day” event, part of the company's annual GTC Conference, Huang admitted that his comments came out wrong.

“This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” Huang said.

In January, Huang sent quantum computing stocks reeling when he said 15 years was “on the early side” in considering how long it would be before the technology would be useful. He said at the time that 20 years was a timeframe that “a whole bunch of us would believe.”

In his opening comments on Thursday, Huang drew comparisons between pre-revenue quantum companies and Nvidia's early days. He said it took over 20 years for Nvidia to build out its software and hardware business.

He also expressed surprise that his comments were able to move markets, and joked he didn't know that certain quantum computing companies were publicly traded.

“How could a quantum computer company be public?” Huang said.

The event included panels with representatives from 12 quantum companies and startups. It represents a truce of sorts between Nvidia, which makes more traditional computers, and the quantum computing industry. Several quantum execs fired back at Nvidia after Huang's earlier comments.

A third panel included representatives from Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, which are also investing in quantum technology and are among Nvidia's most important customers.

Nvidia has another reason to embrace quantum. As quantum computers are being built, much of the research on them is done through simulators on powerful computers, like those that Nvidia sells.

It's also possible that a quantum computer would require a traditional computer to operate it. Nvidia is working to provide the technology and software to integrate graphics processing units (GPUs) and quantum chips.

“Of course, quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” Huang said on Thursday. “But the technology is insanely complicated.”

Nvidia said this week that it will build a research center in Boston to allow quantum companies to collaborate with researchers at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The center will include several racks of the company's Blackwell AI servers.

Quantum computing has been a dream of physicists and mathematicians since the 1980s, when California Institute of Technology professor Richard Feynman first proposed the idea behind a quantum computer.

While classical computers use bits that are either 0 or 1, the bits inside a quantum computer — qubits — end up being on or off based on probability. Experts predict that the technology will be able to solve problems with massive amounts of possible solutions, such as deciphering codes, routing deliveries or simulating chemistry or weather.

No quantum computer has yet beat a computer at solving a real, useful problem. But Google claimed late last year that it discovered a way to do error correction.

One question at the panel centered around whether quantum computing might one day threaten companies like Nvidia that make computers based on transistors.

“A long time ago, somebody asked me, ‘So what's accelerated computing good for?'” Huang said at the panel. Accelerated computing is a phrase he uses to refer to the kind of GPU computers that Nvidia makes.

“I said, a long time ago, because I was wrong, this is going to replace computers,” he said. “This is going to be the way computing is done, and and everything, everything is going to be better. And it turned out I was wrong.”

Alabama lawmakers on Thursday advanced proposed regulations on pharmacy benefit managers

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Two blocks from the Alabama Statehouse, a black wreath hung on the door of Adams Drugs — a symbol to draw attention to the number of neighborhood pharmacies that have closed, or are in danger of closing, across the state.

Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.

“We're losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,” Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said. 

Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.

Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges. 

Pharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions. 

“The biggest issue is we're not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,” Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy. 

The Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of “spread pricing” where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies. 

Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.

Helena Duncan, president of the Business Council of Alabama, told a legislative committee on Wednesday that small businesses, which might already be struggling to provide insurance to their workers, will have to either absorb the increased cost or pass it along to employees through premium increases.

“Shifting the financial burdens from pharmacies to the Alabama employers is fundamentally unfair,” Duncan told a legislative committee on Wednesday. 

Republican Sen. Andrew Jones, a cosponsor of the bill, said Thursday said other states have seen drug prices go down. Jones said it is important to protect neighborhood pharmacies because they play a vital role in communities.

“You are not going to get a big box store to open in the middle of the night to get you the medication you need,” Jones said.

Lawsuit alleges US plane maker's treatment of John Barnett caused his death after he raised safety concerns

The family of a whistleblower at Boeing who killed himself last year is suing the US plane manufacturer, alleging the company's conduct caused his death.

Boeing pushed John Barnett to his death by harassing and intimidating him after he raised safety concerns about the company's plant building the 787 Dreamliner in Charleston, South Carolina, a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal court in the state alleges.

The world's second-largest aeroplane maker has faced significant scrutiny over its safety during a years-long crisis started by two fatal crashes of its bestselling 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019. Last year a door panel blew out of a Boeing plane in mid-air after engineers failed to replace crucial bolts, raising yet more concerns over the company's safety culture.

The crises have also raised questions over how Boeing treated people voicing concerns.

Barnett was a quality manager at Boeing for nearly three decades, starting at Everett, Washington state, before his move to South Carolina. He took early retirement in 2017, at which point he was experiencing symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, according to the claim.

He then shared concerns over Boeing's safety processes with journalists, becoming known publicly as a whistleblower. His allegations included finding metal shavings near critical control wires, and problems with onboard oxygen systems.

His family claim in their suit that Boeing responded by carrying out a “campaign of harassment, abuse and intimidation intended to discourage, discredit and humiliate him until he would either give up or be discredited”.

Barnett was found dead with a gunshot wound in his truck in a hotel car park on 9 March last year, days after giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.

In a statement this week, Boeing said: “We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family.” The company was approached for further comment.

However, Barnett's family alleged that “Boeing had threatened to break John, and break him it did”.

They said the aeroplane maker intentionally gave Barnett inaccurate, poor job reviews and less desirable shifts, and that the company publicly blamed him for delays that angered his co-workers and prevented him from transferring to another plant.

The lawsuit alleged: “Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to his death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that PTSD and John's unbearable depression, panic attacks, and anxiety … would in turn lead to an elevated risk of suicide.

“Boeing may not have pulled the trigger, but Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death.”

The United States Golf Association has released its Water Conservation Playbook to the golf industry, a comprehensive effort to provide courses with the latest tools and techniques to more effectively manage water utilization.The digital publication, written by the USGA with 12 contributing experts, can be downloaded at usga.org/water, free of charge. It is a noteworthy, tangible outcome of the USGA's 15-year, $30 million investment to help golf courses reduce their overall water usage. 

“Golf is currently in a time of great growth, but the threat of water availability and cost, combined with changing weather patterns, poses long-term threats to our playing fields,” said Mike Whan, CEO of the USGA. “We want to put the best intelligence into the hands of those who are making decisions and working on courses every day, and spur innovation toward a more sustainable game.” The book combines the USGA Green Section's 100+ years of expertise in agronomy with research from leading universities and the working knowledge of superintendents, architects and golf course maintenance workers. Its practical approach gives operators insight to better inform decision-making at every level, while maintaining the best possible playing conditions. 

“Golf courses account for about 1.3% of irrigation water use in the US annually, and total golf course water use has declined by almost 30% since 2005, mostly due to improved irrigation practices,” the book's introduction reads. “However, there is no question that many opportunities exist for golf courses to use less water and there are many potential benefits in doing so. Continuing to advance water conservation in golf will require collaboration between superintendents, researchers, regulators, golfers and communities. It is a constant but necessary pursuit, and we hope this playbook will help.”It is structured in three sections: fundamental irrigation stewardship (basic maintenance best practices that every golf course could employ); advanced irrigation techniques and conservation strategies (including sensor and irrigation technology) and water sourcing and stewardship (including irrigating with reclaimed or recycled water). Each section includes: 

“The level of collaboration we've received to bring this to life has been incredible, and it's now our job to share this tool far and wide,” said Matt Pringle, managing director of the USGA Green Section. “If you work on a golf course, deliver or sell water, build irrigation systems, design facilities or are part of the golf community, we encourage you to download and distribute the link to your colleagues.” The USGA currently has 47 ongoing projects that advance water conservation. They include research on topics such as precision irrigation, drought-resilient grassing, reducing irrigated acreage, mitigating water quality challenges and subsurface drip innovation. “It is critical to the long-term sustainability of the game that golf demonstrates its commitment to the responsible use of resources,” said Rhett Evans, CEO of the GCSAA. “The USGA's water playbook is a great tool that provides our members effective, practical solutions to conserve water through best management practices.”

				People & Jobs 

Trailblazing American golfer and Honorary University of St Andrews graduate Dr Renee Powell returned to the Home of Golf this week.

During her visit, Renee took part in the University's prestigious Andrew Carnegie Lecture Series, where she spoke to University Principal Professor Dame Sally Mapstone about her life, her inspirational career and her long association with St Andrews. Alongside the Principal, she also unveiled a new plaque installed in her honour at Powell Hall, the eponymous student residence at the town's North Haugh.

Described as ‘golf's greatest living ambassador', Renee took on racial adversity and segregation, to excel against the odds. In 1967, she became the second African-American woman to compete on the LPGA Tour. In 1971, she was part of a USO tour to Vietnam, in support of American troops, and would expand upon that rare experience throughout a career to support both men and women in military service. 

In 1979, while a member of the PGA of Great Britain & Ireland, she was named the first woman head professional of a private golf club in the UK, Silvermere in Surrey. In 1996 she became the first black woman member of the PGA of America.

Following her LPGA Tour career, Renee dedicated her life to diversifying the game of golf and extending the mission of her father Bill to make the sport welcoming to all. She became an International Goodwill Ambassador travelling to Africa on more than 25 trips to host golf clinics.

Having begun her love affair with golf aged just three and playing competitively since she was 12, Renee, now aged 78, remains a passionate advocate for expanding golf to more youth, women, seniors, minorities, and military veterans.

In 2011, she launched Clearview HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) a free, year-round therapeutic and recreational golf programme specifically for women veterans at the Clearview Golf Club in Ohio built by her father, that she now runs.

In 2008, Renee became the third American, and the only woman golfer, to ever receive an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of St Andrews. In 2015, she became one of two American women initially given honorary membership into the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. And in 2018, the University made Renee the first American to have a student hall of residence dedicated in her name.

Commenting on the visit, Principal Sally Mapstone said: “Renee Powell is a magnificent friend of the University, and a terrific role model for women in sport and for everyone who appreciates the value of fair mindedness, hard work, and hope.”

England Golf has been named one of six finalists in two categories at the FEVO Sport Industry Awards, with the national governing body nominated for Sport Organisation of the Year and the Wellness at Work award.

				Growing the Game 

England Golf has been named one of six finalists in two categories at the FEVO Sport Industry Awards, with the national governing body nominated for Sport Organisation of the Year and the Wellness at Work award.

The 2025 edition of the FEVO Sport Industry Awards will take place at Evolution London in Battersea on May 15. England Golf is going up against the likes of Liverpool FC, British Cycling, Sail GP and Bupa. This recognition acknowledges what has been a stellar 2024 for England Golf, which has seen all 1735 affiliated golf clubs and 60 county unions in the country achieve their Respect in Golf status, by completing the England Golf Terms of Affiliation.2024 was a record-breaking year for England Golf, with the most scores submitted via the World Handicap System ever in a single calendar year, with club membership numbers growing to 730,000 in 2024. England Golf CEO Jeremy Tomlinson said: “These nominations at the sport industry's leading awards ceremony are testament to all of the work being done across the organisation and by the countless volunteers within the game, working together to help make golf more inclusive and accessible. “In the last year we have made great strides towards challenging long-held perceptions of the game, helping our clubs and counties to introduce golf to new players from different backgrounds. The increases we've seen in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18-hole scores and nine-hole scores reflect the progress that has been made.” iGolf has proven to be instrumental in creating a pathway for golfers into club membership, encouraging regularity of play. There has been a 12% increase in sign-ups compared to this time last year, with 13,350 iGolf subscribers having now transitioned into club membership. In the first full year since iPlay was launched, 6,500 people registered. The initiative supports the pathway from beginner to regular golfer, creating an opportunity to educate and inspire on what golfing facilities are available to them. Both iGolf and iPlay are removing barriers and creating entry for all levels of ability, as part of England Golf's mission to make golf more inclusive and accessible. As part of the affiliation programme, there are now 75 new venues – such as driving ranges, golf simulators and adventure golf courses – affiliated with England Golf. This is helping to bring new players of different backgrounds to all forms of the game. The affiliation numbers started at zero in January 2024. England Golf is also working with Mind and Mental Health First Aid England for a powerful new initiative called Fore Your Mind, to support better mental health in the golf community. The governing body has also launched an all-new webpage dedicated to supporting female golfers. ‘Golf Fore Her' has been created to provide guidance and support on the many life stages of a female, from the basics to the impact on your golf, and how playing golf could potentially help you.

Meldrum House, the historic country hotel & golf course in Aberdeenshire, has appointed Neil McLean as its new Membership Manager, marking the latest chapter in the luxury venue's ongoing investment plans.

Neil, who has over 18 years of sales and business development experience, assumed the role at the beginning of March to help enhance the experience for both new and existing members in both the personal and corporate membership categories.

“We're delighted to welcome Neil to the team at what is a pivotal time for Meldrum House,” said Managing Director Jordan Charles. “We're making significant investments to the golf course and hotel to offer members and guests an unmatched luxurious experience and Neil's appointment aligns perfectly with our ambitious growth plans.”

The new appointment announcement comes just after Meldrum House won the ‘Best Premium Hotel' award at the prestigious 2025 Scottish Golf Tourism Awards, which took place in Aberdeen for the first time on March 20.

Recent improvements on the Knights parkland golf course are part of a substantial investment plan by Apex Hotels, to enhance and diversify the venue's high-end facilities. They include an all-new state-of-the-art suite of greens machinery and tractors with the latest GPS technology worth more than £700,000; the addition of TopTracer to all 13 driving range bays; an ultra-modern £500,000 kitchen update to deliver world-class cuisine for members and guests.

Commenting on his appointment, McLean said: “I feel very privileged to join Meldrum House and help the venue in the next stage of its evolution. Building on a rich history of excellence in service and with the recent investments across the venue, we have the perfect foundation to position Meldrum House as one of the very best venues in Scotland and I look forward to building relationships with our members and enhancing their experience.”

A hugely successful Scottish Golf Tourism Week in association with Luxe Scot in Aberdeen culminated in the Scottish Golf Tourism Awards on Thursday evening at P&J Live.  

A brilliant week in the Granite City as SGTW brought together the golf tourism industry once more for over 3,700 face to face meetings, golf days, excursions and many other networking opportunities. 

Since its launch in 2016, Scottish Golf Tourism Week has gone from strength to strength, creating tens of thousands of face-to-face business meetings and thousands of familiarisation trips, welcoming buyers from five continents across the globe. 





Canada, South Africa, Spain and Australia; the USA, Argentina, Norway and Portugal – these are just some of the countries that have been represented this week at Scottish Golf Tourism Week. This year, we have welcomed over 101 Scottish businesses and 94 top international golf tour operators representing over 45 nations from all around the world. 

The special evening is all about highlighting the very best of golf in Scotland. From golf courses to clubhouses, hotels to off-the-course experiences, and all points in between, it's a celebration of the country that gave golf to the world. 

The awards exist to celebrate the outstanding achievements within the Scottish golf tourism industry by recognising the finest courses, hotels and experiences that have helped shape Scotland's reputation as a world-class golfing destination. The awards were hosted by BBC TV and radio presenter, Jason Mohammad who commented “What a wonderful evening”. 





During the ceremony, Michael McEwan, Head of Content at bunkered, spoke about the current campaign to save Dalmuir Golf Course, and by extension, public golf courses in general across Scotland. The reaction in the room to his words was brilliant, as many industry leading individuals and businesses offered their support to the campaign, including the evening's host BBC sports presenter Jason Mohammad. 

This year's 14 award winners were all chosen by an expert panel of independent judges from across the industry.

SPECIAL REPORT: Which Funds Beat Benchmarks Over 1, 3, 5 And 10 Years?



Shares in government contractors Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), Gartner (IT), CACI International (CACI) and Science Applications International (SAIC) tumbled on Thursday after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon was canceling $580 million in contracts, including deals with Gartner and consultancy McKinsey. While Booz Allen stock fell, shares in rival Palantir Technologies (PLTR) rose.

The DOD posted Hegseth's announcement on Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter.

On the stock market today, Booz Allen stock retreated 8.1% to close at 103.58. Gartner stock 6.8% to 418.77. CACI stock was down 4.5% at 369.66. SAIC dipped 6% to 105.98. But Palantir stock rose 1.5% to 87.39.

Further, Hegseth credited the Trump administration's DOGE initiative, led by Musk, for identifying DOD contracts that were no longer needed.

According to reports, Hegseth will be meeting with Musk at the Pentagon on Friday to discuss ""innovation, efficiencies & smarter production."" The defense agency is evaluating large civilian job cuts.

In a post on X, Hegseth said the meeting is not about China war plans as reported by the New York Times.

Further, Musk founded electric car maker Tesla (TSLA). Tesla stock has plunged 41% in 2025 amid Musk's DOGE activity. In  an all-hands company meeting late Thursday, Musk told employees to hold onto Tesla stock.

Worries over Accenture's federal government services business amid DOGE-led layoffs of federal employees also hit Accenture (ACN), after the IT services company reported fiscal second quarter earnings.

Accenture stock tumbled along with IBM (IBM) and ServiceNow (NOW). Accenture stock fell 7.3% to 300.91.

""The new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently,"" said Accenture Chief Executive Julie Sweet on the company's conference call with Wall Street analysts. ""During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue.""

In 2024, the U.S. federal government accounted for 8% of Accenture revenue.

""Shares of many defense tech service providers are down following Accenture's  commentary that DOGE is inducing a slower government procurement environment, which is impacting revenue for its Accenture federal business,"" said William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma in a report.

He added: ""While some small contracts have been canceled for the main players, most cancellations have been for small vendors. There will likely be greater clarity over the next three months following the review of GSA and non-GSA DoD consulting contracts. Slower bookings have the potential to result in revenue deceleration over time.""

While they are rivals, Palantir and Booz Allen announced in December that they would partner in some cases. The two companies said the partnership will focus on ""driving transformational information infrastructure modernization and secure interoperability and rapidly accelerating integrated warfighting operations with coalition partners through data-centric systems that improve collaboration and combined mission planning with U.S. allies and partners.""

Palantir stock has climbed 15% in 2025 but has dropped some 30% from its all-time high set in February.

			9.36am 21st March 2025	 -
				Greenkeeping & Agronomy 

Kim Blake, Course Manager at Fulford Heath Golf Club in Birmingham, has been at the forefront of maintaining and enhancing the club's renowned parkland course for the past 36 years. 

His dedication to innovation has helped the club thrive and stay competitive. A key component of his maintenance programme? The consistent success of MM seed products.

Designed by James Braid, the 6,200-yard course at Fulford Heath features the River Cole, mature trees, and lakes, presenting golfers with challenges that reward skill and strategy. Maintaining such a course requires precision and quality, and Kim has found these attributes in MM seed.

“I started using MM9 15 years ago because of the HEADSTART GOLD treatment,” says Kim. This revolutionary coating ensures rapid germination, which was a game-changer for Kim. “I wanted to shift our greens from 100% Poa annua to a 60/40 mix of bentgrass and Poa annua, so I began integrating MM9 with top dressing.”

Kim's approach evolved as he experimented with mixing MM9 with sand, then using a Graden machine. “One thing I found is that sowing the seed deeper — between 6mm and 10mm — yields better results. It's a theory from my agricultural days: deeper sowing protects the seed from frost lift, preventing root break,” Kim explains. 





This technique, combined with MM9's superior quality, produced impressive results. Kim conducted multiple trials to test MM9 against various creeping bent mixtures. “We did half a green with MM9 and the other half with creeping bent and repeated this on different greens. MM9 consistently germinated a day quicker, thanks to the HEADSTART GOLD coating,” Kim notes. 

“An advantage of MM9 is cost-effectiveness. It's more economical than creeping bent, allowing us to apply more seed per square metre, leading to a better strike and building a stronger seed bank in the soil. After 12 months, MM9 proved to hold its own better than other mixtures.”

For Kim, the right seed choice extends beyond greens. “We recently switched to MM50 on our tees because modern golfers take larger divots, and a pure rye mix stands up to this better,” he explains. 

MM50's blend of fine-leaved ryegrasses creates a dense, resilient surface that recovers quickly. On the fairways, Kim relies on MM22 for its durability and reliability. “It's great for overseeding, renovation, and construction — areas that endure high wear,” Kim adds.

Kim has also modified his approach to sand usage and overseeding schedules. “We've reduced sand use from 120 tonnes to 40 tonnes annually and plan to reduce it further next year. Instead, we focus on biology to control thatch and organic matter. This makes the greens work harder, enhancing the bent seed's performance,” he says.

He overseeds in February/March at 40 kg per hectare, using a Graden sand injection machine or a disc seeder. “We'll do more renovation work in October but won't overseed, as temperatures are too cold. Since prioritising biology over intense aeration and sand, the bents have improved,” Kim shares.

Kim's approach balances simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and long-term benefits. “My goal is to make the job straightforward for the staff and cost-effective for the club. If it's too complex or costly, nobody is happy. Continuous tweaking and adaptation are key,” he concludes.

Trailblazing American golfer and Honorary University of St Andrews graduate Dr Renee Powell returned to the Home of Golf this week.

March 21, 2025

Leading global certification body DNV has validated that Flocean's desalination approach can achieve 30-50% energy savings compared to conventional systems once site-specific engineering is completed.

Conventional desalination capacity is set to double by 2032, addressing critical water shortages while risking a massive surge in carbon emissions.

Current plants already generate over 400 million tons of CO2 annually—a figure that could double as tens of billion in new projects come online within the next 10 years.

Energy is the critical cost driver in desalination, accounting for one-third to over half of total operational expenses. In Cyprus, where desalination supplies most freshwater, the process generates 2% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions and consumes 5% of its power.

To verify these results in real-world conditions, the Flocean Zero project launched in November 2024. Initial data analysis confirmed that the deep ocean environment provides optimal conditions for high-efficiency desalination while dramatically reducing energy requirements. 

Efficiency gains are achieved through two advantages, natural pressure utilization and superior water quality.

By placing reverse osmosis systems at 400-600 meters depth, Flocean harnesses natural hydrostatic pressure to drive filtration without energy-intensive pumping systems.

Deep ocean water contains significantly less life than surface water, dramatically reducing pre-treatment requirements and virtually eliminating biofouling—a persistent efficiency drain in conventional plants.

With freshwater demand projected to exceed supply by 40% by 2030, countries worldwide need solutions that address water security without compromising climate commitments.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Wang Xing, CEO of China's largest food delivery firm Meituan, said on Friday in a post-earnings call that the company is pouring ""billions"" into chips used to train AI models, with more investment planned this year.

The escalated spending and promise of further increases aligns with similar large-scale AI investments by China's other tech giants. E-commerce conglomerate Alibaba announced in February that it would allocated at least 380 billion yuan toward cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years.

Helpany's AI-powered radar device named Paul has helped caregivers reduce falls by 67% in three consecutive months. 

AI technology is changing senior care, boasting a significant reduction in falls at Park Senior Villas – La Cañada. Helpany's AI-powered radar device Paul has helped caregivers to reduce falls by 67% in three consecutive months.

Park Senior Villas implemented the Paul devices to identify at-risk residents by analyzing their motion patterns and providing real-time preventive notifications to caregivers. This cutting-edge technology empowers caregivers to detect changes in residents' conditions early, helping them prevent potential falls. 

As a result, more than 180 proactive care interventions recorded during 90 days.

“The safety and well-being of our residents is our top priority,” said Christina Ryan, chief executive officer of Park Senior Villas. “Implementing Helpany's Paul device has been a game-changer, enabling us to provide proactive, around-the-clock care without compromising privacy.”

Sandro Cilurzo, Helpany's chief executive officer, said he strives to be proactive inside of reactive.

“With the right technology, we can achieve that,” Cilurzo said. “By identifying risks early, caregivers can provide timely assistance, enhancing resident outcomes while easing the burden on staff.

“While the success of Helpany is undeniable, experts emphasize that caregivers play the primary role in keeping seniors safe. Effective fall prevention requires a holistic approach, including attentive care, environmental modifications and proactive health monitoring.”

“The safety and well-being of our clients is our top priority,” says Christina Ryan, chief executive officer for Park Senior Villas - La Cañada, in regards to the implementation of Paul in their facilities, resulting in a 67% deficit in falls. 

Red flags that indicate a senior may need more care include:

Unexplained weight loss: This could indicate underlying health concerns such as malnutrition or illness.

Difficulty standing or walking: Despite AI monitoring, mobility issues can increase the risk of falls and require physical therapy or assistive devices.

Restlessness at night: Persistent poor sleep leads to significant fatigue, impaired balance and slower cognitive responses, dramatically increasing the likelihood of falls.

Inactivity: Prolonged sedentary behavior and minimal activity are putting seniors at a much higher risk of falls, reducing the overall strength, balance and mobility.

Declining gait speed: A slow gait or reduced walking distance may signal an increased risk of falling.

Social withdrawal or mood changes: Isolation can lead to mental health concerns and a decreased quality of life.

“Since implementing Helpany, our caregivers have been able to respond faster and more effectively to residents' needs. This has not only improved resident safety but also eased the workload for our staff by enabling more proactive care,” said Liesen Clemons, general manager of Park Senior Villas – La Cañada. 

Helpany's AI system is proving successful in Tucson and seeing impressive results at Fellowship Square Mesa, where falls have dropped by 70% in just two months. The technology is gaining traction across senior living communities, offering a privacy-first approach that prioritizes dignity and safety.

One of the unique advantages of Paul is its ability to provide continuous, non-intrusive monitoring, giving caregivers real-time insights into residents' movements. This allows them to proactively address potential risks, respond swiftly to changes in mobility, and implement additional measures to enhance overall safety and well-being.

“The goal of AI-based technology is to enhance, not replace, the personal attention that caregivers provide,” Cilurzo said. “Paul is like a virtual caregiver supporting better decision-making and improving overall care quality.”

As AI-driven solutions evolve, the balance between technology and hands-on care will remain crucial. While Paul is helping revolutionize fall prevention, it is not a substitute for comprehensive senior care. Families and caregivers should stay vigilant for signs that a loved one may need additional support beyond what technology can provide.

US President Trump gestures as CEO of Open AI Sam Altman speaks at the White House in January

Major tech firms are pushing the administration of President Donald Trump to loosen rules on building artificial intelligence, arguing it is the only way to maintain a US edge and compete with China. 

Spooked by generative AI's sudden advance, governments initially scrambled to develop guardrails, as major tech companies rapidly integrated the technology into their products.

Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has shifted focus toward accelerating AI development at all costs, pushing aside concerns about the models suffering hallucinations, producing deepfakes, or destroying human jobs.

""The AI future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about safety,"" Vice President JD Vance told world leaders at a recent AI summit in Paris.

This message unsettled international partners, particularly Europe, which had proudly established the EU AI Act as a new standard for keeping the technology in check.

But, faced with America's new direction, European officials are now pivoting their messaging toward investment and innovation rather than safety.

""We're going to see a significant pullback in terms of the regulatory efforts... worldwide,"" explained David Danks, professor of data science and philosophy at University of California San Diego. 

""That certainly has been signaled here in the United States, but we're also seeing it in Europe.""

Tech companies are capitalizing on this regulatory retreat, seeking the freedom to develop AI technologies that they claim have been too constrained under the Biden administration.

One of Trump's first executive actions was dismantling Biden's policies, which had proposed modest guardrails for powerful AI models and directed agencies to prepare to oversee the change.

""It's clear that we're taking a step back from that idea that there's going to be a coherent overall approach to AI regulation,"" noted Karen Silverman, CEO of AI advisory firm Cantellus Group.

The Trump administration has invited industry leaders to share their policy vision, emphasizing that the US must maintain its position as the ""undeniable leader in AI technology"" with minimal investor constraints.

The industry submissions will shape the White House's AI action plan, expected this summer.

The request has yielded predictable responses from major players, with a common theme emerging: China represents an existential threat which can only be addressed by plowing an open path for companies unencumbered by regulation.

OpenAI's submission probably goes the furthest in its contrast with China, highlighting DeepSeek, a Chinese-developed generative AI model created at a fraction of American development costs, to emphasize the competitive threat.

According to OpenAI, American AI development should be ""protected from both autocratic powers that would take people's freedoms away, and layers of laws and bureaucracy that would prevent our realizing them.""

For AI analyst Zvi Mowshowitz, OpenAI's ""goal is to have the federal government not only not regulate AI,"" but also ban individual US states from doing so.

Currently engaged in litigation with the New York Times over the use of its content for training, OpenAI also argues that restricting access to online data would concede the AI race to China.

""Without fair use access to copyrighted material...America loses, as does the success of democratic AI,"" OpenAI said.

Another response submitted by a group of Hollywood celebrities -- including Ben Stiller and Cynthia Erivo -- rejected the notion, reflecting the film and television industry's contentious relationship with the technology.

In its response, Meta touted its open Llama AI model as part of the fight for American technological superiority.

""Open source models are essential for the US to win the AI race against China and ensure American AI dominance,"" the company stated.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg has even advocated for retaliatory tariffs against European regulatory efforts.

Google's input focused on infrastructure investment for AI's substantial energy requirements. 

Like its peers, Google also opposes state-by-state regulations in the US that it claims would undermine America's technological leadership.

Despite the push for minimal oversight, industry observers caution that generative AI carries inherent risks, with or without government regulation.

""Bad press is universal, and if your technology leads to really bad outcomes, you're going to get raked over the public relations coals,"" warned Danks.

Companies have no choice but to mitigate the dangers, he added.

In an era where artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the workplace, the UK's smallest charities face being digitally stranded. Earlier this month, the giving platform Neighbourly and Microsoft unveiled an ambitious solution: Ai123, a pioneering initiative aiming to equip 100,000 people with essential AI skills by June – potentially unlocking millions in efficiency savings for the charity sector.

This groundbreaking campaign comes as Neighbourly research reveals a stark digital divide: 64% of charities have yet to engage with generative AI, while 72% report significant digital struggles due to financial constraints, and 8.5 million people in the UK lack even basic digital skills. While corporate Britain invests heavily in AI adoption, the gap in AI skills between the corporate and charity sectors widens.

The Ai123 campaign aims to tackle this through an innovative Train-the-Trainer model, connecting corporate volunteers from major companies including Virgin Media O2 and Currys with grassroots organisations. The programme is designed to encourage the ripple effect: one trained volunteer empowers one or more charity leaders, who then share skills with colleagues, volunteers and ultimately thousands of service users.

Earlier this week, techSPARK hosted the West of England Mayoral Hustings event, sponsored by RWK Goodman, at the EQ offices in Bristol, marking the start of UK Tech Week. The event provided a platform for members of the tech community to engage with prospective mayoral candidates ahead of the upcoming election on the 1st of May 2025. With innovation and digital growth central to the region's economy, attendees had the opportunity to hear firsthand about each candidate's plans for the future of the industry.

The Hustings was chaired by Vinous Ali from Startup Coalition, who led a discussion with the candidates on three key topics: investment, housing and skills development. Attendees heard from Helen Godwin (Labour Party), Mary Page (Green Party) and Oli Henman (Liberal Democrats), while Steve Smith (Conservative Party) was unable to attend due to magisterial responsibilities but provided a video message for the audience.

techSPARK CEO Ben Shorrock opened the event by presenting the techSPARK manifesto.

Trump DOGE Executive Claims $1.5 Billion Savings From IRS Technology Budget

By David Lawder

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The tech startup executive charged by the Trump administration with reviewing the Internal Revenue Service's technology modernization program said on Thursday that he has canceled contracts worth about $1.5 billion from the tax agency's budget.

Sam Corcos, founder and CEO of health technology firm Levels, and a member of President Donald Trump's informal Department of Government Efficiency, told Fox News Channel that he has found legacy contracts with outside technology consultants worth tens of billions of dollars for a systems modernization effort that is decades behind schedule.

""I think we've so far stopped work and cut about $1.5 billion from the modernization budget, mostly projects that were putting us down this death spiral of complexity in our code base,"" said Corcos, who serves as a special adviser to the Treasury.

That's from an annual modernization budget of about $3.7 billion, which is in addition to a $3.5 billion information technology systems budget, he said.

The true size and legality of many DOGE-related cuts in government spending have been challenged in court.

The IRS last week said it was pausing technology modernization investments to reevaluate its operating approach in light of new artificial intelligence technologies.

The pause marks another shift away from the original $80 billion in IRS investment funding over a decade that was included in former president Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The modernization effort was aimed making up for a decade of under-funding to revamp outdated 1960s-era computer architecture, improving taxpayer services and boosting the IRS' capability to increase tax collections through more sophisticated audits of the ultra-wealthy and business owners.

Clawing back the supplemental funding has long been a target of Republicans in Congress, who argued that it was aimed at harassing taxpayers. Subsequent stopgap government funding measures have whittled the original $80 billion down by as much as half.

Corcos praised the dedication of the IRS' 8,000 career information technology employees, saying that they have been ""super cooperative"" with the cost review. But he said that the agency's IT costs are far above those of private-sector banks processing similar amounts of data.

The Queanbeyan District Court was told the incident occurred during an argument between the woman and her son about a technology ban. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)

A woman previously charged for hitting her 13-year-old son while chastising him for disobeying a technology ban has successfully appealed her conviction.

The NSW District Court heard the boy texted his father after the incident, who called the police on his ex-partner, leading to the charge against her.

Judge Robert Sutherland could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the woman had been reckless in hitting her son or if it was an accident.

A New South Wales woman who hit her teenage son during an argument over a technology ban has won her appeal against her conviction over the incident.

If you need help immediately call emergency services on triple-0

The Queanbeyan District Court heard the two had been arguing about the issue when the family sat down for dinner when she continued to chastise her son for disobeying a technology ban.

Judge Robert Sutherland said things escalated and the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to hit the boy on the shoulder but he ducked.

He said when she hit him again he moved and she landed on the back of his neck.

The court was told the boy lived between his mother's home and his father's after an acrimonious break-up some years before.

At some point during the argument the boy sent a text to his father asking to be picked up because he didn't want to be at his mother's house.

Judge Sutherland said the phone was eventually confiscated and hidden, so that when the boy's father rang him back he didn't answer.

The father then rang police, prompting a visit by two officers who came to the house for a welfare check.

Judge Sutherland said later the boy was taken by police to make a statement, which led to the court action against his mother.

His step-grandmother stayed with him during his interview.

Judge Sutherland questioned if the presence of boy's step-grandmother may have had an impact on his account.

""I have found this case troubling,"" Judge Sutherland said.

""The circumstances of the welfare check [by police] … is concerning.""

He said that was especially so when the officers spoke to the boy, but provided no evidence about what was said in the exchange.

""There's little doubt there was a parental exchange … between a mother and a 13-year-old adolescent,"" Judge Sutherland said.

Judge Sutherland said he had to weigh up if the woman had been reckless in hitting her son, or if it was simply an accident.

In the end he dismissed the charge, saying he couldn't find beyond reasonable doubt that the woman had been reckless.

Was Emma a popular name among tennis families on both sides of the Atlantic in the early aughts? Two decades later, the American Emma, who is 23, will meet the British Emma, who is 22, for the first time.The American Emma—Navarro—is the favorite. She's ranked 10th and has an 11-6 record in 2025, while Raducanu is ranked 60th and is 4-6 this season. That might seem like progress to Raducanu and her fans; even if her record is so-so, at least she has been healthy for a few months straight now. While has shown a couple of glimpses of her 2021 self in beating Maria Sakkari and Ekaterina Alexandrova, she hasn't been able to sustain any top-level consistency for long.The good news for Raducanu is that Navarro, despite her winning record, hasn't been the player she was a season ago. Yes, she won a title in Merida, and made the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, but there have also been some perplexing losses—to Leylah Fernandez in Doha, Sorana Cirstea in Dubai, and Donna Vekic last week in Indian Wells. Navarro doesn't get a ton of free points on her serve, which means everything else has to be extra sharp for her to succeed. That was true during her breakout 2024, but not during her follow-up 2025 thus far.Still, in the battle of the Emmas, Navarro is the cleaner ball-striker, better mover, and more complete player.

Kim Clijsters enjoyed a superb career on the court, which involved 41 WTA titles and a rise to world number one.

Clijsters would love to play Aryna Sabalenka, with the latter currently occupying the role of WTA number one as she looks for more success at the 2025 Miami Open.

The Belarusian boasts three Grand Slam titles in her stunning career so far, one short of the tally Clijsters finished her career with.

The Belgian won three times at the US Open and once at the Australian Open, as well as reaching four other Grand Slam finals.

Now retired, the 41-year-old has been looking back on that stellar career, which involved a fantastic win-loss record of 523-132.

Speaking at the recent Indian Wells tournament, she explained the story behind her current role as honorary president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

“So I got inducted in 2017 together with Andy Roddick, and we had an amazing kind of four days of celebrations, to a point where I feel like it was so overwhelming, to be celebrated like that where you get to see your own career, reflect on your own career, but then also, it takes you all the way back to where tennis started for me and who my inspirations were,” Clijsters said on The Sit-Down podcast.

“To see my pictures or my memorabilia, my trophies, next to Steffi Graf's trophies, and Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez.

“All those women, they were my heroes growing up and so the connection and the warmth I guess too that you feel when you're there and when you can celebrate it that weekend was the reason I think why I said yes when Todd Martin called me a few years ago asking if I wanted to join the team.”

Clijsters's heroes are, of course, also true legends of the sport, and have all left a superb legacy behind them.

The current generation will be doing their utmost to follow in their footsteps, with the likes of Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff perhaps leading the way at this moment in time.

Despite saying goodbye to her playing career, New Jersey-based Clijsters remains a huge tennis fan, having also been inspired by a handful of other female icons.

“I love the sport, like I fell in love with it when I was almost five years old, and I still love playing,” she said. “People ask me do you miss playing here? And I'm like, no I don't, I don't miss playing here. I still love playing tennis, and it can be in a local, small little tennis court in New Jersey or any public court.

“I love the sport, and yeah it's a true passion. And I know it's very rare. I see it with my kids too, I know it was really rare to have found something very naturally that wasn't kind of pushed on me from my parents or anything, to find something that you've loved from such a young age, and to grow have it grow into me still being connected into the sport, right?

“And I never thought when I was a professional player that I would still be connected and have this whole tennis family at the Hall of Fame, and now being able to do the Be Legendary program, and talk to young kids around the world.

“I never thought of those things, and it's amazing how tennis kind of brings people together. And that's the beauty of the sport, is that we get… the sport is so well known around the world, and we have to thank a lot of the women that kind of paved the way for us early on. “The Billie Jean Kings, and from there on [Martina] Navratilova, Chrissy Evert, there's so many to name.

“I'll never forget that, I was 18 years old when I played, no I was younger, but I played the juniors at the US Open and listened to Billie Jean King speak.

“She has a very powerful personality, and her passion is so strong, and just listening to her at a young age, I think I was 14, and listening to her talk about the impact and what it took for them to get to the level where tennis was back then, and I'm talking maybe 1998, or so, it just stuck with me to always be ready to sign your autographs, take the pictures, be available, accessible to the media, the fans, and that's what it is.”

Novak Djokovic has admitted he disagrees with parts of the lawsuit brought against tennis' governing bodies by the player organisation he co-founded.

The Professional Tennis Players Association announced earlier this week that it was taking legal action against the ATP, WTA, International Tennis Federation and International Tennis Integrity Agency, accusing the organisations of “systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare”.

The PTPA was launched four years ago by Djokovic and Canadian Vasek Pospisil, and its statement on Tuesday said the action was being taken on behalf of all professional players.

Tennis has lost its way. Players and fans have been left behind. And after years of inaction by the powers at large, players and the PTPA were left with no choice but to pursue legal actions to force real change.

Djokovic's name was notably absent among the plaintiffs for the US suit, though, and he told reporters at the Miami Open that he was not entirely in agreement with what had been filed.

“I felt like I don't need to sign the letter because I want other players to step up,” said the Serbian.

“This is a classic lawsuit, so lawyers to lawyers, type of situation. So, to be quite frank with you, there are things that I agree with in the lawsuit and then there are also things that I don't agree with.

“And I found that maybe some wording was quite strong in there, but I guess the legal team knows what they are doing and what kind of terminology they're supposed to use in order to get the right effect.”

What an incredible atmosphere 👏👏Fonseca and Tien are amazing talents! Tennis isn't broken after all 😉

— Andy Murray (@andy_murray) March 21, 2025

The ATP and WTA both hit back strongly at the PTPA's allegations, while Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz was explicit in stating that he did not support the legal action.

Djokovic insisted he was not trying to cause rifts, saying: “I've never been a fan of division in our sport but I've always fought for better representation and influence of and positioning of the players globally in our sport, which I think is still not where I think it should be.”

Andy Murray, who is in Florida coaching the Serbian, appeared to reference the drama in a message on social media site X after watching young stars Joao Fonseca and Learner Tien battle it out.

“What an incredible atmosphere Fonseca and Tien are amazing talents! Tennis isn't broken after all,” wrote the Scot, ending with a winking emoji.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Eurosport UK'}"

Joao Fonseca made an electric debut at the Miami Open presented by Itau on Thursday when he powered past Learner Tien 6-7(1), 3-6, 6-4 in a thrilling opening-round clash.


Fonseca and Tien showcased their contrasting styles and battled through dramatic momentum swings at Hard Rock Stadium, which resembled a home crowd for the Brazilian. Fonseca's fans proudly waved their Brazilian flags and chanted his name as he rallied to a physical two-hour, 23-minute victory.

“I knew it was going to be a difficult match. I knew Learner was going to fight until the end, he's a great fighter. He knows how to play, he's very smart. So I needed to go until the end and I just went to it hard and the Brazilian crowd was with me today,” said Fonseca, who signed the camera lens, ‘Am I in Brazil?'

Leading 3-2 in the decider with a break advantage, Fonseca stood up from the changeover and unexpectedly called the doctor, telling chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani that he felt dizzy and needed to vomit. Fonseca took pills from the doctor and following a six-minute break, he continued the match without any obvious signs of illness. 

The late drama continued as Fonseca appeared to suffer from a small cramp just two points from the win. But the teenager wasted no time as he closed out the match and improved to 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Tien, whom he beat twice at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, including in the final.

Fonseca came out of the blocks imposing his game on the 19-year-old, ripping the felt off the ball behind both wings and earning a break in the opening game. Tien quickly fought back by absorbing Fonseca's firepower and hitting his targets with pin-point accuracy. The California native resembled a brick wall in the first-set tie-break, jumping to a 6/0 lead as Fonseca committed uncharacteristic errors.

Tien double faulted on back-to-back points in the second set at 1-2, Deuce, giving Fonseca a break advantage. Throughout the intense clash, the Brazilian strategically opened the court by stretching the lefty to his backhand before unleashing powerful forehands and looking for opportunities to move forward. The Rio de Janeiro native came to net 31 times, converting 22 of those points, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

In the youngest main-draw match in Miami since 2016 — when Alexander Zverev beat Michael Mmoh in a battle of 18-year-olds — Fonseca struck 43 winners, including 27 from his lethal forehand.

When I was younger, I went to my forehand when the important points came and it'd go directly to the fence,” Fonseca said with a laugh. “Now I'm working a little bit more to be aggressive and solid at the same time. In the important points, I go with my forehand where I have confidence. Very happy and proud of myself the way I put in the hard work on court.”

Fonseca arrived in Miami at a career-high No. 60 in the PIF ATP Rankings following a title run at the ATP Challenger Tour 175 event in Phoenix. Boasting a 21-4 season record across all levels, highlighted by his first tour-level title in Buenos Aires, Fonseca will next meet 19th seed Ugo Humbert, who last month won his seventh tour-level crown in Marseille.What an incredible atmosphere 👏👏Fonseca and Tien are amazing talents!

The Palisades Tennis Center is more than a park that has produced many top-ranked players over the past 60 years. The Center is also home to the creation of the Tennis Channel and is the birthplace of Liveball.

Most importantly, it is the heartbeat of an idyllic community. However, the devastating wildfires in January turned the dream tennis location into a nightmare. 

Many Pacific Palisades residents lost their homes and were displaced. The Palisades Tennis Center courts survived, but the shop burned to the ground.

A post shared by Palisades Tennis Center (@palisadestenniscenter)

While the heartbeat of the community is faint, Mike Tomas is using tennis to help keep nurse it back to health in the face of a years-long rebuild. 

Tomas, Operator of the Palisades Tennis Center, took over the facility in 2008 and has seen the importance of tennis in the community. 

""It's a magical spot. It's still inoperable. But the courts are still okay; miraculously, the courts survived. The plan is to try to get back up there as soon as possible. Get some kind of temporary pro shop going and start programming again.""

A post shared by Palisades Tennis Center (@palisadestenniscenter)

His strong connections in the tennis world has helped bring in donations for the LA Fire Tennis Rebuild, including efforts spearheaded by Pam Shriver and Gigi Fernandez with the WTA, International Tennis Hall of Fame, and UTSA.

Unfortunately, fundraising is just one part of a daunting challenge. The center operates on public courts. So, the government and decision-makers have to figure out their next steps in a massive rebuild.

Tomas said, ""People's homes burned down. It's not going to be easy to remove debris, and the toxicity, the safety factor. We're married to that neighborhood coming back.""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Tomas explained, ""The park can be a big step to help the neighborhood recover. I've heard people say things like, 'The park is the heartbeat of the neighborhood.' So, if we can get the park back, we can get the neighborhood back. And if the neighborhood is back, the park is back.""

While tennis legends like Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka have spent time on the courts and in the neighborhood, so have amateur athletes and people of all ages who fall in love with the sport.

For example, one local resident started playing tennis every single day and wanted to return to the court. An official from the US Army Corps of Engineers denied his request, but the man insisted, ""This was my life every day."" The sergeant acquiesced and filmed the video.

A post shared by Palisades Tennis Center (@palisadestenniscenter)

Tomas said, ""There's our little tennis shop and our wonderful tennis community, but there's a neighborhood that is part of Los Angeles that people are trying to make decisions on how to best help that neighborhood. 

""I'm hoping our little tennis shop helps people get back. It helps the neighborhood recover.""

 March  21, 2025  | Men's Tennis

NORMAN – The No. 24 Oklahoma men's tennis team is set to host Georgia in the second Friday Night Lights match of the season on Friday, March 21, at 6 p.m. CT.

The Sooners' 2025 home matches at the Headington Family Tennis Center will be open to the public and free of charge. Due to the elimination of concessions, fans are encouraged to bring their own food and drinks. OU also follows a clear bag policy.

The showdown between the Sooners and Bulldogs can be followed through live stream or live stats.

OU returns to Norman following three straight road matches. In the most recent competition, the Sooners fell short to then-No. 25 South Carolina, 6-1. 

After dropping only their third doubles point of the season, the Sooners' lone point in the match came from a singles win at the four line from junior Luis Alvarez, 6-4, 6-4.

In the most recent ITA team rankings, Oklahoma remains in the top 25, sitting at the No. 24 spot.

Freshman Oscar Lacides is once again ranked in singles, checking in at No. 94. The Frenchman has been noted in every singles ranking of the 2025 season.

Lacides remains ranked with doubles teammate Bruno Nhavene. The pair claim the No. 46 spot.

For the second week, the Sooners saw impressive showings from Alvarez. In the match against Auburn, Alvarez not only picked up a win to contribute to the doubles effort, but showed out in singles to earn a straight-set win to give the Sooners their second point of the match.

The Mexico native continued his success with two more wins in doubles and singles against South Carolina. 

Alvarez is on a four-match win streak in singles and is undefeated at the four position. With five wins in conference play, the junior leads the Sooners in singles conference success. In doubles, Alvarez and teammate Kholo Montsi have tallied a 12-1 record and will look to extend their win streak as they return home to face Georgia.

Georgia is currently notched as the No. 28 team nationally and matches the Sooners with a 10-6 overall record. The Bulldogs are 4-2 against SEC opponents and have tallied wins over Tennessee, Kentucky, LSU and Mississippi State. 

Three players represent UGA in the most recent ITA singles rankings. Thomas Paulsell leads the pack at No. 25, and is followed by Miguel Peres Pena at No. 31 and Ryan Colby at No. 34.

The Bulldogs are represented by three doubles pairs, with Paulsell and Colby at No. 16, Freddy Blaydes and Niels Ratiu at No. 26 and Perez Pena and Oscar Pinto Sansano rounding out the group at No. 57.

The Sooners continue their SEC matchups with two more road matches against Ole Miss on Thursday, March 27, at 3 p.m. CT and Alabama on Saturday, March 29, at 1 p.m. CT.

OU will be back at the Headington Family Tennis Center to face Texas on Thursday, April 3, at 6 p.m. CT. ","{'href': 'https://soonersports.com', 'title': 'Soonersports.com'}"

ORLANDO - After splitting a pair of top-10 matchups in Orlando to open Big 12 play, the No. 11 UCF men's tennis team will embark on its first road trip in over a month, traveling west for contests at BYU and No. 52 Utah.

Each meeting marks the second all-time between the program's, as the Knights (15-5, 1-1) will be in for a pair of difficult contests at altitude. The Cougars (11-4, 0-2) have been in and out of the ITA rankings this season, dropping both of their conference openers last weekend, while the Utes (13-5, 2-0) continue their climb following a 4-1 triumph over Texas Tech.

LAST TIME OUT

With 4-3 clinch wins being a staple of head coach Lloyd Bruce-Burgess' tenure at UCF, it was only fitting that the Knights secured their first Big 12 win of the season in a dramatic winner-take-all tiebreak over No. 10 Arizona. Dominating the doubles point once again, the Black and Gold secured wins on courts two through four, headlined by Mehdi Benchakroun's valiant triumph over ninth-ranked Jay Friend to tally the squad's second win over the Wildcats this season.

Two days prior, the Knights took the doubles point and four first sets in singles against reigning national champions TCU, however, the second-ranked Horned Frogs weathered the UCF charge to take the match, 4-2.

QUICK HITS

THE OPPONENTS

BYU - Friday at 6:30 p.m. ET

Last year's contest between the Cougars and Knights, the first all-time, was a highlight for the team's historic 2024 campaign. Down multiple match points, Paul Colin battled back to secure a 4-3 win for UCF, making for an anticipated rematch in the mountains.

A difficult 4-3 defeat in Stillwater to Oklahoma State preceded another loss to Texas Tech in Lubbock, 4-1. While the Cowboys (Knights win, 4-0) serve as the only common opponent between the two squads, both will author similar lineups to last year's contest.

Utah - Sunday at 3 p.m. ET

A lone meeting in 2007 in which UCF won, 6-1, is the only history between these two programs. The Utes have won five of their last six, including a strong triumph over Texas Tech where they secured wins on courts one, three and four.

Berk Bugarikj leads the team on court one and is ranked 97th in the nation, while Reid Jarvis and Dante Carlos Teramo sit at No. 52 in the doubles edition.

BRIDGEWATER, Mass. -- The Bridgewater State University men's tennis team dropped a 5-2 decision to visiting Wentworth on Thursday afternoon at the Rosen Memorial Tennis Courts. The match marked the home opener for the Bears.

The visiting Leopards improve to 2-7 on the season while the Bears fall to 1-1.

The two teams have met eight times since 2015 with seven of the eight matches taking place at the Rosen Courts. Wentworth has won six of the eight meetings including each of the last three.

The Leopards swept the three doubles matches to take the early 1-0 lead. Senior Pranav Marwaha (Nashua, N.H.) teamed with junior Rene Rodriguez (Doral, Fla.) for a 6-2 win at the second flight while the pairing of senior Niko Rosich (Chicago, Ill.) and sophomore Manas Arya (Hessen, Germany) posted a 6-3 victory at number three. Junior Eric Doraci (Natick, Mass.) and freshman Andre Juscamaita (Lima, Peru) completed the doubles sweep with a 6-4 decision at number one.

Juscamaita notched a 6-3, 6-0 straight set win at the top singles flight and Rodriguez earned a 6-2, 6-1 straight set triumph at number three to extend the Wentworth lead to 3-0.

Sophomore Anthony Lucas (Weymouth, Mass.) got the Bears on the board with a 6-4, 6-3 straight set victory at the sixth flight and freshman Tyler Rocchio (Attleboro, Mass.) cut the BSU deficit to 3-2 as he battled back from a set down to record a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 win at number five.

Rosich, however, outlasted BSU freshman Khiem Nguyen (Burlington, Vt.) in tough three-setter at fourth singles, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, to secure the decisive fourth point for the visitors.

Marwaha capped off the 5-2 win for Wentworth with a tough three-set victory at second singles over BSU junior Tom Ayson (Plymouth, Mass.), 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.

The Bears are off until next Wednesday afternoon when they entertain Roger Williams University at 3:30.

(Atlantic) Atlantic Head Tennis Coach Mike McDermott states the Atlantic girls' tennis team combines experience and youth. He aims to improve the team's dual record from last year, which was 4-7. Returning this season are two sophomores and two seniors who gained valuable experience from last year's lineup.

Coach McDermott emphasizes the need to finalize the rest of the six-person roster. Forty-three players reported to practice this week, with 23 making up the girls' squad.

Coach McDermott mentions that Kuemper, Clarinda, and Shenandoah are the favorites in the Hawkeye Ten Conference. The Trojans will open their season on April 7 at Kuemper.

The boy's squad returns many upperclassmen, led by State Doubles qualifier and senior Kinnick Juhl, along with Conner Johnson, Gradyn O'Hara, Reid Woodward, and Conner Silence.

Sophomore Rayden Wheeler returns to the lineup. Wheeler finished the season with a 1-2 record in doubles and showed well in a couple of J.V. Tournaments. Coach McDermott is looking for more out of him and others to fill out the rest of the Trojans lineup. One hole to fill will be replacing Nolan Waters, who teamed up with Juhl at the State Dual Tournament one year ago.

The Trojans finished last season with an 8-5 dual record.

The Atlantic boy's Tennis squad opens up at home against Kuemper on April 7.

                                        Libby High School tennis coach Kyle Hannah hits balls during practice Wednesday, March 19, 2025. (Scott Shindledecker/The Western News)
                                    
                                        



Last year, the Libby tennis team definitely had some highlights, namely Ryan Beagle winning the state Class A singles championship.

But that was last year, and this year, the team wants to make memories of its own.

Head coach Kyle Hannah is eager to see how his squad rises to the challenge after an outstanding 2024 campaign. With 17 seniors on last year's roster, the team boasted significant experience and delivered exceptional results. 

The boys' squad finished third at state, including Beagle's singles championship, the first individual tennis championship for Libby since Loggers star Jackie Mee won the Class A girls title in 2009.

This season, the Loggers face a new set of challenges as they integrate a wave of fresh faces. The team has grown to 41 participants, including 22 new players eager to learn the game and compete at a high level. The blend of youth and experience will be key as Libby looks to remain competitive in one of the toughest tennis conferences in Montana.

“It will be exciting to watch many of those new to the sport fall in love with the game of tennis,” Hannah said. “Our goals and expectations remain the same each year: learn the game of tennis, play hard, and have fun. However, those striving to compete for Libby's third state championship will be challenged to reach that level. If you ask a few of the boys, another state trophy is in their vision!”

Leading the charge this season will be a talented group of seniors, including Beagle, Alderic Martineau, Maggie Fantozzi, Marissa Hollingworth, Dayton Johnson, Eric Thompson, Dylan Warner and Mara Murer. 

“Our team's strengths this year will be in singles,” Hannah noted. “We will take our lumps early on, but come mid-April, we should be competing every week.”

Libby's conference remains one of the toughest in the state, with powerhouse programs such as Polson and Whitefish consistently fielding strong teams. Columbia Falls also produces contenders each year, making the road to the postseason a demanding one. Only four singles players and four doubles teams qualify for state, making every match an important stepping stone toward that goal.

Guiding the Loggers through this transition is a coaching staff with decades of experience. Hannah marks his 20th year as head coach and assistant coach Terry Oedewaldt has been by his side for 16 of those years, playing a crucial role in player development. 

The team also benefits from the return of coach Barb Mee, who was part of the staff during Hannah's first four years and has rejoined in recent seasons. Additionally, the Libby community has been instrumental in supporting the program, with volunteers such as coach Dave Nelson dedicating time to work with student-athletes.

With a mix of experienced players and an influx of enthusiastic newcomers, Libby tennis is poised to make another strong push in the competitive Northwest A Conference. 

Fans can expect an exciting season as the team works toward another state tournament appearance and perhaps even another trophy for the Loggers' legacy.

The Loggers are scheduled to open the season Friday at Polson at 9 a.m. with a match against Hamilton at noon.

Rain or shine, the Blue Devils took care of business. 

Despite a stormy start at San Diego State March 13, Duke rallied to dominate the Aztecs 4-0 in their first meeting since 1992. Duke then returned to a sunny Durham to handle Yale 7-0 on Tuesday. This was the seventh-ranked Blue Devils' third straight shutout match and first match of the season in their outdoor Ambler Stadium. 

The match started at 6 p.m. — four hours behind schedule — as the gloomy conditions persisted.

“I can't remember, in my time at Duke, playing a match where we practice one of the five days before a match,” head coach Jamie Ashworth said. “... We got here on Monday and didn't practice and couldn't practice on Tuesday and couldn't practice yesterday.”

“For us, mentally, we just try to prepare before the game,” sophomore Shavit Kimchi said. “It's not going to be easy, and we all told ourselves, “It might be nasty today, it might not be the cleanest, but we're here to fight. We're here to get the job done.”

Duke continued its strong doubles performance, with senior Ellie Coleman and freshman Irina Balus disposing of their opponents 7-5. Kimchi and freshman Ava Krug, meanwhile, lost their set 6-2. With the point in limbo, senior Emma Jackson and freshman Liv Hovde delivered for the Blue Devils with a 6-4 victory. 

“They've hit 1000 balls this spring, they've hit millions of balls in their lives, and they know how to play tennis,” Ashworth said of the team. “I think that they did a really good job of handling that adversity, because it easily could have gone the other way.”

Moving into singles, Kimchi's performance remained sluggish but competitive. Losing the first set 6-4, the Sdey Hemed, Israel, native pushed through long, rhythmic rallies from the baseline to nab the second set 6-4. 

Meanwhile, Hovde and sophomore Eleana Yu leapt out to early leads to win their first sets, 6-3, 6-2. Yu went on to wrap up her second set 6-1, increasing Duke's margin to 2-0. As Hovde's second set progressed, the Daniel Island, S.C., native and her opponent tried to use high, deep shots to get the ball out of the other's reach. Although each game remained competitive, she edged ahead and continued to build each point for a 7-5 win.

Junior Katie Codd narrowly secured her first set 7-6 with a 7-3 tiebreaker, while Jackson stormed her way to a commanding 6-1 win. In Jackson's second set, however, the La Grange Park, Ill., native found herself evenly matched and pushed around the baseline, losing 6-3 as she attempted to respond.

With one set in the bag, Kimchi was ready for a final showdown. With the match score 3-0, it fell to Kimchi, Jackson, Codd or Balus to clinch and extend the Blue Devils' win streak to six matches. 

“Eventually, I got to the second set, I got a lot of confidence from that, and then [Coach] Jamie [Ashworth] was doing a great job with trying to motivate me when I was playing the third set, and pushed me to do the right thing and make a better decision when I'm playing,” Kimchi said. 

Jackson and Balus began their third sets well before Kimchi. However, as they remained bogged down in dogfights against stubborn yet increasingly tired opposition, Kimchi pulled ahead and started her match-deciding set. Jackson made her opponent run all around the court, her boundary-testing shots getting the better of San Diego State's Gloria Alogo, while Balus's early lead slowly narrowed.

Taking advantage of her reach and height, Kimchi steadied herself and put the Aztecs' Zoe Olmos on the defensive. Her shots remained patient as her opponent's overtures failed to yield a momentum-breaking mistake. Leading 5-0, Kimchi became more aggressive; with an ace aimed down the center of the court, she clinched the ninth match of her career.

“[Kimchi] didn't have the best of fall seasons, to be honest with you. I think she's coming around and starting to play like she's capable of playing,” Ashworth explained. “I've talked to her a lot … We've not wavered in our belief [in] her.”

Physically, the stands of the outdoor Ambler Stadium were pretty sparse. But what was lacking in occupation was made up for in noise — specifically that of the rowdy Duke men's tennis team seated above court five. 

“You know what's better than one bagel?” shouted a player. 

“TWO!” responded the rest of the team.

The bagel in this scenario refers to the “0” in a 6-0 first set, which was delivered hot by Duke's Coleman to Yale's Mirabelle Brettkelly. A double-bagel was possible for Coleman.

Yet, the Midland, Mich., native's game streak ended when Brettkelly finally managed to hold onto her serve to make it 1-1 in the second set. 

At deuce, Coleman sprinted to reach a dropshot from Brettkelly, lunging to make contact with the ball before dropping her racket and falling to the ground. The senior's hustle was rewarded — the ball landed short on the other side, and Brettkelly was unable to reach it. Coleman continued her hustle against her Bulldog opponent's newfound stamina and ended the match 6-0, 6-4. 

Coleman was the second singles win in her team's eventual sweep of Yale, as Duke won all six singles matches plus the doubles point. 

“We want to make sure that we continue to make this a really tough place for people to play,” Ashworth said. “Whether that's the crowd, whether that's our men's team [being] out here and being a little bit vocal, whatever it is. We want to make sure that teams know … It's one of the tougher places to play in the country.” 

Not every set came easily, though. After double-faulting in the first-set tiebreaker, Kimchi was down 3-1 on court three. Despite only a two-point difference, it looked as though the momentum had shifted to Yale's Julia Werdiger. 

But, as the late-afternoon heat wore off, the sophomore Blue Devil kept her cool — winning the next six points to close out the set 7-6 and winning her next 6-2. 

“The biggest thing for us in those moments and those matches is not to play scared,” Ashworth said. “For the most part, we did that well … I think in singles, we're just deeper than them.” 

This roster depth was obvious from the start. In singles, Duke won the first game on every court except court three. Irina Balus, ranked No. 12 nationally, overpowered Yale's Shyla Aggarwal for an early 3-0 lead on court two. The freshman star dropped her first game in a disappointing deuce loss, which had been replayed due to a stray ball from a neighboring court. However, Balus was unfazed and went right back to overpowering Aggarwal. At 5-2, the Slovakia native hit a deep shot down the line to break the Bulldog yet again. The Blue Devil quickly closed out a second set at 6-2, earning Duke its first of six singles points. 

Blue Devils Eleana Yu and Katie Codd on courts four and six, respectively, both earned four straight points to win their first sets 6-3. Later, Yu closed out her match 6-3, 6-4, and Codd finished 6-3, 6-3. 

The first win of the night started with Kimchi and partner Ava Krug in their doubles matchup against Angela Huang and Werdiger on court two. The Yale tandem suffered many unforced errors that gave the more consistent Kimchi-Krug pairing the upper hand. The Blue Devils came out with a 6-2 win, redeeming their doubles loss to San Diego State. 

Duke's Hovde and Jackson also pulled their weight, winning 6-4 against Erin Ha and Brettkelly on court three. The Blue Devils' win here was enough to earn Duke the overall doubles point, halting Balus and Coleman's 4-4 contest on court one. 

“I think as a team we are doing really well,” Hovde said. “Every match is tough, so I think we're really resilient out here. It was our first outdoor match [at home], so I think we did really well.” 

Duke will be back at Ambler Stadium Friday at 6 p.m. to kick-off conference play against No.10 N.C. State.

The Miami Open attracts the world's top tennis players to South Florida. Last year's event unexpectedly led to a cancer diagnosis for Canadian tennis star Gabriela Dabrowski.

Dabrowski had an impressive 2024 season. The 32-year-old won her first Olympic medal, advanced at Wimbledon, and reached her career-high doubles ranking at No. 3 in the world. But her most vicious opponent wasn't on the court – it was in the form of cancer.

Watch NBC6 free wherever you are

“Pretty much a year ago, we have these very comprehensive physicals that look at lots of different facets of our health, and one of them is to see a general doctor,"" she told NBC6. ""And I'd had this lump for a little while, and I thought it might be growing, and I asked her to check it out. And she said, 'Oh, I'm really not sure what it is, but because I'm not sure, I want you to get a scan.'""

That was at the 2024 Miami Open during a health screening required for every female player. Things escalated quickly from there and scans would reveal it was breast cancer. Yet only her inner circle knew about it.

“I think I compartmentalized with the help of a few key people in my life,"" Dabrowski said of playing while knowing about her diagnosis. ""And then with the tennis part, it was like this bonus of, 'OK, can I still play?' Like, in between surgeries, I could play a little bit.""

Dabrowski was able to compete alongside her doubles partner, Erin Routliffe, all while undergoing treatment and surgeries. She didn't just play a little. She dominated all while holding on to this secret. She revealed her life-altering news later in an Instagram post that she said took months to write.

“Going into the new year, I was like, 'I'm ready, I'm ready to share what I went through,' and my main goal is to just hopefully have a positive impact because I really want women to know that early screenings save lives,” Dabrowski said.



The cancer diagnosis became a catalyst for what she describes as sustained change.

“I feel really lucky to be able to play a sport for a living, to be able to travel the world, although travel days will never be fun, and I don't think that can change. Yeah, I just feel a lot more grateful to play tennis as my job and also have the opportunity to kind of get my health back,” she said.

Dabrowsit got her health back and has returned to the event that marked the beginning of her cancer journey, this time, with renewed passion and strength. She is on long-term treatment with at least five years of endocrine therapy. 

The Women's Tennis Association invited NBC6 inside the physicals that first set Dabrowski on her cancer journey at the Miami Open, and it's the first stop every female player makes before they hit the court.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcmiami.com', 'title': 'NBC Miami'}"

 by Clara Rodriguez Fernandez | Mar 21, 2025

Water could have first formed when the first stars died in supernova explosions only 100 million to 200 million years after the Big Bang — billions of years earlier than scientists previously thought.

Astronomers have used computer simulations to study the supernova explosions of the first generations of stars in the Universe. The simulations show that when these stars died, they left behind oxygen and hydrogen, which reacted to form water over the course of millions of years to form the first water molecules.

This discovery means it may have been possible for the first habitable planets to form early on in the history of the Universe, even before the first galaxies did.

“Our simulations show that water was probably a key constituent of the first galaxies,” said Daniel Whalen from the University of Portsmouth. “This implies the conditions necessary for the formation of life were in place way earlier than we ever imagined — it's a significant step forward in our understanding of the early Universe.”



Right after the Big Bang, the Universe was made entirely of light elements, mostly hydrogen and helium. Heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen, appeared later — they were created through nuclear fusion reactions in the first stars.

Water, however, is a more complex and fragile molecule that requires cooler temperatures to form and remain stable. The aftermath of the first supernova explosions may have provided just the right conditions, and Whalen's team has been the first to simulate how this may have happened.

“Before the first stars exploded, there was no water in the Universe because there was no oxygen,” said Whalen. “Oxygen, forged in the hearts of these supernovae, combined with hydrogen to form water, paving the way for the creation of the essential elements needed for life.”

The researchers simulated two types of supernova explosions that were likely to happen among the first generation of stars, which were much larger and lived shorter than the stars we observe in the Universe today — the simulated stars had 13 and 200 times the mass of the Sun. 

The calculations showed that after the supernovae expanded and cooled down, oxygen reacted with hydrogen to form water. These water molecules were highly concentrated in cloud cores, dense clumps of gas that are thought to be where stars and planets first formed.

There was a key difference between both types of supernovae. The explosion of the larger star could produce water within “just” three million years — between 10 and 30 times faster than the smaller supernova. Most likely, the first water molecules appeared in the Universe when the largest stars died, as early as 100 million years after the Big Bang.

“Although the total water masses were modest, they were highly concentrated in the only structures capable of forming stars and planets,” said Whalen. “These early water-rich regions likely seeded the formation of planets at cosmic dawn, long before the first galaxies took shape.”

These results challenge previous theories of how early life could have first emerged in the Universe. However, more research will be needed to better understand what happened to the first water molecules after they formed in early supernovae. “How much water survived the harsh radiation environments of the first galaxies remains to be determined,” said Whalen.

The simulations only considered the simplest possible case, where a single star explodes. Future studies could look into how several overlapping supernova explosions — a more likely scenario — may have affected the formation of the first water molecules. The researchers stated in their study that, while further explosions could destroy some of the water initially formed, they could also contribute to the creation of denser cores where it would be easier for water to form and survive radiation.

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended Thursday 68 bridges across 19 states be evaluated with a ""vulnerability assessment"" to determine their risk of collapse if involved in a vessel collision in the wake of last year's deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. 

Over the last year, the NTSB identified 68 bridges built before 1991 that don't have a ""current vulnerability assessment."" The recommendations were issued to 30 owners of the 68 different bridges across the country, NTSB officials announced Thursday. 

Some of the bridges include the Golden Gate Bridge in California, the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City and the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida. 

In response to the recommendation from the NTSB, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District said Thursday that the Golden Gate Bridge is ""in full compliance with all state and federal regulations"" and that the district hired a consultant this year to ""conduct an assessment of the South Tower fender system's structural capacity for ship collisions.""

The NTSB noted that their recommendation does not suggest that the 68 bridges are certain to collapse, but rather those bridge owners evaluate whether the bridges are above the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' acceptable level of risk. 

The 68 bridges were divided into two categories, ""critical/essential"" and ""typical."" Those deemed critical/essential are those that serve as ""important links."" The Key Bridge had this classification. Those that are not deemed critical/essential fall under the typical designation. 

The recommendation comes as NTSB officials released new information in the Key Bridge collapse investigation Thursday. Nearly a year ago, on March 26, 2024, a large cargo ship lost electrical power and crashed into the Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, and knocking eight roadworkers, six of whom died, into the Patapsco River.

""Had the Key Bridge's owner, the Maryland Transportation Authority, or MDTA, conducted a vulnerability assessment based on recent vessel traffic as recommended by AASHTO, MDTA would have been aware that the Key Bridge was above the acceptable risk and would have had information to proactively reduce the bridge's risk of a collapse and loss of lives associated with a vessel collision with the bridge,"" NTSB said in a statement Thursday.

The NTSB found that the Key Bridge was almost 30 times greater than the acceptable risk threshold for critical or essential bridges.

NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the final report of the Baltimore incident will be released in the fall.

President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing will be awarded a contract to build the next generation of U.S. fighter jets. 

""The F-47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built,"" President Trump said. ""An experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost five years, and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation.""

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth joined Trump in the Oval Office for the announcement, describing the program as the Next Generation Air Dominance initiative.

Hegseth said the program signals to allies that the U.S. remains firmly committed to global security — and warns adversaries of America's unmatched ability to project power.

President Trump would not reveal a lot of details about the F-47, citing national security. However, a rendering shows a flat aircraft with a pointed nose. 

""This plane flies with drones, flies with many, many drones, as many as you want,"" President Trump said. ""It is a technology that's new but it doesn't by itself. It flies with many drones — something no other plane can do.""

The Associated Press reports that the initial contract with Boeing is worth an estimated $20 billion.

“I don't really think they should be our 51st state. There. I said it,” commented Rogan during a recent episode of his show

One of America's leading podcasters, Joe Rogan, is clearly an advocate for peaceful U.S. coexistence with Canada.

While he has been cited as influential in getting Donald Trump re-elected as president of the United States again, he has made it clear that America needs to back off on increasing international tension with Canada.

“Why are we upset at Canada? This is stupid, this over tariffs,” Rogan said during the March 14 episode of his popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, while conversing with comedian Michael Kosta.

As the two men watch a clip from the Canada-U.S. final in the Four Nations Cup, Rogan continues: “100 per cent. (Canadians) booed us over tariffs.”

Kosta responds by relating a story of doing a stand up gig in Edmonton during the 2010 Olympic hockey gold medal game when Canada beat the U.S. He says a fan sent him a chart about Canada's water usage during the game. “It was like the whole f**king country went to the bathroom at the same time.”

Rogan laughed and then continued with his pro-Canadian sentiment.

“We gotta become friends with Canada again …This is so ridiculous. I can't believe there's anti-American, anti-Canadian sentiment going on. It's the dumbest.”

Kosta queried Rogan on whether there actually is anti-Canadian sentiment and Rogan responds in a voice mocking Americans critical of Canada: “Yeah, there's lots of idiots that, ‘Now they're our f**king enemy. Why are we subsidizing Canada? Well, how come they don't have their own military?'”

Rogan suggests, incorrectly, that Canada doesn't have an armed forces, but he is prepared to let that go: “Let's just deal with it, as it is.”

Both men were aware that Canada is about to launch into an election, though they admit to not understanding our electoral system.

Still, says Rogan, “I just want America and Canada to get along. I think (this) is ridiculous.”

He expressed pointed disagreement with Trump. “I don't really think they should be our 51st state. There. I said it.”

Instead, Rogan muses about Greenland becoming the 51st state. “It's more accessible. We could probably buy that … Plus if global warming is real because of all the digging and oil … it would be good to have a cold spot.”

The North American rift began back in December when Trump started referring to Canada as the 51st state of the United States. Then, fuelling the controversy further, Trump has initiated a tariff war on Canadian goods such as lumber, aluminum and steel.

The controversy boiled over into the sports world, where the U.S. national anthem has been booed heavily during sporting events in Canada. The national anthem for both countries is played before all NBA and NHL games played in Canada. Videos of the U.S. national anthem being booed before tipoff or puck drop have gone viral.

Aside from his Monday-Friday podcast, which reaches 14.5 million listeners on Spotify, Rogan is active in professional sports, particularly mixed martial arts, as an analyst and commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship franchise.

After claims about civil rights leader and World War veteran Medgar Evers' name being removed from the Arlington National Cemetery website surfaced, a spokesperson clarified that it was only ‘moved to a different section'. Now, social media influencers say that Colin Powell's name was purged from the list of notable Americans buried in the cemetery.

This comes as the Arlington National Cemetery has reportedly removed several web pages that celebrated Black and women veterans. The HuffPost reported that the purging follows President Donald Trump's executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the federal government.

Talking Point Memo reported that an army webpage from 2008 that lauded President Harry Truman's 1948 integration order has disappeared. It was available as recently as last year, web archives show.

Responding to the TPM report, a spokesperson said: “As Secretary Hegseth has said, DEI is dead at the Defense Department. Efforts to divide the force — to put one group ahead of another through DEI programs — erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution,”

“We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms. In the rare cases that content is removed that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct components accordingly.”

Users on Elon Musk-led X fact-checked claims. “No individuals have been removed from the listings of Notable Graves on the Arlington Cemetery website. Colin Powell is listed in the section ‘Prominent Military Figures',” a community note read.

Colin Powell was a Black American general and statesman. He served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1989–1993), overseeing the Gulf War, and as Secretary of State (2001–2005) during the start of the Iraq war. Known for the ""Powell Doctrine"" and breaking racial barriers, he died of COVID-19 complications in 2021.

Obviously, many visitors to Yellowstone National Park gape in awe at the roaming bison or the colour of the Grand Prismatic Spring, but few know that the park is standing over a giant supervolcano. 

Volcanoes are known to have existed or may exist in regions where colossal volcanic eruptions, with at least 1,000 cubic kilometres of volcanic material being ejected, occurred. The Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field covers most of Yellowstone National Park and extends across parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

“While driving south from Mammoth Hot Springs towards Norris Geyser Basin early on Aug. 5 last summer, a park scientist noticed a billowing steam column through the trees and across a marshy expanse,” Yellowstone National Park geologists Jefferson Hungerford and Kiernan Folz-Donahue shared in a blog post.

While the last known lava flow in the area occurred over 70,000 years ago, Yellowstone remains one of the most geothermally active places on Earth. It is home to more than 10,000 hydrothermal features, including geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles.

“This hydrothermal activity persists through this day but is much less energetic than when it first formed,” Hungerford and Folz-Donahue noted.

However, on March 17, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) revealed that its geologists had identified a newly formed volcanic vent during the summer of 2024. 

This vent, which continuously emits steam, was found at the base of a lava flow. Scientists recorded its temperature as scorching 171 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius), and the vent has remained active for several months.

Upon closer examination, a team of geologists confirmed that this was indeed new. There is also speculation that it may be linked to previous geothermal activity detected in the same region in March 2003.

“One could run a line along the axis of the older active area and it would intersect the new feature. This line also follows the trend of faults that run from Norris Geyser Basin northward to Mammoth Hot Springs and beyond,” Hungerford and Folz-Donahue concluded.

The global population may have been undercounted with billions not accounted for, a new study, published in the journal Nature Communications has claimed. As per the UN estimates, the current world population is around 8.2 billion and is projected to peak at over 10 billion by mid-2080. However, the researchers at Aalto University in Finland found that rural population figures in these estimates could have been undercounted anywhere between 53 per cent to 84 per cent over the study period between 1975 and 2010.

""For the first time, our study provides evidence that a significant proportion of the rural population may be missing from global population datasets,"" said Josias Lang-Ritter, a PhD scholar who was involved with the study.

""The results are remarkable, as these datasets have been used in thousands of studies and extensively support decision-making, yet their accuracy has not been systematically evaluated,"" he added.

For the study, researchers analysed the five most widely used global population datasets (WorldPop, GWP, GRUMP, LandScan, and GHS-POP) that map the planet in evenly spaced, high-resolution grid cells with population counts based on census data.



It highlighted that there were ""fundamental limitations"" with the national population census while gauging rural populations. Citing an example, the researchers claim that the 2012 census in Paraguay ""may have missed a quarter of the population"".

""Communities in remote locations or impacted by conflict and violence are difficult to access, and census enumerators often face language barriers and resistance to participation,"" it stated.

Since the study focused on maps for the period 1975-2010 owing to a lack of data from later years, findings showed the 2010 datasets had the least bias, ""missing between one-third (32 per cent) to three-quarters (77 per cent) of the rural population"".

""While our study shows accuracy has somewhat improved over decades, the trend is clear: global population datasets miss a significant portion of the rural population. With the same basic practices in place, it's unlikely that slightly improved input data could correct for this level of bias.""

The undercounting of the population could have serious ramifications as governments, international bodies and researchers rely on global population data for resource allocation, infrastructure planning disease epidemiology and disaster risk management.

Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar was a key player in the negotiations with Hamas to free the remaining hostages and reach a cease-fire.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his domestic intelligence chief, extending a purge of rivals in the security establishment while further overhauling the cabinet that presided during the devastating Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.

 Netanyahu convened his ministers Thursday for a vote to remove Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar after arguing that the spy chief had lost his trust. The move, which the prime minister had signaled last weekend, was controversial because the Shin Bet is currently investigating some of Netanyahu's aides. Bar was also a key player in the negotiations with Hamas to free the remaining hostages and reach a cease-fire, and his ouster gives Netanyahu's close aides a tighter grip over the talks.  Israel's resumption of a military campaign in Gaza this week has stoked fresh worries over the fate of the hostages. Thousands of protesters marched in Jerusalem on Thursday outside Netanyahu's home to oppose Bar's dismissal and demand elections. Police used water cannons to disperse some of the demonstrators. Netanyahu shook off those public concerns, protests this week over the expected firing and objections raised by Israel's attorney general to proceed with the dismissal. It followed an earlier removal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, another rival in the security services, and the pushing out of Herzi Halevi, who headed the country's military. Several other senior military commanders and officials have stepped down since the intelligence failures of Oct. 7. Bar, in a letter sent to ministers on Thursday, said his dismissal was designed to prevent his agency from fulfilling its duty and preventing it from investigating thoroughly the reasons of Israel's failure to prevent Hamas's Oct 7. attacks, as well as other serious incidents. He also said his removal from the negotiating team harmed efforts to free the hostages. “The government is seeking to take steps that will weaken the [the state], internally and against enemies,” Bar warned. Protesters marching in Jerusalem outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home to oppose Bar's dismissal and demand elections. The government voted unanimously to dismiss Bar, who will leave his position on April 10 or earlier if a replacement is appointed. The departures have tightened Netanyahu's control over his government, which had been divided by disputes over the conduct of the war with Hamas following the Oct. 7 attacks that left around 1,200 dead and another roughly 250 taken hostage. Netanyahu appointed a more ideologically aligned defense minister in Israel Katz and this week cut a deal to bring far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir back into his coalition. Katz also appointed a new military chief seen as more in line with the government's plan for the renewed invasion of Gaza and potential military occupation. But the moves have also left Israeli society more sharply divided and distrustful of its leadership. Netanyahu, emboldened by a string of military victories, has revived old disputes by again pushing legislation that would give him more control over the country's judiciary, a gambit that sparked a year of mass protests ahead of the war. His government, the most right wing in Israel's history, is also seeking to preserve the fast-growing ultraorthodox population's exemption from military service. Thursday saw the second straight day of protests in Jerusalem against the planned dismissal of Bar. The protesters, who number in the thousands, say the firing of Bar is part of undermining Israel's democratic institutions undertaken by Netanyahu's government and are demanding a change of government.

Melinda French Gates has reacted to her ex-husband Bill Gates' statement that their divorce was the ""mistake"" he regrets the most. Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates announced their split in May 2021 following 27 years of marriage. They were officially divorced three months later. Now, in a recent interview with Elle Magazine, the 60-year philanthropist briefly spoke about her split from the Microsoft co-founder. ""Look, divorces are painful, and it's not something I would wish on any family,"" she told the outlet when asked about her ex-husband's recent comments lamenting how their relationship ended.

""You've clearly Googled more than I have,"" French Gates said when the writer pointed to her ex's comments about regretting their divorce. She also emphasised that despite the difficulty of ending their 27-year marriage, she was confident in her ability to move forward after the divorce. ""I knew when I got divorced, I would be okay on my own. And I think that was the most important thing,"" she said, as per the New York Post. 

Further, when asked what she would want somebody to find if they searched for updates on her down the line, French Gates replied that she'd want the public to see ""she's thriving on the other side of a divorce.""

French Gates' comments come months after the Microsoft co-founder opened up about the divorce. ""The divorce thing was miserable for me and Melinda for at least two years,"" Gates told the Times of London. He also admitted that he had hoped their marriage would be as successful as that of his parents, Bill Sr. and Mary, who lived together for 45 years. 

""There is a certain wonderfulness to spending your entire adult life with one person because of the memories and depth of things you have done and having kids together,"" the tech billionaire told the outlet. He also said that he would have to put the public divorce ""at the top of the list"" of his failures throughout his life. ""There are others but none that matter,"" he added.

Gates later also said that ""despite the fact that the divorce wasn't great, having those three kids, the work we were able to do together - even if I knew that it [wouldn't] last forever, I would still do it again.""

He added that he is now ""lucky to have a serious girlfriend"", referring to philanthropist Paula Hurd. ""We're having fun, going to the Olympics and lots of great things,"" Gates said about Hurd.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

(Reuters) -Britain's Heathrow Airport, a major global travel hub, said it would be closed for all of Friday after a huge fire at a nearby electrical substation wiped out its power, disrupting flight schedules around the world.

Here are some facts about the world's fourth-busiest international airport:

KEY NUMBERS:

-- Heathrow serves more than 230 destinations in nearly 90 countries.

-- Ninety airlines have made Heathrow their base, including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa.

-- According to the group's traffic summary, 5.7 million passengers travelled through Heathrow in February 2025, making it the busiest February on record. Passenger numbers amounted to 84.1 million from March 2024 to February 2025.

-- There are two main runways. The northern one is 3,902 metres long. The southern is 3,658 metres.

-- The airport will submit its proposal for a third runway this summer, weeks after the British government granted its support to the project citing its potential to boost trade and economic growth.

MORE:  

-- Heathrow is operating at 99% capacity and risks being overtaken by European rivals. Its two runways compare with four each at Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt Airport, and six at Amsterdam's Schiphol.

-- The airport is owned and operated by Heathrow Airport Holdings, whose owners include Ardian, Qatar Investment Fund and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

-- There are around 475,000 total aircraft movements through Heathrow annually.

-- The most popular destination out of Heathrow is New York.

-- More than 90,000 people work at the airport, the UK's largest single-site employer.

HISTORY:

-- The airport is named after the village or hamlet of Heathrow, which used to be roughly where Terminal 3 now stands.

-- It began as a tented village in 1946 serving 18 destinations with a handful of airlines making 9,000 flights a year.

-- The first departure was on New Year's Day 1946 to Buenos Aires via Lisbon, the first refuelling stop on a long-haul flight to open up Britain's first air link with South America.

-- Heathrow's first terminal for short haul flights opened in 1955. Originally known as the Europa Building, it is now known as Terminal 2.

-- Terminal 1 was formally opened in 1969 by Queen Elizabeth and was closed in June 2015. Terminal 3 opened in 1961 and Terminal 4 in 1986.

-- Terminal 5 opened in 2008. The public inquiry into its construction was the longest in British planning history, lasting nearly four years.

Fire at substation leaves Heathrow airport closed — and travellers scrambling

London's Heathrow Airport said on Friday it was resuming flights after a fire at a substation knocked out its power, and it expected to run a full operation on Saturday, though experts questioned how such crucial infrastructure could fail.

The fire, which was reported just after 11 p.m. local time on Thursday, forced planes to divert to airports across Britain and Europe, while many long-haul flights simply returned to their point of departure.

Huge orange flames and plumes of black smoke could be seen shooting into the sky from a power station roughly three kilometres from the airport. It took about 70 firefighters and seven hours to get the blaze under control, the London Fire Brigade said. By early morning the roads around Britain's biggest airport were largely deserted.

Police said that while there was no indication of a criminal cause to the blaze, they retained an open mind and counter-terrorism officers would lead the inquiries, given their capabilities and the critical nature of the infrastructure.

Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the ""catastrophic"" fire had prevented the power back-up system from working and that engineers were working to deploy a third back-up mechanism. 

Philip Ingram, a former intelligence officer in the British military, said Heathrow's inability to keep operating exposed vulnerability in Britain's critical national infrastructure.

""It is a wake-up call,"" he told Reuters. ""There is no way that Heathrow should be taken out completely because of a failure in one power substation.""

Airline experts said the last time European airports experienced disruption on such a large scale was the 2010 Icelandic ash cloud, which grounded some 100,000 flights.

Heathrow said its expectation was ""to operate our normal schedule starting with [Friday] evening's departures,"" but that ""customers should check the status of their flight before going to the airport.""

Air Canada said six flights that were in the air had to return to their departure points, while a seventh was cancelled just before departing. That list included flights from Calgary, Toronto and Montreal.

""We have been able to reroute some customers to other European gateways, but our available space for doing so is limited,"" Air Canada said in a statement. ""As well, we have put in place a policy for customers travelling to London to change their travel plans.""

""Once we are told by Heathrow how many flights we will be permitted to operate we will finalize tonight's schedule and notify customers and, as the situation normalizes, we will look to add extra capacity if needed to move delayed customers,"" the airline added.

Since the Heathrow closure was announced, a Friday morning flight from Halifax to London was cancelled, as were six more that had been scheduled for later in the day, which were departing from Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Vancouver.

Greater Toronto Airports Authority advised travellers heading to Toronto's Pearson Airport to check the status of their departures with their airline and that Pearson's social media accounts would provide regular updates.

""Currently all arriving flights are cancelled,"" the GTAA told CBC.

A representative from Montreal-Trudeau International Airport told CBC that three flights that were to depart late Thursday were affected and that two departures to Heathrow were cancelled Friday.

Vancouver International Airport said one Air Canada flight late Thursday was forced to return after taking off, while a British Airways flight was cancelled beforehand. The airport said a late Friday afternoon Air Canada flight to Heathrow and a British Airways departure scheduled for Friday night are scheduled to operate on time, but that travellers are advised to check ahead given the fluid situation.

The fire brigade said that 25,000 litres of cooling oil in the substation's transformer had caught fire. By the morning, the transformer could be seen smouldering, doused in white firefighting foam.

The cost of the impact could total around 20 million pounds ($37 million Cdn) a day, said Paul Charles, a travel consultant.

""A backup should be failsafe in the event of the core system being affected. Heathrow is such a vital piece of British infrastructure that it should have failsafe systems,"" Charles told Reuters.

Heathrow had said the airport, which was due to handle 1,351 flights during the day, flying up to 291,000 passengers, would stay closed until midnight, until amending the timeline late Friday afternoon local time.

Heathrow normally opens for flights daily at 6 a.m. local time due to nighttime flying restrictions.

Some 120 flights were in the air when the closure was announced, with some turned around and others diverted to Gatwick Airport outside London, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris or Ireland's Shannon Airport, tracking services showed.

British Airways itself had 341 flights scheduled to land at Heathrow on Friday.

""It's pretty stressful,"" said Robyn Autry, 39, a professor who had been due to fly home to New York. ""I'm worried about how much is it going to cost me to fix this.""

Prices at hotels around Heathrow jumped, with booking sites offering rooms for 500 pounds ($925 Cdn), roughly five times the normal price levels.

Heathrow, and London's other major airports, have been hit by outages in the past in recent years, most recently by an automated gate failure and an air traffic system meltdown, both in 2023.

Heathrow had its busiest January on record earlier this year, with more than 6.3 million passengers, up more than five per cent from the same period last year. January also was the 11th month in a row that it averaged over 200,000 passengers a day, with the airport citing trans-Atlantic travel as a key contributor.

Loughborough University, in partnership with Mission 89 and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK Branch of the British Parliament, has released the first-ever comprehensive global thematic report on sport trafficking.

The report presents a rigorous academic and policy-oriented analysis of human trafficking in the global sports ecosystem. It details a comprehensive literature review, interdisciplinary expert consultations, forensic analysis of documented trafficking incidents, comparative international policy assessment, and contributions from global experts. 

While highlighting the economic benefits of the sports industry, which is estimated to be between $471 billion and $1.4 trillion annually, the report sheds light on how this lucrative industry has become a magnet for traffickers exploiting vulnerable individuals, particularly young athletes from the Global South.

According to industry stakeholders, the absence of a specific definition for ‘sport trafficking' has presented significant challenges in distinguishing the phenomenon from migrant smuggling, irregular migration, and other forms of human trafficking, thereby preventing targeted Interventions. The report delivers a precise definition of sport trafficking, referred to as a process of recruiting and exploiting individuals within the sporting domain. 

 This is characterised by coercive mechanisms that compromise individuals and fundamental human rights. It not only involves the direct exploitation of athletes but also extends to the many ways the industry can serve as a conduit for labour and sexual exploitation, especially during mega sporting events which attract increased demand for informal labour and entertainment services. 

The report also identifies a range of different areas for improvement in efforts to combat sport trafficking and more effectively protect vulnerable athletes and aspiring athletes. Recommendations are revealed in the study for policymakers, law enforcement, prosecutors, the judiciary, service providers, and sport organisations.

Dr Serhat Yilmaz, the lead researcher behind the report and Senior Lecturer at Loughborough University, underlines the importance of the definition of sport trafficking provided within the report. 

“Without a precise, sport-specific definition of trafficking, we are dealing with inadequate legal protections, ineffective policy development, challenges in identifying and supporting victims, limited prevention strategies and blurred legal distinctions that allow perpetrators to escape accountability. Therefore, our objective behind this work  is to bring sport trafficking out of the shadows and into focused, actionable legal and social frameworks”, he explained.

The report also presents a typology of sport trafficking supported by case studies that are identified and developed through the research. This typology of sport trafficking, as another novel aspect of the document, provides an overview of the different types of trafficking evident in, through, and around sports involving different actors and forms of exploitative purpose. In each case, the existence of the type of trafficking is determined by the presence of the necessary constituent elements of the trafficking crime as per the definition of the UN TIP Protocol, also known as Palermo Protocol.

""Our research constitutes not merely a scholarly contribution; it represents a crucial advancement in comprehending and addressing vulnerabilities related to trafficking across many continents. By aligning our efforts with the United Nations SDG 8.7 and 16.2, we can foster a safer environment for every athlete, with particular emphasis on the issue of sports trafficking,"" stated Lerina Bright, Executive Director of Mission 89, the foremost independent non-governmental organisation committed to fighting the exploitation of young athletes through its 3 pillars of research, education and advocacy.

“With a clear and specialised definition, we can provide clearer legal frameworks, guide more effective policymaking, improve victim support mechanisms, enable more targeted educational efforts and help the judiciary better recognize and address these specific trafficking cases.”

US President Donald Trump has called out the New York Times for allegedly spreading fake news. On Thursday, the New York Times reported that Elon Musk is set to visit the Pentagon on Friday, and that he will be briefed on the “US military's plan for any war that might break out with China”. The NYT quoted two anonymous US officials as its source. Another official didn't provide many details but said that the briefing would be China-focused, it reported.

Hours after the news was published, President Trump called it “fake” and a “lie”. In a post on Truth Social, President Trump wrote, “The Fake News is at it again, this time the Failing New York Times. They said, incorrectly, that Elon Musk is going to the Pentagon tomorrow to be briefed on any potential “war with China.” How ridiculous?”

President Trump clarified that China will not even be mentioned or discussed.

""How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies. Anyway, the story is completely untrue!!!""



Musk, a Trump ally, has been tasked to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and cut government spending. If he is provided information on the US' plan for any potential war with China, it would be a ""dramatic expansion of his already extensive role"", NYT reported.

""The Defense Department is excited to welcome Elon Musk to the Pentagon on Friday. He was invited by Secretary Hegseth and is just visiting,"" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to CNN.

Musk's visit comes as the Pentagon considers major cuts to the top of the military. As part of the Department of Defense's ongoing effort to cut wasteful spending, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a memo Thursday directing the termination of over $580 million in programs, contracts and grants.

In addition to contracts, DOD is also cutting $360 million in grants. This includes a $6 million grant to decarbonise emissions from Navy ships, a $5.2 million grant to diversify the Navy and a $9 million university grant for developing ""equitable AI and machine learning models,"" Mr Hegseth said.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the Rapid Response team of the DOD also called the NYT report ""fake"" and added, ""Elon Musk and DOGE are doing great work to help the DOD!""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing has been awarded a major contract for the Air Force's high-tech next-generation F-47 fighter plane.

The contract is aimed at continuing the development of the replacement for the F-22 stealth warplane -- which has been in operation for some two decades -- with a new, more advanced aircraft that will be able to operate alongside uncrewed drones.

""After a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America's top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform to Boeing,"" Trump told reporters at the Oval Office.

He said the price of the contract could not be revealed for security reasons.

""Nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it'll be known as the F-47, the generals picked a title, and it's a beautiful number, F-47,"" said Trump, who is the 47th president of the United States.

The announcement is a boon for Boeing, which faced a difficult last year in which it struggled with a lengthy labor strike and safety problems.

The NGAD effort was paused in 2024 over cost concerns -- a major focus of the Trump administration, which has tasked billionaire donor Elon Musk with slashing government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).



The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the NGAD airframe could cost up to $300 million apiece -- significantly more than various other aircraft currently in the US inventory.

A senior Air Force officer said earlier this month that the service conducted a study following the pause last year, which concluded that ""not only in the past, not only in the present but in the future, air superiority matters.""

""What this study told us is we tried a whole bunch of different options and there is no more viable option than NGAD to achieve air superiority in this highly contested environment,"" Major General Joseph Kunkel told a symposium in Colorado.

The F-47 will replace the F-22 Raptor aircraft, the development of which dates to the 1980s.

The F-22 features stealth technology, a high degree of maneuverability and the ability to supercruise, or maintain supersonic flight without afterburners.

Jennifer Nikolaeff slowly inhales and exhales as she seeks ""a moment of calm"" at a free yoga class for sacked government workers in Washington, where life has been upended by Donald Trump's return.

""Many of us are trying to get jobs again, so this is just one way for us all to get together,"" said Nikolaeff, 53, who was recently fired from aid agency USAID after 15 years of service across the globe.

As dramatic job losses mount among government staff, a sense of gloom has descended on the US capital.

Of the city's 7,00,000 residents, 70,000 are federal employees with at least another 1,10,000 living in the suburbs.

Civil servants and contract workers, who are often passionate about politics and left-leaning, look on distraught as President Trump and his fellow Republicans slash the government and move to shut many of its agencies headquartered in the city.

Nikolaeff was locked out of her work system at the start of February. Two weeks later, she received a letter saying she was let go.

Since then ""it felt like every day was going through an entire cycle of grief, from sadness to loss, anger,"" she said.

In the city that voted 90 percent for Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential election, three times as many people filed for unemployment benefits in February as in the same period last year.

""The energy has been sucked from everyone,"" said Nick McFarland, a waiter in a Washington bar.

While many have been laid off, others fear they are next to receive the fateful email. Staff are often locked out of offices in the days before cuts are confirmed.

Some of those laid off are already looking for a new job, while also fighting in court to keep their current ones.

Those still on the payroll have had work-from-home options cut back or eliminated.

The city ""isn't sleeping anymore,"" said a headline in the Washington Post.

Elana Woolf, a mental health therapist, says she has seen the impact on patients.

""A lot of people are having increased levels of anxiety, depression,"" she said. ""You can really feel the change in mood and the change in the environment.""

In solidarity, some businesses are making small gestures for former civil servants and contract workers.

Veterinarian services offer discounted prices, bars have special ""happy hours,"" and career workshops offer to help revamp CVs.

""The job market is already kind of a mess, with a lot of high skilled workers flooding the market,"" said Seth Commichaux, who worked at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for nine years before being terminated.

""When I'm applying to jobs, it's not unusual for there to be 1,000 applications on something within a couple of days,"" he told AFP at a small protest gathering of fired employees.

The local real estate market is not yet showing an exodus of residents. 

But ""there is a lot of uncertainty, and so many people are just shell-shocked by the news right now,"" said Sarah Brown, a real estate agent who organized the free yoga session, adding that many people have frozen their plans.

The city government anticipates a drop in revenue of around one billion dollars ""over the next four to five years due to these layoffs,"" Brianne Nadeau, a local Democratic representative, told AFP.

In a physical sign of change, a celebrated ""Black Lives Matter"" street mural just outside the White House has been dug up and removed.  

The capital's Democratic mayor Muriel Bowser agreed to remove the anti-racist statement after Republican lawmakers threatened to cut funding to the city, which is under congressional control.

Back at the yoga studio, owner Kristine Erickson says ""there is a feeling of helplessness among us. It feels like we are being punished.""

 March 21 - The first three months of 2025 promised to be bumpy, but few expected the world to be on the verge of a full-on trade war and for investors to be fleeing Wall Street quite so fast after U.S. President Donald Trump's return to the White House. 

 Investors in emerging markets have been rattled by a spate of domestic crises and UK markets are facing a reckoning of their own as the impact of Trump's tariffs becomes apparent in global economic data. 

 Here's a look at what's coming for markets from Rae Wee in Singapore; Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Naomi Rovnick, Karin Strohecker and Amanda Cooper in London. 

 1/TIARA TIME? 

 U.S. equities are bleeding money at one of the fastest weekly rates on record, and the cash is finding a home in previously neglected markets. Europe's STOXX 600 is set for a gain of 9.3% in the first quarter, against the S&P's 4.5% loss, its strongest performance against the U.S. benchmark in the first 12 weeks of the year since 2015. 

 Defence stocks have led the charge higher as European leaders have sought ways to fund spending on security, with U.S. support no longer seeming to be a given. Chinese tech stocks have shot up, with a regional index over 30% higher, while a basket of Wall Street's Big Tech stocks is down 15%. 

 World stocks minus the United States are heading for their best first-quarter performance since 2019. 

 Move over, TINA - There Is No Alternative -. Investors are considering TIARA - There Is A Real Alternative - to U.S. stocks. 

 2/ROUGH RIDE 

 Selloffs in Turkey, Indonesia and Colombia in recent days have focused investors' minds on slow-burning issues plaguing some developing economies. 

 A return to orthodox monetary policy over the past two years had seen investors warm to Turkey again. But authorities detaining Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, President Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, caused a lira rout and sent stocks and bonds sharply lower, prompting the central bank to raise overnight lending rates. 

 Worries over Indonesia's fiscal strategy and growth outlook roiled the rupiah and stocks, prompting central bank intervention. Also, Colombia's finance minister resigned amid clashes over budget cuts, hours after lawmakers rejected a labour reform by leftist President Gustavo Petro, who has already replaced 12 of his 19 ministers. 

 3/DATA DIVE 

 Investors wary of signs of slowing growth and tariff uncertainty get a raft of fresh U.S. data in the coming week, including a key inflation gauge. 

 February's personal consumption expenditures price index, a closely watched measure of inflation, is due on March 28. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lifted its expectation for PCE, projecting it would end the year at 2.7%, up from a previous forecast of 2.5% - above its 2% target for annual inflation. 

 Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled the U.S. central bank will wait for more clarity on Trump administration policies as it assesses when to resume rate cuts. 

 Measures of consumer confidence and consumer sentiment will also be in the spotlight after U.S. retail sales rebounded marginally in February. 

 4/BLEAK BRITAIN 

 UK investors are about to discover whether weak growth and unexpectedly high borrowing have blown the Labour government's budget goals far enough off course for markets to call for a return to austerity measures. Alongside finance minister Rachel Reeves' March 26 Spring Statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to reduce forecasts that, back in October, assumed the government would just meet its self-imposed spending rules. 

 The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that even a minor OBR downgrade would force Reeves to choose between tax increases, spending cuts or months of ""damaging speculation"" about what she will do in the Autumn budget. 

 Long-term UK debt costs set by the gilt markets are about 15 basis points below January's multi-decade highs after Labour's welfare cut pledges, but bond investors are on high alert for a rule breach the government cannot fix. 

 5/PULSE CHECK 

 Australia and Tokyo will get their inflation report cards in the week ahead, as central bankers around the world try to assess the impact of Trump's tariff policies on global price pressures. 

 Australian consumer prices on Wednesday are expected to have held steady in February. This could support the still-cautious Reserve Bank of Australia's patient approach to future rate cuts. 

 Tokyo inflation is due on Friday, as the Bank of Japan continues to monitor mounting domestic price pressures that could warrant further monetary tightening. 

 The BOJ kept rates unchanged at its March meeting and offered few hints on the timing of its next rate hike. But Governor Kazuo Ueda suggested the central bank could deliver one even before the dust settles on the impact of U.S. tariffs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news","'Are You With Humanity?' Freed Israeli Hostage's Plea To UN Over Hostages","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/are-you-with-humanity-freed-israeli-hostage-eli-sharabis-plea-to-un-over-hostages-7975903","Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:06:52 GMT","

Freed Israeli hostage Eli Sharabi, who was beaten, chained and starved while held for 491 days by Hamas, expressed his anger during an appearance at the UN Security Council on Thursday for having to suffer for so long and worry every day about being killed.

""Where was the United Nations? Where was the Red Cross? Where was the world?"" Sharabi asked.

He challenged the UN's most powerful body: ""If you stand for humanity prove it"" by bringing home the 59 hostages still in Gaza, many of whom are believed to be dead.

The fate of the remaining hostages became more uncertain after Israel on Tuesday ended a six-week break in the fighting that had allowed for the return of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.

Sharabi said the council talked about the need to get humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, but he saw Hamas militants eating stolen food from dozens of boxes marked with U.N. emblems while the hostages starved. They were given maybe a piece of pita and a sip of tea a day, and an occasional dry date, he said.

When he was released on Feb. 8, Sharabi said he weighed 44 kilos (about 97 pounds) - less than the weight of his youngest daughter, who was killed along with his wife and older daughter in Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, along with about 1,200 others. He was among 251 people taken hostage.

The United States in November vetoed a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza because it was not linked to an immediate release of the hostages.

The Palestinians and their supporters then went to the 193-member General Assembly, which adopted a resolution in December demanding a ceasefire and reiterating its demand for the release of the hostages. Unlike Security Council resolutions, though, those passed by the General Assembly are nonbinding.

The ceasefire that went into effect in January was shattered on Tuesday with surprise airstrikes on Gaza that killed more than 400 Palestinians, one of the highest death tolls in the nearly 18-month war. Gaza's Health Ministry said most victims were women and children.

Sharabi's appearance before the council, the second by a freed hostage, followed an Israeli request last week for a meeting on the plight of the hostages.

Britain's deputy ambassador James Kariuki called Sharabi's suffering ""beyond the imagination"" and said ""Hamas must be held accountable for their despicable actions.""

But Kariuki also said the UK condemns Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz's ""warning of the total destruction of Gaza."" Britain calls for the rapid resurgence of aid to Gaza, an investigation into allegations of sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinian detainees by Israeli forces, and an urgent return to the ceasefire deal, he said.

France's new UN ambassador, Jerome Bonnafont, expressed his country's deepest condolences to Sharabi but also condemned the resumption of Israel's bombing, saying it will not ensure the release of hostages, and demanded an end to Israel's humanitarian blockade of Gaza.

Russia's deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky told the council, ""Our hearts were filled with sorrow as we listened to the tragic story of Mr. Eli Sharabi,"" adding ""such brutality can have no justification.""

Polyansky criticized Israel's leaders for not moving to phase 2 of the ceasefire deal, which calls for the release of all hostages and a permanent end to the fighting. He said it's difficult to discuss the future when Israel's military and political leaders appear to have made the choice in favor of war.

Algeria's UN Ambassador Amar Bendjama, representing the Arab world on the council, called Sharabi a ""representative of civil society,"" and said ""no civilian, irrespective of their background, should endure suffering.""

He then accused Israel of ""cherry-picking"" international law. He pointed to Israel's ban on humanitarian aid, fuel and electricity entering Gaza since March 2, its killing of civilians, and the cutoff of the International Committee of the Red Cross' access to over 9,500 Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons since Oct. 7.

After all council members spoke, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, sent ""our condolences"" to Sharabi over the killing of his loved ones and his prolonged captivity. He said Palestinians ""understand this pain because we live it.""

Sharabi made no mention of Israeli actions, except to say that on the morning of Oct. 7, when he heard that militants were inside Kibbutz Be'eri where he lived, he reassured his wife not to worry: ""The army will come, they always come."" That morning, they never came.

He told the council he came to speak for 24-year-old Alon Ohel, a fellow hostage whom he left behind in the tunnel, and all others, including his older brother, Yossi, who was killed but whose body remains in Gaza.

""Bring them all home. Now!"" Sharabi said.

Members of Tren de Aragua are, to use one of the president's old phrases, bad hombres. The gang, which originated in Venezuela's prisons just over a decade ago, has industrialised people-smuggling. It has sidelines in forced prostitution and drug-dealing and uses extreme violence to get its way. Who, then, could object to the deportation of gang members to El Salvador, where they are now in prison? To quibble about the legal power and processes under which they were removed from America seems beside the point. The gang's victims did not enjoy due process.

Such is the emotional and political power of the Trump administration's highest-profile immigration enforcement yet. Mass deportation has proved harder and slower than expected, so the White House needed a quick win to signal toughness. As a legal question, though, it is more complicated. This newspaper has argued that, although Donald Trump may be pursuing policies we disagree with, so far he has acted within the bounds of the president's constitutional powers. We have also said that the time to be really alarmed is when he ignores a court order. Did it just happen?

On March 15th the president publicly invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a law dating from the age of the Founding Fathers, which was last invoked during the second world war. That same day two flights left Texas, deporting passengers under this authority. A federal judge gave an order to halt the flights. But the Department of Justice said the order was moot because the planes were already in international airspace, among other tendentious excuses.

The Alien Enemies Act is drafted broadly and is deferential to the president, as is true of most emergency powers. In case of an “invasion or predatory incursion...by any foreign nation or government”, the president can have the invaders detained and removed. Crucially, the president gets to decide when such an invasion has occurred. Tren de Aragua is obviously not a foreign nation, but the White House claims it is “closely aligned” with Venezuela's corrupt and hostile government. On the surface, this sounds like an administration testing the bounds of presidential authority in the courts, which all administrations do from time to time.

However, both the known details of the case and the context are alarming. The courts have a role because the powers Mr Trump is claiming are unusual and their justification is flimsy. America is not at war with Venezuela, to the dismay of many Trump-supporting Venezuelan émigrés. It is a huge stretch to argue that a gang is akin to an arm of the state, even if it bribes a lot of officials. This was not a national-security emergency: the deportees were already in custody. The government has broad powers to deport foreigners convicted of crimes. What Mr Trump appears to be claiming is the right to designate people as gang members—on what evidence is unclear—and send them to be locked up in a country where torture is common and gang suspects can be held indefinitely without trial. You don't have to be a tattooed Venezuelan to be worried by the suspension of habeas corpus.

The context is the blizzard of challenges to the common understanding of the law, on topics such as birthright citizenship, the limits to free speech and whether a president can shut an agency created by Congress. Other presidents have clashed with the courts, but their arguments have been more modest, their tactics less bare-knuckle.

Faced with an adverse ruling, the lawful response is to appeal. This administration does that. It also fires up its supporters with talk of judges thwarting the people's will. And it issues threats. Mr Trump attacked the judge as a “Radical Left Lunatic”, implied he was crooked and called for his impeachment. Given the fury of MAGA diehards and the pardoning of the January 6th rioters, judges who cross the president may reasonably fear for their physical safety. Small wonder the chief justice issued a rare rebuke.

More details about the Tren de Aragua case may emerge, and the administration will no doubt adjust its tactics in response. Perhaps, if some of the deportees prove innocent, they may be released. However, when a president says things like “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law” and his minions declare they “don't care what judges think”, the threat to America—a place where the law has long tempered executive impulses—is clear. Courts can seem maddeningly slow to a government in a hurry. But that is how checks and balances work. Judges should resist Mr Trump's power grabs. Public servants, including Mr Trump, should obey the courts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news","Italy's Il Foglio Prints AI Edition Of Newspaper To ""Revitalise Journalism""","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/italys-il-foglio-prints-ai-edition-of-newspaper-to-revitalise-journalism-7975312","Fri, 21 Mar 2025 08:55:20 GMT","

In a world first, an Italian newspaper is printing a fully AI-generated edition for a month in what its director said Thursday was an experiment to ""revitalise journalism, not to kill it"".

Il Foglio, a daily broadsheet with an irreverent touch and a circulation of about 29,000, says it is the first newspaper in the world to print entire editions created through artificial intelligence, a nascent technology that is rapidly changing how newsrooms operate.

It began on Tuesday producing a four-page daily AI edition in print and online, alongside its normal edition, featuring about 22 articles and three editorials.

Put simply, the newspaper's 20-odd journalists ask a version of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot to write a story on a specific subject in a specific tone, and it produces a text using information scraped off the internet.

Examples this week included an analysis of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's speeches, an editorial on the recent phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -- and a fashion story.

Il Foglio's director, Claudio Cerasa, explained to AFP the idea behind the project and how it is going.

What do you want to accomplish with this?

""The purpose is twofold. On the one hand, to move theory into practice. On the other hand, it's to test ourselves and thus understand what the limits of AI are, but also the opportunities, the boundaries that must be overcome and those that cannot be.

""All this can spring from a special newspaper like ours, because ours is a newspaper that has irreverent, ironic, creative writing. We do things that are not easily reproducible with a machine.

""It was a desire to flaunt our being special and experiment with something that no one in the world has experimented with, in a disruptive way, creating debate, but above all, first attempting ourselves to understand how AI can be integrated with natural intelligence.""

How does the process work in practice?

""In the editorial meeting, many topics come up. Some of these topics are then covered not only by the normal newspaper, but also by the artificial newspaper.

""Every question asked to AI contains a request for a theme... a request for a tone: respectful, irreverent, scandalous, provocative. In the end we ask it to have the style of the paper.

""If there are too many mistakes, we change articles (start a new one). If there are just few errors, though, we leave them, because we also want to understand what the limits are.""

What lessons have you learned from the first few days?

""Artificial intelligence exceeds all expectations. We have learned it can do things that can compete with what a human does, but we have learned that in the long run competition must create greater efficiency.

""Innovation must be accepted, because you can't stop it, it must be understood, governed, and turned into an opportunity for growth.

""If one day there's a demand for articles made only with AI, it must be accepted. But that demand must increase journalists' creativity, because journalists will have to start getting used to not doing things that a machine could.

""So it's a way to revitalise journalism, not to kill it.""

Are journalists in the newsroom worried?

""No, everyone is entertained, everyone is curious and among other things, it's interesting that with this experiment we're reaching a much larger audience. There are many people who, thanks to AI, are discovering the traditional paper. The first day we had a 60 percent rise in sales.

""It's no coincidence that no major newspaper has thought of (doing) it, because it is obviously scary. Only a newspaper like ours, which is somewhat unique, can afford to do an experiment like this.""

He added: ""The articles written by human beings are better, because they always have something more, they always have an element of creativity, of connection, of making unpredictable links that AI does not have.""

What are readers saying?

""The readers are 90 percent entertained, 10 percent worried because they say 'Make sure you never leave your natural intelligence because you are better.' But there's no one who says the operation is stupid and senseless.

""Everyone has understood the spirit.""

 Coalition aims to speed up Chips Act 2.0 planning 

 * 

 Plans due before the summer 

 * 

 Focus on targeted funding for chip sector 

 By Toby Sterling 

 THE HAGUE, - Nine European Union countries are working to speed up plans to boost the bloc's computer chip industry and aim to present their proposals by the summer, one of the coalition's leaders said on Friday. 

 The coalition, which includes Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, is doing ""homework for the new Chips Act"", Dutch Economy Minister Dirk Beljaarts said in an interview, referring to a possible second EU funding programme for the semiconductor industry following the 2023 Chips Act. 

 That act, currently under review, failed to meet key goals but is regarded as having prevented a deterioration of Europe's industry in the face of larger state support programmes in the United States and China. 

 A frequent criticism is that the process, which featured states providing funding and the European Commission approving projects, was too slow. 

 Beljaarts said the point was to become more targeted the second time around. 

 ""We need to allocate funds,"" Beljaarts said. ""Both private and public funds to push the sector, also to make sure that the trickle-down effect takes place and that companies also benefit."" 

 He said that while Europe had top R&D and equipment players, including powerhouse ASML, gaps included chip packaging and advanced production, following Intel's shelving of plans to build a cutting-edge factory in Germany. 

 The coalition is examining ""what the internal demand would be from European countries ... so that companies know it's worth it to start investing"" he said. 

 Beljaarts said the new group, formally established on March 12, was aimed at helping rather than undermining the Commission. 

 The Commission said it ""strongly supported"" the initiative.

Heathrow airport was completely shut down on Friday after a power outage due to a fire at a London electricity substation, causing travel chaos for passengers around the world and the cancellation or diversion of hundreds of flights from Europe's busiest air hub.

Heathrow plies routes to around 80 countries and some 1,350 flights had been due to land or take off from the airport's five terminals on Friday, according to the online flight tracking website Flightradar24.

Some 230,000 passengers a day and 83 million a year use Heathrow, making it one of the world's busiest airports.

Firefighters were called to a ""highly visible"" blaze at the substation shortly after 2320 GMT on Thursday and around 70 were sent to battle the fire, which was brought under control by around 0800 GMT.

UK energy secretary Ed Miliband promised that the government would do all it could to restore power to Heathrow quickly, as questions were raised about the airport's ""resilience"".

Videos on social media, apparently shot inside Heathrow's terminals, showed shuttered shops and deserted corridors, lit only by emergency lighting.

The shut-down left many passengers struggling to make alternative arrangements.

""I had planned this journey three months ago... I've spent so much money on tickets and everything,"" said Muhammad Khalil, 28, who was booked on a flight to Pakistan to be reunited with his wife after five months.

""You can't imagine how stressful it is for me,"" he told AFP at London's Paddington train station from where he had been due to travel to Heathrow.

British Airways said the closure of its main hub would have a ""significant impact"" on its operations and customers.

""We're working as quickly as possible to update them on their travel options for the next 24 hours and beyond,"" it said.

Talia Fokaides, 42, was supposed to leave London on Friday morning for Athens, but rushed to Gatwick to get a new ticket when she heard the news.

Her mother was having open heart surgery later in the day.

""I just need to be there,"" she told AFP, her voice shaking with emotion.

Flights diverted

Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced, according to Flightradar24.

Airport authorities said they ""expect significant disruption"" over the coming days.

The UK's second busiest airport, Gatwick, said it would accept some flights from Heathrow. Others were diverted to European airports including Shannon in southwestern Ireland, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle.

One resident near the substation said she heard a ""massive explosion"" as the power cut out just before midnight while a night shift worker reported seeing a ""bright flash of white"".

Around 150 people were evacuated from nearby properties because of the fire.

London Fire Brigade deputy commissioner Jonathan Smith told reporters firefighters worked ""tirelessly in challenging and very hazardous conditions"" to bring the flames under control.

He said the fire had involved a ""transformer comprising of 25,000 litres of cooling oil fully alight"" posing a hazard due to the substation's ""still live high voltage equipment"".

The outage left 100,000 homes without power overnight, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said. By morning, power had been restored to all but around 4,000.

As the scale of the disruption began to emerge, the minister faced questions about how one fire could shut down an entire airport.

He said electricity distribution network National Grid had told him they had not seen ""anything like the scale"" of what happened.

""But it makes Heathrow look quite vulnerable and therefore we've got to learn lessons, as I say, about not just Heathrow but how we protect our major infrastructure,"" he told ITV news.

The chair of the parliamentary transport committee, Ruth Cadbury, said it was ""speculative"" to suggest at the moment that arson might have caused the fire.

But she told Times Radio: ""There are obviously questions about it.""

Disruption

Flights from all over the world were affected by the closure and aviation consultant Philip Butterworth-Hayes told AFP it would cost ""certainly more than &#163;50 million ($64.7 million)"" to the airport and airlines.

In January, the UK government gave permission for Heathrow to build a third runway -- which could be ready by 2035 -- after years of legal disputes due to opposition from local residents.

Five major airports serve the British capital and towns nearby, but capacity is stretched, especially at Heathrow, whose two runways each measure almost four kilometres (2.5 miles) in length.

The airport covers a total area of 12.3 square kilometres (4.8 square miles).

Situated 25 kilometres west of central London, Heathrow's main flight destinations last year were Dublin, Los Angeles, Madrid and New York.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has given another ultimatum to Ukrainians living in the country by ordering them to legalise their immigration status or leave by September 10, Moscow Times reported quoting a presidential decree published on Thursday.

The decree stated that Ukrainians without ""legal grounds to stay or reside in Russia"" must leave Russia or obtain citizenship within the next six months and 10 days.

As reported by The Moscow Times, the orders apply to Ukrainian passport holders from four partially occupied regions -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia claims to have annexed these regions in 2022.

The order also applies to the residents of Crimea which Russia claimed to have seized in 2014.

Russian authorities have pressurised the Ukrainians of these occupied authorities to take citizenships in recent years. Putin has claimed that the government had ""virtually completed"" the mass issuance of Russian passports in those regions last year, The Moscow Times reported.

Meanwhile, Ukraine have condemned Russia's ""passportisation"" deeming it to be ""illegal and a ""gross violation of Ukraine's sovereignty."" Western governments have also criticised this move while EU has decided to not recognize the passports as valid travel documents, The Moscow Times reported.

Meanwhile, the efforts to reach an agreement on the ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine continue with US President Donald Trump announcing on Wednesday that he had a ""very good"" one-hour phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump also held talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.

Moreover, The ceasefire talks are set to begin in Jeddah on Sunday with US expecting Ukraine to support agreements reached during a recent phone conversation between Putin and Trump, according to Trump's Special Envoy Steven Witkoff, TASS Russian News Agency reported.

In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff described his discussions with Putin, saying, ""I had two meetings with President Putin. The first one was for somewhere close to three and a half hours, and the second one was close to four hours.""

He continued, ""They were both compelling. I thought we accomplished quite a bit, and in the second meeting, we actually really narrowed the issues, certainly from the Russian standpoint, we were immediately in discussions on tangible, granular ways to move forward towards a ceasefire that included what you've heard about today, which is the ceasefire with regard to energy infrastructure from both sides, something they've been trying to put together for quite some time.""

 President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States will sign a minerals and natural resources deal with Ukraine shortly and that his efforts to achieve a peace deal for the country were going ""pretty well"" after his talks this week with the Russian and Ukrainian leaders.

Trump made the comments at a White House event after signing an order to increase U.S. production of critical minerals.

""We're also signing agreements in various locations to unlock rare earths and minerals and lots of other things all over the world,"" he said.

""But in particular Ukraine, we're doing very well with regard to Ukraine and Russia. And one of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly with respect to rare earths with Ukraine.""

Trump referred to his discussions this week with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2022.

""We would love to see that come to an end, and I think we're doing pretty well in that regard,"" Trump said.

""So hopefully we'd save thousands of people a week from dying. That's what it's all about. They're dying so unnecessarily, and I believe we'll get it done. We'll see what happens, but I believe we'll get it done.""

Ukraine and the U.S. said this month they had agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources, which Trump sees as a means to pay back the United States for its assistance to Kyiv.

Efforts to seal the deal stumbled after a disastrous White House meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy at the end of last month.

Bishops in Philippines welcome Duterte's arrest

ROMAN CATHOLIC bishops in the Philippines have welcomed the arrest this week of the former President (2016-22), Rodrigo Duterte, on charges of crimes against humanity, Vatican News reports. He was taken into custody by the Philippine authorities at Manila airport on 11 March, after an ICC warrant was issued. His arrest followed a year-long investigation into his “war on drugs”, through which he is alleged to have ordered more than 6200 extrajudicial killings. The president of Caritas Philippines, the Rt Revd Jose Colin Bagaforo, said: “True justice . . . is about accountability, transparency, and the protection of human dignity. For years, Duterte has claimed that he is ready to face the consequences of his actions. Now is the time for him to prove it.” The Vicar Apostolic of Taytay in Palawan, the Rt Revd Broderick Pabillo, said that, regardless of his guilt, the crimes had happened under his watch and must be investigated. “That is what democracy should be: no one is above the law.”

 

Study records priests' abductions in Nigeria

ELEVEN of the 145 Roman Catholic priests in Nigeria reported as having been abducted between 2015 and 2025 have been killed, and four are still missing, the Vatican news agency Fides reports. Its study, published last week, says that, between July 2022 and June 2023, 3620 people were abducted in 582 kidnapping cases, and about five billion naira (about $3.88 million) was paid in ransoms. Church personnel have been increasingly targeted. Abductions of priests were more numerous in particular states, such as Onitsha, Kaduna, and Owerri, which recorded 47 cases. Most abducted priests were released, either through police operations or ransom payments. Kaduna emerged as the most dangerous state, where 24 priests were abducted and seven were killed. The latest incident was on 5 March, when Fr Sylvester Okechukwu, a priest in Kafanchan diocese, in Kaduna State, was murdered the day after his kidnapping.

 

Australian church marks 70 years since arson attack

THE 70th anniversary of a fire that destroyed St John's, Camberwell, in Melbourne, was commemorated on Sunday, and the offerings were given to the Adas Israel Congregation, whose synagogue in Ripponlea was fire-bombed in December. In a statement to the congregation, the Vicar and churchwardens said that the donation resonated with the church's own experience of an arson attack in 1955. While governments had a responsibility to protect all citizens, faith communities could work to build solidarity.

 

Cubans freed in Vatican-mediated deal

THE Cuban government has granted the early release of 553 prisoners, this week, completing the deal mediated by the Holy See in the final days of the Biden presidency, Vatican News reports. On 14 January, President Biden removed Cuba from a US terrorism blacklist in exchange for an agreement to free 553 prisoners held after anti-government protests in July 2021 — the largest since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. In a statement after the deal, the Cuban President, Miguel Díaz-Canel, said: “As part of the close and fluid relations with the Vatican State, I informed Pope Francis of [the decision to free the prisoners] in the spirit of the 2025 Jubilee.” The deal was overturned six days after President Trump was sworn in, but prisoners have continued to be sporadically released. In February, the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, called the gradual release of the Cuban prisoners “a sign of great hope”. On Monday, the vice-president of Cuba's High Court said that the process had successfully been completed.

Children encouraged to bring their ‘big dreams' to God

THE Scripture Union International (SUI) is hosting the first Global Children's Day of Prayer, on 29 March, for children aged between eight and 14. The 90-minute online event will involve children, connected to the SUI through a camp, school, or community group, leading others in prayer for local and global needs. Before the day, children have been invited to think of their “Big Dream” for the world and to pray for that. The International Director, Monika Kushmierz, said: “We hope it will be the start of an annual event that will encourage children to talk to God about their concerns, hopes, and dreams for the world.” scriptureunion.global/what-we-do/pray

 

Act on climate finance, United Nations urged

THE World Council of Churches (WCC) has co-signed a statement calling on the UN Human Rights Council to address the “climate-debt-tax-human rights nexus as a moral imperative”. The statement, delivered by the Revd Peter Adenekan during the 58th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, said: “Many of these countries are spending more on servicing debt than on lifesaving public services and responding to the climate emergency. In other words, obligations to repay debt are preventing governments from meeting people's rights to health, education, and a clean environment.” Mr Adenekan, a student at the Ecumenical Institute in Bossey, is researching, with the WCC's Living Planet Programme, the intersection of climate and debt in Nigeria.

The US Department of Defense has removed or plans to purge thousands of articles about the Holocaust, 9/11 terrorist attacks, cancer awareness and sexual assault among others from Pentagon websites as the department adhered to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's order to scrub ""diversity"" content from all its platforms.

According to a report by CNN, over 24,000 articles could be deleted with several taken down already. The purge comes a month after the Pentagon in a memo said it would be removing news and feature articles promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) content.

Pages taken down include an article about the experience of Holocaust survivor Kitty Saks, who later immigrated to the US, an article about Holocaust Remembrance week and an Air Force Academy cadet majoring in history describing his experience taking scholarly visits to concentration camps in Europe.

""Honouring the memory of the Holocaust and those who survived is not a matter of political ideology - it is a moral imperative and a vital component of education, remembrance, and the fight against anti-Semitism,"" he said.

Several articles containing 'sexual asault' themes have also been chalked off the websites and now have ""DEI' in their URL. ""April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month"" and ""A call to action - Three ways to combat sexual assault"" are some of the pages that have faced the axe.

Notably, many of the up to 24,000 pages that might be purged were not submitted by individual units but rather identified using automated scripts.

“In the rare cases that content is removed – either deliberately or by mistake – that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content so it recognizes our heroes for their dedicated service alongside their fellow Americans, period,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot said in a statement.

Ever since it became evident that Donald Trump was returning to the White House, several US companies have rolled back their DEI policies amid criticism from conservatives. The likes of Google, Meta, Amazon and McDonalds have either entirely scrapped or dramatically scaled back their DEI programmes.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The palace appeared to be partly in ruins, with soldiers' steps crunching broken tiles underneath their boots.

Sudan's military has said it has retaken the Republican Palace in the country's capital Khartoum after nearly two years of fighting.

The current conflict in Sudan erupted in April 2023 when a power struggle between the leaders of the military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) boiled over into open fighting in Khartoum and other cities.

Social media videos showed the military's soldiers inside on the 21st day of Ramadan, the holy Muslim fasting month.

A Sudanese military officer wearing a captain's epaulettes made the announcement in a video and confirmed the troops were inside the compound.

Soldiers carrying assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers chanted: ""God is the greatest!""

Sudan's information minister said the military had retaken the palace in a post on X.

""Today the flag is raised, the palace is back and the journey continues until victory is complete,"" he wrote.

Its recapture by the military marks another gain for Sudan's military which has made steady advances in recent months.

The rival RSF has been mostly expelled from the capital of Khartoum after Sudan's war began in April 2023.

Africa correspondent

Sudan's military operations have pointed towards a specific target for several weeks: reclaim the Republican Palace from their entrenched enemy the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after close to two years of war.

After two days of intense battles in and around the palace complex, victory over the symbolic site has been declared by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) with soldiers sharing videos and photos from inside the palace.

""People will say it is photoshop but this is the Republican Palace. Inside the palace! Inside the palace!"" yells an SAF Captain in a video filmed inside the building.

The Republican Palace is the country's seat of power and the official residence of its president.


Though the iconic building on the bank of the Blue Nile River decorates banknotes, it is rarely home to the military rulers who prefer to live in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) headquarters to the southeast of the palace complex.

The palace was unveiled in 2015 as a gift to former military dictator Omar Al-Bashir by China.

It stands behind the colonial governor-general's residence where decorated British General Charles Gordon was killed by Sudanese fighters 140 years ago.

The symbolism of the old palace and the political significance of the Chinese rebuild often draws history to its steps.

Gunfire was heard in the capital overnight on Friday, although whether this was from fighting or celebrations is unclear.

The RSF hasn't acknowledged the loss of the presidential palace but the group still holds territory elsewhere in Sudan so fighting is likely to continue.

The war has killed more than 28,000 people, according to UN figures, and forced millions to flee their homes.

Lando Norris continues strong start to season by topping sole practice session at Chinese GP; Lewis Hamilton fourth as Ferrari produce improved display; watch Sprint Qualifying later on Friday at 7.30am, with the Sprint itself on Saturday at 3am live on Sky Sports F1

Lando Norris set a searing pace to top practice for McLaren at the Chinese Grand Prix ahead of Sprint Qualifying, which begins at 7.30am on Friday.

The Brit, who leads the Drivers' Championship after winning the season-opener in Australia last weekend, delivered a 1:31.504 to finish almost half a second clear of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the sole practice session at the first Sprint event of the season.

Oscar Piastri was on course to set a similar time to his McLaren team-mate before running wide in the final corner, which left the Australian third.

Lewis Hamilton completed a more positive showing from Ferrari - following their surprise Melbourne struggles - to take fourth.

Hamilton was almost 0.7s back from Norris, but unlike the three drivers ahead of him, did not go for a second qualifying simulation in a slightly rushed climax to the session following a red flag caused by a technical failure on Jack Doohan's Alpine.

George Russell had topped the timesheet after medium-tyre running but ended up fifth after failing to improve with his soft-tyre effort.

Reigning world champion Max Verstappen was only 16th for Red Bull after aborting his only attempt at a flying lap.

Norris' time was more than two seconds quicker than Verstappen's pole last year in China, which is partly a result of a fully re-laid surface at the Shanghai International Circuit.

While that has provided improved grip for the entire field, it's McLaren who appear to be in a league of their own.

Russell sparked a debate in the paddock on Thursday by saying that McLaren have a bigger advantage over the field than Red Bull ever did during their historically dominant 2023 campaign, and that the reigning constructors' champions could win every race this season.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player



While that seems unlikely in a 24-race calendar, this session provided further evidence that McLaren appear to currently hold a huge advantage over the teams - Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes - that they ended last year so closely matched with.

While that chasing trio are all likely to be disappointed by the margin by which they appear to trail McLaren, there was at least some consolation for Ferrari in that they looked to have overcome the struggles they had in Australia.

Most had expected the Italian team to be McLaren's closest challengers in Melbourne, but a lack of pace and a poor strategy call saw Leclerc and Hamilton finish eighth and 10th, respectively, at Albert Park.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player



Being back in contention to challenge for the podium represents an improvement, while the fact Hamilton was within a tenth of Leclerc on their first quick runs could be taken as a further positive after his teething issues last weekend.

McLaren's strong showing also dispelled any notion that their performance could be impacted by a tightening of rules on the degree to which cars' rear wings are allowed to flex on track.

Norris said on Thursday that McLaren didn't need to make any changes as a result of the regulation change. Alpine and Haas both confirmed on Friday that they had to alter their cars to comply with the rules.

Ed Nelson remembers the last time the Panama Panthers played a basketball game inside Visions Veterans Memorial Arena in Binghamton.

The 18-year Panama head coach wishes he didn't.

Leading Oppenheim-Ephratah/St. Johnsville by 4 in the closing seconds at then-Floyd L. Maines Veterans Memorial Arena in 2019, it looked like the Panthers were on their way to the first state title game in program history.

Then disaster struck.

Panama senior Jack Sperry fouled O-E/S.J.'s Tyler Leon on a 3-point attempt with 2 seconds remaining.

The fadeaway shot from the corner found nothing but the bottom of the net.

Leon sank the ensuing free throw and the teams went to overtime where the Wolfpack beat the Panthers 61-57.

Panama should have been playing for a state title.

“We've been on that big stage a couple of different times and found some creative ways to lose some big basketball games on that stage,” Nelson said. “Last time we were in Binghamton (we had) the infamous 4-point play.

“That's the thing with this year, we are making amends for a lot of bad memories of the past,” Nelson added. “We were seeing some ghosts at Rush-Henrietta when we were down 12-3. It's kind of a redemption year for me personally.”

After a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19, the state championships returned to Glens Falls in 2022. But the New York State Public High School Athletic Association final four is back in Binghamton this weekend for the first time since that fateful weekend six years ago.

So are the Panthers.

Some of the last names remain the same as does the goal: the school's first basketball state championship.

Nelson is in his final season as head coach, while Bryce Hinsdale and Alex Barmore — who had older brothers on the 2019 team — are seniors on this year's squad. 

“They grew up around it. Their parents send me pictures of them in Y league basketball games in third grade. This core group has been playing together for a long time,” Nelson said. “They've been playing together since they were in Pampers. These parents have put a big commitment into their kids. It's definitely shown.”

Hinsdale and Barmore are joined in the starting lineup by three other seniors, including leading-scorer Carter Brink, Tate Catanese and Jordan Mescall.

Brink is averaging 23.8 points, 4.5 assists, 3.0 rebounds and 2.4 steals per game; Hinsdale averages 12.3 points, 4.6 assists and 3.3 rebounds per game; Barmore averages 9.4 rebounds and 8.5 points per game; Mescall averages 8.1 points and 3.5 rebounds per game; and Catanese averages 8.4 rebounds and 5.7 points per game.

Panama will take on Section III's Sackets Harbor in today's 11:45 a.m. semifinal.

The Patriots beat Section IV's Morris in their regional after winning the Syracuse-area title with a 53-44 victory over Madison.

“It was a little bit easier to find out about Sackets Harbor than Fillmore. I went to Binghamton Sunday and watched them play Morris. I watched Class D last year when they were in it and had my eyes on some guys,” Nelson said. “I've had my eye on them the whole time. Marcus Castine is a solid ballplayer and likes to get to the paint.

“We'll lay the cards on the table and see what happens,” Nelson added.

Today's 10 a.m. semifinal will feature Section XI's Bridgehampton and Section II's Loudonville Christian.

“That's the thing about being a coach. Your mantra is to go 1-0 every single day. With playoffs you play one game and wait a week. You make it this far and you are back to back. We are definitely not looking past Sackets Harbor.”

Bridgehampton topped Section IX's Eldred 71-41 in their regional championship game after a win over St. Pius in their sectional final.

Loudonville Christian beat Section X's Harrisville 38-36 in their regional final after a 54-36 win over Germantown in their sectional final.

“You have to get a little bit of intel on the other two teams so you aren't sitting blind if you do happen to be successful on Friday,” Nelson said. “We've done our homework and we're still doing homework as we speak.”

The Class D final is set for 6 p.m. Saturday.

“It's kind of bittersweet. We talked about it (Wednesday), (Thursday) will be our last basketball practice in the Panama gym. These guys have been in there since eighth grade. They've put in a lot of blood sweat and tears,” Nelson said. “You can't guarantee you'll be successful, but you can deserve it. Hopefully we've done our part to come out and be successful this weekend.”

CHARLESTON – The opportunity is here.

After coming up short in their previous two trips, the Williamstown boys basketball team plays for the Class AA state championship on Saturday morning. Tip-off is set for 10 a.m. at the Charleston Coliseum and Convention Center – the same venue where the top-ranked Yellowjackets defeated No. 4 Wyoming East 61-51 during Thursday's semifinal game.

Winners of 17 in a row, Williamstown brings a 21-3 record into its second meeting of the season against Wheeling Central. The two teams met at Williamstown High School on Feb. 1 with the Yellowjackets pulling out a 56-55 victory.

“That matchup, we will be going up against an amazing player in (Eli Sancomb), who clinched player of the year earlier today,” said Williamstown's Parker Schramm, who scored 17 of his game-high 20 points the second half as his team left Wyoming East in its rear-view mirror after erasing a 26-24 halftime deficit. “Wheeling Central has a lot of good players. We just have to stay locked in and be ready to play on Saturday.”

Teammate Jayden Bryant finished with 18 points and a team-high five rebounds. The other piece of the “Big Three' – Cruz Isaly – picked up two quick personal fouls in the opening period but played all but 10 minutes of the game — picking up only one more the rest of the way.

This senior class, winners of 85 games in their high school career, was knocked out of the state tournament in the semifinal round as sophomores and defeated by Wheeling Central in the quarterfinals a year ago.

“This is what these guys wanted – and that was an opportunity,” Williamstown coach Scott Sauro said. “It is here. We have a couple of days to get ready for it and we are excited for that.

“It's small school basketball. If you have shooters and a big, you can spread teams out, which makes it difficult on other coaches and other teams. And oh by the way, they have the Gatorade player of the year.

“We know what we are getting into. We are not afraid of anybody. That's not a knock on any team because we have so much respect for them. But we will not be afraid to play in the game.”

Wyoming East, which entered the semifinal game winners of 10 straight, gave Williamstown all it could handle for two-plus quarters. During the latter portion of the second half, the Yellowjackets pulled away for an 11-point lead and the Warriors were forced to foul for basically the entire fourth quarter.

“We ran into a really good basketball team today,” Wyoming East head coach Kent McBride said after his club ended the season at 19-4. “When you get down to this point of the season, you are not going to get a bad team. And we ran into a good one.”

Freshman point guard Talan Muscari led the Warriors with 15 points, while classmate Broc Johnson finished with 11 points and six rebounds. Konnor Fox, a 6-foot-9 sophomore, contributed 12 points and six boards. 

“We gave it a heck of an effort and I thought there were points in the game where our youth really showed,” McBride said. “You had 18-year-olds from Williamstown who have been down here a long, long time versus guys who have just stepped on this floor.

“We battled like crazy to overcome it, but we just couldn't. And it wasn't due to lack of effort, it wasn't due to lack of execution and it wasn't due to lack of preparation. I have immense pride with not only these three players sitting with me, but for the other nine in our locker room.”

Williamstown knew it had its hands full when Fox put down a two-handed slam for the first points of the game. The first half consisted of five ties and six lead changes. The largest lead by either side before halftime was four points.

Isaly's bucket at the 5:20 mark of the second quarter put Williamstown in front 18-17. If not for the likes of Wyatt Powell, Tyler Keiser and Lynken Joy and their supporting roles, the Yellowjackets could have possibly faced a larger deficit by intermission.

Powell scored a bucket and assisted on another, while Joy sank a couple of buckets to keep the deficit at two. Off the bench, Powell finished with six points, four assists and one steal.

“In these type of games your best players have to show up, and all three did,” Sauro said. “That's a constant, but also in these games it's the other guys that win games. We don't win this game without Wyatt. The effort he gave defensively was tremendous. He's just so steady on the ball – he doesn't get beat very often.”

When Isaly was on the bench nursing two early fouls, Powell and the rest of the Yellowjacket contingent stepped up.

“With Wyatt, defensively he is on lock down,” Isaly said. 

In reality, the court is flat. But in the second half, the Yellowjackets started to get downhill with its offense. Especially Schramm, who in the final four minutes of the third quarter and opening moments of the fourth period found his shot. 

With the game tied at 30-30, Schramm accounted for 10 points and an assist during a 17-6 run which put the Yellowjackets in front to stay. Two buckets were 3-pointers, an area of the court he struggled with for a game and a half at the state tournament.

“I just started to get the feel,” Schramm said. “I know whether I'm playing good or bad, the rest of the team is going to have my back. They are going to pick me up whenever I am down, and I figure I can pick them up as well. It was just a good team win.”

Schramm helped clinch the game down the stretch by making 7-of-8 free throws as Wyoming East never got closer than six points the rest of the way.

Even though no one on the Williamstown roster were members of the program when the Yellowjackets won a Class AA state title in 2021, coach Sauro can lend his experience from having coached one.

“The job's not done,” Sauro said. “We want to give it our best shot on Saturday and see what happens. This is something we have been working for, the seniors have been working for since they were second and third graders.”

The John T. Rhodes Myrtle Beach Sports Center on Thursday, March 20, 2025, is bordered by a 21-acre, city-owned lot that could be developed into a new sports facility.

A 21-acre parcel across from Broadway at the Beach could advance Myrtle Beach's sports tourism ambitions.

After Surfworks announced it would be moving its planned facility to Broadway at the Beach, the future is in question of the 21-acre, city-owned lot where the project was initially set to be built.

At the city's annual budget retreat in Pinopolis this month, city council and staff heard sports-tourism possibilities for the property.

Sports Facilities Management, which was tasked by city leaders to determine what would be most beneficial to the city at that location, presented six top options: a tennis/pickleball facility, an ice rink, an indoor track, an indoor event facility, an aquatic center or outdoor, multipurpose fields.

Bordering the John T. Rhodes Myrtle Beach Sports Center, using the lot to expand the city's sports facilities could be a natural fit.

“We are at capacity at the current sports center, and we're also utilizing the convention center at times for things like cheer and dance, and sports tourism is big for us,” said mayor Brenda Bethune.

Sports tourism is indeed big for Myrtle Beach, which has made large investments into its sports facilities that include the Colonel Thomas “Buddy” Styers Athletic Complex in The Market Common, the John T Rhodes Sports Center, the Rivers Lynch Tennis Center and Doug Shaw Memorial Stadium.

City leaders say the investment in facilities is paying off. Myrtle Beach sports tourism resulted in $185.2 million in direct spending and $17 million in governmental tax revenues in 2024, city records show.

But there's room for more.

“Outside of the PGA events and the new things that have been brought in here, we're plateauing a bit as a community because of inventory,” said Jason Clement, CEO of Sports Facilities Management. “So that's a segue to what the team has asked us to present here, and that's the 21 acres where we have the opportunity to invest, reinvest and expand on this investment into sports tourism.”

The John T Rhodes Sports Center in Myrtle Beach is adjacent to a city-owned, 21-acre plot of land the city is considering a sports-related use for.

Clement explained to the group of city leaders the positives and negatives of each use. Some, like an aquatic center, would create new opportunities in the region but would require significant subsidies to be financially viable.

“They come at a pretty hefty price tag, just so everyone's aware. They also require a significant financial subsidy,” Clement said. “One of the things that we say is that if you're utilizing water, either moving or frozen, you're going to pay for it.”

Other uses like outdoor multi-purpose fields would be less expensive to build and maintain but wouldn't expand sports offerings in the city. Those multi-purpose fields could expand the city's ability to host more or larger baseball and softball tournaments, though. That's already the city's bread and butter. According to a budget retreat presentation, baseball brought in $51 million in direct spending in 2024.

“Myrtle Beach is a baseball, fastpitch, diamond sports mecca,” Clement said.

Clement said an indoor event facility was the top ranked possibility out of the six options. It could host sports like basketball and dance competitions, and could include meeting space.

The second ranked option was outdoor fields, then pickleball and tennis in third. Indoor aquatics, indoor ice and indoor track were the three lowest ranked uses, respectively. The estimated cost for the facilities ranged from $18-23 million for outdoor fields to $38-47 million for an indoor aquatics center.

Though a sports-related use was highly discussed for the property, Bethune said that doesn't mean the use for the property is decided.

“We're not saying anything yet,” Bethune said. “We just got the report today. This is the first time council has seen this report, so I'm sure we'll have workshops about it where we discuss this further.”

The long-discussed project is now being planned for a new location at Broadway at the Beach at the site of the old Palace Theatre.

The Trump administration halted $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania Wednesday in response to the university's transgender sports policies.

The announcement was first reported by Fox News and later reposted by Rapid Response 47 on X (formerly Twitter). Rapid Response 47 is an account created by the Trump administration to respond to news reports. However, the University of Pennsylvania said it has not received any official notification on the funding cut, in two media statements on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.

Further, the university's statements maintained that “we have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.” 

The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights investigated the university after a transgender athlete was given a spot on the women's Swim and Dive team. According to a team member Paula Scanlan, “the University of Pennsylvania offered her and her teammates psychological services to re-educate themselves to become comfortable undressing in front of a man.” 

The University of Pennsylvania is not the first university to receive federal funding revoked under the Trump administration. Columbia University has seen cuts of $400 million for official inaction by the university after continued harassment towards Jewish students on campus. The funding was “immediately canceled” on March 7 after ongoing reviews of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

On February 5, President Trump signed the “Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports” executive order. The order maintains that American laws require educational institutions to guarantee biological women “an equal opportunity to participate in sports” under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. The order tasks athletic governing bodies and state Attorneys General with promoting equal opportunities and fairness for women.

Notably, the order requires the Secretary of Education to ensure that a previous executive order is not enforced. Former president Biden sought to expand Title IX protection to LGBTQ+ students. In Tennessee v. Cardona, the US Supreme Court upheld a preliminary injunction that blocked the Title IX rule related to gender identity. At the same time, the order is facing legal challenges for violating equal protection rights.

The order was built on another executive order US President Trump signed on January 20. The order recognizes only two sexes, male and female, and defines sex as “individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female,” which, the order states, is not changeable. The order is also facing legal challenges for discriminating against transgender people.

On March 21, 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr. began his third march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to protest racial discrimination in the Jim Crow South. By March 25, over 25,000 people led by Dr. King reached Montgomery, Alabama. Specifically, the march called attention to the suppression of African-American voting rights and a police assault on a civil rights demonstration three weeks prior.

Five months later, in August 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. Read a history of the march from Selma to Montgomery.

AUSTIN, Texas — There's a new spot near the University of Texas at Austin that's celebrating women's sport in a unique way.

It's called the 1972 Women's Sports Pub, and it will dedicate its TV screens solely to women's sports.

Earlier this week, co-owners Debra Hallum and Marlene du Plessis cut the ribbon to officially welcome everyone in for business. 

""We need everyone watching women's sports,"" Hallum said. 

She said this is a chance to put a spotlight on games that are overlooked, despite growing viewership in the women's sports world.

For example, last year's women's Final Four had 4 million more viewers than the men's, in large part because of Indiana Fever player Caitlin Clark.

The inspiration for the pub came from an online article Hallum said she saw a few years back, where someone opened a women's sports bar in Portland, Oregon. Hallum and du Plessis then visited in a similar bar in Seattle.

Soon after, Hallum and du Plessis decided Austin should have one too. 

""Women's sports is now more available than it's ever been, and I think that's very important that people know it's there,"" Hallum said.

The year attached to the name also has significance: 1972 is the year Title IX was enacted by U.S. Congress, eliminating sex-based discrimination in educational programs. 

Through the name, Hallum said they wanted to spur their own change in the community. 

""We wanted to have that significant title that represented a change in girls and women's sports,"" Hallum said. 

She also stressed that all sports fans are welcome.

""If women watching women's sports could fix the gap and fix everything, it would have been fixed years ago,"" Hallum said.

The timing of the pub's opening comes just in time for March Madness, when primetime games will be highlighted on the schedule. People will be able to get an update of which games will be shown through the pub's social media pages. 

Hallum said the pub will be partnering with local teams such as Austin Rise FC, a soccer team founded and led by a group of women. The pub is also partnering with the UT women's basketball team.

And 1972 will also be giving back through donations. According to its website, 10% of profits made will be given to local nonprofit groups that provide ""athletic opportunities to girls and gender-expansive youth in Austin.""

1972 will be open Wednesdays through Fridays from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. and on weekends from 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. ","{'href': 'https://www.kvue.com', 'title': 'KVUE.com'}"

The Frewsburg girls basketball team celebrates after defeating Tuckahoe in the New York State Public High School Athletic Association Class C semifinal at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy on Thursday.

TROY — The whole goal of the Frewsburg girls basketball season has been to get back to the New York State Public High School Athletic Association Class C championships. 

The Bears accomplished that and were in a semifinal matchup against Section I's Tuckahoe on Thursday at Hudson Valley Community College. It was time to prove themselves. 

Frewsburg did exactly that, scoring the first eight points of the game, but in the state final four there is no easy matchup and Tuckahoe was going to put the Bears to the limit all game. Chipping away at the Frewsburg lead, Tuckahoe received a big triple in its final possession of the first quarter from Ava Rogliano to make it a one-score game. 

However, Frewsburg sophomore Jadyn Trocki was left with too much time as she used the final 11 seconds efficiently, running to a spot where she could hit a 3-pointer of her own at the buzzer. That lift of confidence led to a big second quarter and Frewsburg controlled the game all the way to a 69-45 victory and a date with Section II's Stillwater in the Class C final at 7:45 tonight.

“Anytime you get a win in the state semifinal that's a good feeling,” Frewsburg head coach Sierra Beaver said. “I think this one took a lot out of us, so we're going to have to go and get some good sleep tonight and get some rest tomorrow and get our legs back under us. Hopefully we can have another good showing tomorrow.”

Frewsburg's Ava Jimerson drives past Tuckahoe's Juliana Manginelli during the second half of the NYSPHSAA Class C semifinal at Hudson Valley Community College on Thursday night. 


While Trocki set up plenty of her team's buckets in the first period, her buzzer-beater was the only points she scored in the frame. The sophomore star proceeded to score the first 8 points for the Bears in the second quarter with a pair of triples that made sure the Bears stayed in front of the Tigers. 

“She does a great job creating separation,” Beaver said about Jadyn Trocki. “Especially when we need a big shot, just finding a way to get a little bit of space so she can get a shot off. It doesn't take a lot because she has a pretty quick release.”

Frewsburg was able to hit shots beyond the arc, including 2 of Teghan Trocki's four on the evening, while Tuckahoe found itself settling for two and the Bears built a double-digit lead at halftime 37-24. 

“Both times I felt we came out and played well, but this time our defense kind of gave us the edge,” Beaver said comparing this year and last year's semifinal. “We were up 6 or 8-0 at the beginning whereas last year I feel it was kind of back and forth the entire time. We knew they were going to come out fast with intensity, and to be able to meet that was good.” 

With the speed of Tuckahoe, Frewsburg knew that the game was far from over at halftime and would need to continue matching that fast tempo. 

The Frewsburg answer was senior Ava Jimerson, who was looking for one last chance at a state title. 

“It started off with my coach yelling at me to shoot,” Ava Jimerson stated. “I was not shooting the whole first half and I listened to her. I shot one and it fell, then I shot another one and it fell again.”

Jimerson took heed of the advice from Beaver and started taking it to the basket scoring 9 of her game-high 19 points in the third quarter. 

While the second quarter saw the Trocki sisters hit four 3-pointers, it was the Jimerson twins taking over in the second half. Ava scored 16 points in the final half and Taytum Jimerson finished the game with 12 assists, 7 points, seven rebounds and a block. 

“Ava is always able to get to the rim against anybody,” Beaver said. “She does a really good job when she gets inside and to be able to finagle her body to get shots off when there's taller girls. Taytum had 12 assists. She just made a lot of mature senior passes tonight. When she got into trouble in a double team, she just pivoted her way out of it and was able to find people.” 

Tuckahoe brought height and athleticism under the basket, but it was unable to get the better of Ava Jimerson when she was attacking the glass, finishing with 19 points and 12 rebounds. Abery Harvey was also dominant in the post, attacking and showing some range with 13 points and five rebounds. 

Frewsburg had four girls finish with double figures as Jadyn Trocki provided 14 points, eight boards and a block and Teghan Trocki had 12 points and five rebounds. Senior Kaylee Cappa was also the Sportsmanship Award recipient for the Bears.

“It means everything,” Ava Jimerson said about advancing to the state title. “We have four seniors on this team with me being one of them and I just wanted to win as a senior.”

The Bears will have to collect themselves and get ready to switch gears against a more patient Stillwater squad in the Class C championship.

“Defensively, we did our job,” Beaver stated. “They're really fast, so they're tough to keep in front. I feel like in the full court they got too many full transition buckets and a few too many offensive rebounds, but when you're playing that fast it's hard to get bodies on people. I think that together we did a really good job of not allowing them to penetrate and get easy looks.”

In the first semifinal, Stillwater grinded the Cooperstown offense to a halt, limiting the Hawkeyes to single-digit scoring in the first three periods and earned a comfortable 59-37 victory. 

Stillwater was led by the trio of Addison Thornton with 18 points, Andie Luskin with 16 and Maddie Chatt had 11. 

The state's top-ranked team completely took Cooperstown's top scorer out of the game as seventh-grader Emma Johnson scored just 2 points and the Hawkeyes only received double digits from eighth-grader Lanie Nelen with 13.

“I think they're the exact opposite of what Tuckahoe likes to do,” Beaver said about Stillwater. “They like to get more into the halfcourt, they'll take their transition points and they got a few of those tonight for sure against Cooperstown. But I think they really like to get the ball in the halfcourt and run a set offense and so we'll have to talk about how we're going to defend some of those plays.”

Lori and Bruce Nixon at Illinois' open practice ahead of the NCAA tournament on Thursday at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee.

MILWAUKEE — Bruce and Lori Nixon picked the right time to attend the University of Illinois.

The couple — Bruce hails from Clinton, while Lori is from Aurora — were season-ticket holders when the likes of Kenny Battle, Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo guided Illinois to the Final Four in 1989.

“The Illini spirit runs deep,” Bruce Nixon said. “It was just a heck of a year. We're proud of being Illinois alumni and being part of that experience. We're hoping to see this year's team put it together just like they did.”

Some 36 years later, they were among the very first to arrive at Fiserv Forum on Thursday, well before Kasparas Jakucionis, Morez Johnson Jr. and Kylan Boswell took the floor for an open practice ahead of the NCAA tournament.

“We just want to see the Illini nation come out in strong numbers,” Bruce Nixon said.

“Let's have fun. Let's take this thing all the way out of Milwaukee,” he said.

The couple is now retired and residing in northern Wisconsin. They have a daughter who attended the University of Kentucky; it could be a house divided if the Illini and Wildcats advance to face each other in the second round.

So it worked out that the Illini got the nod to open the tournament close to home. On the way back home, in fact, from visiting family in Illinois earlier this week.

“We were thinking we were either going to go to Milwaukee or Lexington if the Illini went,” Bruce Nixon said. “So this just matched up perfect ... we're really happy with the mix of teams that have gone here, also.”

Whether the Nixons are pitted against each other is dependent on Friday's results; Illinois' tournament opener against Xavier is slated for 8:45 p.m., immediately following Kentucky's tilt with Troy.

Either way, count the Nixons as fans of what Brad Underwood has done with the Illini since taking the helm of the program in 2017.

“He has done a great job of getting some great talent,” Bruce Nixon said. “We're actually thinking that this might have to be an annual occasion for March Madness. Now that we're retired, we'd like to follow them around and get to see more of these tournaments.

Cameron Bowers, left, and Maggie Bartoletti pose for a photo at Illinois' open practice Thursday ahead of the NCAA tournament at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee.

Bloomington native Cameron Bowers — also among the smattering of Illini fans in Fiserv Forum's lower bowl Thursday — shares the sentiment.

“I'm a big fan,” Bowers said. “We've gone from a program that was in obscurity in the Big Ten to not having to worry about our name being called on Selection Sunday. I think that's a huge thing.”

Credit Bowers' grandfather, Rantoul's Bill Shaffner, with inspiring the Milwaukee resident's Illini fandom.

Bowers' — a bartender in nearby Shorewood, Wis. — spots orange and blue where he can in the heart of Badger country, where he's lived since 2016.

“That was destined before I was born,” Bowers said. “My grandpa has been a donor and season ticket holder for years and years and years. I was so happy come Selection Sunday (to be able to) just come down the street and go watch the boys.”

He'll attend Friday's game with a few pals; one from England, another who graduated from Northwestern and, fittingly, a Xavier grad.

Maggie Bartoletti was wearing her school's navy blue and white as they watched the Illini make their final preparations, complete with cheerleaders and a 40-piece basketball band watching from the baseline.

“It's a good little fun rivalry with some friends up here,” Bowers said. “You see a lot more orange and blue than you'd think up here, even outside of tournament time. I have a couple regulars who graduated from U of I and live here now who are big time Illinois fans.”

The Illini held an open practice in Milwaukee on Thursday ahead of their opener against Xavier on Friday.

PHILADELPHIA — Drake Ayala had no trouble securing two wins here Thursday, as the former Fort Dodge Senior High standout advanced to the quarterfinals of the NCAA Championships.

Ayala, a junior at Iowa who earned the No. 2 seed, picked up a technical fall and a major decision at 133 pounds. He will now face Ohio State's Nic Bouzakis on Friday with a spot in the semifinals on the line.

Last year, Ayala advanced to the 125-pound championship, placing second. He owns a record of 19-2 on the year with 11 wins resulting in bonus points.

Iowa is currently tied for fourth with Minnesota and Ohio State at 18 points. Three-time defending national champion Penn State leads with 39.5 followed by Nebraska and Oklahoma State.  

A three-time state champion for the Dodgers, Ayala is in his third NCAA Championships. He qualified as a freshman, becoming just the third true freshman to do so under head coach Tom Brands. 

Following a year spent unattached, Ayala returned to the Hawkeye lineup in 2023-24, finishing third at the Big Ten Championships before a second at nationals, going 27-5 overall. 

Earlier this month, he placed second at the Big Tens to Lucas Byrd of Illinois, who earned the No. 1 seed at 133 and also advanced to the quarters. Byrd will face Penn State's Braeden Davis while Indiana's Angelo Rini meets Cal Poly's Zeth Romney. 

The winner between Ayala and Bouzakis gets either Wisconsin's Zan Fugitt or Virginia Tech's Connor McGonagle. 

Ayala earned two takedowns in the first period vs. Missouri's Kade Moore to begin the day before securing three more in the second. He put the match away with his seventh takedown in the third,w inning 21-5 in 5:30.

In the second round vs. Northern Iowa's Julian Farber, Ayala earned a 13-4 major decision with three more takedowns, including two in the opening period. He is now 7-3 in three trips to the NCAAs. 

Joining Ayala in the quarters from Iowa will be Mike Caliendo, Patrick Kennedy, Stephen Buchanan and Ben Kueter. Caliendo had two major decisions, Kennedy won twice by decision, Buchanan had a major decision and a technical fall, and Kueter scored two decisions.

Caliendo faces Michigan's Beau Mantanona at 165 pounds, Kennedy gets Dean Hamiti from Oklahoma State at 174, Buchanan wrestles Seth Shumate of Ohio State at 197 and Kueter takes on Owen Trephan from Lehigh at heavyweight.

Kyle Parco and Gabe Arnold went 1-1, earning round one wins before falling in the second. Joey Cruz and Jacori Teemer both went 0-2 and were eliminated.

New Mexico's Nelly Junior Joseph, center, gathers with teammates and staff during practice Thursday for the NCAA Tournament at Rocket Arena in Cleveland.

CLEVELAND — For a movie to maintain its PG-13 rating, the Motion Picture Association of America allows no more than one F-word during a feature-length film.

Thursday's Lobos news conference met those minimum standards. Barely. One more bad word and it would have been pushed into an R rating.

To be fair, English is not Nelly Junior Joseph's first language. A native of Nigeria, he is still learning the nuances of Americanized subtext. Subtle transitions from one thought to another are filled with, well, filler words.

When asked about a possible mismatch in the block against Marquette's low post players in Friday's first-round South Region game in Cleveland, the New Mexico center did his best to lay it out there.

He finished with a barely audible but clearly stated curse word.

“I feel like I just have to, like, be able to, like, talking, whenever they pass the ball to me I just got to finish every time and play hard and, because they're going to be physical as [expletive],” Joseph said. “So I gotta be ready for that.”

He's not the first Lobo to get extra talky in front of a microphone. Lobos guard Filip Borovicanin, a junior from Serbia who, like Nelly, also speaks with a heavy accent, dropped a similar F-bomb during a radio interview on KKOB-AM earlier this season.

Hey, it happens.

During UNM's shootaround Thursday afternoon, Lobo Louie showed up wearing the team's turquoise alternate uniform. Was it a sign of what the Lobos would be wearing in Friday's game?

Nope.

Chalk it up to a wardrobe malfunction. A team spokesman said UNM will wear its standard cherry red uniform. There's no rule against the team wearing turquoise — it's just a team decision to wear red.

Two uniforms that can't be worn at any point during the tournament are the Lobos' yellow statehood alternates and the 1977-78 throwbacks the team wore against Utah State in February. Neither conforms to the NCAA uniform codes for the tournament, which states no vertical lettering is allowed (sorry throwbacks) and coloring that must match the school's primary look (turquoise is fine, all yellow with a Zia symbol on the chest with smaller numbers in front is not).

Michigan State's Tom Izzo drew the largest media gathering at Thursday's eight press conferences for teams representing the South and East regions.

The Spartans won the school's second (and most recent) national championship in 2000. They started that tournament with a pair of wins in Cleveland.

“Yeah, I got the same socks, underwear and hat on, but other than that — no, you know, it was interesting,” Izzo said when asked if he was superstitious about returning to where it all started. “I called one of my former assistants who's now with the Phoenix Suns, and he said, we started in Cleveland. I was on the bus on the way down here, and I talked to — I just wish it worked that way, but I'm not sure that's God's plan. It's great. It brings back good memories. But the sad part is, none of my guys were born then.”

Rocket Arena is the spacious home of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. It's not quite the house built by LeBron, but it may as well be. The arena opened in 1994 and served as the cornerstone of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex that featured the baseball stadium, now known as Progressive Field, that's home to the Cleveland Guardians.

The venues sit right next to one another downtown, the baseball field's left field foul line pointing almost in a straight line toward the basketball arena.

Ask anyone who the most famous Cavalier of all time is and the answer is easy. LeBron James was drafted by the Cavs in 2003 and played in Cleveland through 2010 when he famously took his talents to South Beach and played four seasons with the Miami Heat. He returned to Cleveland in 2014, leading the Cavs to four straight finals appearances and the 2015-16 NBA title.

It would be unprecedented for an NBA team to retire the number of an active player on another team, which explains why LeBron's name hasn't risen to the rafters like Nate Thurmond, Larry Nance, Mark Price, Brad Daugherty, Bingo Smith, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Austin Carr. Similarly, he is not mentioned on the team's wall of fame just inside the arena's main entrance.

In time, LeBron. In time.

Mar 20, 2025

Photo by the West Central Tribune/Michael Lyne: Dawson-Boyd sophomore guard Jaxton Hastad looks to make a pass while defended by Heritage Christian Academy's Griffin Booms in a Class A state quarterfinal game on Thursday, March 20, 2025, at the Target Center in Minneapolis.

MINNEAPOLIS — The second-seeded Dawson-Boyd boys basketball team found a new level in the second half of its Class A quarterfinal matchup against No. 7 Heritage Christian Academy on Thursday at the Target Center. The Blackjacks held a 6-point lead at halftime but ran away with the win in the second half, riding a scoring barrage from Brayson Boike and Gunner Liebl to a 69-46 win. 

“Offensively, we didn't need to really change anything. We settled for some 3-point shots, they don't go in, so maybe the offense doesn't look too good,” Dawson-Boyd head coach Cory Larson said of the team's halftime conversation. “Offensively, we wanted to attack them a little bit more and get Gunner going… The message was get aggressive, play a little bit more north-and-south offensively, and we were able to get to the rim a few more times in the second half.”

Holding a 34-28 lead out of halftime, Dawson-Boyd wasted no time flipping the switch. Liebl scored Dawson-Boyd's first 6 second-half points to extend the advantage to 40-29. After a Carson Stratmoen putback layup, Liebl assisted a Boike basket inside and then hit another basket for his 8th point of the half on a 12-1 Dawson-Boyd run when Heritage Christian called a timeout.

After scoring 2 points on 1 of 7 shooting in the first half, Liebl went on to finish the game with a total of 18 points after shooting 6 of 9 after the break. He also grabbed five rebounds and dished out five assists with four turnovers.

Dawson-Boyd's lead only continued to balloon from there. Boike converted an and-1 to bring the Blackjacks' lead to 25 points with seven-and-a-half minutes left in the game. A Liebl eurostep extended the lead to 20 with four minutes left to play, and an emphatic dunk and a pair of free throws brought the Blackjack advantage up to its apex, 69-45, when both teams made a mass substitution with 90 seconds to play.

Boike made a statement in his first game on the big stage. He scored a game-high 31 points on 11 of 18 shooting from the field. He also grabbed eight rebounds, blocked three shots and ripped away a pair of steals.

“The thing about Brayson right now is that obviously everybody understands he's talented, but he's playing with a lot of determination. A lot of desire,” Larson said. “That's a great characteristic to have when you're playing late in March. He's impacting the game in a lot of different ways. Defensively today, I mean, he had a big block in the second half, but he was very efficient on the offensive end too.”

Both Dawson-Boyd and Heritage Christian Academy were making their third-ever state tournament appearance in the matchup. For the Eagles, the tournament berth marked their second consecutive season qualifying for state after they went home with a fifth-place trophy last year. For the Blackjacks, it was their first appearance since 1991. Their lone other appearance came as Dawson High School in 1949.

The Blackjacks first pulled away while facing a 7-6 deficit. Boike finished through contact to give Dawson-Boyd the lead and then slammed home a dunk off a feed from Drew Hjelmeland to extend the advantage to 3 points.

Hjelmeland then came up with a steal to set up a Liebl bucket and, after Heritage Christian called its first timeout five minutes in, he hit another 3 to give Dawson-Boyd a 17-7 lead on a 10-0 run.

Heritage Christian battled its way back down to a 4-point deficit when Owen Haag knocked down a 3-pointer, making the score 27-23 with five minutes remaining in the half. A traveling violation against the Blackjacks gave the Eagles the opportunity to make it a one-possession game. Still, Heritage Christian shot an airball and Hjelmeland got a floater and a putback to go down on consecutive possessions to bring the Blackjacks back out of the danger zone.

Dawson-Boyd got in foul trouble early. The Eagles entered the bonus with nine minutes left in the half and entered the double bonus in the final two minutes. Jaxton Hastad was called for three first-half fouls, and another in the opening minutes of the second half, but Heritage Christian struggled at the charity stripe; they shot 3 of 8 as a team from the line in the half. 

“It's easy for us, as a coaching staff, to say, ‘Hey, play straight up. You know the first move he's going to give you is a shot fake to try to create some sort of advantage,' but we're not the ones that are out on the court,” Larson said. “I thought we did a pretty good job of just playing ourselves in the second half, but at the same time, staying aggressive.”

While University of Minnesota-commit Abu Tarawallie was able to have his way in the paint, logging 8 points and 11 rebounds at the break with four coming on the offensive glass, he shot 2 of 6 at the line. Tarawallie went on to finish the game with 19 rebounds and 13 points on 5 of 11 shooting from the field and 3 of 10 shooting from the free-throw line.

“He eats up so much space, he's pretty active and he's so strong,” Larson said of Tarawallie. “He's got 80-to-90 pounds on most of our kids… He had a really nice first half and got us into foul trouble, but I thought kids did a good job of adjusting in the second half.”

Larson added that he felt the group was good defensively as a whole, noting that they only allowed 18 second-half points.

An acrobatic layup from Joshua Sokeye and another travel against Dawson-Boyd gave the Eagles another opportunity to make it a one-possession game in the final minute, but Beau Johnson ripped away a steal and Dawson-Boyd carried a 34-28 advantage into halftime. 

In addition to Tarawallie, the Eagles also had Haag and Sokeye score in double figures for the Eagles with 11 and 10 points respectively. The Eagles are one of two teams in Minnesota state history with four career 1,000-point scorers in their career, per NSPN.TV, with Tarawallie, Sokeye, Jonah Moulton and Haag all in the club. 

Both teams struggled with long-range shooting in the game; Dawson-Boyd shot 3 of 19 from beyond the arc while Heritage Christian shot 3 of 16. Still, Dawson-Boyd used its size down the stretch to create a 44-30 edge in points in the paint, and their defensive performance resulted in a 22-7 advantage in points off turnovers.

Dawson-Boyd improves to 28-3 with the win and will No. 3 Red Lake County (30-2) in the semifinals at the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena on Thursday at 2 p.m. The Rebels defeated No. 6 Goodhue 68-61 on Thursday.

The coaching fraternity is much closer than most people realize

Best Friends Ben McCollum of Drake, Grant McCasland of Texas Tech Square off for Spot in Sweet 16

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — The coaching fraternity is much closer than most people realize. Friendships are formed and relationships kept through all the hirings and firings, and paths cross and cross again as coaches climb and fall on the professional ladder.

Every once in a while, they cross on a stage so big that everybody notices.

So it will be on Saturday night, when Grant McCasland leads third-seeded Texas Tech against Ben McCollum and his team full of Division II transfers from No. 11 seed Drake. At stake for the best friends: a spot in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.

“It's just like playing pick-up with your teammates,” McCollum said after beating No. 6 seed Missouri in the first round. “When you're playing pick-up, sometimes you kind of get after each other a little bit, but afterwards it's all love.”

The 48-year-old McCasland certainly is no stranger to facing familiar faces. The Red Raiders play Big 12 games against his alma mater, Baylor, where he spent five years on the staff of longtime coach Scott Drew. And they regularly play Kansas State, which is coached by Jerome Tang, who was on that staff in Waco, Texas, at the same time.

Yet his friendship with the 43-year-old McCollum goes back even farther, way back to their very origins in coaching.

It was the early 2000s and McCasland had just been hired for his first real job, as an assistant at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, Colorado, where the pay was so modest he felt fortunate to live in the dorms. It was there that McCasland came across Jeff Linder, an assistant at Emporia State, a Division II school in Kansas, who was recruiting some of his guys.

Linder, by the way, is now an assistant on McCasland's staff at Texas Tech.

So fast-forward a couple of years and McCasland gets his first head-coaching job at Midland, a junior college in Texas. One of his first calls was to Linder, who joined his staff, and together they went to the national tournament their first year.

The guy that replaced Linder at Emporia State: Ben McCollum, a young man happy to land a first full-time job of his own.

The three of them grew close — they were all just starting out, after all. They'd spend hours discussing offensive and defensive strategy, and how to build a winning culture. They leaned on each other when times got hard and applauded every success.

“We were young,"" McCasland said, ""and we didn't make any money, and we all loved ball. We loved being around each other.”

McCasland eventually got the head job at North Texas, the one he parlayed into his current position at Texas Tech, and McCollum got his shot as a head coach at Northwest Missouri State, which he quickly turned into a Division II juggernaut. But even as their professional paths diverged, their personal relationship only grew closer through the years.

Their families get together in offseasons. They call each other up when they're in a rut. They go trout fishing together.

McCasland remembers one year at North Texas that he thought his team had a pretty good offense. It was the nation's No. 1 team when it came to scoring out of timeouts. He had installed some creative movements, and McCasland was proud of it.

“Ben watched film of our team,” he recalled, “and straight-up told me our offense sucked.""

“You know, that's the kind of relationship we have,” continued McCasland, who on at least one occasion tried to hire McCollum to his staff. “I love him, but you know, when you play him, it's going to be different.""

McCasland may have missed his chance to hire him, by the way.

In McCollum's first year leading the Bulldogs, and with a team relying heavily on the four transfers he brought with him from Northwest Missouri State, McCollum has already set a school record with 31 wins. They won Missouri Valley regular- and postseason titles, snapped a four-game losing streak in NCAA Tournament first-round games, and on Saturday, McCollum will be trying to get Drake to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1971.

Not surprisingly, his name has been linked to just about every coaching vacancy in the game. One in particular keeps surfacing: Iowa. He was born in Iowa City, in the shadows of the university, and grew up in the small western Iowa town of Storm Lake. He spent a stint playing ball at North Iowa Area Community College.

McCollum batted back any talk of other jobs this week. He insisted that his only focus is on what Drake is doing right now.

Right now, the Bulldogs are getting ready to play his old friend and his Red Raiders in the NCAA Tournament.

“We'll always be friends,” McCasland said, “but tomorrow, I guess, it will be on.”

Once Gov. Greg Gianforte affixes his signature to House Bill 190, Montana will become the fourth state to adopt American Rodeo as the official state sport.

Other states have adopted official sports representing a facet of their heritage, ranging from the common – baseball in New York — to the increasingly popular — pickleball in Washington — to the less traditional — pack burro racing in Colorado, and dog mushing in Alaska.

During the last week the Legislature took its final votes on HB 190 and the bill will head to the governor's desk for a signature.

Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, carried the bill in the Senate and wore her paisley scarf on the floor last Saturday when she spoke about the bill, because “this is more rodeo than almost anything else.”

“I don't know that I can convey, really, how fun rodeo is here in the Senate chamber,” McKamey said.

“This is very unique in that it represents our heritage, the outdoors, and it's an opportunity to have have a really unique statement about our state,” she added.

Some senators voiced their opposition to the bill — Sen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, said that more Montanans hunt than rodeo, and Sen. Susan Webber, D-Browning, objected to the bill not specifically including Native American components.

“I just had hoped that they would have included the Indian Relay, which is a few centuries old here as part of this bill,” Webber said. “But we do have an Indian rodeo circuit that goes along with the National Rodeo Association. I just wish they would have done a little bit more.”

The bill was supported by the Montana American Indian Caucus, as well as by the congressional delegation and all six of Montanan's statewide elected officials.

“There's nothing better than a good rodeo all summer long. And the fine senator in the back near Kalispell said they have it all winter long going there,” Sen. Butch Gillespie, R-Ethbridge, said. “And as far as the Indian rodeos … nothing's better than their rodeos and and the relay races, and they happen all over the place also. So let's not let the other western states get the drop on us here.”

The Senate passing the measure 40-9, with an amendment making the law effective immediately. The House on Wednesday concurred with the amendment with only two votes in opposition.

Five colleges in Montana, including Montana State University, have rodeo clubs or teams. MSU hosted the collegiate rodeo finals for 24 years, until they moved briefly to South Dakota in the 1990s and then to Casper, Wyoming where they are still held.

At the high school level, Montana qualified 100 contestants to the National High School Rodeo Finals from the state championships held in Kalispell last J—une.

American Rodeo now joins the pantheon of state symbols, next to the duck-billed dinosaur (state fossil), Scobey soil (state soil), bitterroot (state floral emblem), blackspotted cutthroat trout (state fish), bluebunch wheatgrass (state grass), grizzly bear (state animal), and “Montana Melody” (state ballad) among others.

MARK NANCE/Sun-Gazette Correspondent
Loyalsock's Julie Ellis (2) drives around Dunmore's Amanda Dempsey (10) in the  first  half.

Loyalsock (28-2) vs.

Imhotep (23-6) at Parkland High School, 6 p.m.

Loyalsock road to Final Four: In District 4, beat Line Mountain, 77-31, Towanda, 52-20, and Hughesville, 52-49; In states, beat Biglerville, 53-20, West Catholic, 54-35, and Dunmore, 60-36

Loyalsock notes: Loyalsock is making its second straight Final 4 appearance after having previously never advanced beyond the quarterfinals. The Lancers have won six state tournament games the past two years and have set a new single-season record for wins both times, going a combined 55-6. The 28 wins this season also tie the mark for most games won by any Loyalsock basketball team in the 2000s, sharing that distinction with last year's boys' team. The Lancers rallied from a point down in the second quarter against Dunmore, outscoring it, 42-14 in the middle quarters. They also snapped Dunmore's 18-game winning streak after closing the second round game against West Catholic on a 19-4 run. Loyalsock is allowing 30.9 points per game and held Dunmore 20 points below its season average. Lacey Kriebel scored a season-high 24 points, adding seven rebounds, five assists and three steals. Alaina Dadzie scored 17 points and Jaekairah Harden had 10 points with eight rebounds. Julie Ellis and Jillian Kennedy excelled defensively and Addie Bastian and Madison Perry provided quality minutes off the bench. Loyalsock's two losses this season are by three combined points against 5A state semifinalist Crestwood and District 4 Class AAAA champion Central Columbia, both games being decided in the last 2.6 seconds. Loyalsock enters tonight on a six game winning streak and has won 18 or more games in nine straight seasons.

Imhotep road to Final Four: In District 12, beat Academy at Palumbo, 62-18; lost to Audenried, 65-52, beat West Catholic, 57-35; In States, beat Executive Education, 53-27, Hughesville, 52-41, and Pequea Valley, 55-25

Imhotep notes: Like Loyalsock, Imhotep is trying to reach its first state final. It also is making its state semifinal debut after starting strong against Pequea Valley. The Panthers earned a hard-fought win against Hughesville in the second round, scoring the game's final seven points in the last minute after the squads exchanged 11 first-half leads. Geren Hargrove and Anise Geiger form a strong inside tandem and combined for 28 points against Hughesville. Guard Sabria Mann has enjoyed an excellent season as has wing forward Geren Hawthorne, who is especially dangerous near the rim. Ashlee Boykins, McKenna Alston and Kayla Thompson all have played well off the bench and Anai Kenyatta hit a key 3-pointer against Hughesville. Imhotep held a 30-22 advantage on the boards against Pequea Valley and did a nice job igniting its transition game off those defensive boards. Pequea Valley forced 12 second half turnovers but Imhotep built a 26-9 halftime lead and was able to gradually extend that through the final two quarters. The Panthers reached the Public League championship, losing a hard-fought game against Audenried. They average 54 points per game and, like Loyalsock, have heated up at the perfect time, winning 18 of their last 19 games.

ON THE MOUND — Brooke freshman Niko Palavis works to the plate during Thursday's game at Wheeling Park. He struck out three, walked three and gave up one earned run in three innings of work. The Bruins fell 10-0 in five innings. - Kim North

WHEELING – Although it was nearly 30 degrees colder Thursday than it was on Wednesday, the chill-filled breeze on the Wheeling Park hilltop was not enough to cool off the red-hot Wheeling Park baseball team.

The Patriots (2-0) used no-hit pitching, flawless play in the field and 11 more base hits in rolling past debuting Brooke, 10-0, in five innings on the artificial surface on Patriot Field.

“The elements were tough but our guys continued to play hard and hit the ball,” Wheeling Park head coach Steve Myers said. “We got solid pitching and played good defense.”

Shepherd University signee Ryland Robb worked the first four frames, striking out half-a-dozen, walking two and hitting a pair. He erased one of the baserunners with a pickoff to end the second inning. Robb threw 70 pitches, with 41 being strikes. He threw a first-pitch strike to half of the 16 Bruins he faced.

“He stayed composed,” Myers said of Robb. “He was really focused today.”

Freshman Jaxon Updegraff took the hill for the fifth and needed just seven pitches – all strikes – to complete the no-no. He fanned a pair.

“He's going to be a good player,” Myers said of Updegraff.

Leading 5-0 entering the home half of the fifth, Wheeling Park collected six hits – two doubles and four singles – in duplicating their run total to that point and invoking the 10-run mercy rule against reliever Gavin Kuchinski.

Rocco DiGiandomenico ignited the late uprising with a wind-blown double to left-center. Nolan Yanchak's double to right-center made it 6-0. Noah Short lofted a soft single over shortstop that was misplayed as Yanchak, after hesitating at third, scored on to up the margin to 7-0 as Short alertly took second. With one out, Miles Gorby ripped an RBI single up the middle for an 8-0 advantage. Following a single by Kolten Whitmire, a wild pitch advanced the runners to second and third. Updegraff slapped a 2-1 offering through the right side of the infield as Gorby and Whitmire scored to end things.

The top three hitters in the Wheeling Park order each finished with two hits, with Nate Simon belting a single and triple to drive home two runs. Updegraff and Whitmire each singled twice and combined for three ribbies.

The Patriots, who defeated University 12-2 in five innings 24 hours earlier, jumped out to a 3-0 lead after one at bat as Updegraf singled, Simon tripled him home and two runs scored when Yanchak's shot to first caromed into shallow right-center.

Whitmire had a run-scoring single in the fourth and Simon, a Seton Hill University recruit, singled in the fifth run of the game.

The Bruins advanced a runner to second in the fourth when Henry Anderson walked and moved up 90 feet when Robb was called for a balk with one out. However, a pair of strikeouts sandwiched around a hit-by-pitch ended the inning.

Freshman Niko Palavis got the start for Brooke. The righty struck out three and walked a trio while tossing 69 pitches, of which 37 were strikes.

“It was a tough day for us. We started a freshman on the mound today, and I think it was 3-0 when he left … two unearned (runs),” Brooke head coach Doug Costain said. “That was the bright spot for us today.

“I'm not in the business of making excuses,” Costain added, “but we've only been on the baseball field three times, twice for scrimmages and once to practice. We talked about valuing our at-bats a little more, taking a better approach at the plate. We'll get there. It's still early.”

Wheeling Park returns to the diamond Saturday for a doubleheader at Parkersburg South. Brooke visits Elkins the same day for a 1:30 p.m. contest.

LJ Maehl continues to pile up all-conference honors, adding another one to her resume for this past basketball season.

Maehl, a Fort Dodge junior, was one of three players who earned unanimous first team all-Iowa Alliance Conference status. 

Joining Maehl were Dodger teammates Meah McCaleb, Brooklyn Pommer and Dakota Pommer. 

On the year, Maehl averaged 18.5 points per game and eight rebounds, shooting 46 percent from the field and 71 percent at the free throw line. She also recorded 42 steals, 30 assists and 25 blocked shots, knocking down 27 three-pointers.

“I thought the voting for all-conference went pretty fair,” FDSH head coach Scott Messerly said. “LJ was an obvious pick and there really wasn't even a vote for making her unanimous.

“She had a great year and in my opinion is the best player in our league.”

Heading into her senior year, Maehl ranks third on the school's career scoring list with 981 points. She is 192 away from passing Molly Nelson for first all-time.

“Being named first team all-conference for the second straight year is an incredible honor,” Maehl said. “I'm deeply grateful to my coaches for their guidance, my teammates for their constant support and inspiration, and my family for their unwavering belief in my.

“Althought our team didn't reach all of its goals this season — and I know I have more work to do on my individual game — we plan to work hard this offseason.”

McCaleb, a senior and three-year starter, posted 158 points with 132 rebounds while leading the team in steals (92) and assists (87). 

“Meah had a really nice season and a good career,” Messerly said. “I'd have liked for her to get on the first-team, but in these situations a lot of times it comes down to points scored. She really did everything we asked of her.”

Brooklyn Pommer, also a senior, added 85 points with 104 rebounds, 44 steals and 32 assists while Dakota Pommer, a junior, finished with 119 points, 79 rebounds, 45 assists, 33 steals and 10 blocks. 

“The Pommer sisters were great at what we asked them to do,” Messerly said. “Brooklyn was one of the top rebounders and defenders while Dakota is just a good player.”

Karsyn Pankonen of Ames and Machaela Trask from Mason City were the other unanimous first team all-league selections. The Little Cyclones and Riverhawks shared the division title at 7-1.

Mar 21, 2025



SOUTH BEND, Ind. — The matchup will feature markedly contrasting styles and a decidedly different pace.

The No. 11-seed Iowa State women's basketball team is expecting a lot different from its First Four victory over Princeton when the Cyclones face No. 6 Michigan this morning at Purcell Pavilion.

Michigan (22-10) brings its five-guard offense to Notre Dame's home court when it faces Iowa State (23-11) in a 10:30 a.m. game that will be televised on ESPN2.

“It's fun playing with five guards,” Wolverines coach Kim Barnes Arico said. “Two years ago, you would have never convinced me that we would do that. But I think as a coach, and this is something we've learned in this landscape more than anything else in college athletics, is that we better evolve and we better be willing to change.”

Iowa State will face a dramatically different pace than it did when the Cyclones beat Princeton in Wednesday's First Four game. Iowa State rallied from a 13-point halftime deficit to win 68-63, the 800th victory for coach Bill Fennelly.

Unlike Michigan, Iowa State has a strong post player in 6-foot-3 center Audi Crooks, who averages 23.3 points and 7.5 assists.

“We have to keep the ball in front of us,” Fennelly said. “Transition defense is going to be critical.”

Michigan is making its seventh-straight NCAA Tournament appearance, yet seven players on the Wolverines' roster will be dancing for the first time. That list includes three freshman starters: Syla Swords, Olivia Olson and Mila Holloway.

Olson is the Wolverines' leading scorer at 16.2 points per game, Swords is second at 16.1, and senior Jordan Hobbs (13.4) is third.

Olson and Swords are the only freshman teammates who average at least 15 points per game this season.

Katie Dinnebier

DES MOINES — Drake led by as many as 10 points in the second half but couldn't finish off Marquette, falling 74-69 in the first round of the Women's Basketball Invitation Tournament on Thursday at the Knapp Center.

The host Bulldogs (22-12) didn't make a field goal over the final two minutes as Marquette (21-10) finished off the comeback win to advance. Drake went ahead 43-33 on a 3-pointer by Courtney Becker with nine minutes left in the third quarter, but the Golden Eagles outscored the Bulldogs 44-29 in the second half for the win.

Jaidynn Mason's jumper with 50 seconds left put Marquette in front for good.

Skylar Forbes and Halle Vice scored 18 points apiece to lead the Golden Eagles, and Mason finished with 16.

Katie Dinnebier closed her collegiate career with a game-high 25 points for Drake, but she finished 7-of-21 from the field. Abbie Aalsma made four 3-pointers on her way to 16 points, while Becker and Anna Miller added 11 points each.

Miller had a game-high 11 rebounds as Drake won the battle on the boards, 39-33, but the Bulldogs couldn't overcome 22 turnovers in the season-ending defeat.

Florida 83, UNI 71

GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Florida stole the show in the second half.

The third-seeded Gators outscored Northern Iowa 45-33 after halftime to collect an 83-71 victory in the opening round of the Women's Basketball Invitation Tournament on Thursday night at Exactech Arena.

Jeriah Warren scored a game-high 28 points to power Florida (17-17), which trailed by three points late in the first half before breaking free from there. The two teams were tied at halftime, 38-all, but the Gators used a 7-0 run shortly after the intermission to take the lead for good.

UNI's Shateah Wetering scored the first basket of the second half to put UNI (17-17) on top 40-38, but Florida eventually led 52-43. Three-pointers by Kayba Laube and Elise Jaeger bookended an 8-0 Panther surge that got the deficit down to one, 52-51, but that was as close as UNI would get the rest of the way.

Alexia Gassett chipped in 13 points for Florida, Ra Shaya Kyle had 12 and Laila Reynolds added 11.

Laube led Northern Iowa with 21 points and five rebounds. Maya McDermott and Ryley Goebel got 13 points and Wetering added 10 in the season-ending defeat.

With four weekend series remaining on the regular season schedule, the Tauros will hit the road to Minnesota to take on the Austin Bruins in an all-important late-season series with playoff implications at stake in the Central Division.  

Entering the weekend the Tauros and Bruins find themselves tied for second place in the division with 77 points each through 51 games played. This weekend will be the first half of two straight weekends between the Tauros and Bruins as they wrap up their season series.  

The home stretch of the regular season for Minot includes matchups against Austin (twice), Aberdeen, and Bismarck. Austin, Abderdeen and Bismarck all find themselves in the playoff race as Austin and Bismarck have clinched playoff berths while Abderdeen sits tied with St. Cloud at 56 points.  

An overtime win on Friday night against North Iowa last weekend clinched a Robertson Cup Playoff Berth for Minot securing a return to the playoffs for the reigning Central Cup champions.  

The season series between the Tauros and Bruins sits deadlocked at 2-2 with both teams notching their respective two wins on the road. The last road trip to Riverside Arena took place back in early October for the Tauros and resulted in a combined nine goals scored for Minot as they outscored Austin 9-3 on the weekend. 

En route to that weekend sweep, it was Jesse Juhola leading the team in scoring goals, with three of the nine goals coming off his stick.  

Adam Mahler was the hero in the Friday night win over North Iowa this past weekend as he hammered home the overtime winner for his 13th goal of the season. The goal for Mahler also marked his 3rd game-winning goal as he leads Tauros' defensemen all-time in points scored in a season with 41 this year.  

Also heating up in the goal-scoring department this past weekend was Tauros' forward Noah Gibbs. Gibbs was able to find the back of the net twice on Friday night, which was good for his second and third goals in a Tauros uniform since being acquired by Minot.  

Last season the Tauros' pursuit for the first-place seed entering the postseason was largely bolstered by a stellar month of March which saw them post a combined record of 8-1 through the nine games played that month. Additionally the Tauros posted an unblemished 5-0 record that March against eventual playoff teams.  

The second half of March this year will once again provide an opportunity for Minot to gain critical ground on teams in the playoff race as first place remains in the balance. So far this month the Tauros hold a 4-1 record with all four of their remaining games coming against the Bruins. 

This weekend will also feature four of the current playoff picture teams playing each other as Bismarck will travel to St. Cloud to play the Norsemen who are tied with Aberdeen in the race for the final playoff spot. 

The Tauros are averaging 3.80 goals per game with 194 goals scored in 51 games played this season. Additionally, Minot has continued to hold teams under an average of two goals per game.  

As for the Bruins, they were entering last weekend in third place in the division, but were able to gain ground on the Tauros in the standings thanks to a weekend sweep over the Wings with 11 combined goals scored in the two wins. 

Alex Laurenza continues to lead the Bruins in points and goals scored as last weekend the forward broke the single-season record in Bruins franchise history for goals scored netting his 33rd & 34th goals of the season. Laurenza is also the leading Central Division point-getter with 74 points on the year through 50 games played.  

Luc Malkhassian also left his mark on the weekend sweep over Aberdeen earning himself the NAHL's Central Division Star of the Week on a weekend where he found the back of the net four times while also accounting for an assist.  

The Bruins are coming off a weekend series in which they went 50% on the extra-man advantage, netting four goals on eight opportunities. The Bruins' power-play unit ranks fourth among the Central Division converting at 19.71%. 

The last time the Bruins squared off with the Tauros it was a weekend sweep in Minot in December as the Bruins held the Tauros to just two goals on the weekend. 

Next weekend, the Tauros will return to Minot to take on the same Austin Bruins team on home ice at the Pepsi Rink at Maysa Arena. Puck drop for those games is scheduled for 7:35 p.m.

NEW MANCHESTER — The awaited debut of the new artificial turf surface at Oak Glen's Field of Dreams Complex came at a perfect time to display the benefits of the new field.

The moderate, and at times heavy, rain that fell just after game time Thursday evening would have been more than enough to keep the Golden Bears off the old natural surface softball diamond for days in past years. Not with the new field.

Playing through the weather, Oak Glen made the debut a victorious one, pulling away from visiting Madonna for a 16-6 victory.

“This is a beautiful opportunity for our school and softball program,” Oak Glen head coach Sherrie Garner said of the new field. “We're just thankful for the efforts that went into it. Our administration, staff, the whole community with the bond levys, give us great support.

“We talked about how the game would not have happened with the old field. It's good not to look out and see ducks on the ponds anymore.

“It's a beautiful field, everyone did excellent work to put this together.”

Oak Glen, now 2-0 with wins on back-to-back days to start the season, opened a 4-1 lead, fell behind 6-4 in the second, then stormed away with the victory scoring the game's final 12 runs to bring the run rule into play.

“We got the bats going a little bit, we're still a little bit rusty, we had some timely hitting against Wheeling Park (Wednesday) and did enough with them today,” Garner said. “We'll get there.”

After Madonna (0-1) struck first with a Peyton Conley run off a wild pitch that was set up by her double and steal, the Bears plated four in the bottom half.

Danica Holden, who had a monster game at the dish with six RBIs, knocked a two-run triple, then scored on an error to make it 3-1. A bases-loaded walk drawn by Mikalyn Balch later in the inning made it four two-out runs.

Madonna's rally in the top of the second started with a run crossing on an error, then a Conley drove in a pair of runs with a two-run double to even the score.

A couple batters later, Rylee Birkhimer knocked in two more with a base hit to make it 6-4 Dons.

From there, though, it was all Oak Glen.

Holden had an RBI single in the bottom of the second to get the Bears back within one, then a Neveah Heath knock was misplayed with two outs, allowing two runs to cross to put Oak Glen on top for what ended up being the final lead change.

Addie Smith had an RBI single in the third and Carney scored on an error making it 10-6.

An inning later, the Bears played six more to push the margin to 10. That rally started with a two-run Riley Bruce single, then, after another run off an error, Holden sent a ball deep down the line that bounced around in the corner, and she raced around for an inside-the-park, three-run home run that provided the final margin. 

After the somewhat wild start – both teams made early pitching changes – the Bears went away from the plan to rest regular starter Mattie Carney and made a third pitching change to bring in the ace in the third inning, and she proceeded to fire three shutout innings without allowing a hit, striking out five to take the win.

“It was not my plan to pitch her,” Garner said. “The first two girls can throw strikes, too, but we were struggling a little bit to keep their hands on the ball and throw strikes and it wasn't their night. Mattie came in with a good attitude and performed for us. She is definitely our workhorse.”

Above, in back row, Lenny Kasten, Eric Bernotas, Zach Lund, Caleb Smith, Tuffy Latour, Bree Schaaf. Front row are Lea Ann Parsley-Davenport, Tristan Gale Geisler and Katie Uhlaender. 

USA Bobsled and Skeleton Hall of Fame celebrated its 2025 inductees over the two weekends of the IBSF Bobsled and Skeleton World Championships. 

On March 8, the Skeleton ceremony was held in the Mount Van Hoevenberg Mountain Pass Lodge, and the Bobsled ceremony was held on Saturday, March 15, immediately following the awards ceremony.

During the Skeleton Hall of Fame Ceremony, moderated by Tuffy LaTour, 2002 Olympic Silver medalist Lea Ann Parsley, 2007 World Championship Silver medalist Eric Bernotas, and longtime General Manager of the USA Bobsled and Skeleton teams Lenny Kasten were inducted.

In 2000, Lea Ann Parsley won the first World Cup medal, a silver, in skeleton for the United States at a meet held in Lillehammer, Norway. The former fundraiser for the US Handball team went on to win six more World Cup Medals and numerous top-six finishes. In 2002, at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, Parsley won the silver medal. In addition, she was one of eight athletes chosen to carry the American flag in the opening ceremonies. 

Parsley went on to win the 2004 U.S. Skeleton National Championships and coach the U.S. skeleton team for the 2006 Olympic games while pursuing a career as a fire-fighter, becoming Ohio's 1999 Fire-Fighter of the Year.

“A big shout out to Terry Holland, who was at the top of the Salt Lake City Track and said we're going to know if you like this sport by the sound of your scream when we kick you off,” said Parsley. “You either won't like it, or you'll love it.”

Taking a wrong turn on the Northway in 2001 introduced Eric Bernotas to skeleton. He took a turn towards the track when he subsequently saw the sign to Mount Van Hoevenberg arriving while a skeleton school was in progress. Thinking that looked like a cool sport, he asked how he could get involved. Two weeks later, Bernotas was sliding down the track.

Introduced by teammate Zach Lund, the two-time Olympian Bernotas said, “The thing that keeps coming back to me is, even when not knowing exactly where I was heading, this community of people continued to push, drive, and support me. This place, these people, and their stories always pull me back, and today I find myself here again. This place, for me, was always about discovering my potential; it was a doorway for me to be able to do that, and I shall be ever grateful.”

The third inductee on March 8 was the beloved longtime USA Bobsled and Skeleton National Team Manager Lenny Kasten, who was responsible for the national team's domestic and international travel, logistics at the meet, and seeking and signing sponsors.

“His relationships are legendary; there's not a team on the tour that doesn't have a Lenny story of him helping them,” said Tuffy LaTour. ”

Above are Zach Lund, left, and Tuffy LaTour. 

Latour read comments from three athletes he felt could illustrate Kasten's impact. 

One example is from Jon Baily, “Lenny is one of those unforgettable individuals who leaves a lasting impression on everyone he meets. His unwavering dedication to the athletes he supports is truly inspiring, and his unorthodox methods, often teetering on the edge of legality, are legendary.”

Kasten thanked the many athletes he had the privilege of assisting and, most especially, his wife Alla for her support.

 The first Bobsled team inducted on Saturday, March 15, was the 1932 Silver-medalists Saranac Lake Red Devils led by Henry Homburger, who also helped design and led the mile-and-a-half track construction. 

The all-local Red Devils include Homburger, a civil engineer; Percy Bryant, a World War I vet who directed the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital; Paul Stevens, whose brothers won gold in the two-man and who served in World War I and World War II; and Ed Horton, an outstanding speedskater and owner of a greenhouse. The Red Devils' achievements included many first-place finishes in various national races. Accepting for the Red Devils was Homburger's grandson, granddaughter, and grand-nephew, who thanked everyone for recognizing the achievements of the Red Devils.

Homburger, who also assisted in the design of the Olympic Arena for the '32 Games, went on to build several great camps in the Adirondacks and, with his brother, engineered the opening of Howe Caverns in Schoharie County, New York.

The second inductee was the 1948 Gold-medal winning 4-man team led by Francis Tyler, the last Olympic medal to be won for the next fifty-six years, though several came heartachingly close. Tyler was a local policeman; Ed Rimkus slid for only two years; Pat Martin, a Messina policeman, was the first Olympian to win three winter Olympic medals; and brakeman Bill D'Amico was an all-around athlete who excelled in skiing, speed skating, football, and golf.

“Heading to St. Moritz, Tyler's team was considered America's best, and they didn't disappoint, winning the US their first medal since 1936,” said LaTour. “In 1936, he and his teammates placed sixth in the four-man. Because of WWII, Tyler had to wait twelve years to represent his country again.” 

Accepting for Tyler were the 2010 Night Train Gold Medal-winning team members Steve Mesler and Curtis Tomasevicz.

The final inductees, who also delivered the most heartwarming reflections of the day, were the four members of the 2002 four-man Silver-medalists Todd Hays, Garrett Hines, Bill Schuffenhaue, and Randy Jones, who was inducted in 2021 and joined his teammates in the ceremony. Each had a poignant story or thank you for sharing, in many ways summed by Hays' story of his dad introducing him to the Winter Olympics when watching the 1980 Games in their Rio Grand River Valley Texas home.

“My father started leaping around the room every time we won something, saying, “We did it, WE did it. Flash forward, and twenty-two years later, on our final run, we saw the scoreboard and started going crazy; the second thing I saw was my favorite athlete, the old man, leaping again, yelling, “Wed did it, by God, WE did it.” Now, flash forward twenty-three years after that; I look around this room; we did it; we did all of this. Right? It was all the older timers grinding it out from the top of Cortina, the men who came before us who did it not for any medals; they did it for the love of the game. That cannot be forgotten.”

“We are up here getting these awards; I want everyone to understand we're on their shoulders, we're on their backs, and I can only hope that the things we did will allow these other great men and women in this room, in this sport, to do the same thing. Brother and sisters, thank you for all this and everything you've done for this sport.”

“The Hall of Fame is a good way to keep everybody back in the sport by bringing people back here and reminding them that they are loved,” said Olympic gold medalist Jimmy Shea. “This event is a wonderful way of doing that. A big thank you is owed to Tuffy LaTour for all the work he puts into the Hall of Fame and for documenting and sharing the history of this sport.”

SHENANDOAH JUNCTION — Serf Guerra, Alex Danner, Brady Roberts, Sam Hefner, Nayan Dominguez, Jett Gross, Conner Williams, Liam Sager and Cole Smith give “Jefferson Baseball 2025” a group of players with varsity experience. Those hitters were very important in the Cougars, achieving another 20-plus win season in 2024.

But only Gross pitched more than 25 innings and most baseball enthusiasts believe the sport's most important position on any given day is pitcher.

It may begin with the day's pitcher, but he has to be given runs or he can't haul his team into the winner's circle, because he may be gone to the pitch-count rule before he receives any offensive support.

Even as a freshman last season, Guerra led the Cougars in batting average with his .357 showing. His on-base percentage was .448 and he slugged six home runs, drove in 40 runs, scored 25 runs and had 40 hits.

Danner batted .342, scored 33 runs had 40 hits and 26 RBIs.

As a junior, Roberts had a useful .465 on-base percentage and .296 batting average. Hefner batted .304, Sager hit .305, Gross .242, Dominguez .222 and Cole Smith .211.

With a mostly senior class pitching staff in 2024, the Cougars still return Gross and his 50.2 innings, Easton Pruitt (with a 2-0 record, 3.36 ERA and 25 innings from 2024) and Cole Smith.

Guerro was the lone returnee who showed much power, even though both Sager and Williams each hit a home run in 2024.

Jefferson has always known the sometimes infinite value of the stolen base, gleaning walks and hit batsmen, heads-up base running and finally exposing the opposition's pitchers to higher pitch counts.

Even in seasons where it doesn't reach the big-school state tournament, Jefferson rolls out a group of pitchers that don't allow many walks, base runners or lengthy times in between pitches.

The Cougars last won state championships in 2016 and 2015.

Last year's edition had a 25-13 record, leaving longtime coach John Lowery, Sr. with an overall lifetime record of 1,442 and 382 in his coaching career at Harpers Ferry High School and Jefferson High School. Jefferson had its first baseball season in 1973 and Lowery, Sr. has been the school's only coach in its 53 previous years of baseball.

AP PHOTO - Drake guard Isaia Howard (23) dunks over Missouri guard T.O. Barrett, right, during the first half of their first-round game in the NCAA Tournament on Thursday in Wichita, Kan.

WICHITA, Kan. — Bennett Stirtz scored 21 points and No. 11 seed Drake, a team relying heavily on Division II transfers, held on after blowing most of a 15-point lead to beat sixth-seeded Missouri 67-57 on Thursday night in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

Tavion Banks added 15 points and nine rebounds for the Bulldogs (31-3), who along with first-year coach Ben McCollum advanced to a second-round matchup with third-seeded Texas Tech or No. 14 seed UNC Wilmington on Saturday.

“We just fought. That's kind of what we have to do, is just continue to grind and compete,” said McCollum, who won four D-II national titles at Northwest Missouri State before taking the Drake job last April. “We have guys that want to do that.”

Missouri (22-12) grinded, too, reducing that 15-point deficit to one down the stretch. But the Tigers had expended too much energy, and Drake scored the next six points to take back control and put the game away.

Caleb Grill finished with 14 points to lead the Tigers. Tamar Bates had 10 before fouling out.

“It's a memorable season for our guys, a great accomplishment to say the least, but it was cut short. There's no doubt about it,” Missouri coach Dennis Gates said. “It's loser goes home, and we didn't do enough to come away with a win.”

As expected, the game was a stylistic clash: Drake and its nation-leading scoring defense trying to force a rock fight, and Missouri with its top-10 scoring offense trying to push the tempo whenever it had the chance.

There were very few until the second half.

The Bulldogs made every shot a chore, and at the other end, they patiently probed for openings. Usually it was Stirtz — one of the Northwest Missouri State quartet who followed McCollum to Drake — who was knocking down a 3 or driving to the rim.

The Missouri Valley champs forged a 30-23 halftime lead. And it appeared as if the small school from Des Moines, Iowa — with an enrollment of 4,774 — would be able to put the game away, extending the advantage to 43-28 with 12:40 to go.

That's when Missouri began to press in an attempt to push the pace, and the Bulldogs struggled to deal with it. At one point, the Tigers ripped off 10 consecutive points, closing within 52-51 on Mark Mitchell's free throw with 4:28 remaining.

That was the closest Missouri would get down the stretch.

“Drake answered it,” Gates said. “I credit them, because they settled back in. We just didn't execute. We got the shots. We had an opportunity to tie the game; that's why we were down one. … We just didn't make enough shots or have enough stops.”

Takeaways

Drake went 12 of 24 from the foul line but survived to snap a four-game losing streak in first-round NCAA Tournament games.

Missouri had lost four of its last five entering the tournament, and the Tigers sure looked like a slumping team in the first half. The result was a deficit that they were simply unable to overcome.

Up next

The Bulldogs will play Saturday for a spot in their first Sweet 16 since 1971.

After a 2-1 away win over Italy in Milan in the first leg of their UEFA Nations League quarter-final on Thursday, Germany will be looking to finish the job in the second leg at the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund on Sunday.

Germany went behind to Sandro Tonali's early opener, but turned the game around after the break following a few tactical adjustments by coach Julian Nagelsmann.

Speaking after the win in Italy, Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann was quick to point out that it's only half time in the tie. He also hinted at making a few changes to his starting eleven for the return leg.

“The result is dangerous. We have a few ideas in our heads about what we can change. I'm not scared, but it will be exciting. The stadium is usually very loud. That will certainly be the case on Sunday too, which will help us,” he said.

Tim Kleindienst, who scored straight after coming on as a substitute at half-time for Jonathan Burkardt, could be handed a start on Sunday.

So could Nico Schlotterbeck, who replaced David Raum at left-back after an unimpressive first half from the Leipzig man.

Nadiem Amiri, who made a surprise start in a wide attacking midfield role, will compete with Jamie Leweling for a starting berth in Dortmund.

Raoul Bellanova and Samuele Ricci are alternatives to Matteo Politano and Nicolo Rovella should Luciano Spalletti decide to change his starting eleven.

BINGHAMTON — One by one, the empty possessions dwindled away for Jamestown in the closing minutes Thursday night.

A missed 3-pointer here.

A turnover there.

Two missed free throws.

All the while, Port Washington was taking advantage at the other end of the floor.

In the end, it spelled a 50-39 victory for the Vikings in a New York State Public High School Athletic Association Class AAA boys basketball semifinal at Visions Veterans Memorial Arena.

“They're a well-coached team. They got after it,” Jamestown senior Jaydian Johnson said postgame. “I don't think we played our best basketball tonight. Nothing was falling for us; just an off-day.”

The Section VIII champions ended the game on a 15-2 run to punch their ticket for today's 7:45 p.m. championship game against Section II's Shaker.

For the Red & Green, their season ends with a 19-4 record, including their 17th Section VI title and fifth Far West Regional crown, but short of the third state championship game appearance in program history.

“We played a pretty tough schedule in Western New York, certainly some tough teams. But maybe they were a little bit different type of teams than these guys,” Jamestown head coach Billy Miley said. “We try to get ready, but when it comes down to the game, you have to be able to execute. They did a better job of that today.”

Jamestown led after a 9-7 first quarter, but Port Washington took a 26-20 lead into halftime, thanks in large part to 9-of-13 shooting from the floor during the second quarter.

“I think it was just losing guys … not being 100% aware at all times,” Miley said. “They took advantage of that.”

The Vikings' Kenny Daly – who finished with a game-high 23 points – then hit a 3-pointer early in the third quarter to give his team its largest lead to that point at 29-21.

But the Red & Green fought back and Elijah Farmer's free throw with 3.9 seconds left in the third quarter made it a three-point game.

Jamestown's Gavin Johnson opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer to tie the game at 35-all, but that would end up being the Red & Green's only field goal of the final eight minutes. 

Jaydian Johnson hit a pair of free throws with 6:10 remaining to give Jamestown a 37-35 lead, before things fell apart for the Section VI champs.

Port Washington got two offensive rebounds on its next possession and Daly eventually made a free throw to make it 37-36 before Izaias Clemmons scored through contact to give his team a 38-37 advantage with 5:06 remaining.

“We like more possessions and pushing the ball a little bit,” Miley said. “They do a good job of taking that away defensively and being very deliberate at the offensive end, so we're not getting as many possessions as we normally would like.”

That contact was Farmer's fourth foul and then, on Jamestown's next trip down the floor before Miley could put in a substitute, Farmer picked up his fifth foul on an offensive rebound attempt.

“We were having a hard time stopping them before that,” Miley said of Farmer's exit. “Obviously we certainly are better with him on the floor.”

The Vikings' Chase Kovar made it 40-37 on their next trip before the Red & Green's Carson Panebianco sank two free throws to make it 40-39.

Those ended up being the final points Jamestown would score.

The Red & Green went 1 of 14 from the field, including 1 of 9 from 3-point range, in the fourth quarter. They missed their final eight shots, while Port Washington went 6 of 8 at the foul line to put the game away.

“They are really tough defensively. They make you work for everything,” Miley said. “We got a couple of decent looks and weren't fortunate enough to knock them down.”

“They play hard, they don't gamble and they take smart shots. … They were just knocking shots down,” Jaydian Johnson added. “We didn't play our brand of basketball tonight. We live and we learn.”

As the final horn sounded, junior Jericho Thagard was consoled by Jaydian Johnson and Panebianco, Jamestown's only two seniors.

Undoubtedly, the Red & Green's 10 juniors and two sophomores will set a goal nothing short of returning to Binghamton next March.

“We keep getting to this point and not being able to get over the hump,” Miley said. “There are a lot of guys who want to get back here.”

Even though he won't be part of it, Jaydian Johnson was sure of it.

“They'll be back next year.”

NOTES: Jaydian Johnson had 15 points and eight rebounds; Farmer had 8 points and four rebounds; junior Dominic Gonzalez had 7 points and five rebounds; and Panebianco had seven rebounds for Jamestown, which finished 13 of 49 from the field, including 3 of 22 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 11 times. … Daly had 23 points and five rebounds; Clemmons had 12 points and 12 rebounds; and Ryan Shanahan had five rebounds and four assists for Port Washington, which shot 19 of 42 from the field, including 3 of 18 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 13 times. … Shaker forced overtime in the first semifinal on Bless Demand's 3-pointer with 3 seconds remaining in regulation and then outscored Newburgh 12-3 in overtime.

Mar 21, 2025

MILWAUKEE — Iowa State won't have second-leading scorer Keshon Gilbert for the NCAA Tournament, but the Cyclones may be getting another guard back.

Tamin Lipsey expressed cautious optimism that he'd be available Friday when Iowa State, the No. 3 seed in the South Region, faces Lipscomb (25-9) in the first round. Lipsey had missed Iowa State's Big 12 Tournament quarterfinal loss to BYU with a groin issue.

“It's felt a lot better every day,” Lipsey said Thursday. “So I'm expecting to go out there and play, and I hope I can go out and feel the best I can. … I feel like I'm trending in a positive direction and feel good about it.”

Lipsey's return would be a major boost to the Iowa State defense. The 6-foot-1 guard has a school-record 235 career steals and is averaging 10.8 points and 3.2 assists this season.

Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said Lipsey is playing as well as he has in his three seasons with the Cyclones. Lipsey played through a fractured thumb earlier this season, and teammates have praised his toughness.

“Tough as nails, as they would say,” guard Curtis Jones said. “He'll play through a lot, especially now that it's March. It's win or go home. I feel like he would play through a broken bone. As long as he can get out there and run and pass, I think that's all he needs to do to make an impact on a team.”

Iowa State (24-9) is adapting to the absence of Gilbert, who had a team-high 4.1 assists per game. His 13.4 points per game rank behind only Jones' 17.1.

Gilbert already had missed four of Iowa State's last seven games. After missing the regular-season finale against Kansas State, Gilbert returned to play 10 1/2 minutes in a Big 12 Tournament victory over Cincinnati, but he was held out for the BYU game and won't play again this season.

The injuries have tested Iowa State's depth, one of its hallmarks. The Cyclones are one of only 31 Division I teams — and 11 in this tournament — to have four players scoring at least 10 points per game.

“On any good team, when you have adversity and challenges it's important, the next-man-up mentality” Otzelberger said. “And you gain strength collectively from the group and pouring into the group. Our team has done a fantastic job of that, and that's allowed them to continue to elevate.”

Gilbert's injury has resulted in an expanded role for Nate Heise, a Northern Iowa transfer getting his first taste of March Madness as a fifth-year senior. The 6-4 guard has played as many as 30 minutes five times this season, four of them in Iowa State's last seven games.

“Obviously you want everyone to be at full strength, but that's just not the case right now,” Heise said. “It's been a little different role for everybody. It's been a little different compared to the beginning of the year, but I've really enjoyed it. I look forward to it.”

Lipscomb coach Lennie Acuff didn't expect Iowa State's injuries to play a major role in Friday's game. Acuff recalled how his own team responded when forward Dylan Faulkner, who averaged 10.5 points per game, broke his foot in January, ending his season.

“We just had other guys step up,” Acuff said. “A lot of times when you have a proud program that's built on winning and culture, that's what happens. We don't expect anything less than their best tomorrow.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news","City to scrutinize TMH ownership, explore possible sale after request to tweak governance","https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/2025/03/21/tallahassee-memorial-healthcare-could-city-sell-hospital-property/82571100007/","Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:39:51 GMT","

City leaders will explore the possibility of a sale of Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare property after hospital officials proposed restructuring its governance agreement in a way that city staff say would decrease city authority and oversight in broader strategic decisions affecting the healthcare system. 

To position itself for continued growth and new partnerships, the nonprofit, community based hospital wants to create a new health system board whose members wouldn't require ""city confirmation authority"" to oversee the broader TMH health system. The existing board would continue to manage the hospital's day-to-day operations, according to city agenda materials.

The move touched off an extraordinary staff report on the city's relationship with the hospital, potential acquisitions that could transform TMH in the future and a deep dive into the ownership arrangement to ""ensure the city's interests are preserved."" 

""In light of TMH's proposal, staff will evaluate whether continued city ownership remains in the city's long-term interest,"" according to the report in commission agenda materials for next week's meeting. ""As part of this analysis, staff will also explore the feasibility and potential advantages of a possible sale of the property, considering all available options and approaches."" 

While many were surprised to see the issue pop up on the agenda, City Manager Reese Goad said he added the informational item for city commissioners review because many people don't realize the city owns all of the land, buildings, equipment and other assets associated with TMH — including the fixtures inside the hospital such as beds, X-ray machines and more.

The city's largest healthcare provider began as a city-run hospital in the 1940s and transitioned into an independent, nonprofit healthcare system under a long-term lease agreement with the City.

""I think it's healthy for us to all understand the history and the current status,"" Goad told the Tallahassee Democrat. ""That'll enable a fuller discussion for the city commission to evaluate changing the board status, and really the evolution of health care in our region.""

While the city agenda item brought up the specter of a possible acquisition of the hospital by a for-profit or nonprofit entity in line with industry trends, TMH officials said there are ""no current plans to transition to a different ownership or operational model.""

TMH Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Stephanie Derzypolski said the request for the governance change was partially influenced by the hospital's partnership with FSU Health but mostly driven by its substantial growth over the years, which includes a new healthcare campus taking shape in Panama City.

""In fact, one goal of our relationship with FSU is to preserve our independence and avoid acquisition by a large for-profit hospital system,"" Derzypolski said in an emailed statement.

The hospital serves 21 counties across North Florida and Georgia, according to agenda materials. It has been in a long-term lease agreement with the city since 1979 when the city selected the non-profit group to control hospital operations. Goad said the rent has been set at $1 a year since the two parties entered into the lease.

""This structure allows the City to retain ownership and oversight while enabling TMH to expand its medical services and partnerships,"" agenda materials say.

Derzypolski clarified that the hospital has no intentions of terminating its lease with the city, or asking the city to consider selling.

""TMH's request to the city was simply for confirmation of changes to its governing documents in accordance with the provisions of the lease,"" she said.

If the governance is updated, this will not change ""the city's ownership of the property or TMH's responsibility for operating the hospital and its related facilities,"" Derzypolski said.

Goad said the city will have to fully look at the ramifications and conduct a legal analysis before any decision is made, but he said he wouldn't assume that TMH is looking to pull away from city ownership: ""I don't think that'll happen.""

However, the city agenda item points to a steady decline in independent and nonprofit hospitals due to financial pressure, forcing many to ""merge with larger health systems, including university-affiliated hospitals, larger nonprofit entities, and for-profit entities.""

It also highlights UF Health Shands and its expansion through ""strategic acquisitions and developments."" But Goad said while the comparison of the Gainesville-based hospital system to the TMH-FSU Health partnership is warranted, ""it might be premature.""

According to agenda materials, the city ""retains ownership of the land, buildings, equipment, and other assets associated"" with TMH. Goad clarified that assets include everything but vehicles, yet the city has no financial obligation if something needs to be repaired or replaced, meaning there's no impact to the city's budget.

Everything is entirely paid for by TMH, he said.

When the two parties created a long-term lease agreement in 1979, everything on the property was leased to TMH. But even though everything is the city's property, the city cannot take items from the hospital.

""We cannot intervene in their operation,"" Goad said.

The city manger expects a robust discussion at the Wednesday, March 26, city commission meeting at 3 p.m. at City Hall.

""It could be a meaningful milestone in health care in Tallahassee,"" he said.

After the article published, City Commissioner Jack Porter reached out to the Tallahassee Democrat and said she has “no interest in the City selling TMH.”

                        Let Healthcare Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.
                    
                
            



The massive PBM is pivoting to a cost-based reimbursement model, which it says will reduce variation in how pharmacies are paid. Pharmacy groups say that depends on the specifics of Optum Rx's plan.

Pharmacy operators say the existing reimbursement model is fundamentally broken. Pharmacies are generally paid for drugs based on a variety of complex factors beyond cost, which results in them relying on higher rates for some medications to offset losses on others — a delicate balancing act that has become more difficult as pricier branded drugs enter the market.

As a result, pharmacies are often reimbursed less than it costs to acquire and dispense drugs, contributing to losses for many operators. Many pharmacies blame PBMs like Optum Rx, because they reimburse pharmacies for dispensing drugs to their members.

PBMs, on the other hand, pass the blame along to drug manufacturers for setting high list prices, arguing that price hikes result in pharmacies having to pay more to acquire drugs in the first place.

Still, major PBMs are taking actions they say will make pharmacy operations more tenable as they face rising public pressure to lower drug prices.

With its announcement Thursday, Optum Rx is following in the footsteps of pharmacy juggernaut CVS Health, which in 2023 said its pharmacies would move to a cost-based model. Cigna-owned Express Scripts also offers a cost-based pricing option.

Under such models, pharmacies are generally paid the drug's acquisition cost, plus a defined markup and occasionally an additional dispensing fee.

However, it's not clear how Optum Rx plans to structure its model, including how it will calculate any additional markup for the pharmacy.

When asked for more details, a spokesperson said Optum Rx's approach “incorporates multiple market indices and data to inform how drugs will be reimbursed.”

Changes to Optum Rx's reimbursement structure have major implications for U.S. pharmacies. Last year, the PBM managed $178 billion in pharmaceutical spending for more than 61 million people, according to a securities filing and information on the company's website.

Pharmacy groups said they welcome the change, but it's difficult to say how helpful it will be without more details.

“We have seen announcements like this in the past by PBMs that claim they want to work with independent pharmacies. Based on the results to date, some were obviously intended as political cover or public relations,” the National Community Pharmacists Association said in a statement.

“If this is a good-faith effort, it would be a good first step in reimbursing all independent pharmacies for the actual cost of acquiring drugs, plus the cost of counseling patients, serving patients, inventory, supplies, and other overhead. Otherwise, this will be another cost-shifting gambit that will leave independent pharmacies in the same position,” the NCPA continued.

The Optum Rx spokesperson did not respond directly to questions on how the reimbursement model will affect the PBM's finances, or whether it expected pharmacies would be paid more overall as a result.

“We expect these changes will rebalance reimbursement to promote long-term financial stability for pharmacies in our network,” they said. “When implementing cost-based reimbursement, a pharmacy may receive more for certain drugs and less for other drugs.”

Reimbursement pressures have contributed to notable upheaval for the pharmacy industry. In recent years, CVS has closed hundreds of underperforming locations, Rite Aid underwent a bankruptcy and Walgreens announced plans to go private in a deal with a private equity company. Meanwhile, some regional chains and independent operators have gone out of business entirely.

All told, the closures are contributing to pharmacy deserts. Nationally, 15.8 million people, or 5% of all people in the U.S., live in areas without convenient access to a pharmacy, according to a study from last year.

Along with PBM's impact on pharmacies, lawmakers and antitrust regulators have also taken issue with how the middlemen negotiate savings with drugmakers, contributing to rising momentum in Washington to crack down on PBMs.

However, despite a plethora of bills on the Hill and litigation from the Federal Trade Commission, PBMs have yet to face concrete reform. Instead, major PBMs say they're responding to calls for change internally.

Optum Rx, for example, announced the pharmacy reimbursement change one day after it released plans to lower prior authorization requirements on dozens of drugs.

The PBM also recently committed to pass through 100% of rebates it receives from drugmakers to its customers.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Consumers gravely concerned about their healthcare are sounding the alarm after Jefferson Health, our region's largest health system, announced earlier this week that it was unable to finalize a new contract with Cigna Insurance.

Emergency care remains in-network for all Cigna members and patients with Medicare Advantage plans are also unaffected. However, Jefferson Health is now out-of-network for Cigna members who get insurance through their employers.

""I feel frustrated and concerned. My wife's healthcare providers are all through Jefferson,"" David Rosenberg, of Fairmount, told Action News. ""She has a number of appointments coming up, including her mammogram.""

Rosenberg says his wife's family has a history of breast cancer, so she is very vigilant about her checkups.

He received a letter from his children's pediatrician's practice that it is now out-of-network too.

The Rosenbergs don't feel comfortable switching away from any of their trusted providers.

""They know our family and they know their medical histories,"" David said.

Jefferson Health said rising costs made its previous contract with Cigna unsustainable.

""Since 2020, Cigna's reimbursement rates have increased only around 3%, while the costs of providing care have increased more than 20%,"" said Dr. Edmund Pribitkin, Jefferson Health's Chief Physician.

Cigna claims ""Jefferson Health chose to leave our network due to their unreasonable rate hike demands that would raise health costs for the people we serve.""

""The first thing that you can do is pick up the phone, call the insurance company, and ask them if you qualify for something called a continuing care patient,"" said Lisa Gill, with Consumer Reports.

Gill says pregnant women and cancer patients are examples of people who could qualify and receive about a 90-day window to continue their care with their current provider.

She says other patients should ask, ""Will they allow you to at least submit claims that are out-of-network? Would any of it be covered? A lot of plans will cover 40%, 50%, sometimes even more than that.""

In the meantime, Jefferson is pleading with patients and providers to contact Cigna directly to express their concerns. Cigna says its customer service advocates are available 24/7 at 1-800-244-6224 and customers can find in-network hospitals and providers on their website or app.

Both Cigna and Jefferson said they are committed to continuing negotiations and it is still possible they reach an agreement.

Some may remember Tower Health hospitals and doctors were out-of-network for Cigna members for four months last year, but those parties did finally agree to a new contract.

Action News will keep you posted on what happens in the case of Cigna and Jefferson Health.

Cigna Healthcare's full statement to Action News:""Unfortunately Jefferson Health chose to leave our network due to their unreasonable rate hike demands that would raise health costs for the people we serve. Almost all our employer clients' benefits plans are self-funded, which means any increase in cost of care is paid directly by local employers, their employees and their families. We will continue to negotiate with Jefferson Health to reach a fair agreement that will keep health care affordable for patients. Our customer service advocates are available 24/7/365 to ease the transition and guide patients to high-quality, local in-network care.""

Jefferson Health's full statement: ""Despite our best efforts to reach a fair agreement, Jefferson Health and Cigna have been unable to finalize a new contract. As a result, as of March 15, 2025, Jefferson Health will be considered out-of-network for Cigna commercial members.

""We understand that this news may cause concern, and we want to reassure our patients that we remain committed to providing high-quality care. We continue to negotiate in good faith with Cigna to reach a resolution that is fair and sustainable for our patients, providers, and community.

""For more than 20 years, Jefferson Health has been a trusted provider for Cigna members. However, our current contract does not reflect the true cost of delivering high-quality care.  Since 2020, Cigna's reimbursement rates have increased by only 3%, while the Hospital Wage Index has risen 20% and CPI-U has increased 21%.  Rising costs for labor, medical supplies, and operations make it unsustainable to continue at these below-market rates.  Other insurers in our communities have recognized these economic realities, and Jefferson has successfully reached agreements with them.

""Emergency care remains in-network for all Cigna members, regardless of contract status.

""Some patients may qualify for Transition of Care programs to maintain in-network benefits. Please check with Cigna.

""Many Cigna plans include out-of-network benefits that may allow continued access to Jefferson providers.

""We encourage Cigna members to contact Cigna directly to understand their coverage options and advocate for continued access to Jefferson Health providers.

""Our priority remains delivering the highest quality care while securing fair agreements that support our mission. We appreciate your patience and support as we work toward a resolution.""","{'href': 'https://6abc.com', 'title': '6ABC Philadelphia'}"

At NVIDIA's GTC 2025 event in San Jose, California, this week – the so-called ""Super Bowl of AI"" – the chip giant announced multiple partnerships leveraging the power of AI to turbocharge applications in life sciences and healthcare, including a partnership with GE HealthCare and Google.

NVIDIA and GE HealthCare are developing AI-powered autonomous imaging solutions, beginning with X-ray and ultrasound technologies.

By leveraging NVIDIA's Isaac for Healthcare and Cosmos platforms, GE HealthCare plans to train and test autonomous imaging systems in a virtual environment before real-world deployment.

The initiative will initially focus on automating repetitive tasks in X-ray imaging, enabling care teams to spend more time on complex cases.

In ultrasound, AI-driven automation could help alleviate the physical strain on sonographers and improve imaging consistency.

""We are excited about the potential of autonomous X-ray and ultrasound as we focus on unlocking smarter, more automated solutions that enhance efficiency and ease the burden on healthcare professionals,"" Roland Rott, president and CEO of Imaging at GE HealthCare, said in a statement.

NVIDIA's GH200 and GB200 superchips, combined with CUDA-X libraries, are set to accelerate AI applications in healthcare and life sciences by delivering significant computational gains.

The latest architecture can speed up engineering simulations by up to 11x and support calculations five times larger than traditional accelerated computing platforms. These advances could drive breakthroughs in biomedical research, medical imaging, and drug discovery.

NVIDIA's cuDSS library is already enhancing large-scale engineering simulations, such as electromagnetic modeling and computational drug design, by making efficient use of shared CPU-GPU memory.

This technology, integrated into platforms like Ansys HFSS and Altair OptiStruct, allows researchers to run more complex simulations faster.

""The ability to solve massive computational problems without being constrained by memory limitations is a game changer for healthcare research and life sciences,"" Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, said in a statement.

NVIDIA and Alphabet's Google are deepening their AI partnership to accelerate advancements in healthcare, life sciences, and drug discovery by leveraging NVIDIA's GPUs and AI platforms, including Omniverse, Cosmos, and Isaac, to drive breakthroughs in medical research, robotics, and scientific computing.

Isomorphic Labs, a Google DeepMind-founded company focused on AI-driven drug discovery, has built a drug design engine on Google Cloud using NVIDIA GPUs, aiming to scale and refine AI models that could significantly improve therapeutic development.

In addition to drug research, the partnership will enhance Google Cloud's AI infrastructure, making NVIDIA's Blackwell-based GPUs available for computational workloads across biotech and medical imaging.

""AI and accelerated computing are transforming the future of healthcare, from drug discovery to robotics and cloud-based research,"" Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA said in a statement. ""Together with Google, we are pushing the limits of AI to solve the most pressing challenges in medicine and science.""

Robert Slepin is chief digital officer and senior vice president at Markham, Ontario-based SE Health and emeritus CIO adviser at EHR giant Epic. SE Health is one of the largest diversified home health organizations in Canada that includes a dedicated research center, health career college, futures lab and global enterprise. The provider organization has facilitated transformation in the areas of aging, education, Indigenous health and end-of-life care.

Slepin has more than 35 years in health IT. He said a combination of being in the right place at the right time and several key decisions were pivotal in giving him opportunities to gain practical experience in digital transformation and in shaping his career as a healthcare CIO and digital advisor.

Past employers and clients have included Johns Hopkins Medicine International, Stanford Children's, Sutter Health, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Alberta Health Services, Hamilton Health Sciences, University Health Network and others. His experience includes serving as a health system CIO and as CIO or program director and/or advisor for numerous health information system companies, including ones specializing in EHR, ERP, AI, analytics, digital health and more.

A specialty over the past fourteen years has been advising and helping healthcare organizations to plan, execute, oversee, and realize value and return on investment from large-scale Epic, digital health and enterprise IT projects, enabling transformation.

Today, Slepin is working on a major digital transformation project at his new employer, SE Health. Healthcare IT News sat down with him to discuss aspects of digital transformation efforts that provider organizations don't quite have a firm grasp on to begin with, the primary technologies involved in digital transformation, how to organize such a comprehensive effort as digital transformation, and his transformation effort at SE Health.

Q. What would you say is the most important thing hospitals and health systems should know about digital transformation efforts that perhaps they don't quite have a firm grasp on to begin with?

A. There are so many things hospitals and health systems should know about digital transformation and don't know – or know and don't do – that it is a challenge to call out one thing alone for them to focus on getting a better grasp. Transformation can be extremely complex and complicated, especially the larger and more complex the domain you have in mind.

Accordingly, there is not one thing to be done; there are numerous things to be done and many of them at the same time, and there are local nuances, interacting effects and environmental changes along the way that causes ""best practices"" not to necessarily work the way you think they will.

Perhaps the most important thing to have a firm grasp on, therefore, is that you cannot have as firm a grasp on transformational programs as you do on day-to-day operations or simpler optimization projects.

By their nature, digital transformations are difficult and unpredictable and will require an adaptive, learning mindset; humility; and curiosity. Textbook approaches won't work off-the-shelf; adaptation is required. Experimenting along the way is necessary for ongoing learning and adjusting course based on real-time feedback.

Digital transformation is an extremely tall challenge especially if you view it in the way McKinsey describes as ""the rewiring of an organization, with the goal of creating value by continuously deploying tech at scale"" – and considering a need to keep one foot firmly planted in today's operating environment to maintain stability while you simultaneously are shaking things up while reimagining the future.

A critical success factor in leading a digital transformation is the guidance and support of one or more executive sponsors. If the aim is a strategic, enterprise, long-term reimagination of the business, it must be led from the top of the organization: The CEO should be responsible and accountable to create a compelling, clear vision for the direction and collaborate with their leadership team to gain support for the new direction across the entire organization.

Without the active, visible sponsorship of the top leaders of the organization, supported by the board, the process will at best likely be sub-optimal and outcomes fall short. In a worst-case scenario, the transformation will be a disaster and the initiative canceled.

If the aim of the digital transformation is less ambitious, for example, to transform or optimize a business process and not the entire business, executive sponsorship still is crucial. In this case, the sponsorship might not require the CEO to be the cheerleader but rather another member of the C-suite holding accountability for that domain of the business.

Q. What are the primary technologies involved in digital transformation, and who should be leading the way with each?

A. The technologies involved in digital transformation will vary depending on the scope of the initiative. Several examples of technologies that might be involved in transformation include:

Enterprise applications, such as EHR, ERP and CRM software

Bolt-on applications, such as third-party software connected to an EHR, ERP or CRM

Cloud computing, for example, network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable resources enabling users to self-provision on-demand

Platform-as-a-service, essentially a cloud system that includes hardware, software and infrastructure, to develop, run and manage applications

Digital front door, essentially a patient experience platform provided by an EHR vendor, another vendor, or custom-developed in house or with a vendor

Artificial intelligence, such as machine learning, generative AI and agentic AI

Internet of things, essentially biometric devices connected to patients in their homes or while on the go

Mobile devices, for example, handheld devices; wearable devices on body, in visual field or over ears; vendor apps; or custom-built apps

Automation, such as robotic process automation and more modern AI platforms and tools that go beyond traditional RPA capabilities

Digital twins, essentially digital simulations of patients moving through facilities to model and improve flow or twin of a human body and genome to be more precise in diagnosis and personalizing treatment

Leadership for each technology, project and/or program will depend on the organization. Smaller hospitals and healthcare organizations might have a single tech executive in charge of planning and delivering the system, for example, a CIO, CDIO, chief digital transformation officer or CDO.

Larger enterprises will likely have one or more additional positions as part of the broader transformational leadership team. For example, CTO, chief applications officer, CAIO, CISO and chief analytics officer. In all cases, it is crucial to have senior business leaders who are co-leading and/or sponsoring or co-sponsoring, at the executive level, any transformational initiative.

Unless the transformation is extremely narrow and impacts only the technology team, business leaders will be critical to partnering with the technology chief(s) in leading change. The chief human resources officer, COO and CFO are some of the executive officers who you would expect to see participating in key leadership roles.

In healthcare, other senior leaders essential to collaborating with technology and business leaders to imagine and make change happen include titles such as CMO, CNO, CHIO, CMIO, CNIO and chief practice information officer.

Q. How do you organize such a comprehensive and wide-ranging effort as digital transformation?

A. Critical success factors, in my view, include leadership from the top; establishing cross-functional teams with a clear vision and mission; linkage between these teams and the rest of the organization; and a transformation management office to keep everyone organized and synchronized.

I would make the teams as small as possible to be efficient and nimble, but they should be representative of the groups that have a stake in the change. Some leaders abide by the two-pizza rule made famous by Jeff Bezos; I would advise not to follow this rule strictly in a hospital or healthcare setting.

Engaging people is critical; if you artificially constrain the size of a team to, let's say, seven people when the size and complexity of the population being affected is not well represented by this small group, you run the risk of some if not many groups feeling disengaged in the process and this issue will come back and bite you later.

For example, if your academic health sciences center has 40 clinical subspecialties across a dozen medical and surgical departments, and you populate your provider advisory council with only seven physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants to guide a massive clinical transformation – good luck to you! I think that's too small a number for this kind of organization in this context.

To tailor these key ingredients into a form that works for a specific organization, there are numerous ways that companies can organize the details of their digital transformation initiatives, depending upon the objectives, scope, structure and culture of the organization, among other factors.

Many hospitals and healthcare organizations have recent experience, are currently implementing or planning to install a modern EHR system as an enabler for transforming the experiences of patients, providers and health professionals with an aim to improve the safety, efficiency, quality and experience of patient care while establishing a foundation for ongoing improvement and innovation.

These kinds of programs are examples of a type of digital transformation from which healthcare organizations can learn to determine what works well, what does not work well and what they should consider adjusting to improve how they organize for future efforts.

Some hospitals and healthcare organizations desire to set a higher bar and truly reimagine the experience of patients, families, providers and other stakeholders in a broader digital transformation that will be core to the business strategy – and not be just a one-time project or ongoing program.

These care providers should be open to questioning and changing everything, thinking differently and aiming to create entirely new, better models of care delivery, more efficient, engaging end-to-end processes and journeys, and shifting focus from sick care to preventive health and wellness. They should think differently about how they organize their efforts going forward and not do things the way they always have.

I would recommend looking outside of your own walls and outside healthcare for inspiring examples of successful companies across industries and across the world to learn from and inform the design of your transformation initiative. Getting outside perspectives from management consultants, advisors, peers, customers, patients and other stakeholders can inform your planning.

Q. Currently you are working on one of Canada's largest healthcare providers' digital transformation strategy, which includes telehealth triage, virtual care, transitions of care, hospital-at-home, home care, remote patient monitoring, seniors' living and other initiatives. Please talk a bit about this project and some of the advice you've given.

A. After serving as board advisor for a digital transformation initiative at SE Health, I became their CDO and senior vice president earlier this year. SE Health is among Canada's largest not-for-profit social enterprises, providing healthcare services across home and community care, long-term care, acute care and primary care. Its customers include governments, regional health authorities, hospitals, the seniors' living sector, community organizations and consumers.

Project Acorn, as the digital transformation project is named, aims to revitalize SE through people-focused transformation of technology, processes and how we work together. Its scope is expansive – including health records, patient relationship management, finance, payroll, human resources, enterprise service management, and cybersecurity, privacy and risk management.

It's early days for Project Acorn, which had been in the initiation phase during 2023-24 and is formally kicking off this month, following the conclusion of vendor selections and contracting with several partners for software and professional services to assist with systems integration.

Of course, at this stage of inception, there are no outcomes to report yet. But I am happy to say there is extremely strong commitment and active, visible leadership from the board of directors, CEO, senior leadership team and people across the company.

SE has a clear, compelling vision for the future, has a transformation plan and roadmap, is up-staffing and up-skilling, has formed a governance structure and project teams, has established a transformation management office and has partnered with systems integrators.

SE is well organized and beginning to move forward with reimagining care at home, people and finance modernization, enhancing our privacy, security and risk management, and improving the experience of clients and team members across the organization.

The technology SE has chosen is new and incredibly exciting – but the real magic is the way that people across SE are coming together to redesign so many aspects of the way we do things to create a better future for SE and, most important, to improve the health and lives of those we serve across Canada and the U.S., and beyond through our research institute and social impact work.

Finding a lawyer for doctors: Do I need an employment contract lawyer? What do physician contracts include? How long are most physician contracts?

A health care attorney shares insights on navigating the complexities of doctor employment agreements and the importance of hiring a healthcare lawyer for contract review and negotiation. Guest Richard Levenstein, JD, attorney at law at Nason Yeager, discusses common issues in contracts, negotiation strategies, and the long-term implications of contract terms on a physician's career. AMA Chief Experience Officer Todd Unger hosts.

AMA membership offers unique access to savings and resources tailored to enrich the personal and professional lives of physicians, residents and medical students.

Levenstein: There is no hard-and-fast rule with regard to negotiating. The negotiations must be reasonable in nature. Asking for something that is unreasonable and that really can't be supported destroys one's credibility. 

Unger: Hello. And welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today, we're talking about some of the most common questions that physicians have about employment contracts. Our guest today is Richard Levenstein, attorney at law with Nason Yeager in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer in Chicago. Richard, we're glad to have you with us. 

Levenstein: And I'm happy to be here, Todd, and look forward to answering some questions that you may have for me today. 

Unger: Well, lots of questions from physicians about this particular topic, especially when they're getting their first job out of residency but beyond that as well. One of the most common questions that we hear is whether or not a physician should hire a lawyer to review the contracts that they receive. I imagine that you have some particular advice on that topic. What would it be? 

Levenstein: My advice would be to always hire a lawyer and a health care specialist attorney with regard to a physician's employment agreement, whether it's the first agreement out of residency or whether it's an agreement well into one's career. Representing yourself in a situation like that is not a particularly good idea, because without knowing what to look for in those agreements, it's very difficult to protect one's interests. 

Unger: So you obviously have a lot of experience in this particular topic, a person that would be great to talk to. But for the average physician out there who's looking to find a lawyer to review their contracts, how do they go about that? What's the best way for someone to look? What kind of qualifications should they be looking for? 

Levenstein: Several ways. The state bar associations, many of which have health care law sections, will have attorneys listed in the state under that specialty. Many states have health care law certification boards, meaning board certified in that specialty. 

The state medical societies will be aware of attorneys who specialize in health care. Local medical societies may have the same information. The American Society of Medical Association Counsel to which I belong, which is an organization of attorneys who represent physicians and represent medical societies at the national, state and local levels, also would be a particular source. 

So there are many sources in which one can look for a health care attorney. And you can also ask fellow physicians who have dealt with health care lawyers and their practices and experiences to make a recommendation of one that they've been happy with. 

Unger: Now, you see a lot of these contracts. I'm curious, just kind of at the top level, what are the kinds of common issues that people should really focus on? 

Levenstein: So the one issue that always jumps out at the page, and especially for that first contract for residents, is the number on the page of the salary or compensation, which, of course, is many times what a resident had just finished earning. That is not the most important part of the contract. What's behind the dollars is the most important part of the contract. 

And there are many issues which one needs to be aware. The term, length of the contract and the termination provisions need to be reviewed. We don't have time to go through the specific elements of those issues today. So I'm just going to name them so people will know what to look for when reviewing these contracts. 

Compensation formulas—whether the compensation is a guaranteed salary or a draw against productivity, very important, the benefits that are to be available to the employed physician pursuant to the agreement. Covenants not to compete, not to solicit, of significant importance with regard to what happens upon termination and what happens in the life of a physician in the event of termination. 

Fair market value clauses that would enable an employer to change the compensation amount based upon the fair market value of the compensation being paid, no longer being, in fact, fair market value, this is a very important clause, because one does not want to have a contract which has a clause that enables your compensation to be changed without safeguards. 

Coterminous clauses—those are clauses that, upon termination of the contract, require a physician to resign medical staff privileges they may hold in connection with that employment. Sign-on bonuses and relocation bonuses—not only the amounts of what is paid, but what the repayment clauses are in the event of termination and what the obligations to repay all or part of those funds are. 

Dispute resolution, very important—whether the contract calls for arbitration or litigation in the event of a dispute or requires mediation, I think mediation is a great clause to have. I'm not a fan of arbitration, particularly. I'm much more of a fan of litigation, where the procedural safeguards and due process rights are more protected. 

Arbitration is a private proceeding with limited protections. My advice to those who see an arbitration clause in their contract is that any clause should just state that in the event of a dispute, the parties may mutually agree to arbitrate but are not required to do so. 

Private equity—if you're in a private equity situation, there might be additional considerations to be concerned about. If you are going to own stock or other equity ownership, the terms of a shareholders or other agreement, which would be concomitant with the employment agreement, need to be looked at, the buy-in provisions into a private practice environment after a certain period of time as an employee, the outside activities that a physician might be enabled to engage in, in addition to what their duties are as a physician. 

Many physicians have outside activities they want to continue to engage in, such as teaching or testifying as an expert. And those contracts require those outside activities to be listed in specific nature in the contracts. 

Unger: Now, Richard, I'm going to just interrupt you for one second here. For anybody that wasn't convinced that they needed an attorney to look at their contract, your answer to this question pretty much spells that out. There is a lot to be concerned about. 

And I'm curious, in the scheme of things, how much flexibility do you find on the employer side to making adjustments to all of those dimensions that you talked about? And is there usually a difference between maybe a large institution and a smaller one in terms of that flexibility? 

Levenstein: There are many differences with regard to the ability to negotiate. First, starting with the area of specialization that the physician is practicing in. Whether or not they're in demand in that location gives them additional leverage, as opposed to one physician who is in a specialty that was not in such high demand. But there are certain provisions that if a reasonable approach is taken by the attorney, a knowledgeable attorney who knows how to approach these issues, there's no hard-and-fast rule with regards to negotiating. 

The negotiations must be reasonable in nature. Asking for something that is unreasonable and that can't be supported destroys one's credibility. For example, when dealing with a covenant not to compete, asking one to eliminate a covenant not to compete entirely, it's not a reasonable position because if they wanted to do that, they wouldn't have had it in the contract. 

Asking one to limit the applicability of that covenant not to compete, such as it should only apply in the event of a termination for cause by the employer or without cause by the employee, something reasonable, hard to say no to without giving up a position that the employer is being unreasonable. 

So if you can take a reasonable position that puts whoever you're negotiating with in an unreasonable position if they don't agree with what you're asking or flat out refuse to even discuss it is the way that I approach it, because I want the credibility with the other attorney and his or her client, that they know that I know where I'm coming from, and my client knows what he or she is looking for. And I get a better response with that attitude and that approach to negotiation. 

Unger: Where do you see the biggest gains between the original agreement or contract that gets put in front of a physician and the outcomes that you typically generate? 

Levenstein: Negotiating the covenant not to compete in any way that it can be limited, similar to what I just said, or the radius, the geographic radius, trying to limit it. And in larger institutions that have multiple locations, oftentimes they will try to use every location they have as a base for the radius. And so those kinds of considerations are really important. 

The compensation formula—extremely important in this regard. If you're on a guaranteed salary, you know you get paid a certain amount every year. But if you're on a productivity basis where you have a draw against productivity, if you do not make whatever the productivity level is, you can owe your employer money back. 

You never want to, if you can help it, have a client put into that position where they owe money back to their employer, because it means that the first money that you earn in paycheck or a portion of it goes to your employer before you take home money, because many of the contracts will provide as such. 

And so you want to be very careful as to what the productivity formula is if you have to agree to such a formula. And you want an example of how it works in the contract so that when the time comes and you are trying to verify whatever your client is being told as to what they owe or don't owe, you can plug those numbers into the formula. And you also want the right and the obligation on the part of the employer to provide all of the backup documentation used to make such calculations with regard to the productivity formula that is applied. Those are really important. 

Malpractice insurance, another important issue—the coverage while one is employed, if one is leaving a job, what we call nose insurance for that new employer to pay, tail insurance for the prior employer. That employee needs to be covered for claims made between the time they leave their employment and start the new employment. 

Similarly, on the way out, tail insurance, you want to talk to your new employer about tail insurance. And most importantly, who pays the cost of tail insurance, which can be very high. Ideally, you want the new employer to pay both the nose insurance, if the old employer is not paying it, and the tail insurance on the way out. Oftentimes you can only get one, and anything you can get towards payment of those costs from your employer is a gain and a win. 

The coterminous provision is important, too. A physician who gives up voluntarily medical staff privileges at a hospital in connection with his or her employment most likely is giving it up at a hospital that the employer has some control over. And if you're staying in the area because you can, applying for privileges at that hospital or new because you had to resign may be a difficult task because of that employer's control and influence at that hospital. So I try to negotiate out coterminous provisions if at all possible. 

Unger: Now, that's a lot to think about. I'm curious, is there any difference between the types of factors that you're talking about for, say, somebody coming out of residency versus a physician that's kind of well into their career and looking at a change? 

Levenstein: Sure. The person well out of the career first is generally someone who's more financially secure, doesn't necessarily have student loans that are outstanding and have to be repaid, and their economic situation is more stable than a resident who comes out of residency with student loans, oftentimes a young family and the obligations that go with that and who are more inclined to look at the financial aspects of the contract and maybe not concern themselves with the other elements of it unless someone has pointed them out to them, as I just have done this morning, this afternoon.

And the economic situation or the economic standing of the two physicians in those categories is an important factor that sometimes drives negotiations in many ways. But the basic elements of the contract that I described are common, whether it's the first contract or the last or middle contract. 

With this exception, the first contract that a resident signs can oftentimes be the most important he or she signs, because it can set the tone not only for their career, but for their lives going forward, at least, for the length of term of that first contract. 

Unger: That's really good advice. One kind of nosy question. I mean, residents are coming out of their years of school and training. And they are worrying about outsized student debt, things of that nature. Is this a big package do you afford, this kind of negotiation for a contract? And how do they stack that up against the value? 

Levenstein: Let me answer that this way. I think—and I'm not here to toot my horn as a lawyer. But I think that the money that is spent on a health care lawyer negotiating these contracts is the best money that a physician spends, because it can alter, as I said, at all levels, not only their career path, but their lives and lifestyle, because oftentimes the covenant not to compete can limit their ability to leave, depending on what triggers it, and keep them in the location where they are because of the economic factors involved and the fear of having to move and start again. 

Also, young physicians, in some instances, might have offers to repay their student loans by their employers. And again, that's not free. It comes with repayment clauses that reduce the amount of repayment by the term that one stays in that employment proportionately so that if it's a three-year contract and you leave after one year, you still can owe two-thirds of whatever was paid to pay those loans off back to your employer. 

So again, many factors all need to be looked at together. And a lawyer with experience in negotiating these contracts, a health care lawyer is important. And there are lawyers who negotiate contracts all the time that are not health care contracts. I can tell you that employee positions contracts are far different than any other employee contracts because of the many issues that I've just gone through and described for you. 

Unger: Richard, this has been so helpful in understanding what it takes to really evaluate those contracts and make sure that you're protected for the future. Thank you so much for joining us and helping physicians navigate what is clearly a complicated process.

A vulnerability in ChatGPT that was identified last year is being used by would-be cyberattackers to target security flaws in artificial intelligence systems, with the healthcare industry one of the top targets, according to a report from Veriti.

Of the organizations analyzed, 35% are unprotected due to misconfigurations in intrusion prevention system (IPS), Web application firewall (WAF), and firewall settings. This vulnerability, despite being classified as medium severity, has already been weaponized in real-world attacks, the report found.

""No vulnerability is too small to matter,"" the authors wrote. ""Attackers will exploit any weakness they can find.""

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

The investigation found that in one week, multiple parties attempted more than 10,000 cyberattack attempts. 

Medium-severity vulnerabilities still pose a risk, said Veriti, because security teams often prioritize patching only critical and high-severity vulnerabilities. But attackers exploit whatever works, regardless of ranking, and a once-ignored vulnerability can quickly become a favorite avenue of attack.

The issue has captured the attention of the American Hospital Association, which said that such cyberattacks could lead to data breaches, unauthorized transactions, regulatory penalties and reputational damage for healthcare institutions.

""This could allow an attacker to steal sensitive data or impact the availability of the AI tool,"" Scott Gee, AHA deputy national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, said in a statement. ""This highlights the importance of integrating patch management into a comprehensive governance plan for AI when it is implemented in a hospital environment. The fact that the vulnerability is a year old and a proof of concept for exploitation has been published for some time is also a good reminder of the importance of timely patching of software.""

Veriti said the next steps for security teams are to check their IPS, WAF, and Firewall configurations for protection against CVE-2024-27564, monitor logs for attack attempts from known attacker IPs, and prioritize AI-related security gaps in risk assessments.

THE LARGER TREND

A number of cyberattacks have affected healthcare organizations in recent years. The most notable cyberattack of 2024 was the one that targeted Change Healthcare, which. according to the HIPAA Journal, compromised the protected health information of at least 100 million people.

This represents a third of the population in the United States and makes the data breach the largest known breach at a HIPAA-regulated entity. The previous record was set by Anthem in 2015 in an attack affecting 78.8 million individuals, the report said.

A June 2024 KnowBe4 report showed the global healthcare sector experienced 1,613 cyberattacks per week in the first three quarters of 2023, nearly four times the global average, and a significant increase from the same period the previous year. This surge has contributed to a steep rise in cyberattack costs for healthcare organizations, with the average breach cost nearing $11 million – more than three times the global average – making healthcare the costliest sector for cyberattacks.

Ransomware attacks have dominated, accounting for over 70% of successful cyberattacks on healthcare organizations in the past two years.

Circular Protocol, Arculus by CompoSecure and IT Lab said Thursday (March 20) that they plan to launch a blockchain-compliant ecosystem for healthcare providers in the U.S. market in the second quarter.

The companies' solution will integrate into clinical networks and serve as the secure passkey for recording, managing and safeguarding healthcare data within facilities using the MedTech device, according to a Thursday (March 20) press release.

The solution will be enabled by the Circular blockchain and by security and software offerings from Arculus by CompoSecure and IT Lab, according to the release.

In use, the ecosystem's solution will include a physical card holding a private key that will enable authorized administrators, operators and patients to digitally sign off procedures, exams and other transactions on the blockchain by simply tapping the card on their computer, per the release.

“Tech needs to be invisible and easy to use while delivering the benefits of secure and immutable records on a public registry, so the rights of medical institutions and patients are protected, and their data safely stored,” Dr. Gianluca De Novi, founder and CEO at Circular Protocol, said in the release.

Blockchain has numerous potential benefits to serve the unique needs of healthcare and other regulated industries that must adhere to numerous requirements, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence and Solana collaboration, “Blockchain's Benefits for Regulated Industries.”

The report found that blockchain enables robust know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) by verifying identities in real time and providing an immutable record of data and transactions; facilitates secure data sharing between authorized parties by using cryptography and access controls; and, with smart contracts, can enforce rules automatically to aid compliance and reduce human error.

“For example, in healthcare, blockchain's distributed ledger technology can be leveraged to streamline centralization of patient records while ensuring that only authorized parties have access to their confidential data,” the report said.

At a time when authentication-based fraud is skyrocketing, tap-to-authenticate technology is currently being considered as a security measure by 77% of financial institutions, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence and Arculus collaboration, “To Stamp Out Authentication-Based Fraud, Banks Want Metal Cards.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news","Why to choose a Public-Private Partnership in Healthcare?","https://servier.com/en/newsroom/open-innovation-reasons-choose-public-private-partnership-healthcare/","Fri, 21 Mar 2025 12:40:21 GMT","

At Servier, we are convinced that collaboration between public and private actors is a powerful tool to accelerate innovation and meet patient needs. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a unique collaborative model, making it possible to pool expertise and resources and share risks to accelerate the discovery and development of new therapeutic solutions. To this end, we are engaged in many international projects in all our therapeutic areas.

A PPP is based on contractual collaboration between different actors in the public sector (universities, hospitals, research institutes, etc.), the private sector, and patient associations. Together, they contribute their expertise to a public health project. As part of a long-term dynamic, these initiatives, lasting 3 to 10 years depending on the nature of the project, aim to accelerate the transformation of scientific discoveries into concrete solutions for patients.

In a world where scientific and technological advances are progressing at lightning speed and unmet medical needs require innovative and personalized approaches, PPPs offer a unique framework for accelerating therapeutic innovation.

PPPs help to remove certain scientific and technological barriers by pooling expertise to bring innovative solutions to patients faster. For instance, the sharing of knowledge between scientific experts, physicians and industry accelerates the transition from basic research to clinical applications.

PPP funding predominantly relies on public or institutional funds, which makes it possible to support ambitious research projects, sometimes perceived as too risky for exclusively public or private funding.

This secure environment encourages pharmaceutical companies to invest in areas where progress remains to be explored and thus increases the probability of success for their research projects.

These collaborative initiatives, like those of the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) program, help break down traditional barriers by providing a cooperative space that is conducive to innovation.

The complexity of clinical studies, the ever-increasing regulatory requirements and the challenges associated with industrialization represent long, expensive and risky processes for healthcare actors, requiring considerable resources and multidisciplinary expertise.

PPPs, by their collaborative nature, allow the generation of large databases (chemical libraries, clinical-biological data, epidemiological data, etc.) and access to expensive infrastructure such as biobanks, new preclinical models, or new technologies and specialized equipment. For example, thanks to the amount of data generated, this pooling of resources makes it possible to identify sub-populations of patients for a given disease and thus provide personalized care, meaning the ability to provide the right treatment to the right patient.

These large-scale projects make it possible to deal with health challenges that are too ambitious for a single actor to tackle alone – such as rare diseases and the integration of health data – transforming competitors into collaborators.

We actively participate in nearly forty PPPs in France and abroad (Europe, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, etc.). Our contributions take various forms, such as providing our in-house expertise, robust data, new technologies and/or funding, each with a unique objective: to solve a common public health problem that would be impossible to achieve alone. Our expertise, along with our long-term vision enabled by our unique governance model, serves as a true differentiating factor alongside our partners, while involving the patient at every stage. Public-private partnerships contribute positively to development and performance and fully illustrate the Group's ambition to adopt a collaborative approach that is a catalyst for innovation.

As of January 2025, Servier is engaged in 34 PPPs across 35 countries. Around 150 employees and 300 external partners contribute to the PPPs in which we are involved

Spending on nursing homes grew the slowest in January among all areas of healthcare, according to Altarum's monthly Health Sector Economic Indicators brief, published Wednesday.

For the first time in many months, home healthcare was not the fastest-growing category, growing by 6.1%, year over year, Altarum Fellow and Senior Researcher George Miller told the McKnight's Business Daily. Among the major spending categories, annual growth from December through January was greatest for retail sale of prescription drugs, at 8.3%. 

The data represent a reversal from the previous report, which showed that among major spending categories, annual year-over-year growth through December 2024 was greatest for home healthcare, at 9.4%. Annual growth at that time was slowest for prescription drugs, at 4.7%.

Overall, Miller said, in January, national health spending grew by 6.3% year over year but  the growth rate was nearly identical to its December 2024 level. 

“A very small month-over-month decline was driven by a larger decline in spending on personal healthcare,” he said.

In February, healthcare rates were 2.8% higher than in February 2024, according to the report. 

“Among major spending categories, this overall growth rate was led by prices for prescription drugs, at 4.6%, continuing a sharp increase in 2025 from an average of 1.4% throughout 2024 and representing the highest year-over-year increase since March of 2017,” Miller said.

Increased rates for other major categories ranged from 1.6% for dental care to 2.6% for home healthcare.

According to the report, for major payers, year-over-year private insurance rate growth for services (3.6%) continued to exceed the rate growth for Medicaid (2.6%) after overtaking it last month. Medicare service rates increased 1.6%.  

“Notably, revised data show that Medicare year over-year prices changes for physician services were positive in January for the first time since January 2022,” according to Altarum.

Employment in healthcare grew by 52,000 jobs in February, whereas nonhealthcare industries increased by 99,000 jobs, Miller noted.

February's healthcare job growth was led by ambulatory healthcare services, which added 25,600 jobs, of which 4,100 were in home healthcare. Hospitals added 14,900 jobs, and nursing and residential facilities added 11,500 jobs.

“In January 2025, year-over-year nominal wage growth in the healthcare industry was 4.3%, including 4.6% in hospitals, 4.5% in ambulatory healthcare services (which includes home healthcare), and 3.7% in nursing and residential care facilities,” Miller said.

Altarum's monthly HSEI briefs analyze the most recent data available on health sector spending, prices, employment and utilization. The March report is the last in a series supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Kelsie Reed Blakeney, a registered nurse with nearly a decade of experience, has founded Ablake Healthcare in Columbia, South Carolina, to provide compassionate and comprehensive home care services for seniors and their families. 

Drawing on her extensive background in critical care, Blakeney aims to address the challenges families face in caring for elderly loved ones. She offers a range of medical and non-medical services designed to support and enhance their quality of life.

“My time in the nursing profession has been nothing short of amazing, and my experiences with patients and families have given me a much deeper understanding of what it means to be a nurse,” Blakeney told Home Health Care News. “While critical care was rewarding, I felt in my heart that I was meant to provide a different type of care — care that reaches communities, care that gives back and care that treats your family as my own.”

After transitioning to long-term and community care, Blakeney observed the challenges that families encounter while caring for their loved ones. 

“Caring for an elderly or disabled family member can be overwhelming, and many families are not prepared to provide the necessary level of care,” she explained. “Making the decision to place a loved one in a long-term care facility can be heartbreaking, and these facilities are often prohibitively expensive, leaving families feeling overwhelmed and unprepared.”

Recognizing the increasing demand for affordable and reliable care for seniors and their families, Blakeney founded Ablake Healthcare, an agency that serves families in several South Carolina counties, including Chesterfield, Lancaster, Marlboro, Kershaw, Darlington, Florence, Richland, Lexington, and York.

Ablake Healthcare provides 24/7 availability and a comprehensive range of skilled nursing and therapeutic services for individuals recovering from illness or surgery, as well as those managing chronic conditions. Their offerings include Alzheimer's and dementia care, fall prevention, meal preparation, respite care, medication management and post-operative care. They accept clients through private pay, Medicare, and Medicaid.

Before launching Ablake, Blakeney vowed to uphold the mission of providing clients with the best possible care. 

“We ensure high-quality service by conducting in-home client assessments,” she stated. “These assessments are carried out by one of Ablake's registered nurses to gather all necessary information for effective client care. Once the assessment is complete, we initiate a client-caregiver match, enabling us to pair our clients with a dedicated caregiver who best meets their needs. Our clients are assigned a primary caregiver to foster trust and enhance overall quality of care.”

In addition to ongoing training and education, such as CPR and first aid, caregivers receive training in client safety and managing chronic conditions at home. 

“As a critical care registered nurse, I am primarily responsible for meeting our patients' needs,” Blakeney stated. “From life-saving measures to daily activities such as bathing and feeding, we do whatever is necessary to meet their specific needs. My experience as a nurse has influenced the services our agency offers, ensuring that our clients are always at the center of the care plan. Sometimes, they may be completely dependent on our services, while at other times, they may only need companionship for a day. Regardless of the specific need, our clients and their families can depend on Ablake to provide exceptional care.”

Ablake Healthcare plans to expand its services to include skilled nursing care, along with physical, occupational and speech therapy, according to Blakeney. During the next five years, she hopes to add non-emergency medical transportation and establish an adult day center to encourage social engagement among seniors and their peers.

The American Hospital Association and the nonprofit Health-ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) are warning of a potential terrorist threat against U.S. hospitals in the coming weeks.

On March 18, user @AXactual made a post on X with details related to the active planning of a coordinated, multi-city terrorist attack on United States health sector organizations, according to the joint threat bulletin.

The terrorist attack on hospitals would reportedly be by ISIS-K, a division of the jihadist group Islamic State, according to The HIPAA Journal. The post was added to the X account of American Kinetix, which claims to be a Christian company in the United States that consists of JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command), the CIA and combat veterans, The HIPAA Journal said.

American Kinetix said it had received reports of possible pre-attack surveillance at hospitals.

The post said chatter in ISIS-K training camps in Afghanistan confirmed planning is in the advanced stages, The HIPAA Journal said. According to the post, ISIS-K would use Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs) followed by armed assaults and hostage scenarios. 

""Intelligence suggests these attacks must occur before Al-Q'aida's planned aviation/D.C. attack, likely making hospitals a prelude to a larger-scale operation,"" explained the post, according to that report.

The primary targets would be mid-tier cities with low-security facilities, the joint threat bulletin said. With the information claiming multiple simultaneous targets, attackers would likely select health sector facilities with visibly weak security and conduct prior planning coordination. 

It is common practice for individuals contemplating targeted acts of violence to conduct pre-attack surveillance and reconnaissance, the bulletin said. Having a visible security presence can mitigate being chosen as a target during the planning phase of an attack.

The AHA and Health-ISAC said they were sharing the joint threat bulletin out of an abundance of caution to spread awareness of the potential threat. The AHA and Health-ISAC are in close contact with the FBI and said they would provide additional information as it became available.

At this time, no information is available to either corroborate or discount this threat's credibility, the bulletin said. 

""Generally, foreign terrorist groups do not publicize their upcoming attacks,"" the AHA and Health-ISAC said in the bulletin. ""However, this widely viewed post may encourage others to engage in malicious activity directed toward the health sector, so threats of this nature should be taken seriously. Security teams should review emergency management plans and spread awareness of the potential threat internally.""

The groups recommended that organizations review and evaluate the coordination and capabilities of physical security, cybersecurity and emergency management plans and to increase relationships with local and federal law enforcement to streamline response efforts during an attack. 

In addition, staff and security teams should remain vigilant for any suspicious activity, as well as people or vehicles on organizational premises or in the vicinity of health sector facilities, the bulletin said. If any are identified, they advise to notify local law enforcement immediately.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs eliminated several electronic health record modernization contracts amid a larger cutback earlier this month. Some canceled work under the Veterans Health Administration's Integrated Healthcare Transformation program could directly affect system improvements that ensure patient safety.

The VHA initially received multiple bids for the potential 10-year, $1 billion transformation support contract in 2020 – and selected companies such as Aptive HTG, HRS Consulting, RB Management Consultants, Sierra7, Titan Alpha and Trilogy Federal to work on the project.

As of this week, all these companies appeared with multiple contracts receiving a ""Notice of Termination for Convenience"" dated March 4 in a search of all contracts awarded by the VA under the Integrated Healthcare Transformation program since September on USASpending.gov.

The 2006 Veterans Benefits, Healthcare and Information Technology Act requires the VA to use veteran-owned small businesses, both service-disabled and otherwise, for certain contracts. 

Aptive Resources is a veteran-owned and woman-owned management consulting firm. Along with Trilogy Federal, Titan Alpha and the others with canceled EHR transformation support contracts, all are service-disabled and/or veteran-owned small businesses.

According to documents obtained by Federal News Network, which broke the story that the VA cut support work for the EHR program on Wednesday, six service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses were part of the VA's recent purge of 585 non-mission-critical or duplicative contracts, announced March 3.

A source reportedly told FNN that advisors from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and lawmakers who oversee the VA are not communicating about cuts to the EHR modernization program and the affected companies have already been forced to lay off staff. 

""The groundwork, and all the other work, is being done by this contract support team,"" the source told FNN. ""Right now, they're just trying to do damage control. It's inevitable, I hate to say this, but when this impacts a veteran, and somebody loses their life, that's when the fire alarm is going to ring.""

The agency previously said that mission-critical contracts were exempt from the reductions it made earlier this month, and the $900 million saved by canceling this round of contracts is just the first step in the audit of the VA's nearly 90,000 contracts worth more than $67 billion. The VA said it would redirect savings from the canceled contracts to healthcare, benefits and services to its beneficiaries.

""Among the contract cancellations announced today are those that paid contractors to generate 'contract deliverables' for other contractors to fulfill,"" the VA had said.

""Other canceled contracts cover administrative services that VA can perform on its own, such as staff mentoring, leadership coaching, preparation of meeting agendas and meeting minutes, as well as services such as 'executive support' that involve creating PowerPoint slides.""

Meanwhile, projects such as the VHA's Healthcare Identity Management Program, which safeguards patient and beneficiary identity data, could be in jeopardy with its VHA Integrated Healthcare Transformation contract included in the purge.

Aptive was unable to discuss the canceled contracts ""due to provisions in our contractual agreements,"" a spokesperson for the company said Thursday by message. But a case study posted to the company's website in January details its extensive role in ensuring the integrity of the nation's largest integrated health system.

Because the VA EHR uses the Department of Defense's Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System as the authoritative source of identity information and the DoD Electronic Data Interchange Person Identifier as the unique identifier for the shared EHR, data accuracy is essential to correctly identify patients and link clinical records before care is delivered to veterans. 

VA's Master Person Index is a database with more than 75 million unique entries populated from patient and beneficiary databases at VA facilities nationwide. 

The company said it was addressing inconsistencies in integrating the VA's and DoD's data elements. For example, including both DoD and VHA sites in the provider list has resulted in VHA Message Center orders being sent to DoD providers rather than the appropriate VHA provider, ""risking patient safety unless erroneous orders are identified and correctly redirected."" 

To correct the patient order errors, VHA contracted with Aptive directly to support all aspects of error identification, resolution, reporting and workflow redesign, the company said. 

""There are major differences in the identity data between VA and DoD that must be addressed before data migration,"" Aptive said in January.

""Although significant progress has been made in reducing the number of identity issues shared between VA and DoD, tremendous numbers of anomalies remain that will likely require manual analysis, which are beyond the ability of the existing [identity management program] team to successfully resolve according to schedule,"" the company said.

Under the extinguished contract, Aptive audited procedures and identified system errors, detailed tracking of data message redirection and corrections, redesigned the workflow to halt potential errors and managed the reporting and tracking of initial data errors and corrections ""as required by statute.""

Healthcare IT News reached out to the VA Thursday about the non-mission-critical or duplicative status of Aptive's and others' contracts and was asked for specific contract numbers. Details on 82 of the VHA Integrated Healthcare Transformation program awards terminated on March 4 were provided. 

The agency said it is reviewing the request for information. When and if it provides comments or clarifications, this story will be updated.

The lack of interoperability between the DoD and VA has been a stumbling block for the EHR system since early predeployment delays in 2020.

In 2022, the VA Office of Inspector General found 149 instances of patient harm related to an element of the Oracle Health EHR known as the ""unknown queue."" Incomplete routing information had failed to alert VA clinicians in several cases.

The VA's watchdog has performed several audits and provided numerous recommendations to prevent, respond to and mitigate the impact of major performance incidents on VA care delivery operations and patient safety over the last few years.

The Government Accountability Office said Feb. 21 that while the VA's EHR Modernization Program had made incremental improvements to the system during the most recent pause on rollouts, there's much more to be done to eliminate risks to veterans in the VA's care. The office added three new recommendations for cost estimating, schedule and system metrics, bringing its total recommendations to 18.

For the last few weeks, we've been busy covering the earnings calls of at-home care companies, which have revealed some key trends that providers are facing as they head into Q2. 

Specifically, Addus HomeCare Corporation (Nasdaq: ADUS), Enhabit Inc. (NYSE: EHAB), The Pennant Group (Nasdaq: PNTG), BrightSpring Health Services (Nasdaq: BTSG), Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: AVAH) and other publicly traded companies weighed in on industry issues and developments. 

These calls took place against the backdrop of regulatory uncertainty, with the Capitol Hill budget battle and the confirmation hearing of Dr. Oz for CMS chief being among the latest developments playing out in Washington, D.C.While home-based care executives weighed in on the uncertainty around programs like Medicaid, the cloudy outlook here did not seem to dampen executives' spirits. There was a sense of optimism around how certain strategies are bearing fruit, as well as enthusiasm about the growth potential for at-home care.

In this week's exclusive, members-only HHCN+ Update, I delve into some of the main takeaways that emerged during this latest earnings call season and offer key takeaways, including: 

— Carefully crafted payer strategies continue to fuel progress at certain home-based care companies. 

— Home-based care providers aren't just leaning on the company's key growth drivers. Instead, many are fine tuning their growth plans in order to reach new heights. 

— In addition to well-known challenges that providers are already facing, companies are also keeping an eye out for possible wrinkles that could negatively impact their businesses down the line. 

It's no secret that home health providers have been struggling with margin pressure related to Medicare Advantage rates. Commentary from Aveanna Healthcare and Enhabit executives provided reason for optimism on this front, as both companies shared some encouraging news related to their payer strategies – notably, their comments suggest how strong payer relationships not only create positive financial trends but can lead to improvements in staffing and clinical capacity. 

At Aveanna Healthcare, prioritizing preferred payers agreements is part of the company's larger transformation strategy. The company first began its transformation strategy, which centers around four primary initiatives, in 2023. Its purpose was to get back on track after a turbulent entrance into the public market.

Based in Atlanta, Aveanna Healthcare offers a range of pediatric and adult health care services. The company provides home health, hospice and pediatric care services. It has 327 locations across 34 states.

Aveanna Healthcare CEO Jeff Shaner once defined “preferred payers” as those “that support value-based care by offering us an above-market reimbursement rate and value-based payments in exchange for proven savings.” 

In Q4, the company landed eight additional preferred pay agreements, bumping its overall number up to 22.

In addition to contributing to the financial health of the company, Aveanna Healthcare has also seen other benefits to its preferred pay focus.

“We also experienced improvement in our caregiver hiring and retention trends by aligning our efforts with those payers willing to engage with us on enhanced reimbursement rates, and value-based agreements,” Shaner said last week during its Q4 earnings call. “While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, our preferred payer strategy allows us to return to a more normalized growth rate in our business segments.”

Improvement when it comes to hiring and retention trends is especially important at a time when providers continue to see the negative impact of a challenging labor market. 

Similar to Aveanna Healthcare, Enhabit also leaned on its payer innovation strategy. This has become increasingly important as the company navigates choppy waters. 

Last year, Enhabit faced a number of public battles amid its move to nail down a strategic direction. One thing that remains consistent is the company's strategy of creating “win-win” agreements with its payer partners.

“They get access to our high-quality care, superior outcomes and evidence-based specialty programs, and we get access to more members and competitive rates and terms,” Debra Konjanovski, senior vice president of payor innovation at Enhabit, previously told HHCN.  

Enhabit has shown a willingness to walk away from high-profile contracts when they no longer serve the company. In 2024, the company terminated its contract with UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE: UNH) UnitedHealthcare subsidiary, the largest MA administrator in the country. The two companies eventually formed a new agreement later that year.

In Q4, the company's payer innovation continued to bear fruit. Overall, 48% of Enhabit's non-Medicare visits are now in payer innovation contracts at improved rates. 

Enhabit also credited its payer innovation strategy for the improvement of its clinical capacity. The company negotiated 76 new contracts in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

“This, combined with continued staffing and cost disciplines, should allow us to expand home health margins as we exit 2025 despite CMS rate reimbursement increases not keeping pace with our overall market inflation,” Ryan Solomon, CFO of Enhabit, said during the Q4 earnings call earlier this month. 

Enhabit operates across 34 states and has more than 10,000 employees. The company's footprint includes 255 home health locations and 115 hospice locations.

The HHCN editorial team often asks providers to identify the main growth drivers that define their businesses. As a result, I've become familiar with the primary sources of growth at companies across the industry.

This earnings season, I was particularly interested in the comments about how BrightSpring and Pennant are planning to grow. In the case of BrightSpring, CEO Jon Rousseau was very explicit about leaning more into home-based primary care as a growth avenue and, further highlighting the importance of payer strategies, emphasized how expanding in home-based care can support involvement in shared savings frameworks. And Pennant's growth strategy for its home health business adds to a trend of health system tie-ups in the space.

BrightSpring is a Louisville, Kentucky-based company that delivers care to complex populations, offering primary care, home- and community-based services, pharmacy services and rehab services to over 400,000 consumers throughout 50 states.

Areas such as pharmacy solutions and community and rehab care have been strong growth drivers for BrightSpring. Still, the company has earmarked home-based primary care as a major future business opportunity.

“Our focus in home-based primary care is, how do we continue to drive that incredibly valuable service to as many patients as we can and get them in the ACO, so that we can drive more and more shared savings,” Rousseau said earlier this month during the company's Q4 earnings call. “We said before our five- to seven-year goal is how are we serving at least 100,000 or more people? That's what we're working towards.”

On its end, M&A has always been Pennant's bread and butter when it comes to accelerating growth. Specifically, the company's strategy involves purchasing community-driven home-based care companies with strong ties to their specific markets.

Eagle, Idaho-based Pennant Group is a holding company with independent operating subsidiaries that provide health care services. It has 131 home health and hospice agencies and 60 senior living communities.

During Q4, Pennant zeroed-in on what CEO Brent Guerisoli called “transformative partnerships.” 

In January 2024, the company entered into a joint venture with John Muir Health. Partnerships like this reflect the broader trend of home health growth through health system JVs, which fueled the growth of giants such as LHC Group and currently is a cornerstone for Compassus.

Pennant also joined forces with Hartford Health Care at Home (HHCAH), the home health and hospice segment of integrated health system Hartford HealthCare.

Guerisoli referred to the latter partnership as “a foundational relationship for future expansions in the eastern U.S.,” during the call. 

Addus is one of the biggest home-based care providers working in the Medicaid space, so it tracks that possible changes to the program would be top of mind for leaders at the company. But while the program clearly seems to be under threat, even the risks and uncertainty here did not significantly dampen Addus' outlook, maintaining the trend of generally upbeat messaging with regard to future prospects for at-home care.

Based in Frisco, Texas, Addus delivers home care, home health and hospice services to more than 62,000 consumers through 257 locations across 23 states.

In terms of government payers — which includes Medicaid — Addus has over 300 contracts with federal, state, county and municipal governments, according to the company's website. 

Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a budget resolution. While the proposal doesn't specifically name Medicaid, experts believe that a reduction in federal Medicaid spending is on the table. 

Though Addus CEO Dirk Allison said he believes that the impact to the company's business will be minimal, he pointed out the few ways they would be affected by cuts.

“The only states we serve that could be impacted by the lowering or removal of the FMAP floor would be California and Washington, [whose] combined Medicaid revenue represents approximately 2% of our total consolidated revenue,” he said during the call.

The Q4 call was also an opportunity for Allison to speak on the value of the Medicaid program more generally.

“Medicaid is a valuable state and federal lifeline to the extremely at-risk population that we serve, which, if cut, could lead to much higher total cost of care for both states and the federal government,” Allison said. “At Addus, we are focused on our strategy of expanding our services to this population as it relates to home care, which we believe remains valuable to both our states as well as Congress and this administration. We are encouraged by the bipartisan congressional comments opposing cuts to the Medicaid program.”

While Addus' leaders see the company as largely insulated from Medicaid risk, the same cannot be said for every provider that relies on Medicaid. Given that one theme of the recent earnings calls was the ability of at-home care to lower costs and deliver value to payers, I only hope that the government is hearing this message and crafting policy accordingly.

Oops, something went wrong

Quarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company's progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and the best and worst performers in the healthcare providers & services industry.

The healthcare providers and services sector, encompassing insurers to hospitals to outpatient care facilities, benefit from the consistent demand for healthcare services. Stable or even recurring revenues can be earned through insurance premiums, patient care contracts, and testing services agreements. However, the business models face challenges such as high operational costs especially if significant labor is involved. Reimbursement pressures from public and private payers can impact margins and an evolving regulatory landscape adds uncertainty to it all. Looking forward, this sector is poised to benefit from tailwinds such as the aging population, which means rising prevalence of chronic diseases. There is also broad demand for value-based care models, which emphasize cost efficiency and patient outcomes. Advances in telehealth, data analytics, and personalized medicine are likely to create new revenue opportunities for companies that can successfully digitize. However, headwinds abound, including labor shortages in clinical settings, continued reimbursement cuts, and regulatory scrutiny over pricing and care quality.

The 40 healthcare providers & services stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts' consensus estimates by 1.6% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line.

In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 21, 2025) — Mental health is a crucial component of overall well-being, and in recent years, there has been growing recognition of the mental health needs of children, adolescents, and young adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 5 children experience a mental health disorder each year. Despite this increased awareness, access to mental health services remains a significant challenge, both in Kentucky and nationwide.

With support from generous donors, providers at Kentucky Children's Hospital (KCH) have launched a new Pediatric Psychology program to address the growing need for mental health services.  With a mission to improve the mental health of children, adolescents, young adults and their families by:

“Launching this new division reflects a commitment from the Department of Pediatrics to include mental health care as part of promoting healthy development in our youth,” said Megan Marsac, Ph.D., chief of the Division of Pediatric Psychology in the UK College of Medicine. “We are thrilled to be bringing mental health providers with specialized skill sets in evidence-based assessments and practices to increase our ability to meet the mental health needs of the children of Kentucky.”

The Pediatric Psychology program comprises an interdisciplinary team that frequently collaborates with child life specialists, nurses, advanced practice nurses, social workers and physicians. Together, this team ensures that both mental and physical health needs are addressed, providing comprehensive care for youth experiencing mental health conditions.

“Mental health care isn't separate from health care — it's an essential part of it,” said Scottie B. Day, physician-in-chief for KCH. “With this new division, we are reinforcing our commitment to treating the whole child and bridge the gap in access to critical mental health services for children, adolescents, and young adults.”

The division is expanding its team by recruiting additional psychologists with specialized skills to meet the growing demand for mental health services. This expansion aims to increase access to care and reduce wait times.

The program's current clinical services include:

The team also conducts research on methods that can be used to improve youth and families' experiences with medical care, their adaptation to medical conditions as well as their overall health. Clinically relevant research and quality improvement projects help identify youth and families who may benefit from mental health support, determine factors associated with mental health symptoms and evaluate treatments to enhance mental health outcomes and quality of life. The team will also partner with medical teams on identifying youth who are at risk for suicide and helping to connect them to services. 

As a division of the UK College of Medicine, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students will have the opportunity to learn about in evidence-based mental health interventions, clinically relevant research and trauma-informed care, as well providing trauma-informed care training to medical providers. 

Patients and families who wish to be connected to these services should contact their primary care provider. If your child is considering suicide, go to the nearest emergency room, call or text 988 or chat on 988lifeline.org right away. The Lifeline provides 24/7, free and confidential support for people in distress, prevention and crisis resources for you or your loved ones.

UK HealthCare is the hospitals and clinics of the University of Kentucky. But it is so much more. It is more than 10,000 dedicated health care professionals committed to providing advanced subspecialty care for the most critically injured and ill patients from the Commonwealth and beyond. It also is the home of the state's only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that cares for the tiniest and sickest newborns, the region's only Level 1 trauma center and Kentucky's top hospital ranked by U.S. News & World Report. 

As an academic research institution, we are continuously pursuing the next generation of cures, treatments, protocols and policies. Our discoveries have the potential to change what's medically possible within our lifetimes. Our educators and thought leaders are transforming the health care landscape as our six health professions colleges teach the next generation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals, spreading the highest standards of care. UK HealthCare is the power of advanced medicine committed to creating a healthier Kentucky, now and for generations to come. ","{'href': 'https://uknow.uky.edu', 'title': 'UKNow'}"

Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, headquartered in Dublin, Ohio, is a leading global healthcare solutions provider specializing in pharmaceutical distribution, medical and laboratory products, and data-driven healthcare solutions. With a market capitalization of $31.9 billion, the company operates in over 30 countries and employs more than 48,000 professionals worldwide. 

Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as ""large-cap stocks,"" Cardinal Health fits this bill perfectly. Cardinal Health plays a critical role in enhancing supply chain efficiency, improving patient outcomes, and driving innovation in healthcare logistics, serving hospitals, pharmacies, and healthcare providers across the globe.

Cardinal recently touched its all-time high of $133.11 in the last trading session. CAH stock has surged 12.5% over the past three months, outpacing the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's XLV 6.5% gain over the same time frame.

Over the longer term, Cardinal's performance looks appealing. CAH stock has gained 19% over the past six months and 18.9% over the past year, compared to XLV's 5.3% rise over the past six months and 1.1% returns over the past 52 weeks.

Cardinal Health has sustained its uptrend, consistently trading above its 50-day moving average since late October and maintaining its position above the 200-day moving average since mid-August, reinforcing its long-term bullish momentum.

Cardinal Health climbed over 1% on March 18, defying the broader market downturn as investors sought refuge in defensive healthcare stocks. Heightened market volatility, driven by economic uncertainty and shifting interest rate expectations, pressured major indices. However, CAH and its peers benefited from their stable earnings outlook and resilient demand for healthcare products and services, making them attractive in risk-averse conditions.

Cardinal Health has outpaced its peer Cencora, Inc.'s COR 17.4% gains over the past six months and a 10.7% rally over the past year.

Among the 15 analysts covering the CAH stock, the consensus rating is a “Strong Buy.” The mean price target of $142.19 represents a 6.8% premium to current price levels.

Since the start of the artificial intelligence (“AI”) boom, the healthcare sector has been lagging the S&P 500, with investors parking their funds primarily in mega-cap tech and growth stocks. Healthcare has been one of the S&P 500's worst-performing sectors over the past two years. It grew just 2.5% in 2024 compared with the benchmark index's 23.3% jump.

While the healthcare sector's weighting in the S&P 500 has declined to a 25-year low of about 10%, total U.S. healthcare spending has more than tripled in roughly the same period, from $1.4 trillion in 2000 to $4.9 trillion in 2023. The segment has witnessed major technological upheavals that should have a long-standing impact. Growth in key areas like telehealth, surgery, data analytics and biotechnology have aided in a big way.

The current year started with visible underperformance in the sector, channeled by skepticism over the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health Secretary. However, while RFK Jr. has long been a vaccine skeptic and some of his past comments have criticized groundbreaking drug developments, during the confirmation hearing, he distanced himself from the anti-vaccine movement and voiced support for HIV treatment and prevention drugs. As a result, healthcare as a sector has picked up, with some semblance of confidence returning. In fact, the S&P 500 Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) has grown 6.9% year to date as of March 20, after the bloodbath witnessed in the last quarter of 2024.

An aging population has also helped the sector grow. Moreover, these stocks are considered defensive, meaning they tend to remain stable regardless of the prevalent market conditions. Regular demand for healthcare services is not dependent on the peaks and troughs of a market that has risen and fallen over the past two years over the Fed's monetary policy.

The healthcare sector is poised for significant long-term changes, including the integration of AI in medical research. The sector also seems lucrative for investors looking for a steady cash flow, as pharmaceutical companies are known to offer regular dividends. While it is not having a great time currently, with the measures in place and the new technology delivering them, the time may be ripe to invest in the sector.

Hence, astute investors should bet on healthcare mutual funds at present. Mutual funds, in general, reduce transaction costs and diversify portfolios without an array of commission charges that are mostly associated with stock purchases (read more: Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money).

America's hospitals and health systems are incubators of innovation, ideas and medical progress as they are constantly striving to improve patient care and advance health.

Today, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform each and every aspect of health care delivery, from the simplest administrative task to the most complex clinical procedures, while improving organizational and patient care outcomes at lower costs. According to a recent survey, 85% of health system leaders cited AI as the “most exciting emerging technology for health care.”

AI is already transforming health care delivery at every level, including easing appointment scheduling and discharge, augmenting diagnostic decisions and streamlining resource allocation, just to name a few. Tapping AI's potential to elevate health care delivery to new heights requires planning, vision and commitment.

A recent Market Insights report from the AHA Center for Health Innovation, “Building and Implementing an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan for Health Care,” provides health care leaders with an important starting point, a playbook for allocating resources and a road map for hospital and health care executives looking to expand their adoption of AI's capabilities.

The report reveals the three pillars of successful AI integration — making sure the right people, processes and technology are in place — and explains the purpose of each as hospitals and health systems grow more fully into the world of AI. At the same time, the report highlights how challenges related to data privacy, bias and the need for human expertise must be addressed to implement AI responsibly and effectively.

Importantly, the report gives real-life examples from seven hospitals and health systems that are navigating the opportunities and challenges of AI to transform health care delivery for their patients and communities. While each organization approached its AI action plan differently, they each put the foundational building blocks in place and then overlaid that foundation with a structured, systematic approach to identifying, vetting and executing AI pilots and projects.

AI is not the wave of the future. It is here now and already transforming care and care delivery. AI can help caregivers manage disease and chronic conditions, promote wellness, and achieve efficiency and affordability. And while individual hospitals and health systems will proceed at their own pace, weaving AI-assisted methods and procedures into their care delivery in ways that work best for their organization and the patients they serve, this report provides the foundational building blocks for many institutions who want to create an effective AI action plan.

Health care is and will always be about people caring for people. As hospitals and health systems continue to “redefine the H,” an important part of their efforts to make care more convenient and coordinated will be building and implementing an AI action plan.

NATCHITOCHES, La., March 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- ""AI works 120 million times faster than the human brain,"" according to Dr. Neilank Jha, neurosurgeon, spine specialist and researcher. But AI — artificial intelligence — still needs human oversight. ""The ideal approach is human/AI decision-making.""

Jha, a behavior economist — one who studies human behavior and decision-making — was one of three distinguished speakers at the ""Leadership in the Age of AI"" forum at Northwestern State University on March 19. NSU alumni Monty Chicola, a software developer and entrepreneur, and Dr. Julian Bailes, neurosurgeon and expert on brain injuries, also offered insights into what lies ahead as artificial intelligence changes the way people live, work and make decisions.

""AI's capabilities are mind-blowing,"" said Chicola, ""AI is not going away.""

Chicola, founder of Real Vision Software, is currently teaching an artificial intelligence programming course at NSU in partnership with IBM. He said developing American-based AI software is important because of the U.S.'s political and economic stability, as AI is increasingly applied to commerce, communications, medicine, athletics, entertainment and most other facets of modern life.

""NSU is positioned for leadership, research and innovation and will be integrating AI into academic programs and research initiatives,"" said Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Dr. Greg Handel, who moderated the panel.

The forum provided a platform to pay tribute to the late philanthropist Lola Walker Dunahoe by announcing that Wednesday's event would serve as the inaugural Dunahoe Lecture Series, to be held annually. The Dunahoe family recently established the Lola Walker Dunahoe Endowed Chair in Interdisciplinary Studies, with NSU naming Jha the chair's Distinguished Professor in Leadership and Neuroeconomics.

Natchitoches native Bailes discussed how AI is being used in neurosurgery and its implications for the future. He currently uses advanced GPS technology in surgical navigation, imaging and ultrasound. A nationally recognized expert on concussions, Bailes shared sobering statistics on brain injuries associated with contact sports and how AI technology can be applied to examine a patient's brain, currently only possible through autopsy, to generate a living diagnosis. AI can be used to read images, analyze massive amounts of data and power care coordination, saving time and lives. 

""This is how important AI already is and how it will be more so,"" Bailes said.

Jha, who also studies the brain and spine, identified Bailes as a significant mentor and elaborated on how AI can be used to treat brain cancer. In development is a pump that could be implanted into a tumor, bypassing the blood brain barrier, treating the tumor directly without affecting the whole body. Adding a chip to the pump would enable doctors to track data, detect risks and make informed assessments.

Jha also discussed how AI can be used to solve problems with business, industry and municipal operations by processing large amounts of data to optimize decision-making, which can result in streamlined workflows, enhanced data security and improved customer experiences. 

As NSU's new Distinguished Professor in Leadership and Neuroeconomics, Jha plans to work with faculty in the School of Business to build a consulting group that will work with business and industry to solve problems in Natchitoches and the northwest Louisiana region. 

What AI can't do is replace human experience and judgement and there are ethical considerations, Jha said.

Wednesday's forum was part of university initiatives to integrate AI education into its curriculum, including the development of AI driven programming and interdisciplinary leadership courses. The forum and the Lola Walker Dunahoe Endowed Chair are aimed at attracting top talent in interdisciplinary studies.

Two motions from the Yukon Party regarding health care in the territory have passed unanimously in the Yukon legislature.

Motions in the legislature are non-binding and usually symbolic.

One motion, introduced by the health critic Brad Cathers, the MLA for Lake Laberge, called for the government to take advantage of the turmoil and tumult south of the border with a marketing campaign targeted at U.S. healthcare workers. The motion also asked YG allow U.S.-certified doctors to work in the Yukon, and give other U.S.-trained healthcare workers a fast pass to a license. It was introduced on March 13.

The other motion was moved by the leader of the official opposition, Currie Dixon. His motion proposed YG strike a joint task force with the Yukon Medical Association to explore ways to reduce administrative burden on doctors. However, as reported by the News, the motion was also introduced by Cathers in the legislature the previous week.

Health Minister Tracy-Anne McPhee amended both motions when they came up in the legislature on March 19.

With the motion regarding U.S. doctors, McPhee proposed a change of wording: instead of urging YG to “take immediate steps” to recruit U.S. health-care workers, the amendment said the government should consult with the Yukon Medical Associations and other professional health care organizations on appropriate recruitment measures, for health-care workers from the U.S. and elsewhere.

She also changed the language to specify that the marketing campaign would be targeted towards Americans.

McPhee said the amendment would make the motion more inclusive. Incorporating the Yukon Medical Association would be able to provide expertise on how to address recruitment and retention, she said.

“They are the front-line individuals who work in these professions,” she said.

“We absolutely must consult with them and work to collaborate with them to determine how we can best spend Yukon resources — those resources being financial, energy, opportunities or marketing — to make sure that we are reaching the audiences that we need to in order to work to solve this problem.”

Cathers accused McPhee of watering down the motion.

“The minister's proposal also takes out any reference to taking immediate action, and what we have seen from this Liberal government is a lot of lip service since we raised this issue two years ago,” said Cathers.

In defending the amendment, Premier Ranj Pillai made reference to British Columbia's U.S.-doctor-poaching plan. He said our southern neighbour is targeting doctors from west coast “blue states.”

McPhee also said she was in contact with B.C. health minister to learn more about the province's outreach to U.S. doctors, and what the Yukon can learn from it.

The Yukon Party members voted against the amendment, but the NDP members supported it. The motion was amended with 10 votes in favour. Yukon Party members did support the amended motion itself, however, and it passed unanimously.

As for the motion to strike a joint task force on reducing the administrative burden on doctors, McPhee introduced an amendment to do away with introducing a special task force altogether, instead asking the Yukon government to simply work with the Yukon Medical Association to find ways to reduce the burden of administration on doctors.

McPhee has previously called the idea of a new task force redundant, a sentiment she repeated in the legislature on March 19.

“I brought this amendment because a task force, Mr. Speaker, is not what is needed,” said McPhee. “We should not duplicate tables that exist already.”

In an email sent out on March 20, cabinet communications listed seven different committees and groups dedicated to healthcare such as the Joint Management Committee, Health Human Resources Steering Committee, Fee Liaison Committee, Joint Administrative Committee, the Physician Payment Advisory Committee, Digital Health Strategy Working Group, and the “Tripartite Leadership” meetings which are called as necessary.

McPhee's amendment received unanimous support from other members in the legislature, with Dixon saying the ultimate goal was getting the administrative load lifted from doctors.

The amended motion also passed unanimously.

Oklahoma's insurance commissioner is warning that people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace could see sizeable increases in their health insurance premiums if federal enhanced Advanced Premium Tax Credits are not extended by Dec. 31.

Commissioner Glen Mulready said the permanent extension of $338 billion of federal health insurance subsidies looks more unlikely, which could lead to a significant spike in health insurance premiums in 2026.

""While there might be other potential solutions considered by Congress this year, Oklahoma's leaders and citizens need to be prepared for the consequences of these subsidies ending with significant changes in health insurance costs anticipated,"" the Republican commissioner said in a news release.

The warning comes as the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress have been seeking to slash federal spending in the face of a $36 trillion national debt.

Higher costs of health insurance premiums could push individuals to leave the marketplace and shift to Medicaid or be left uninsured, further exacerbating rate increases, according to a state Insurance Department news release.

In response, the Oklahoma Association of Health Plans is calling on the state Legislature to support bills aimed at minimizing additional hikes, including House Bill 1161, Senate Bill 1096 and Senate Bill 1067.

""If the tax credits don't go through, I think we're going to see Oklahomans that are no longer insured or who are (not) going to be able to afford their insurance,"" said Haley Faulkenberry, the association's executive director. ""This is why it's so important that the Legislature pass bills (like these), so we're not overwhelming our premium payers in Oklahoma with additional costs that may not make sense.""

Monthly medical bills for about 300,000 state residents enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans could rise as much as 165% next year without the federal subsidies, according to the state Insurance Department.

Mulready said Oklahoma Marketplace's silver plan, a common insurance choice, would rise to $153 a month next year from $58.

While he remains hopeful Congress can come to a compromise to lessen the impact of the tax credit cutoff, Mulready said, ""Oklahomans and my fellow elected leaders must understand the potential impact of the expiration of these federal subsidies.""

Lower- and middle-income individuals or families who depend on credits to pay for insurance coverage will be most affected.

Faulkenberry said the Legislature needs to make decisions now to protect Oklahomans from increased health insurance premium costs, which could potentially lead to increased uninsured rates in the state.

""The data clearly showed that without congressional action this year, Oklahoma families will face higher health care costs due to the expiration of eAPTCs. We urge those in Washington, D.C., to strongly consider what this means for Oklahomans,"" Faulkenberry said in a statement.

THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn. — When Nolan Hunt was diagnosed with autism at 18 months, doctors warned his mother he might never speak. But nearly a decade later, the 10-year-old has defied expectations, chatting about everything from his favorite toys to his dream of becoming a YouTuber.

His mother, Kendra Hunt, remembers the uncertainty she felt when she first received his diagnosis.

""Felt like I was losing my child at that point, and I wanted to do everything in my power to make sure that he wouldn't continue to regress anymore,"" she said.

Determined to give Nolan the best chance to thrive, Kendra turned to Sanford Thief River Falls Behavioral Health Center, where a dedicated team of specialists began working with him.

""We had occupational therapy from Sanford twice a week. We had speech twice a week, and then I had early intervention services coming into our house once a week,"" Kendra said.

Nolan has been working with occupational therapist Vanessa Thompson and speech-language pathologist Ashley Holtan for nearly 10 years, developing motor and communication skills through play-based therapy.

""They see it as fun. We're just playing,"" Thompson said. ""But in turn, we're using it to build on a skill.""

""Kendra has used a lot of support and a lot of support systems with Nolan,"" Holtan added. ""I feel like that's why he has made so much progress.""

His older brother, Mason Hunt, has also played a big role in Nolan's journey.

""Being almost non-verbal to speaking in full sentences and stuff like that,"" Mason said, reflecting on his brother's progress.

Now, Nolan is full of energy and personality.

""I want to drink real cow milk,"" he said with a playful slurp.

And his ambitions are just as big.

""I want to be a YouTuber that makes plush videos,"" Nolan shared.

With his family's unwavering support and the continued guidance of the Sanford team, Nolan is well on his way to achieving his dreams.

The Sanford Thief River Falls Behavioral Health Center offers a range of services for children and adults, including occupational therapy, speech-language pathology and clinical psychology. Many in the community are surprised to find such resources available in a town of fewer than 10,000 people.

For Nolan and his family, those services have made all the difference, they said.

North Carolina Health News


					News. Policy. Trends. North Carolina.				





When Gov. Josh Stein rolled out his first budget proposal this week, he presented a $33.65 billion spending plan for lawmakers to consider that he said was “delivering on the promise of North Carolina — that where you come from should never limit how far you can go.”

Stein, a Democrat who served as attorney general for the past eight years and a legislator in the General Assembly before that, noted that such a commitment includes health care.

“We have to invest in strengthening our families and lowering costs,” Stein told reporters at a briefing Wednesday. “Too many families can't afford bare necessities like groceries, housing, health care. So we have to lower costs whenever we can.”

Stein warned of a fiscal revenue cliff that he sees the state approaching if some income and corporate tax cuts favored and pushed through by the Republican-led General Assembly go into effect. He urged lawmakers to delay those cuts, which he said overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and corporate shareholders who live outside North Carolina — and even outside the country in some cases. 

Instead, Stein recommended a child tax credit and cuts for families with low to moderate incomes that could work out to as much as $1,600 for some workers.

Making child care more affordable for North Carolinians was a theme woven throughout Stein's spending proposal, as was looking for ways the state could help alleviate the health care workforce shortage that many facilities are struggling to overcome.



On the child care front, Stein recommended:

North Carolina child care centers have been struggling to survive for several years. Many saw their enrollment numbers drop during the pandemic. Even with an infusion of federal money to help stave off some of those impacts, some centers struggled to keep their doors open. As that support was phased out last year, and centers started to close, child care advocates cautioned about a funding crisis ahead. 

Kristin Walker, state budget director with the Office of State Budget and Management, told reporters at the governor's briefing that there were 80 fewer child care centers now than there were a year ago.

Stein hopes to reverse that trend.

“When we invest in the youngest North Carolinians, we set them up for a lifetime of educational success,” Stein said. “We also help parents who want to stay in the workforce. It's counterintuitive that too many North Carolinians cannot afford to go to work. That's because they can't afford child care if they can find it at all. Getting pushed out of the workforce hurts our workers and hurts our businesses and the economy to the tune of approximately $5 billion a year in lost economic activity.”



Some of Stein's proposals to make a dent in the health care workforce shortages include:

When Stein was attorney general, he played a key role in negotiating a multi-state settlement agreement with opioid distributors and manufacturers that brought more than $750 million over an 18-year period to North Carolina to help the state continue to fight and recover from the crisis.

“While North Carolina has made progress at reducing opioid, fentanyl deaths, still too many people are dying,” Stein said.

Now, he's recommending the creation of a fentanyl law enforcement unit and a prosecutorial team “to investigate and stop the flow of this deadly poison into our communities.” 

“Too many North Carolinians have lost a loved one to a drug overdose or a senseless crime, and we honor the victims by tackling this head on,” he said.



Stein said that to “ensure North Carolinians can access the health care they need,” his proposed spending plan invests more than $770 million in the first year of the biennium and more than $580 million in the second year by leveraging federal funding.

Some of that money will go toward rural health care facilities.

Some will help people with disabilities and traumatic brain injuries who have been advocating for more community-based support for years. Stein proposes spending $35 million by year two of the biennium to support the creation of up to 200 Innovations Waiver slots that go to help people with intellectual and developmental disabilities access community-based services. Another part of that funding will support 75 slots for people to get onto the state's Traumatic Brain Injury support program.

Stein's proposal is only the starting point for a budget process that usually takes weeks, and perhaps months, to complete. But it's not certain how many of his proposals will be adopted by the Republican-led General Assembly, where lawmakers hold the pursestrings for the state. In the coming weeks, the state Senate will release its proposed spending plan, and the state House of Representatives will do the same. Together, they develop one budget for the next two years.

Stein could have more of a say in how that fiscal plan shapes up than his predecessor Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper did during the last two years of his term.

The governor has the power to veto a budget, and the state Senate has enough Republicans to overturn a veto if the objections break down along partisan lines. The state House of Representatives, however,does not have a veto-proof majority this year, leaving more room for negotiations.

Stein's proposal also calls for:

The Marketing and Healthcare Science Programs at Rome High School recently received industry certification and recertification, respectively, from the Georgia Department of Education.

The team that evaluated the Marketing program was impressed with the collaboration the program has with other CTAE programs at the College and Career Academy as well as the DECA Chapter having 150 active members. They were also impressed that the school store, which is run by the Marketing students, helps pay for students to go to DECA and other club competitions.

The team that evaluated the Health Care Science Program was impressed with the facilities, equipment, the depth of the curriculum being taught, as well as the hands-on activities.

“We are very proud that the Georgia Department of Education has given industry certification to our Marketing and Healthcare Science Programs. This is a testament to the great job our teachers and students do each and every day,” Marores Perry, Director of CTAE and Student Services, said. “These and other programs at the College and Career Academy are preparing our students for life after school.”

Industry certification standards are developed collaboratively by the GaDOE specialists and state business associations along with input from CTAE instructors throughout the state.

Industry certification represents the apex of program quality. Only those programs that have successfully undergone rigorous reviews by leaders from business and industry are recognized with this distinction. The Georgia Department of Education is committed to the industry certification process as a part of its effort to strengthen technical and academic standards for all CTAE programs.

The findings are being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session (ACC.25). They highlight how these important cancer screening tools can also be used to assess the amount of calcium buildup in the arteries within breast tissue—an indicator of cardiovascular health. 

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that middle-aged and older women get a mammogram—an X-ray of the breast—to screen for breast cancer every one or two years. About 40 million mammograms are performed in the United States each year. While breast artery calcifications can be seen on the resulting images, radiologists do not typically quantify or report this information to women or their clinicians. The new study, which used an AI image analysis technique not previously used on mammograms, demonstrates how AI can help fill this gap by automatically analyzing breast arterial calcification and translating the results into a cardiovascular risk score. 

Advances in deep learning and AI have made it much more feasible to extract and use more information from images to inform opportunistic screening

“We see an opportunity for women to get screened for cancer and also additionally get a cardiovascular screen from their mammograms,” said Theo Dapamede, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at Emory University in Atlanta and the study's lead author. “Our study showed that breast arterial calcification is a good predictor for cardiovascular disease, especially in patients younger than age 60. If we are able to screen and identify these patients early, we can refer them to a cardiologist for further risk assessment.” 

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States but remains underdiagnosed in women and there is also lagging awareness. Researchers said the use of AI-enabled mammogram screening tools could help identify more women with early signs of cardiovascular disease by taking better advantage of screening tests that many women routinely receive. A buildup of calcium in blood vessels is a sign of cardiovascular damage associated with early-stage heart disease or aging. Previous studies have shown that women with calcium buildup in the arteries face a 51% higher risk of heart disease and stroke. 

To develop the screening tool used for this study, researchers trained a deep-learning AI model to segment calcified vessels in mammogram images—which appear as bright pixels on X-rays—and calculate the future risk of cardiovascular events based on data obtained from the electronic health record data. The segmentation approach is what separates this model from previous AI models developed for analyzing breast artery calcifications. Researchers said the model is also strengthened by its use of a large dataset for training and testing, which included images and health records from over 56,000 patients who had a mammogram at Emory Healthcare between 2013 and 2020 and had at least five years of follow-up electronic health records data. “Advances in deep learning and AI have made it much more feasible to extract and use more information from images to inform opportunistic screening,” Dapamede said. 

With the help of artificial intelligence, computers are to simulate human thought processes. Machine learning is intended to support almost all medical specialties. But what is going on inside an AI algorithm, what are its decisions based on? Can you even entrust a medical diagnosis to a machine? Clarifying these questions remains a central aspect of AI research and development.

Overall findings showed the new model performed well at characterizing patients' cardiovascular risk as low, moderate or severe based on mammogram images. After calculating the risk of dying from any cause or suffering an acute heart attack, stroke or heart failure at two years and five years, the model showed that the rate of these serious cardiovascular events increased with breast arterial calcification level in two of the three age categories assessed—women younger than age 60 and age 60-80, but not in those over age 80. This makes the tool particularly well suited for providing early warning of heart disease risk in younger women, who can benefit more from early interventions, researchers said. 

The results also showed that women with the highest level of breast arterial calcification (above 40 mm²) had a significantly lower five-year rate of event-free survival than those with the lowest level (below 10 mm²). For example, 86.4% of those with the highest breast arterial calcification survived for five years compared with 95.3% of those with the lowest level of calcification. This translates to approximately 2.8 times the risk of death within five years in patients with severe breast arterial calcification compared to those with little to no breast arterial calcification. 

The AI model was developed as a collaboration between Emory Healthcare and Mayo Clinic and is not currently available for use. If it passes external validation and gains approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, researchers said the tool could be made commercially available for other health care systems to incorporate into routine mammogram processing and follow-up care. The researchers also plan to explore how similar AI models could be used for assessing biomarkers for other conditions, such as peripheral artery disease and kidney disease, that might be extracted from mammograms.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), a division within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tasked with conducting research to improve health care quality, is reportedly at risk of experiencing widespread layoffs. Concerns have emerged that the Trump administration may target the small government agency for significant staffing reductions.

AHRQ plays a key role in analyzing health care systems and practices to enhance patient outcomes and efficiency. The potential layoffs could impact its ability to fulfill its mandate, which includes producing evidence-based research on topics such as patient safety, medical errors, and cost-effective treatments. While no official announcement has been made regarding the scale or timing of these layoffs, fears about their likelihood have sparked discussions among stakeholders in the health care sector.

The Administrative Court has today rejected the appeal filed by several private care providers in primary care to remove the requirement for Millennium in primary care.

The Administrative Court writes regarding the principle of proportionality:

No evidence has been presented to support that the examples of procedure proposed by the Companies are less intrusive than the introduction of the requirement. The fact that the proposed solutions on the part of the Companies offer an equivalent alternative to the requirement does not lead to the conclusion that the requirement is not necessary to achieve the intended purpose.

Comment from Carasent CEO, Daniel Öhman:

""My impression now is that most private care providers in primary care in VGR believe that they will avoid Millennium, but I would still be surprised if they do not appeal. The Administrative Court does not question that it is possible to achieve VGR's goal without forcing everyone into the same system, but it says that it has not been proven that integration with existing systems is less intrusive than forcing everyone into Millennium. This should be quite obvious and easy to show in the next instance.""

March 20, 2025 / 8:51 PM EDT
          / CBS News
        

Grand Prairie, Texas — Joseph Buentello, 80, was cruising through retirement when he received a call erroneously claiming his son was in jail.

""I was scared, I hit the panic button and I let my panic take control of my good judgment,"" Buentello, of Grand Prairie, Texas, told CBS News. 

The caller told Buentello that if he wanted to get his son out, he needed to rush to his local grocery store and send $5,000 through a bitcoin ATM. 

 Buentello said he never even thought about calling his son first.

 ""They said there is nothing we can do about it,"" said Buentello the ATM operator told him after he was scammed. ""That money has already been distributed. They said it was distributed the minute you got through putting your money in there.""

That is why, Buentello learned, the cryptocurrency scammers wanted him to use that machine. Often found inside convenience stores, Bitcoin ATMs resemble regular ATMs and provide a legitimate and straightforward method to convert cash into cryptocurrency.  

According to data from the Federal Trade Commission, between 2020 to 2023, consumer losses in bitcoin ATM scams skyrocketed nearly tenfold, from $12 million annually in 2020 to $114 million annually in 2023. During that timeframe, consumers over the age of 60 were more than three times more likely than younger adults to lose money to bitcoin scams, the FTC found. 

And getting the money back has been tough.

When McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara first joined law enforcement back in 1970, he said the biggest thieves in the Texas county were bank robbers.

""Take a gun, go rob a bank, get the money, and we'd go after 'em,"" McNamara said. ""But this is a totally different deal now.""

A couple of years ago, after a caller scammed an 83-year-old woman in Waco, Texas, into depositing $15,000 into a bitcoin ATM, McNamara's deputies pulled the cash right out of the machine and returned it to her.

The bitcoin ATM operator then sued the county, claiming the seizure was unlawful, but the lawsuit was eventually dismissed and the woman was allowed to keep the money. 

 However, the lawsuit was dismissed only after the county admitted that the funds were seized ""in error.""

McNamara doesn't regret how the situation was handled. 

""I don't regret it at all,"" McNamara said. ""We got the lady's money back. It should have gone back to her.""

Bitcoin ATM operators told CBS News that they take extensive measures to protect users from fraud, including displaying up to six screens alerting customers to potential scams.

In recent years, a handful of states, including California, Vermont and Minnesota passed laws regulating Bitcoin ATMs. However, most of the country, including Texas, has no regulations.  

 ""I feel like such a fool,"" Buentello said. 

Had there been any sort of refund policy in place when he made his transaction, Buentello believes could have saved his money and avoided the scam. 

According to the FTC, scammers will often offer an urgent reason for the victim to withdraw cash from their bank account and deposit it in a bitcoin ATM. They will provide a QR code that victims can scan, which deposits the money directly into the scammers' crypto account.

Some tips from the FTC to avoid being scammed include never clinking on unknown links or responding directly to unexpected calls or unknown text messages. Scammers will be trying to rush you, so you should slow down and consult with someone you trust. And never withdraw cash in response to an unexpected call or message.

Bitcoin (BTC) and other major tokens lost more than 3% as Thursday's rally was met with profit-taking during Asian morning hours Friday — in line with expectations.

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.2% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding from $86,000 to under $84,000, ether (ETH) dropping below $2,000 and Solana's SOL falling 5%.

XRP showed steady declines bringing Wednesday's 10% spike to a 4.8% gain over a weekly basis, while BNB Chain's BNB continued to edge higher, bringing weekly gains to over 8%. 

At press time, Tron's TRX and TON were the only major tokens in the green, rising 2% each. 

TRX was floated on Solana for the first time ever on late Thursday in an attempt to expand its user base. TON saw retail demand after the Toncoin Foundation said that venture capital firms now hold over $400 million worth of the asset after fresh investments.

Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting delivered a brief upside catalyst markets had been waiting for, propelling BTC past $85,000 as no rate cuts were announced. 

However, the Fed said it would scale back its “quantitative tightening” program starting in April which traders likely interpreted as an indirect rate cut, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Telegram broadcast. Options markets have started to position accordingly.

“The chance of BTC reaching above $100K by June 30 has increased from 20% to nearly 30% in the last 24 hours,” Dr. Sean Dawson, head of research at onchain options platform derive.xyz, told CoinDesk in an email. 

“While the probability of ETH remaining above $2000 by June 30 is now a coin flip – was 40% 24 hours ago. Nearly 60% of ETH options traded on Derive.xyz in the last 24 hours were calls bought, indicating a bullish sentiment. For BTC, 34% of all volume was bought, reflecting demand for downside protection,” Dawson added.

FxPro's Alex Kuptsikevich, who eyes the $80,000 support level as a critical area to watch for a break of support, maintained a cautious tone.

“It's important to note that the crypto market has yet to break above its 200-day moving average, currently sitting close to $2.9 trillion. A strong rally above this level could trigger an active buying phase, but there's also a risk of bears setting up a trap, as they've done several times before,” Kuptsikevich said in a Telegram message.

“For bitcoin to maintain momentum, staying above this key level is crucial. If it does, it could spark renewed interest in buying a variety of coins that have been in a correction phase for a while,” he added, referring to broader altcoin and memecoin markets.

 Bitcoin is paring recent losses but still struggles to sustain its uptrend, leading some analysts to predict another drop to as low as $65,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded by as much as 14% after plunging to a four-month low near $76,600 on March 11. But BTC price is down approximately 25% from its record high of around $110,000, which is normal for a “bull market correction.”

Still, some analysts anticipate the Bitcoin price declines to continue in the future.

Bitcoin faces renewed bearish pressure after rejecting at $87,470, the descending channel resistance, with a “dark cloud cover” pattern reinforcing the downtrend, according to an analysis shared by GDXTrader on X.

The dark cloud cover pattern occurs when a strong green candle is followed by a red candle that opens above the previous close but closes below the midpoint of the first candle's body.

Such a shift in sentiment indicates that buyers attempted to push higher but were overpowered by sellers, often leading to further downside.

Bitcoin's failure to close within the $90,000-$93,000 resistance zone suggests a lack of buying conviction, GDXTrader noted, saying the cryptocurrency will remain under bearish pressure unless it decisively breaks above the said range.

Bitcoin's potential to decline further arises from its “perfect rejection” after testing the $86,000-88,000 zone as resistance, according to analysis from popular trader CrediBULL Crypto.

Notably, Bitcoin attempted to break toward the local supply zone marked in red but failed to sustain above the said resistance zone, illustrated by the orange circle in the chart below.

Failure to reclaim the supply zone has increased the probability of a drop toward lower support levels around $77,000-79,000 (highlighted in green) by March. Testing this area as support has led to sharp price rebounds in March.

Nonetheless, if this support zone breaks, a deeper move below the $77,000-79,000 region could extend toward the $65,000-74,000 area—the larger green liquidity zone in the chart above—by April.

Analyst George shared a similar outlook, as shown below.

According to analyst CryptOpus, Bitcoin remains tightly correlated with traditional equity markets, particularly the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq 100 (NDX), both of which are displaying bear flag patterns on the charts.

A bear flag forms when the price consolidates higher inside an ascending parallel channel. It resolves if the price breaks below the lower trendline and drops by as much as the previous downtrend's height.

BTC is following a similar bear flag structure, with $84,000 acting as the lower trendline support. A break below this threshold could trigger a deeper sell-off toward $72,000 per the technical rule explained above.

Moreover, Bitcoin's correlation with equities has grown due to a broader decline in risk-on sentiment, led by the US President Donald Trump's global trade war.

HINDHEAD, United Kingdom, March  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, experts from SNXCrypto, a professional cryptocurrency platform, analyze the key drivers behind this growth and explore whether Bitcoin could reach $150,000 or even $200,000 in the near future. While some market analysts remain cautious, Bitcoin's bullish momentum suggests it could continue its upward trajectory.

The platform's analysts emphasizes on factors supporting a surge to 150,000 – 200,000



In addition, SNXCrypto enlists various factors driving Bitcoin's price surge, including;

The influx of institutional investors has played a significant role in Bitcoin's meteoric rise. Major corporations such as Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, reinforcing its status as ""digital gold."" Meanwhile, leading financial institutions have introduced Bitcoin investment products, enhancing its accessibility for mainstream investors.

Amid global economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin has emerged as a preferred store of value for investors seeking protection against currency devaluation. With central banks adopting expansionary monetary policies, Bitcoin's scarcity and decentralized nature make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets.

The cryptocurrency market has witnessed improved regulatory clarity, particularly with the approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in key financial markets. These developments have significantly lowered entry barriers for institutional and retail investors, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset.

Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins and its quadrennial halving events have historically led to long-term price appreciation. The 2024 Bitcoin halving has already reduced the issuance of new Bitcoin, creating a supply shock that could drive prices higher within the next 12 to 18 months.

Consequently, Bitcoin's extraordinary rise from $20,000 to $100,000 underscores its resilience and increasing relevance in the financial world. While market uncertainties persist, factors such as institutional adoption, supply constraints, and regulatory advancements suggest that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 or even $200,000 in the future.

Investors are advised to consider both bullish and bearish scenarios while staying informed about market dynamics. Regardless of price movements, Bitcoin's role as a decentralized digital asset remains a cornerstone of the evolving financial landscape.

Crypto traders are turning their attention from Bitcoin to other major cryptocurrencies, most especially Ethereum and XRP.

That's a very good sign, given the beating the assets have taken over the last several weeks.

Analysts at CEX.io, a crypto exchange, say this is a sign of mounting confidence in altcoins. 

“These developments indicate potential capital rotation, as investors shift funds from Bitcoin to Ether and other altcoins in anticipation of better performance,” CEX.io analysts said.

Indeed, DL News reported that whales have been piling into XRP this month.

Still, the crypto market is in flux and continues to struggle for momentum. The market has lost 27% of its value since peaking on December 17 and is now at $2.85 trillion.

So, signs of an altcoin resurgence spell relief for crypto investors.

Both XRP and Ethereum dominated trading volumes on crypto exchanges this year, CEX.io analysts noted.

XRP volume leapt more than three-fold on Wednesday, the biggest trading spike for any major cryptocurrency this week.

That increase in volume more than doubled XRP's crypto dominance to over 8% ― the highest trading dominance for XRP since its price reached an all-time high in January 2018.

On Wednesday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the Securities and Exchange Commission will drop its case against the company. Ripple designed the XRP cryptocurrency to facilitate cross-border payments.

The SEC sued Ripple in 2020 for allegedly breaching US securities law in its sale of XRP to investors.

While Garlinghouse hailed the development as a “resounding victory” and XRP rallied, the bump may not be long-lived. 

Analysts at B2BINPay, a crypto business payment provider, told DL News that investor enthusiasm for XRP will depend on “future events.”

For Osama Bari, chief technology officer at D24 Fintech Group, a business payment outfit, an XRP ETF might be the next growth driver for the Ripple-linked cryptocurrency.

“If the SEC drops its appeal against Ripple and an XRP ETF is approved, prices may revisit previous highs or even reach new levels,” Bari said earlier this week.

Ethereum's market dominance was also boosted this week with a 96% increase in daily trading volume.

Not only that, but Ethereum's selling pressure has begun to wane even while short-term Bitcoin holders have been ditching the top cryptocurrency.

Market analysts say Ethereum's reduced selling pressure compared to Bitcoin indicates the former is likely to experience a faster price recovery, at least in the short term.

 Bitcoiners waiting for retail to show up might be missing the obvious — it's already here, a crypto executive says. 

Bitcoin bulls who still think the cycle peak has yet to come as retail investors haven't piled in yet might be using an outdated playbook, according to a crypto executive.

“The idea that the cycle isn't over just because onchain retail activity is absent needs reconsideration,” CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju said in a March 19 X post. 

Ju said that those tracking retail movements using only onchain metrics will not have seen the full picture. 

“Retail is likely entering through ETFs — the paper Bitcoin layer — which doesn't show up onchain,” Ju said. 

“This keeps the realized cap lower than if the funds were flowing directly to exchange deposit wallets,” he added, noting that 80% of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows come from retail investors — a trend that Binance analysts already once observed in October last year. 

Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, inflows have totaled around $35.88 billion. Source: Farside 

At the time, the analysts said most of the ETF buying likely came from retail investors moving their holdings from wallets and exchanges into funds with more regulatory protection.

Ju was responding to counter-arguments over his earlier prediction on X that the “Bitcoin bull cycle is over” on March 17. 

“I've been calling for a bull market over the past two years, even when indicators were borderline. Sorry to change my view, but it now looks pretty clear that we're entering a bear market,” he said. 

Ju explained that certain indicators are showing a lack of new liquidity, which is likely being driven by macro factors. 

He also clarified when he said the bull cycle was over, he meant Bitcoin could take “6-12 months” to break its all-time high, not that it's about to crash.

Traders often look at retail investor activity to spot signs of exhaustion or as a signal to start selling when the market appears overheated.

There are several sentiment indicators that help market participants understand the level of retail interest in the market. One of these is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures overall crypto market sentiment, reading a “Fear” score of 31, down 18 points from its “Neutral” score of 49 yesterday.

Other common signals used to track the level of retail interest in the crypto market include Google search trends for “crypto” and related keywords and the popularity of crypto applications in major app stores worldwide.

While the Google search score for “crypto” worldwide was at a score of 100 during the week of Jan. 19 - 25, when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $109,000 and US President Donald Trump's inauguration, it has since declined by almost 62%.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto has been on a wild ride since President Donald Trump's presidential election win in November. Prices surged as investors got excited about the Trump administration's friendly approach toward digital currency. However, weak economic data and an intense market sell-off during the past month has spilled into the cryptocurrency sector, sending prices way down from recent highs.

Crypto has really only been around for a little more than 15 years, so the investment community still has a lot to learn about digital assets. But the sector has often traded in a fashion similar to high-flying tech stocks, so it can't be a complete surprise to see it sell off with the broader market.

Still, the perennial bull Michael Saylor, who co-founded Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, in 1989, and is still its executive chairman, recommends investors buy one top cryptocurrency that he thinks can soar 15,810% over time.

If you know who Saylor is and have been following him during the past five years, then you know that the token he is referring to is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. In 2020, when Strategy, which used to primarily be a data intelligence company, was struggling, Saylor chose to take most of the company's remaining cash and start purchasing hoards of the crypto. It hasn't stopped since and has seen its stock surge, along with Bitcoin's price.

Interestingly, Strategy's stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. The big reason is that the company has been able to tap the capital markets to access funding that it can use to purchase the crypto, essentially making it a levered play on the coin. Strategy now owns about 2% of all bitcoins outstanding.

Last year, Saylor made a bold call, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $13 million by 2045, which implies 15,810% upside from current prices (as of March 18). He said: ""My long-term forecast is 21 years, 29% ARR (annual rate of return). Right now we're 60% ARR, it will decelerate toward 20% ARR over the next 21 years, and the volatility will decelerate.""

Another reason Saylor thinks that Bitcoin can explode is that it makes up such a small fraction of global wealth (0.1% when it traded at $65,000). However, he sees this share increasing. At $13 million, Bitcoin would make up 7% of global wealth, which he views as a plausible scenario.

Like many other Bitcoin bulls, Saylor also believes the Trump administration is a huge catalyst for the sector. So far, the administration has taken a much more pro-crypto approach than former President Joe Biden's administration. Trump has placed pro-crypto officials in his cabinet and has pro-crypto advisors. We've already seen the Securities and Exchange Commission put its lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance on hold and move to drop a lawsuit against Coinbase.

Trump also issued an executive order to create a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. Although most of the tokens that will go into these stockpiles will come from cryptocurrencies seized by the Treasury Department, the Bitcoin reserve will be able to buy additional coins, as long as the purchases are at no cost to the American taxpayers and are budget-neutral.

While Bitcoin has fallen from a peak of more than $109,000 this year into the low $80,000s as of this writing, Saylor has held firm. In late February, he wrote on X, ""Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin."" Strategy has also continued to buy more Bitcoin and is looking to raise more capital to buy still more.

Will it hit $13 million? It's impossible to know. Although Saylor has been right during the past five years and continued to buy Bitcoin as its price has soared, his thesis looks like napkin math at best. That's not to say that it won't continue to climb. I am bullish long term on the digital coin because of its potential to hedge inflation with its finite supply of 21 million tokens.

However, as I mentioned above, it's not only a fairly new asset but also extremely volatile, so while I think it's a good asset to have exposure to, I see no reason to be as aggressive as Saylor and Strategy.

Bitcoin is surging after a rollercoaster few months after Donald Trump's speech at a major cryptocurrency summit.

Trump spoke at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York on Thursday and bitcoin, by far the largest cryptocurrency, recovered much of its losses from recent months.

Bitcoin went over $100,000 (£77,200) for the first time in December 2024 but has since crashed down to $79,000 (£61,000) amid wider fears of economic turmoil caused by the Trump administration.

But ahead of Trump's speech, the currency climbed back up to $86,000 (£66,400).

Speaking via video link from the White House Trump promised to make the US a bitcoin ""superpower"" and the ""undisputed crypto capital of the world.""

He highlighted his administration's actions on loosening regulations on the crypto industry, including ending what he called ""operation chokepoint 2.0"", which saw federal agencies encouraging banks to not operate in risky sectors, particularly the crypto industry.

Trump said the operation went too far and acted as a form of ""lawfare"" against the industry.

The president has also instituted the US government's Crypto Federal Reserve which will hold certain cryptocurrencies when they are acquired by state operations rather than sell them.

Despite the losses of recent months bitcoin has been on an incredible run in recent years after hitting a low of $16,000 (£12,300) in 2022. A lot of the recent gains have been associated with an event known as the Bitcoin halving that happened on 20 April 2024.

Halving is an event automatically triggered by the bitcoin network, which is designed to prevent inflation in the cryptocurrency but it can also trigger large price rises.

The halving happens roughly every four years and after each halving the following one to two years often see bitcoin's price explode.

Aaron Peak, personal finance expert at credit reference company CredAbility, said: ""Bitcoin is notoriously volatile: prices can surge or crash unpredictably, so investors should always be cautious.

""Bitcoin's price has been on a rollercoaster recently, and we've seen some major price swings in recent months.”

Bitcoin halving reduces the rewards of mining the cryptocurrency by 50%.

Crypto miners use high-end computing rigs to perform calculations and are rewarded with bitcoin but after each halving, the reward decreases.

Miners complete calculations required to verify transactions, using computers to make guesses to solve the puzzle and the first to solve it adds a new block to the blockchain – a digital ledger that records and verifies transactions across a network of computers.

The dates of the halvings are not set, rather they occur every 210,000 blocks that are mined.

Aaron Peak, personal finance expert at credit reference company CredAbility said: “Right now, miners – who verify bitcoin transactions – earn 6.25 bitcoins for each new block they add to the blockchain.""

“After the next halving, their reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoins. This reduces the supply of new coins, which can affect bitcoin's price.”

Bitcoin halving performs several important functions, restricting supply and limiting inflation, which helps to maintain the cryptocurrency's value.

Peak explains: ""Halving is important because it slows down how quickly new bitcoins are created. Historically, bitcoin halving has led to price increases. When fewer new bitcoins enter the market, but demand stays the same (or grows), the price often rises.

“It's a bit like gold, if mining gold became twice as hard overnight, but people still wanted it, the price would likely go up. However, past performance doesn't guarantee the same outcome every time, so there are no certainties.""

The next bitcoin halving event is expected to happen in 2028, but it all depends on how quickly miners create new blocks, Peak explained.

Peak said: ""It will happen after another 210,000 blocks have been added to the blockchain, which usually takes around four years.

""This happens because bitcoin has a fixed supply – only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. The process is built into bitcoin's code to control inflation, a bit like how central banks manage the money supply, except no one can change bitcoin's rules.""

Bitcoin halvings are expected to continue until 2040.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Can you buy food with Bitcoin?

The short answer is yes, definitely. Depending on the country you're in, there may be different options presented to you. 

The benefit of using a Bitcoin payment for food directly is to avoid the intermediary and higher costs while performing a pure Bitcoin transaction as Satoshi had intended. 

Although most merchants do not accept BTC as payment yet, Bitcoin cards, gift cards and food delivery portals that accept Bitcoin, even indirectly, are pretty much available everywhere. 

All you need to do is refill the card with some cryptocurrency, and the payment processor will directly exchange Bitcoin for local currency. 

1. Pay for your food via direct Bitcoin payments

Although the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin is increasing globally, very few are still fully embracing the cryptocurrency as a payment method. When Bitcoin is accepted, normally, a Lightning wallet is used for fast payments and very low fees. 

You can visit https://btcmap.org/ to find Bitcoin-friendly food companies around the world. Just choose a nearby area to see where you can use the digital currency.



Depending on the jurisdiction, fast food companies that accept Bitcoin include groups like Burger King and Subway. McDonald's fully accepts BTC as a direct payment in El Salvador and as a pilot program in Lugano, Switzerland.

You can also pay with Bitcoin at specific restaurants such as Mastro's (at selected US locations) and Tahini's, a Canadian-Middle Eastern chain with some US presence. This crypto-friendly restaurant even holds Bitcoin as a reserve asset. 

Accepting Bitcoin directly for online orders is less common unless the merchants partner with a delivery service that supports crypto. It's possible to pay with Bitcoin for food delivery at companies like Manufy in the US that also accept Bitcoin directly. 

You can also buy groceries with crypto directly at many Bitcoin-friendly grocery stores. Whole Foods in the UK, US and Canada accepts BTC via the Flexa network's Spedn app at specific locations. One of South Africa's largest grocery retailers, Pick n Pay, is a supermarket accepting Bitcoin payments. It rolled out Bitcoin payments across many of its stores following a successful pilot. 

El Salvador is deservedly known as a Bitcoin country, and in most cases, restaurants, grocery stores and online retailers allow their customers to pay with Bitcoin directly. 

Many small municipalities are adopting Bitcoin as a widely used currency. Other than El Salvador, in places like Lugano, Switzerland and Mossel Bay, South Africa, many merchants, mostly small retailers, accept Bitcoin as a legitimate method of payment. 

How to pay with Bitcoin directly

Did you know? Subway was the first major food chain to accept Bitcoin. The first Bitcoin purchase at a Subway occurred in 2013 in Moscow, Russia.

2. Bitcoin cards, an alternative way to pay for your food

Many services offer Bitcoin-funded debit cards that convert Bitcoin to fiat at the point of sale. BitPay, Wirex and Binance are well-known companies. They support Bitcoin and crypto payments at grocery stores like Walmart. They can also convert cryptocurrency into various currencies. 

The benefit of Bitcoin cards is that the conversion into fiat is instant, without the need for the store to accept Bitcoin directly. ‍The crypto card provider partners with companies like Visa and Mastercard to make sure that your card is accepted by the vast majority of vendors and merchants.

How to pay with Bitcoin cards

How to use Bitcoin gift cards to pay for food

Bitcoin gift cards are Bitcoin vouchers that you can buy to purchase food from popular delivery platforms like Uber Eats, DoorDash or Grubhub. Services like BitPay, CoinGate and Bitrefill let you order food online with Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin gift cards are also widely used for grocery shopping at Walmart, Whole Foods, Safeway and Lidl. The gift cards can be used for shopping in-store or online services, or pick-up or delivery.

How to pay with Bitcoin cards

Paying with Bitcoin gift cards is one of the most widely available methods, particularly helpful when the chosen restaurant or merchant doesn't accept crypto directly yet.

Precautions when paying with Bitcoin for food

While Bitcoin offers a convenient and decentralized payment method, it's essential to take certain precautions to ensure a safe and smooth transaction:

Remember, the security of your funds is just as important as how you use them. Taking precautions now will ensure your assets remain safe while enjoying the convenience of paying with Bitcoin.

US President Donald Trump delivered a video address at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on Thursday (March 20), reaffirming his commitment to making the United States the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower” and the “crypto capital of the world.”

The three-minute pre-recorded speech marked the first time a sitting U.S. president addressed a cryptocurrency conference.

Trump sharply criticised the previous administration's policies, vowing to end what he called the “regulatory war on crypto” and halt “lawless” government crackdowns.

“We're ending the last administration's regulatory war on crypto and Bitcoin, and that includes stopping the lawless Operation Choke Point,” Trump said.

Operation Choke Point, a controversial initiative that allegedly sought to cut off banking services to crypto businesses, was a major point of contention in the industry.

“Operation Choke Point went beyond regulation, and I mean far beyond. Frankly, it was a disgrace. But as of January 2025, all of that is over,” he added.

Trump touted his administration's efforts to integrate Bitcoin into national policy, highlighting the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile.

“That same week, I signed an order creating the brand-new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will allow the federal government to maximize the value of its holdings instead of foolishly selling them for a fraction of their long-term value, which is exactly what Biden did.”

These initiatives aim to ensure that the US government retains and strategically manages Bitcoin holdings rather than liquidating them at low market prices.

Trump also urged Congress to pass new laws regulating stablecoins, which he believes could strengthen the US dollar's global dominance.

“With the right legal framework, institutions large and small will be liberated to invest, innovate, and take part in one of the most exciting technological revolutions in modern history.”

He argued that properly regulated, US dollar-backed stablecoins could bolster the dollar's position as the world's leading reserve currency.

Trump's stance represents a stark contrast to past regulatory uncertainty, positioning his administration as the most Bitcoin-friendly in US history.

“Together, we will make America the undisputed Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world,” Trump declared. “And it's going to be right here in the USA, the good old USA.”

Since taking office, Trump has signed several executive orders related to cryptocurrency, including:

TradingKey - On March 2, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump fulfilled a campaign promise by announcing the inclusion of five cryptocurrencies in a ""Cryptocurrency Strategic Reserve,"" aiming to make the U.S. the ""World Crypto Capital."" The announcement triggered a surge in the prices of the respective virtual currencies and quickly garnered global attention.

This article delves into the meaning, value, risks, and future trends of cryptocurrency strategic reserves, helping you better understand the potential impact and opportunities in this emerging field.

A cryptocurrency strategic reserve refers to the proactive accumulation and storage of cryptocurrencies by governments or corporations to achieve specific goals or respond to emergencies. Similar to oil reserves, gold reserves, and foreign exchange reserves, cryptocurrency reserves are a form of contingency funds, typically held long-term unless specific conditions are met.

Both governments and corporations prioritize Bitcoin (BTC) as the primary strategic reserve asset, followed by Ethereum (ETH) and other leading altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Ripple  (XRP), and Cardano (ADA).

With the rapid development of the cryptocurrency market, an increasing number of countries and corporations are considering integrating cryptocurrencies into their official reserve assets. The motivations for establishing a cryptocurrency strategic reserve are varied, encompassing financial security, technological innovation, and international competitiveness.

Enhancing International Competitiveness

In the digital economy era, establishing a cryptocurrency strategic reserve can provide a competitive advantage in the global financial transformation, enhancing a nation's international influence. Cryptocurrencies can also be used as tools for cross-border payments and settlements, improving efficiency and reducing transaction costs.  

Addressing Global Economic Uncertainty

During economic crises or financial market turbulence, cryptocurrencies may serve  as safe-haven assets, helping stabilize financial systems. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin was widely regarded as ""digital gold"" by investors to hedge against market volatility. Additionally, cryptocurrencies' low correlation with traditional assets—such as stocks, bonds, and gold— makes them a valuable diversification tool for reducing portfolio risk.  

Promoting Financial Security and Innovation

For nations or corporations facing international sanctions, cryptocurrencies can act as a hedge, helping to ensure the free flow of funds. Establishing cryptocurrency reserves can also stimulate the development and application of blockchain technology, support digital economy infrastructure, and improve the overall efficiency of financial systems.

While these reasons align with the strategic goals of many nations or corporations, the United States—as the world's largest economy—is taking a particularly aggressive stance in cryptocurrency reserves, aiming to consolidate the dominance of the U.S. dollar and establish itself as the global crypto hub.

While cryptocurrency strategic reserves offer numerous advantages, they also pose risks and challenges—primarily related to liquidity, security, and technology:

Risk Type

Description

Volatility

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, with prices capable of significant short-term fluctuations.

Security 

The security of crypto asset storage and transactions remains a major challenge. Hacks, scams, or system failures can lead to losses.

Technology

Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, which is still evolving. Technical flaws, consensus mechanism issues, or software vulnerabilities could impact asset security and effectiveness.

The United States and El Salvador are currently the most committed nations to establishing cryptocurrency strategic reserves.On November 17, 2022, El Salvador launched its ""Daily Bitcoin Purchase"" plan and has since accumulated 6,120 BTC. The U.S., although a latecomer, has made rapid progress. In July 2024, Trump proposed a Bitcoin strategic reserve during his campaign, and by March 2025, he announced the inclusion of BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, and SOL in the reserve, converting 207,000 confiscated Bitcoins into reserve assets.

Following the U.S. lead government officials and politicians in Japan, Russia, Brazil, and Poland have also proposed establishing Bitcoin or cryptocurrency reserves.At the corporate level,, institutions such as Strategy (MSTR), Tesla (TSLA), Block.one, and CoinShares have continued to hold or increase their Bitcoin positions.

Notably, although China has not officially declared a Bitcoin strategic reserve, it holds nearly 194,000 BTC, making it the second-largest national holder after the U.S.However, the Bank of China has stated that it is not yet appropriate to include cryptocurrencies in the country's official reserve assets.

While the primary actors in cryptocurrency strategic reserves are nations and corporations, their transactions take place within the broader crypto market—inevitably impacting market perception, liquidity, and prices, and in turn influencing investor decisions and potential returns.

Category

Specific Impact

Recognition

Inclusion in strategic reserves enhances the legitimacy and recognition of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. 

Liquidity 

Large-scale purchases increase market liquidity.  

Volatility

Long-term holding characteristics may reduce short-term speculation, stabilizing the market. 

Price

Large-scale purchases can alter supply-demand dynamics, driving up cryptocurrency prices.

Competition 

Increased institutional participation may intensify market competition, driving innovation and application expansion.

While the impact on investors is largely positive, potential downsides include excessive speculation leading to market bubbles and fewer opportunities for short-term traders. Therefore, it is essential to objectively both the benefits and risks of cryptocurrency strategic reserves.

Prior to the U.S. initiative, cryptocurrency strategic reserves were often dismissed as a pipe dream or even a joke—with El Salvador frequently cited as an outlier. However, President Trump's proposal and gradual implementation of a national cryptocurrency strategic reserve have turned the concept into a global focal point. This is only the beginning, with far greater developments likely on the horizon.

Regulatory Framework Development

To ensure the legality and stability of cryptocurrency reserves, governments are expected to gradually establish standardized policies and regulations. The Trump administration has begun rolling back many of the restrictive measures from the Biden era, shifting toward more lenient and crypto-friendly policies. On March 20, 2025, Trump also called for Congress to pass stablecoin legislation.  

Technological and Security Upgrades

To mitigate risks of theft or loss, more secure digital wallets and reserve management systems will be essential—driving advancements in blockchain technology and cybersecurity. Future reserves are also expected to prioritize cross-chain interoperability, enabling seamless transactions between different blockchain networks. Multi-chain architectures may become the norm, allowing governments and institutions to diversify reserve assets across various platforms.  

Global Acceleration

As cryptocurrency applications expands, more nations and corporations may adopt incorporate digital assets into their strategic reserves to enhance financial flexibility and reduce reliance on traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro. For countries facing foreign exchange shortages or economic sanctions—such as Russia and Iran—cryptocurrency reserves could offer a crucial tool to circumvent traditional financial systems.  

Asset Diversification

 As the cryptocurrency market matures, investors may increasingly seek diversified asset allocations, expanding beyond Bitcoin into altcoins, stablecoins, and emerging digital currencies.

The rise of cryptocurrency strategic reserves marks a profound transformation in the global financial landscape. The United States' pioneering move to integrate cryptocurrencies into its national reserves reflects both a forward-looking embrace of emerging technologies and a strategic effort to reinforce its financial dominance amid potential shifts in the global monetary system. Other nations—motivated by concerns over U.S. dollar hegemony or recognition of cryptocurrency potential—may gradually follow suit.

Whether cryptocurrency strategic reserves become the norm will depend on market development, regulatory clarity, and the broader evolution of the international financial order. Regardless, this financial chapter has already begun, and its impact is poised to be both far-reaching and enduring.

 Strategy is exploring more ways to raise debt and equity to continue stacking Bitcoin as part of its corporate BTC treasury plan. 

Strategy has announced the pricing of its latest round of perpetual preferred stock, which the company does before announcing more Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions.

According to Strategy, the latest round of preferred stock will be sold at $85 per share, with a 10% coupon, and will bring the company approximately $711 million in revenue.

Market analyst Jesse Myers said that the annual 11.8% dividend distributed to investors from the latest offering suggests that Strategy can now siphon investors from the bond market, which only offers 4.2% interest.

Strategy's most recent BTC purchase occurred on March 17, when the company acquired 130 BTC, valued at roughly $10.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 499,226 BTC, valued at $41.8 billion.

The March 17 acquisition was the company's smallest purchase on record and followed a three-week break in buying. However, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has signaled that the company will raise more debt and sell more equity to fuel its accumulation of Bitcoin.

On March 10, Strategy announced it would periodically sell shares of its 8% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock as part of its plan to raise an additional $21 billion to buy more Bitcoin.

The company followed through on March 18 by announcing a tranche of 5 million shares in Series A perpetual preferred stock to raise additional capital.

Data from SaylorTracker shows the company is still up approximately 26% all-time on its investment and is sitting on over $8.6 billion in unrealized gains despite the recent market downturn.

However, shares of Strategy declined by over 26% in early March since their highest point in January 2025 and plummeted by over 44% since the all-time high of roughly $543 reached on Nov. 21.

Shares of Strategy are currently trading at around $299, up by 29% from the recent low of $231 recorded on March 11.

The company's inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, a weighted stock index that tracks the top 100 companies by market capitalization on the tech-focused stock exchange, injected fresh capital flows into the company but also exposed it to broader downturns in the tech market.

 In the game to establish the US as a “Bitcoin superpower,” is Trump playing alone? 

US President Donald Trump wants to make his country a “Bitcoin superpower,” but the question remains as to who he is competing against. 

Speaking at Blockwork's Digital Asset Summit on March 20 to a crowd of crypto industry executives and observers, he said, “Together we will make America the undisputed Bitcoin (BTC) superpower and the crypto capital of the world.”

The US crypto industry has benefited greatly from preferential executive orders coming out of Trump's White House, including the establishment of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” — a move advocates regard as a key metric for Bitcoin adoption.

However, many other countries, including major US trade partners, are just not ready to take on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, begging the question of who the US is competing against to become a “Bitcoin superpower.”

Compared to major trade partners and geopolitical rivals, the US is certainly far ahead of the game in terms of Bitcoin adoption. Neither the European Union, China, Mexico nor Canada have taken such drastic steps toward institutionalizing the asset.

China, the US' largest trade partner by far and also its most prominent geopolitical opponent, has taken a strong stance against the asset, initially banning it outright before softening its approach slightly. China now allows mining operations but strictly prohibits the use of Bitcoin.

Overall, the government has preferred to concentrate its efforts on developing a retail central bank digital currency in the form of the digital yuan. 

The European Union, another major US trade partner, passed its Markets in Crypto-Assets regulatory framework in May 2023, which came into full implementation by member states at the end of 2024. 

While the EU is ahead of the US in terms of passing concrete legislation, it offers far less preferential terms to the industry than those expected in the US' parallel legislation currently circulating in Congress.

Crypto user penetration in the EU is expected to remain essentially stagnant this year, and cryptocurrency's popularity is low overall among its wealthiest economies. No member state has a Bitcoin reserve.

Even in crypto-friendly Switzerland, which saw $52.4 billion in US service exports in 2024, there are limits to crypto endorsement and adoption. On March 1, Swiss National Bank President Martin Schlegel said Bitcoin wasn't suitable as a reserve asset, citing stability, liquidity concerns and security risks.

Germany's central bank chief, Joachim Nagel, has also dismissed the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has previously criticized Bitcoin as being a poor form of money. 

Related: What Canada's new Liberal PM Mark Carney means for crypto

South Korea doesn't feel ready to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset, with the Bank of Korea stating that BTC is volatile and does not meet International Monetary Fund standards. 

Russia, for its part, has allowed crypto to be used in international settlements to circumvent sanctions. The central bank is also preparing a three-year experiment to allow select investors to trade crypto. Some legal scholars in the country have suggested establishing a crypto fund consisting of assets seized in criminal proceedings, although the Duma has yet to form one.

Critics have questioned the strategic value of the US Bitcoin reserve and who it benefits in the long run. 

Cornell economics professor Eswar Prasad said, “This is neither a strategic nor sensible idea but instead benefits bitcoin holders while sticking US taxpayers with the bill and exposing the government to financial risks. The US government would become a key driver of bitcoin's price on the way up and down.”

As noted by TLDR News, the point of most strategic reserves is to stock commodities that are deemed critically important to the function of a country's economy. Governments can also create them to stabilize the price of goods that are in high demand. The US has strategic reserves of oil and grain, while China even has a strategic pork stockpile. 

The Bitcoin strategic reserve does neither of these, as there is no great demand among Americans for Bitcoin, and Bitcoiners certainly don't want the price to remain stable. 

George Selgin, a senior fellow and director emeritus at the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said the reserve's stated goal of helping pay off US national debt was unrealistic. 

“The plan's million-coin stash would have to more than double in value during its 20-year holding period just to compensate for the plan's implicit interest cost. Second, the stockpile must eventually be sold to realize the gains, and you can bet that the same bitcoin holders who have managed to get the government to keep the bitcoin it already has will cry foul if it ever tries to sell any new coins it acquires,” he stated.

Claims of it serving as a digital Fort Knox are “just as dubious,” he said, as the gold contained therein hasn't propped up the value of the dollar since Richard Nixon was president and took the dollar off of the gold standard. 

Even Bitcoiners have taken a crack at the reserve. Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin and digital asset hedge fund Capriole Investments, criticized the “hold only” policy of the reserve, calling it “disappointing” and a “pig in lipstick.”

Source: Charles Edwards

The reserve even proved to be something of a non-starter for Bitcoin price, with price action remaining relatively stable after Trump signed the executive order on March 6. 

As it stands, the US is leading a race that no one else is running. But things could change quickly. Right-wing parties sympathetic to the creation of Bitcoin reserves have been on the rise in European elections. 

Brazil, a major economy in the Western hemisphere, has also been weighing the possibility of a Bitcoin reserve. 

Furthermore, the US Bitcoin reserve allows the Treasury to purchase Bitcoin so long as it can do so in a budget-neutral manner that doesn't come at a cost to taxpayers. The full effect of the reserve, and its influence on Bitcoin adoption, may yet be felt.

The Lazarus Group, a hacking group closely associated with North Korean, holds more bitcoin (BTC) than Tesla (TSLA), the electric car manufacturer led by Elon Musk, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.  

At press time, Lazarus held 13,441 BTC worth $1.14 billion, according to data source Arkham Intelligence. That's 16% more than Tesla's bitcoin stash of 11,509 BTC.

Last month, Lazarus Group struck crypto exchange Bybit, draining $1.4 billion in ether (ETH) from the platform. Recently, some of the stolen funds have been converted into bitcoin, with 12,836 BTC distributed across 9,117 unique wallets, as Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou confirmed.

Tesla acquired its bitcoin stash four years ago and has been HODLing ever since, making it the world's fourth-largest publicly listed company in terms of BTC holdings.

The striking contrast between Tesla and Lazarus Group emerged even as President Donald Trump's positive stance on cryptocurrency has sparked calls for accelerated BTC adoption among corporations and sovereign nations worldwide.

On Thursday, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to making the U.S. the ""undisputed Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world."" Against this backdrop, it will be interesting to see if Tesla and other U.S. corporations respond to being overshadowed by a North Korean hacker.

Meanwhile, the U.S. government holds 198,109 BTC worth over $16 billion, representing coins seized in enforcement actions. Trump recently announced the same as the strategic reserve.

By Hamza Ameer

Islamabad– Bilal Bin Saqib, who has been appointed as the Chief Advisor to the Finance Minister to streamline and strategise digital asset management, has said that Pakistan will no longer sit on the sidelines and let the opportunity to attract global investment through cryptocurrency trading slide away.

“Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines. We want to attract international investment because Pakistan is a low-cost, high-growth market with 60 per cent of the population under 30. We have a Web3 native workforce ready to build”, said Saqib as Pakistan seriously considers legalising cryptocurrency trading to attract global investment.

“Pakistan stands ninth globally in terms of crypto adoption, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalaysis. In Pakistan, at least 15 to 20 million Pakistanis are currently engaged in crypto trading despite the absence of a formal regulatory framework,” Saqib, who is also the CEO of Pakistan Crypto Currency Council (PCCC), added.

Saqib said that the global political developments have also played an important part in the realization to legalise crypto trading in Pakistan.

“Donald Trump is making crypto a national priority, and every country, including Pakistan, will have to follow suit,” he said.

Cryptocurrency trading has been banned in Pakistan for some time, with authorities cautioning risks regarding use of virtual currencies.

In 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) even sent out a notification, warning all those using virtual currencies/coins/tokens for the purpose of transferring value outside Pakistan.

“Virtual currencies/coins/tokens provide a high degree of anonymity and potentially can be used for facilitating illegal activities. Also, due to the ambiguous nature of virtual currencies, no legal protection or resource is available to any individual in the event of a loss incurred due to highly unstable investments based on speculations,” read a notification issued by the SBP.

“Persons using virtual currencies/coins/tokens for the purpose of transferring value outside Pakistan are subject to prosecution as per the applicable laws,” the notification added.

However, over the years, it seems that the global traction of digital assets management has compelled Pakistan to re-evaluate its stance.

Experts believe that in view of the country's population, which is young and tech-savvy, Pakistan could see a turning point in its economic transformation with the regulation of crypto currency trading.

“Regulating crypto could unlock Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) opportunities and create new revenue streams for the economy,” said economist Shahbaz Rana. (IANS)

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its decision to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash.

The decision follows “the Administration's review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments”.

“Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “Securing the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors is essential to establishing U.S. leadership and ensuring that the American people can benefit from financial innovation and inclusion.”

In August 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash. Back then, the Treasury estimated that Tornado Cash had been used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019.

 Bitcoin narratives like NFTs, layer-2s, and re-staking are fading, with experts citing decreased hype and focus shifting to sustainable growth. 

A Bitcoin layer-2 executive explained how Bitcoin narratives that were “overhyped” have now wholly vanished while the ecosystem develops. 

In a Cointelegraph interview, Bitlayer co-founder Charlie Hu laid out three Bitcoin narratives that he believed were overhyped. This included narratives that surrounded Ordinals, layer-2s and re-staking. 

According to Hu, one of the overhyped narratives in Bitcoin was non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The executive told Cointelegraph that while inscriptions may have gone “to the moon,” Hu said the era is “completely gone.” 

CryptoSlam data shows that in the first quarter of 2024, Bitcoin NFTs had a volume of $1.4 billion. In 2025 Q1, the volume is only at $280 million, showing an 80% drop. The executive believes that the 1,000x days of Bitcoin NFTs may be over and that people can't expect similar “crazy” price performances anymore.

Apart from Bitcoin NFTs, Hu told Cointelegraph that the hype around Bitcoin layer-2 and Bitcoin re-staking has also declined among venture capitalists. 

Hu told Cointelegraph that at least 80 layer-2 networks aimed to get funded at the beginning of 2024 when the layer-2 narrative was strong. The executive said many projects pitched their ideas to investors, the media and different communities. Hu said that while there was some hype, this was “definitely over.” 

Many other crypto executives and entrepreneurs resonate with Hu's point of view about the dying hype around layer-2 ecosystems. On Feb. 20, Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali said the “honeymoon phase” for Bitcoin layer-2s is over. The executive said that most projects will cease to exist as their initial excitement fades.

Meanwhile, Hu also told Cointelegraph that a third “overhyped” narrative was Bitcoin re-staking. He said that at the moment, there are only two or three projects still surviving after the peak of the narrative's hype phase in 2024. 

While some hyped narratives started to fade, Hu believes there are many things to look forward to in the growing Bitcoin ecosystem. The executive said that while layer-2s are a great narrative, they see it more as an engine that powers Bitcoin's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which could allow holders to explore yield opportunities. Hu told Cointelegraph:

Meanwhile, Dominik Harz, the co-founder of hybrid layer-2 Build on Bitcoin (BOB), told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin layer-2s should be seen as a long-term play. 

“Looking at Bitcoin Layer-2s through a short-term lens misses the point. Hype cycles come and go, but lasting developments in crypto, like Bitcoin itself, are inherently long-term plays,” Harz said. 

The executive also believes that Bitcoin DeFi has not yet reached its full potential. “Bitcoin DeFi hasn't even really taken off yet. We're very early. Only 0.3% of Bitcoin's market cap is active in DeFi right now compared to 30% for Ethereum,” Harz told Cointelegraph. 

Harz pointed out this was a 100x discrepancy, saying it would decrease rapidly as Bitcoin DeFi explodes. The executive also said layer-2s are necessary technological advancements for Bitcoin DeFi to hit the market. 

Max Sanchez, the chief technology officer of layer-2 protocol Hemi Labs, also believes that Bitcoin layer-2s are not losing steam. 

He told Cointelegraph that the space is entering a maturation phase where fundamentals matter. Sanchez said that many early projects in the Bitcoin layer-2 space brought technology from Ethereum without adapting it to Bitcoin's unique architecture “in a way that truly extends Bitcoin.”

Sanchez, who works on a hybrid project connecting to Ethereum, also said that building a layer-2 in just one silo and forgoing interoperability with Ethereum-based protocols is a “false notion.”

 Global trade tensions and fluctuating market dynamics are making investors reconsider their crypto strategies, market analysts told Cointelegraph. 

Speculative appetite is vanishing from the crypto markets, as investors are looking for safer digital asset investments following the recent wave of memecoin scams and macroeconomic uncertainty.

Bitcoin's hot supply metric, which measures the Bitcoin (BTC) aged one week or less, is down over 50%, from 5.9% at the end of November to just 2.3% on March 20, Glassnode data shows.

The metric's decline signals an investor shift to safer investment positioning amid the recent market volatility, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.

Global trade tensions and fluctuating market dynamics are making investors reconsider their strategies, the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding:

“This trend isn't solely rooted in fear, it also reflects a more pragmatic approach to investing,” explained Lee.

The stablecoin supply ratio (SSR), which measures the ratio between Bitcoin and stablecoin supply, also suggests that investors are still hesitant to take on significant new positions.

The SSR ratio stood at an over four-month low of 8, last seen at the beginning of November 2024, when Bitcoin was trading at $67,000, just before the post-election rally took BTC to a new all-time high of $109,000.

Historically, SSR values below 10 are considered low, indicating that there is relatively low stablecoin buying power among investors, compared to Bitcoin's market cap.

The cautious crypto investor positioning aligns with the sentiment among traditional market participants, according to Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform.

The cooldown in Bitcoin's hot supply metric shows faltering speculative appetite, according to technical analyst Kyledoops, who wrote in a March 21 X post:

“This means fewer fresh coins in circulation, reduced liquidity, and lower market participation,” added the analyst.

Despite the current lack of risk appetite, analysts remain optimistic on Bitcoin's price trajectory for the rest of 2025, with price predictions ranging from $160,000 to above $180,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes around $84,000 at the time of writing on Friday after recovering nearly 2% so far this week. The recent announcement by the United States (US) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining rewards are not securities could boost BTC investors' confidence. 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision to keep interest rates unchanged and maintain its rate cut forecast for the year, along with a net inflow of $661.20 million from the US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), have supported Bitcoin's mild recovery this week.

The US SEC announced on Thursday that the PoW mining rewards are not securities. The statement revealed that both solo mining and mining pools do not fall under US securities laws as they do not require the efforts of a central entity or entrepreneurial figure to generate profits.

This announcement provides Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with regulatory clarity, reduces legal risks, boosts investor and miner confidence, reinforces its commodity status, and could potentially drive price and market growth.

This week, the institutional demand for Bitcoin showed signs of recovery. According to Coinglass data, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $661.20 million until Thursday, halting the sell-off seen over the past weeks. Bitcoin's price could recover further if this inflow continues and intensifies, indicating a reduction in sell-side pressure.

Bitcoin's price recovered nearly 5% on Wednesday, reaching a high of $87,000, bolstered by the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged and maintain its rate cut forecast for the year. 

However, Fed officials trimmed their growth forecast for the year amid the growing uncertainty over the impact of US President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies on economic activity. Since February, President Trump has imposed a flat 25% duty on steel and aluminum and threatened to impose reciprocal and sectoral tariffs taking effect on April 2, fueling worries about a global trade war. 

On the same day, Donald Trump posted on the Truth Social platform, calling on the Fed to lower interest rates as tariffs start to hurt the economy.

Trump posted: “ The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!”



In addition to supporting macroeconomic data this week, global uncertainty also eases slightly. Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in the Ukraine war. 

Moreover, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Trump agreed to work together to end the protracted Russia-Ukraine war, further boosting investors' confidence toward risky assets like Bitcoin.

However, traders should also keep an eye on the rising tension in Gaza. The Israeli military said that it launched a limited ground incursion into Gaza a day after an aerial bombardment of the Strip that shattered the two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas. Moreover, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of fierce war expansion, which could hinder investors' confidence and lead to a risk-off sentiment in the crypto market.

The Blockworks Digital Asset Summit on Thursday made history as the first sitting US President, Donald Trump, spoke at the event. During his speech, Trump called for US dollar dominance and vowed to make America a crypto superpower.

In an exclusive interview ahead of the summit, Bitfinex Analysts told FXStreet, “President Donald Trump's address at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City marks a significant milestone, as it will be the first time a sitting US president has spoken at a cryptocurrency conference.”

The analyst continued, “Historically, political endorsements have influenced Bitcoin's market dynamics. For instance, following President Trump's announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve, Bitcoin experienced a 7.2% surge intra-day. Similarly, his re-election in 2024, accompanied by pro-crypto sentiments, propelled Bitcoin to surpass the $100,000 mark.”

“Broader macroeconomic factors, such as trade policies and ongoing tariff negotiations, will play a far more significant role in shaping the long-term impact on digital asset markets. While Blockworks' involvement suggests a well-organized media event, the fundamental outlook for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remains unchanged,” Bitfinex Analysts told FXStreet.

Moreover, the US SEC's Crypto Task Force holds the first-ever roundtable on crypto asset regulation on Friday. This roundtable aims to discuss regulatory approaches for crypto assets, building on the SEC's efforts to foster innovation while protecting investors. The roundtable will also be open to the public.

Bitcoin's price broke and closed above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on Wednesday, reaching a high of $87,000 that day. However, it failed to find support and declined 3% on Thursday, closing below it. At the time of writing on Friday, it continues to edge lower, around $84,000.

If BTC continues its correction, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $78,258.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 45 after being rejected from its neutral level of 50 on Wednesday, indicating rising bearish momentum. If the RSI continues to slide, Bitcoin's price could fall sharply.

However, if BTC recovers, breaks, and finds support around the 200-day EMA at $85,508, it could extend the recovery to retest its key psychological level of $90,000.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission Crypto Task Force will host a series of roundtables to discuss key areas of interest in regulating crypto assets. The “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity” series' first-ever roundtable begins on Friday. 

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $84,000 at the time of writing on Friday after recovering nearly 2% so far this week. The recent announcement by the US SEC that Proof-of-Work mining rewards are not securities could boost BTC investors' confidence. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $84,500 on Friday after recovering nearly 3% so far this week. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) find support around their key levels, suggesting a recovery on their cards. 

XRP whale holdings and network activity signal rising optimism among investors. However, signs of bearish sentiment in the derivatives market could hamper XRP's price growth.

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead.

        Share    

Popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple have formed different risky patterns ahead of the closely-watched triple-witching event. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has slipped to $83,580 from the weekly high of $87,158, while Ethereum (ETH) has dropped below $2,000. Ripple (XRP) has fallen from this week's high of $2.59 to $2.35.

A likely reason for this price action is that market participants are waiting for the quarterly triple-witching event on Wall Street. Triple witching is a day that happens on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. On this day, stock options, stock index futures, and index options expire simultaneously.

The upcoming triple-witching event will see options and futures contracts worth over $4.5 trillion expire. Historically, stocks and cryptocurrency prices experience heightened volatility ahead of, during, and after the witching event.

For example, Bitcoin price opened at $97,777 on the last triple-witching event on Dec. 20. It then crashed to $92,200 and ended the day at $97,000.

This quarter's triple witching event is happening as concerns about Donald Trump's tariffs have remained. It also comes two days after the Federal Reserve delivered a muted interest rate decision. While officials warned of stagflation, Jerome Powell noted that inflation would be transitory. The Fed also hinted that it would soon scale down its quantitative tightening policies.

There is a risk that the BTC price will drop ahead of or after the triple-witching event. It has formed a rising wedge pattern, comprising two ascending and converging trendlines. This pattern is on top of the double-top at $108,150 and the death cross that formed on March 14. These patterns point to further Bitcoin price downside, with the immediate target being at $76,890, its March low.

Ether has formed a triple-top pattern at $4,005, with a neckline at $2,140. A triple-top often leads to a strong bearish breakout, and in this case, it has dropped below the neckline. It also moved below the 50-week and 200-week moving averages, pointing to further downside, potentially to the psychological point at $1,500.

Meanwhile, XRP price is at risk of a breakdown even after the SEC ended the Ripple case. The main reason for this is that the coin has formed a head and shoulders pattern whose neckline is at $1.93, with the shoulders at $3. It failed to invalidate this pattern this week by moving above the shoulders level. Therefore, a move below the neckline at $2 risks it dropping to $1.

With Trump's influence, Metaplanet eyes expansion and increased visibility in the US market.

Tokyo-listed Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has appointed Eric Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump, to its newly formed Strategic Board of Advisors.

Metaplanet announced Trump's appointment on March 21, confirming that he will join as the first official member of the new advisory board. The board aims to unite influential voices committed to advancing financial innovation and Bitcoin adoption.

The company stated that this move reflects its dedication to building a top-tier advisory team. Trump brings experience across multiple industries and has become increasingly vocal about Bitcoin and digital assets.

Metaplanet described him as a strong advocate for Bitcoin adoption and a valuable addition to its strategic direction. It added:

“Eric Trump brings a wealth of experience in real estate, finance, brand development, and strategic business growth and has become a leading voice and advocate of digital asset adoption worldwide.”

Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet's Director, expressed optimism about the appointment. He noted that Trump's global business insight and engagement with the Bitcoin community will help accelerate the company's vision of becoming a world-leading BTC treasury firm.

According to Google Finance, the news sparked investor interest, pushing Metaplanet's stock up by over 17% to ¥4,730.

Eric Trump's appointment appears to signal a deliberate step in Metaplanet's international growth strategy.

After listing its shares on the OTCQX in December, the firm has worked to expand global visibility and attract US investors.

Considering this, Trump's son's presence on Metaplanet's board could help boost the firm's appeal among American investors, especially as it positions itself as an emerging alternative to Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy).

Eric Trump has taken a more public role in the crypto space. He is connected to World Liberty Financial, a family-backed digital asset venture. Earlier this month, he endorsed his father's pro-crypto policy and expressed support for both Bitcoin and Ethereum on social platform X.

 Bitcoin is seeing classic manipulatory whale moves on Binance, analysis warns, with BTC price upside capped below $90,000 as a result of liquidity massaging. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is being capped at $87,500 thanks to manipulation by one or more whales, new analysis says.

The latest market coverage by trading resource Material Indicators on March 20 reveals why BTC/USD is stuck in its current range.

Bitcoin has managed to sustain $80,000 as support for more than a week while hitting two-week highs of $87,500 on March 20. 

Despite following broad volatility across risk assets, BTC/USD may have gone even higher were it not for maneuvers of large-volume trading entities on exchange order books.

Looking at global trading platform Binance, Material Indicators argued that shifting blocks of ask liquidity above price were keeping it pinned in a specific area — a classic manipulatory device known as “spoofing,” which has often been used by whales in the past.

“If you are wondering why Bitcoin price hasn't been able to rally past $87.5k yet, the reason is price suppression from Spoofy the Whale,” it summarized in a post on X.

An accompanying chart shows that the liquidity in question currently sits at $89,000. It also tracks investor order classes, showing all but the largest “whale” transactions distributing.

Discussing the data, Material Indicators hinted that support at the recent multimonth lows of $76,000 was insufficient as a firm market floor.

Meanwhile, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades said that the current low-timeframe area of interest at $84,000 was essential for bulls going forward.

“The bulls would want to hold on to the $84K-$85K region to keep the momentum. Otherwise you're at risk of visiting those lower liquidity clusters which then can end up in a full retrace as price is still choppy,” part of his own X post explained.

Daan Crypto Trades paid additional attention to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA), key bull market trendlines that bulls are currently in the process of trying to flip to support at around $85,000.

Businesses can benefit from implementing cryptocurrency in their blockchain applications in several ways:

Overall, implementing cryptocurrency in blockchain applications can provide businesses with cost savings, efficiency improvements, security enhancements, and access to new markets, making it a valuable addition to their operations.

Cryptocurrency development faces several challenges and risks, primarily related to security, scalability, regulatory compliance, and community acceptance. Security is a major concern, as cryptocurrencies are often targeted by hackers due to the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions.

Ensuring the robustness of the underlying blockchain technology and implementing strong security measures is crucial to protect against theft and fraud. Scalability is another challenge, as blockchain networks must be able to handle a high volume of transactions to be viable for mainstream use. Developing solutions that can increase transaction throughput without compromising decentralisation or security is a significant technical challenge.

Additionally, navigating the complex regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies poses risks for developers, as regulatory changes can impact the legality and viability of their projects. Finally, gaining acceptance and adoption from the broader community is essential for the success of a cryptocurrency, and developers must work to build trust and confidence among users, investors, and regulators alike.

Future trends in cryptocurrency development are expected to focus on improving scalability, interoperability, and privacy while enhancing user experience and regulatory compliance. Scalability solutions, such as sharding, layer 2 protocols, and novel consensus mechanisms, will likely be further developed to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees.

Interoperability efforts will aim to create seamless connections between different blockchain networks, enabling the transfer of assets and data across platforms. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and protocols will continue to evolve to address concerns over data protection and anonymity.

User experience enhancements, including easier wallet management and intuitive interfaces, will be prioritised to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the general public. Additionally, regulatory compliance tools and standards will be developed to ensure that cryptocurrencies can coexist with existing financial systems and meet regulatory requirements.

Overall, future trends in cryptocurrency development are expected to drive innovation and adoption, making cryptocurrencies more efficient, secure, and user-friendly.

In conclusion, cryptocurrency development is essential for blockchain applications as it underpins their core functionalities and value propositions. Cryptocurrencies serve as the lifeblood of decentralised ecosystems, enabling secure and efficient peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. By integrating cryptocurrencies, blockchain applications can achieve greater transparency, immutability, and decentralisation, key characteristics that set them apart from traditional systems.

Additionally, cryptocurrency development company enables the creation of custom tokens, which can represent various assets, rights, or utilities within a blockchain network, opening up new possibilities for decentralised applications and smart contracts. Moreover, cryptocurrencies incentivise network participants, such as miners or validators, through rewards or transaction fees, ensuring the security and integrity of the network.

Overall, cryptocurrency development is not only essential for the technical functioning of blockchain applications but also for driving innovation, enabling new business models, and fostering the growth of decentralised ecosystems

Five cryptocurrencies have been delisted by Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, after a regular assessment of their adherence to industry norms. This action demonstrates Binance's dedication to upholding a stable and open trading environment while making sure that all listed assets satisfy its changing needs.

Which cryptocurrencies are being delisted?

According to a statement released by Binance, the digital assets Aergo (AERGO), AirSwap (AST), BurgerCities (BURGER), COMBO (COMBO) and Linear Finance (LINA) will no longer be available on the platform. In support of the delisting decision, the exchange listed a number of factors, including trading volume, security, liquidity, project team commitment and regulatory requirements.

These projects no longer meet the platform's listing requirements, according to Binance's internal review. The affected tokens will be removed from all spot trading pairs starting March 28, 2025, at 3:00 a.m. UTC. Before the deadline, Binance users who own these assets ought to take the required steps to manage their holdings. Furthermore, Binance may, on behalf of users, convert delisted tokens into stablecoins after delivery. This is not a given, though, and if it does apply, a separate announcement will be made.

Margin trading

By March 27, 2025, at 9:00 a.m., UTC positions for AERGO, LINA and COMBO in Binance Futures will be automatically closed and settled. After March 27, 2025, the tokens will no longer be available in Binance Simple Earn and other investment products.

By March 28, 2025, Binance Convert & Trading Bots will no longer support the delisted assets. In addition, Binance revealed plans to launch a Vote to Delist function that would let the public vote on which projects should be delisted. The tokens mentioned in this announcement, however, will not be eligible for this feature.

Binance is constantly making improvements to its listing procedures and trying to keep trading on the platform convenient and safe, ensuring the highest caliber trading experience. Users should follow the delisting deadlines and review their holdings, taking the appropriate action.

On Thursday, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) logged a total of $165 million worth of inflows, according to the data provided by SoSoValue.

It is worth noting that these products have now seen five consecutive days of inflows. This signals that institutional demand is coming back after an excruciating streak of disastrous outflows. As reported by U.Today, Bitcoin ETFs had hemorrhaged more than $6 billion in less than two months due to investors souring on risk assets amid global trade tensions and recession fears.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has accounted for virtually all of the recent inflows, adding $172 million. 

Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) are also in the green with $9.19 million and $5.22 million worth of inflows, respectively.

At the same time, several Bitcoin ETFs bled assets on Thursday, with the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) being the hardest-hit product with a total of $17.4 million. Grayscale's GBTC has also seen outflows totaling nearly $8 million. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price action remains rather anemic. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $84,152 after dipping by 2.1% over the past 24 hours.

Macro guru and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal is leaning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) as the flagship crypto asset hovers around 22% below the all-time high reached in January.

Pal tells his 219,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that the “next part of the year” will be “very strong” for Bitcoin.

According to the macro guru, Bitcoin's future price action is likely to mirror the bullish cycle that occurred after the second halving.

“2017, those of you who remember was an amazing year. And I think we'll see something very similar. Bitcoin priced in those financial conditions which were leading by three months. Bitcoin's already priced it all in. So it's the worst news is in. My guess, probably up only.”

On the timelines for a bullish reversal for Bitcoin, Pal says,

“Basically, we're turning the corner and we should start to see higher prices. And the higher prices will come quick. And the higher prices should take us all the way back to the highs pretty soon. Not soon like in a week or two, but soon like in a couple of months.

So I think what you've all had to go through is a boring sideways consolidation pattern, with a slight down-bias.

Your altcoins have been nuked, but nothing out of the ordinary. We saw this in 2017, we've seen it now and we are very very close to the turnaround.”

According to the macro guru, the crypto market's bullish cycle is still at an early stage.

“We've barely started the cycle. So I know we all say it's so early, nothing's really happened yet. It hasn't. We had phase one of the banana zone, which was the breakout of that consolidation range. This is the consolidation phase two, then we will get into the much more important banana zone phase two. It is all coming.”

A banana zone is a phase in the crypto markets where there are parabolic price moves that present opportunities for out-sized gains, according to Pal.

Bitcoin is trading at $85,201 at time of writing.

Sudan's army announces its fighters have entered the presidential palace in the centre of Khartoum

In recent weeks the army has stepped up its campaign against the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the city, which it lost at the start of the war in 2023

Reclaiming Khartoum would be a huge victory for the army and a pivotal moment in the conflict

But the RSF says it is fighting back and claims to have launched an attack on the palace

The RSF also still controls large parts of the country – including much of the west

The two-year civil war has caused the world's largest humanitarian crisis, according to the UN

New to this story? Here's a summary of the background

Sudanese troops film themselves in presidential palace

Edited by Damian Zane, Wycliffe Muia, Danai Nesta Kupemba and Natasha Booty

We're now pausing our live coverage of events in the Sudanese capital. But you can read an account of what happened on Friday here.

We'll also be publishing more analysis of what's been taking place on the BBC News website.

Extraordinary scenes of jubilant soldiers waving flags at Khartoum's presidential palace have suggested this could be a turning point in Sudan's bitter two-year civil war. But RSF militia are fighting back and the future remains unpredictable.

Here is a reminder of why this matters and where this could all lead:

Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as ""Hemedti"", shakes hands with Kenya's President William Ruto

To much fanfare last month, RSF leaders and their allies announced plans to form a parallel government to rule Sudan.

The fact they held their summit in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and were welcomed with open arms by President William Ruto outraged Sudanese officials, who retaliated by halting imports on all Kenyan goods including tea.

No rival government yet exists as such - at present it is merely a charter outlining what that eventual government could look like.

But the timing was no accident.

The RSF suffered some of its most humiliating defeats in Khartoum in the weeks before the Nairobi announcement, and multiple peace talks have failed in recent months.

Beyond the capital, the army had also won near total control of the crucial state of Gezira.

In other words the momentum has shifted, however temporarily, in favour of the army.

As news comes of the army latest success in clawing back the presidential palace, the RSF has been quick to say it's fighting back and claims to have launched a counter-attack.

The war has left many people in desperate need of assistance

A UN official has said it is too ""early"" to tell if this latest development will make it easier for aid agencies to get access to people who need the most help, in what has been described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

The conflict has prevented a lot of help from getting through.

""We are watching the evolution of the situation and we hope the outcome will be positive for the people,"" said UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Sala. 

Aid agencies have struggled to provide the food and basic necessities that many need they need throughout this war. 

""We have been in this conflict for two years, and it's been unpredictable in nature,"" Ms Nkweta-Sala told the BBC's World At One radio programme.

She called for the opposing sides to respect international humanitarian law. 

A photographer for the AFP news agency, Ebrahim Hamid, was taking pictures on Thursday in Omdurman, which is just over the Nile form Khartoum.

He was capturing some of the destruction that has been caused over the past months of fighting. 

A hospital director showed the photographer the damage wrought by bullets and shelling on her institution:

And Hamid saw how buildings have been reduced to rubble: 

Many people fled Khartoum and Omdurman when the fighting broke out nearly two years' ago. At some point they may return to find much of what they knew has gone.

Alarabiya television has broadcast pictures from inside the presidential palace, showing more images of celebrating soldiers.

It is not clear if these were taken before or after an RSF drone strike, which the paramilitary force said claimed dozens of lives. 

As conflicts rage from Gaza to Ukraine, the devastating human cost of Sudan's war is being overlooked, aid agencies warn. Here are some key facts:



More images have been coming through from earlier today of troops celebrating at the presidential palace. The soldiers have been sharing them on social media:

In the lead up to the assault on the palace, the BBC has access to the soldiers preparing for the battle:

Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Port Sudan

Army spokesman Lt Col Hassan Ibrahim, pictured here last week, is one of those who have died

A military spokesman has been killed in an RSF drone attack on the presidential palace, the army says.

Lt Col Hassan Ibrahim was killed alongside Capt Emad Eldein Hassan, a junior colleague, the army told the BBC. Capt Hassan was once of the military's well-known social media influencers.

Three crew members of Sudan TV were also killed while reporting about the soldiers' advance to the palace. They were a programme editor, a cameraman and a driver. 

The drone attack targeted army troops celebrating inside the Republican Palace, hours after the military recaptured the symbolic building from the RSF.

The RSF spokesperson has said the battle for the palace is far from over.  

""Our valiant forces are still present in the vicinity of the area,"" reads the statement that was issued on Telegram. 

The paramilitary force says it has carried out a ""lightning military operation"" inside the palace , killing at least 89 ""enemy elements"". 

The RSF also says they destroyed various military vehicles and asserts that they will ""continue to fight"".

Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Port Sudan

This is one of the most significant advances the Sudanese Armed Forces have made in the civil war so far. 

It is a symbolic victory, allowing them to reclaim the seat of power in central Khartoum, symbolised by the presidential complex. 

It is also a strategic victory. 

After clearing outer districts of Greater Khartoum, the army has now retaken key locations in the city centre, pushing the RSF fighters further away from sites like government buildings and the military's headquarters. 

This means the RSF has in effect lost its control of the capital, even though its fighters are still present in the city. 

It is not clear though how far the frontline has moved. 

This has changed the direction and dynamics of the war. 

Bloody fighting is expected to continue as the army tries to corner remaining fighters, who still occupy swathes of territory to the south of the palace. 

They also control parts of the nearby airport.

People in the capital are still reeling from what they faced under the RSF soldiers.

But, residents feel relieved and safe now that the territory has been taken back by the army. 

With some saying they would finally be able to sleep at night. 

Millions have been forced from their homes during the civil war and parts of the country are facing famine conditions

Sudan, a predominantly Muslim nation in north-east Africa, collapsed
into civil war nearly two years ago when the military and a paramilitary group
known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fell out.

The
two had been allies, coming to power in a coup six months earlier, but disagreed
over an internationally backed plan to move
towards civilian rule.

The crux of their disagreement was to do with the integration
of the paramilitary group into the army, which is when RSF fighters went on the
offensive capturing much of the capital - and going on to control much of the
western region of Darfur.

The RSF became a powerful player in Sudan under the leadership
of Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted as president in 2019. It had grown out of the ""Janjaweed"" militias linked to genocide in Darfur two decades ago.

The military's capture of the presidential palace may be significant,
but it is by no means the end of the brutal
power struggle that has brought so much suffering to the people of Sudan.

Both sides have been condemned
for war crimes, famine has been declared in several areas and more than 12
million people have been forced from their homes.

In an X post, external, Sudan's diplomats in Tokyo described the presidential palace as a ""living symbol of Sudanese sovereignty and a source of national pride"". 

The picture they shared (above) of an intact palace taken before the conflict began in 2023, contrasts sharply with the images of a ruined building that we're seeing from the soldiers' social media videos.

Peter MwaiBBC Verify

BBC Verify has checked video
and images appearing on social media showing Sudanese army forces around the presidential palace in Khartoum.

We've matched the features of
the buildings and grounds to images available on Google and visible on satellite
imagery and checked that these videos have not appeared before. They show
soldiers celebrating and announcing today's date. 

Celebratory gunfire can also
be heard. 

The footage also reveals
extensive damage to the outside of the palace, as well as destruction inside
one of the buildings.

The RSF paramilitary force has launched a drone attack on the presidential palace killing at least three people, reports say.

The three are crew members of the state-owned Sudan TV,  pan-Arab channels Saud Al Arabiya TV and its sister station Al Hadath reported.  

Sudan TV is yet to comment on the attack which happened a few hours after the army recaptured the palace from the RSF.

It is not clear if the army officers, who have been celebrating inside the palace, were caught up in  the drone attack.  

Many in Khartoum have been surviving on what charitable food kitchens can offer them

A Sudanese activist has told the BBC's Newsday programme that the army's recapture of the presidential palace is a ""very important"" and ""emotional"" moment for many people on the ground in the capital, Khartoum. 

""Everybody was waiting for the military to take over the palace,"" said Duaa Tariq. 

She said no food or basic necessities had been coming in or out of Khartoum for about four months while the opposing sides were fighting. 

And although there is excitement, there is still an underlying fear. 

""We are not sure what will happen next. We are just going to have to sit and wait,"" she said.

RSF still controls parts of the capital (file photo)

The army says it is pursuing fleeing RSF soldiers in parts of central Khartoum and also preparing to enter Tuti island in Khartoum. 

The island, which is located where the White Nile and Blue Nile rivers merge, is still under RSF control.

An army official told pan-Arab news channel Al Hadath that the RSF had a ""limited period to surrender"".

The RSF did not immediately comment on the retaking of the palace and the army's advances in Khartoum.

Elsewhere in Sudan, the paramilitary group said late on Thursday that it had seized a key base from the army in North Darfur, a region in the west of the country.

Some Sudanese have welcomed the recapturing of the palace by the army. 

Mohamed Ibrahim, a 55-year-old Khartoum resident, told the Reuters news agency that the ""liberation of the palace is the best news I have heard since the start of the war"". 

""It means the start of the army controlling the rest of Khartoum.

""We want to be safe again and live without fear or hunger,"" he added.

The two-year civil war has caused the world's largest humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. 

The taking of the presidential palace and - if it happens - the recapture of the entire capital by the army would be a significant moment, but it is not the end of the two-year conflict.

The RSF paramilitary force still controls large parts of the country, including much of the western Darfur region which has seen some of the deadliest violence over the past two years.

Many posts on social media are showing jubilant soldiers waving their guns in the air, cheering and kneeling to pray at the entrance to the presidential palace.

Here are some stills from footage that's been recorded:

European nations supporting Ukraine in the conflict with Russia are shifting away from the idea of deploying troops to the country, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.

The claim is based on public statements from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who this week hosted military planners from 31 countries, as well as insider accounts of the discussions on how European nations could approach the end of hostilities.

Russia has insisted that it will not tolerate troops from NATO countries in Ukraine, regardless of how such a mission is branded by the US-led military bloc. Proponents such as UK leader Starmer have advocated for a so-called “peacekeeping force” to oversee a potential ceasefire.

The FT described a “noticeable shift from European ground troops to air and sea patrols” during a recent phone call regarding Western strategy, citing a participant in the discussion. Additionally, Starmer has reportedly acknowledged that the US will not provide a military “backstop” for any mission in Ukraine, as was publicly stated by the administration of President Donald Trump.

Trump aims to transfer responsibility for Ukrainian security to European NATO members after negotiating a truce with Russia, asserting that the US and NATO should play no role in future arrangements.

Meanwhile, the EU faces challenges in replacing US military assistance for Kiev. Member states failed to reach an agreement on Thursday concerning €40 billion ($43 billion) in additional military aid for Ukraine, a proposal pushed by the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. A less ambitious plan to allocate €5 billion ($5.4 billion) to supply 2 million artillery shells reportedly remains stuck in diplomatic limbo.

JERUSALEM (AP) — A strike in Gaza killed several members of a family Friday as Israel ordered ground forces to advance deeper into the territory and vowed to hold more land until Hamas releases its remaining hostages.



The explosion east of Gaza City killed a couple and their two children, plus two additional children who weren't related to them but were in the same building, according to witnesses and a local hospital. The Israeli army said it struck a militant in a Gaza City building and took steps to minimize civilian harm. It was not immediately clear if the army was referring to the same strike.



The Israeli military said on social media it was planning to conduct raids in three neighborhoods west of Gaza City, and it warned Palestinians to evacuate the area in advance. The warning came shortly after the Israeli military said it intercepted two rockets fired from northern Gaza that set off sirens in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon.



After retaking part of a corridor that divides Gaza's north from south, Israeli troops moved Thursday toward the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah. The military said it had resumed enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City. 



Defense Minister Israel Katz said Friday that Israel would carry out operations in Gaza “with increasing intensity until the hostages are released by Hamas.”



“The more Hamas continues its refusal to release the kidnapped, the more territory it will lose to Israel,” Katz said.











In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was delivered a setback in his attempt to fire the country's domestic security chief.



Hours after Netanyahu's Cabinet unanimously approved the firing Ronen Bar, head of the Shin Bet security service, the Supreme Court ordered a temporary halt to his dismissal until an appeal can be heard no later than April 8. Netanyahu's office had said Bar's dismissal was effective April 10, but that it could come earlier if a replacement was found.

Israel's attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.



A Shin Bet report into Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that prompted the war in Gaza acknowledged failures by the security agency. But it also said policies by Netanyahu's government created the conditions for the attack.

Netanyahu has resisted calls for an official state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack and has tried to blame the failures on the army and security agencies.



A number of senior security officials, including a defense minister and army chief, have been fired or forced to step down. Bar had been one of the few senior security officials since the Oct. 7 attack to remain in office.



The decision to sack Bar deepens a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the 2023 Hamas attack. It also could set the stage for a crisis over the country's division of powers. 



Critics say the move is a power grab by the prime minister against an independent-minded civil servant, and tens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated in support of Bar, including outside Netanyahu's residence on Friday. 



Netanyahu sounded defiant in a social media post Friday evening, saying: “The State of Israel is a state of law and according to the law, the Israeli government decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.” 







Nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel on Tuesday shattered a truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages and brought relative calm since late January.



In the southern city of Rafah, officials said Israeli bombardments had forced residents into the open, deepening their suffering. Officials said they halted the building of shelter camps to protect employees.



Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians. It says military operations will escalate until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive — and gives up control of the territory.

The ceasefire agreed to in mid-January was a three-phase plan meant to lead to a long-term cessation of hostilities, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the return of all hostages taken by Hamas. 



In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas returned 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces also withdrew to buffer zones inside Gaza, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza. 



The ceasefire was supposed to last as long as talks on the second phase continued but Netanyahu balked at entering substantive negotiations.

Instead, he tried to force Hamas to accept a new ceasefire plan put forth by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. 



That plan would have required Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group's main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.



Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the original ceasefire agreement mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.



The militant group has said it is willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.







Hamas said in a statement Friday that the firing of Shin Bet's head shows a “deepening crisis of distrust” within Israel's leadership. It also said Netanyahu used the ceasefire negotiations “to stall and buy time without any genuine intention of reaching tangible outcomes.” 



Netanyahu said he had ordered the resumed strikes on Gaza this week because of Hamas' rejection of the new proposal.



The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.



Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.



The war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and has caused vast destruction across the territory.

Flights to and from London's Heathrow Airport were canceled Friday after a fire at a nearby substation knocked out power to Europe's busiest airport, disrupting travel plans for hundreds of thousands of people around the world.

At least 1,350 flights to and from Heathrow were affected already, including several from U.S. cities that were canceled, flight tracking service FlightRadar 24 said.

Britain's Heathrow Airport will be closed Friday after a fire at an electrical substation knocked out power to the airport and thousands of homes. About 150 people had to be evacuated after a transformer within an electrical substation caught fire in west London.

A large fire near London's Heathrow Airport knocked out power to Europe's busiest flight hub and forced it to shut all day. Travel expert Simon Calder explains how the incident is disrupting global travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers on Friday.

At least 1,350 flights have been disrupted at at Europe's busiest travel hub. Follow live updates. 



LONDON (AP) — The first plane landed at Heathrow Airport late Friday, about 18 hours after an inferno at an electrical substation caused a power outage that shuttered Europe's busiest air travel hub.



The British Airways jet touched down just before sunset after Heathrow lifted its closure order that disrupted global travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers.

At least 1,350 flights to and from Heathrow were affected, flight tracking service FlightRadar 24 said, and the impact was likely to last several days as passengers try to reschedule their travel and airlines work to reposition aircraft and crews.



Authorities do not know what caused the fire but so far found have no evidence it was suspicious.



Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion, followed by a fireball and clouds of smoke, when the blaze ripped through the electrical substation near the airport.



About 120 flights were in the air when the closure was announced, with some turned around and others diverted to Gatwick Airport outside London, Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris or Ireland's Shannon Airport, tracking services showed. 







Lawrence Hayes was most of the way to London from New York when Virgin Atlantic announced the plane was being diverted to Glasgow.



“It was a red-eye flight and I'd already had a full day, so I don't even know how long I've been up for,” Hayes told the BBC as he was getting off the plane in Scotland. “Luckily I managed to get hold of my wife and she's kindly booked me a train ticket to get back to Euston, but it's going to be an incredibly long day.”



Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports for international travel. It had its busiest January on record earlier this year, with more than 6.3 million passengers, up more than 5% from the same period last year.




AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on a big disruption in air travel through London.



Still, the disruption Friday fell short of the one caused by the 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and created trans-Atlantic air travel chaos for months.

It was too early to determine what sparked the huge blaze about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the airport, but there's “no suggestion” of foul play, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said.



The Metropolitan Police force said counterterrorism detectives were leading the investigation because of their ability to find the cause quickly and because of the location of the electrical substation fire and its impact on critical national infrastructure. 



Heathrow said its backup power supply designed for emergencies worked as expected, but it was not enough to run the whole airport. It said it had no choice but to close the airport for the day.



“We expect significant disruption over the coming days, and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” the airport said.

The widespread impact of the fire that took seven hours to control led to criticism that Britain was ill prepared for disaster or some type of attack if a single blaze could shut down Europe's busiest airport.



“The U.K.'s critical national infrastructure is not sufficiently hardened for anywhere near the level it would need to be at to give us confidence this won't happen again,” said Alan Mendoza, the executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, a security think tank. “If one fire can shut down Heathrow ... it tells you something's badly wrong with our system of management of such disasters.”



Tom Wells, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, acknowledged that authorities had questions to answer and said a rigorous investigation was needed to make sure “this scale of disruption does not happen again.”



Heathrow — where the U.K. government plans to build a third runway — was at the heart of a shorter disruption in 2023 when Britain's air traffic control system was hit by a breakdown that slowed takeoffs and landings across the U.K. on one of the busiest travel days of the year.

Heathrow had originally said it expected to reopen just before midnight, but anticipated “significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens.”



After Heathrow announced it would reopen, British Airways said it was cleared for eight long-haul flights to depart from Heathrow after 7 p.m. United Airlines said it expected to operate most of its Friday departures to London. 



Even after flights resume, it will take several days to mobilize planes, cargo carriers, and crews and rebook passengers, said aviation consultant Anita Mendiratta.



“It's not only about resuming with tomorrow's flights, it's the backlog and the implications that have taken place,” she said.

Mark Doherty and his wife were halfway across the Atlantic when the inflight map showed their flight from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport to Heathrow was turning around.



“I was like, you're joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York.



Doherty called the situation “typical England — got no back-up plan for something happens like this. There's no contingency plan.”



At Heathrow, a family of five traveling to Dallas showed up in the hopes their flight home — still listed as delayed — would take off.



But when Andrea Sri brought her brother, sister-in-law and their three children to the airport, they were told by police that there would be no flight.



“It was a waste of time. Very confusing,” said Sri, who lives in London. “We tried to get in touch with British Airways, but they don't open their telephone line until 8 a.m.”



Travelers who were diverted to other cities found themselves trying to book travel onward to London. Qantas airlines sent flights from Singapore and Perth, Australia, to Paris, where it said it would bus people to London, a process likely to also include a train shuttle beneath the English Channel.



Budget airline Ryanair, which doesn't operate out of Heathrow, said it added eight “rescue flights” between Dublin and Stansted, another London airport, to transport stranded passengers Friday and Saturday. 



National Rail canceled all trains to and from the airport.

Matthew Muirhead was working Thursday night near Heathrow when he stepped outside with a colleague and noticed smoke rising from an electrical substation and heard sirens.



“We saw a bright flash of white, and all the lights in town went out,” he said.



The London Fire Brigade sent 10 engines and around 70 firefighters to control the blaze and about 150 people were evacuated from their homes near the power station.



The blaze knocked out power to 67,000 customers, though most of it was restored by daybreak, the fire brigade said. 



Flights normally begin landing and taking off at Heathrow at 6 a.m. due to nighttime flying restrictions. But the skies were silent Friday morning.



“Living near Heathrow is noisy, there are planes every 90 seconds or so, plus the constant hum of traffic, but you get used to it, to the point of no longer noticing,” said James Henderson, who has lived next to the airport for more than 20 years. “Today is different, you can hear the birds singing.”

ISTANBUL (AP) — Thousands of people marched to Istanbul's city hall to rally against the arrest of Istanbul's mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a third straight day on Friday, even as the Turkish leader issued a stern warning, declaring that street protests would not be tolerated. 

Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.

Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

Imamoglu was questioned by police for four hours over corruption accusations, during which he denied all the charges, Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported. He was expected to be transferred to a courthouse Saturday evening for questioning by prosecutors. 

His arrest has sparked the largest protests since 2013, when Turkey was rocked by mass anti-government demonstrations that left eight people dead. 

The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Ozgur Ozel, renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations, while authorities widened a ban on protests and criticized the appeal as irresponsible.




Erdogan, increasingly authoritarian after more than two-decades in office, said the government would not tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of links to corruption and terror organizations.

“An anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,” Erdogan said.

“Pointing to the streets instead of courtrooms to defend theft, plunder, lawlessness and fraud is a grave irresponsibility,” Erdogan said. “Just as we have not surrendered to street terrorism until now, we will not bow to vandalism in the future either.”

Since Imamoglu's arrest, thousands have gathered at Istanbul's city hall for nighttime rallies. Clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, the Turkish capital of Ankara and Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city.

The most violent clash was at Ankara's Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration. Students said rubber bullets were used, but the government denied that.

The Interior Ministry said that more than 50 people were detained and 16 police officers were injured.

On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day ban on demonstrations, following a similar measure imposed earlier in Istanbul. Authorities on Friday announced more road closures in Istanbul and shuttered metro stops near the university in Ankara. 

Ozel, of the opposition Republican People's Party, appealed for people to gather and demonstrate. “I invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,” he said.

“To those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares,” he said. “It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.” 

Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.

The opposition party has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday — through improvised ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey — to show solidarity with Imamoglu.

Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a “trustee mayor,” if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.

Meanwhile, Ozel also said the opposition party would hold an extraordinary party congress on April 6, to thwart any attempts by the authorities to appoint a “trustee chairman” to lead the party. The decision came amid speculation that authorities could annul the party's last congress, held in 2023, over alleged vote-buying and other irregularities, and appoint a handpicked leader.

On Friday, the Borsa Istanbul's benchmark index dropped by around 7%, prompting temporary trading suspensions aimed at preventing panic-driven sell-offs.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te said Thursday that the island's defense budget will exceed 3% of its economic output as it overhauls its military in the face of the rising threat from China. 

Along with the latest equipment — much of it from the United States, the military is seeking funds to retain more service people with higher pay and to lengthen compulsory national service from four months to one year. 

In a speech Thursday to the American Chamber of Commerce, Lai said his administration is determined to “ensure that our defense budget exceeds 3% of the GDP. At the same time, we will continue to reform national defense.”

Lai's comments were the latest reassurance to U.S. and domestic critics who say Taiwan is not spending enough on its own defense. The self-governing island, which relies on the U.S. for much of its cutting-edge weaponry, currently spends about 2.45% of its gross domestic product on its military.

U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that Taiwan increase defense spending as high as 10% of GDP, a proportion well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend, in order to deter China. 

China's actions have also unsettled neighbors in the South China Sea and other parts of the Indo-Pacific.

Leaders in Australia and New Zealand have said China should have given them more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live fire exercises in the seas between the two countries last month, forcing flights to divert on short notice.




Lai said that Taiwan plans to “advance our cooperation with the U.S. and other democracies in upholding regional stability and prosperity.”

China considers the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its own territory and has significantly boosted its military to make good on its threat to invade the island to assert its control. 

Raymond Greene, the de-facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan; Dan Silver, the chamber chairperson; and Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy attended the speech. 

Taiwan and the U.S. have no formal diplomatic ties but American law requires Washington respond to threats toward the island.

Celebrations filled Iraq's Kurdish region on Thursday as people gathered to mark Nowruz, the festival that welcomes spring and the start of a new year.

Thousands gathered in Iraq's Kurdish region on Thursday to celebrate Nowruz, the festival that heralds the arrival of spring and the start of a new year.

Nowruz, deeply rooted in Persian and Iranian traditions, has spread beyond borders and is now embraced by diverse communities across the world.

In Akre, known as the “capital of Nowruz,” men and women carrying torches climbed the mountains as fireworks lit up the sky.

Falling on 21 March, Nowruz symbolises the shift from darkness to light. For Kurds, it carries deep political meaning, reflecting their cultural identity and long struggle for autonomy. 

With over 20 million Kurds across Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Turkey, the festival remains a powerful emblem of unity.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

        Trump accused the Education Department of being ‘wasteful' and polluted by liberal ideology as he moves to advance a campaign promise to dismantle the agency.
    

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday calling for the dismantling of the US Department of Education.

The move fulfils a promise made by the 47th US President in the wake of his 2024 campaign trail. Trump has derided the agency as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology.

The order says the Education Secretary – Linda McMahon – will “to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education, and return authority over education to the States and local communities.”

It offers no detail on how that work will be carried out or where it will be targeted, though the White House said the agency will retain certain critical functions.

Trump said his administration will close the department beyond its ""core necessities,"" preserving its responsibilities for Title I  – a federal program that supports low income students in receiving a high quality elementary and secondary education – funding, Pell grants and money for children with disabilities.

The White House said earlier on Thursday that the department will continue to manage federal student loans, but the order appears to say the opposite.

It says the Education Department doesn't have the staff to oversee its $1.6 trillion loan portfolio and “must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America's students.”

At a signing ceremony, Trump blamed the department for America's lagging academic performance and said states will do a better job. “It's doing us no good,"" he said.

Already, Trump's administration has been gutting the agency. Its workforce is being slashed in half, and there have been deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation's academic progress.

McMahon said she will remove red tape and empower states to decide what's best for their schools. But she promised to continue essential services and work with states and Congress ""to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.”

“The Department of Justice already has a civil rights office, and I think that there is an opportunity to discuss with Attorney General Bondi about locating some of our civil rights work there,” McMahon told reporters after the signing.

The measure was celebrated by groups that have long called for an end to the department. But – advocates for public schools said eliminating the department would children behind in a fundamentally unequal education system.

“This is a dark day for the millions of American children who depend on federal funding for a quality education, including those in poor and rural communities with parents who voted for Trump,” said Derrick Johnson, NAACP President.

Dismantling the agency is most likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979. Republicans said they will introduce legislation to achieve that, while Democrats have quickly lined up to oppose the idea.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the order a “tyrannical power grab” and “one of the most destructive and devastating steps Donald Trump has ever taken”, vowing to fight the order vehemently.

It was as galling as it was predictable.Last Thursday, the UN Human Rights Council released a report accusing Israel – whose women were raped by invading Hamas marauders on Oct. 7 and as hostages in Gaza – of “the systematic use of sexual, reproductive, and other gender-based violence” against Palestinians. Nothing less.  It also accused Israel of “genocidal acts.” Yet again. This was not some keffiyeh-wearing, backpack-hauling protester at Columbia University making audacious claims. It was an officially sanctioned UN body lending its imprimatur to the accusations.Israel's response was equally predictable. AdvertisementHorrid antisemitism, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One of the worst blood libels the world has ever seen, said Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar. A pro-Palestinian demonstration takes place at Columbia University, in New York City, last October, marking the first anniversary of the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023.  (credit: Mike Segar/Reuters)But these statements likely had as much impact on global public opinion as the UN report had on Israeli opinion. A new approach is needed. Einat Wilf – prolific author on Israel and Zionism, articulate lecturer, and former MK in the Labor Party and Ehud Barak's short-lived Independence faction – has a suggestion: Stop focusing on the trees. Look at the forest.Each UN report, each Amnesty International document, is a tree. Stopping at each one means getting lost in the forest.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true.

(credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on.

(credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Last Thursday, the UN Human Rights Council released a report accusing Israel – whose women were raped by invading Hamas marauders on Oct. 7 and as hostages in Gaza – of “the systematic use of sexual, reproductive, and other gender-based violence” against Palestinians. Nothing less.  It also accused Israel of “genocidal acts.” Yet again. This was not some keffiyeh-wearing, backpack-hauling protester at Columbia University making audacious claims. It was an officially sanctioned UN body lending its imprimatur to the accusations.Israel's response was equally predictable. AdvertisementHorrid antisemitism, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents.

This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Israel's response was equally predictable. AdvertisementHorrid antisemitism, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One of the worst blood libels the world has ever seen, said Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar.

(credit: Mike Segar/Reuters)But these statements likely had as much impact on global public opinion as the UN report had on Israeli opinion. A new approach is needed. Einat Wilf – prolific author on Israel and Zionism, articulate lecturer, and former MK in the Labor Party and Ehud Barak's short-lived Independence faction – has a suggestion: Stop focusing on the trees. Look at the forest.Each UN report, each Amnesty International document, is a tree. Stopping at each one means getting lost in the forest.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023.

She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



But these statements likely had as much impact on global public opinion as the UN report had on Israeli opinion. A new approach is needed. Einat Wilf – prolific author on Israel and Zionism, articulate lecturer, and former MK in the Labor Party and Ehud Barak's short-lived Independence faction – has a suggestion: Stop focusing on the trees. Look at the forest.Each UN report, each Amnesty International document, is a tree. Stopping at each one means getting lost in the forest.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends.

She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Each UN report, each Amnesty International document, is a tree. Stopping at each one means getting lost in the forest.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave.

This is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <

She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously.

For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <

(credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support.

It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



IRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends.

For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles.

She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave.

She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <

She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <

I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters.

But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership.

But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership.

For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake.

(JTA) — US President Donald Trump counts “Fiddler on the Roof,” the musical about a Jewish family seeking to maintain their traditions in an Old World shtetl plagued by antisemitism, as one of his favorite Broadway shows, he said while visiting the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. this week.Trump's visit was his first since he dismissed members of the national performing arts center's board and appointed himself its chairman. He spoke at a board meeting and toured the center, according to The New York Times, which both obtained a recording of the meeting and interviewed people who had been present.In his comments, Trump said he possessed musical aptitude but had been thwarted in pursuing a career in the arts by his father, the real estate developer Fred Trump, according to the newspaper. The White House communications director told the Times that Trump “is a virtuoso and his musical choices represent a brilliant palette of vibrant colors when others often paint in pale pastels.”  Taking control of the Kennedy CenterTo take control of the Kennedy Center, which he said had leaned too “woke” in its programming, Trump ousted the former board chair, the Jewish billionaire and philanthropist David Rubinstein, whose family came to the United States from Ukraine — which was part of Russia's Pale of Settlement, the setting of “Fiddler on the Roof.”Trump has not previously been reported to be a Fiddler fan, but the musical has intersected with him before. The comedian Randy Rainbow created a parody of the show's “Tradition!” called “Distraction!” to pillory Trump's response to the pandemic five years ago.Fiddler on the Roof (credit: Wikimedia Commons)And in 2018, a Baltimore man was arrested after shouting “Heil Hitler, Heil Trump” during a performance because, he said, a scene showing a pogrom at a wedding reminded him of his hatred of Trump.

Speaking at the Unity Rally in Jerusalem on Thursday night, hostage families gathered to condemn the push to return to armed conflict with Hamas and insisted a continuation of the war could harm their loved ones. ""We must say this clearly: Returning to war could lead to hostages being accidentally harmed by our forces, or tortured and murdered by terrorists, and could result in losing the bodies of deceased hostages in the rubble,"" the attending families shared in a short statement. ""This is not an outcome the Israeli people can accept.""  The rally, held in Safra Square, saw thousands join in song, prayer, and a collective call to decision-makers to act, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.Families of the hostages speak out against continuing the warOrna and Ronen Neutra, parents of the late Omer Neutra, shared, ""Last week, we participated in bringing recently released hostages to meet President Trump at the White House. In their first days as free people, they chose to overcome immense physical and mental difficulties to share their testimonies with the President and emphasize the urgency of freeing their brothers who are still imprisoned in Hamas tunnels. We must say this clearly: they cannot survive there much longer, and concern for their well-being is growing. Returning to war could lead to hostages being accidentally harmed by our forces or tortured and murdered by terrorists, and could result in losing the bodies of deceased hostages in the rubble. This is not an outcome Israeli society can accept. It is neither moral nor Jewish."" AdvertisementDemonstrators protest for the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, outside Hakirya Base in Tel Aviv, March 17, 2025 (credit: AVSHALOM SASSONI/FLASH90)Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, added, ""A month ago, I saw my brother Evyatar for the first time in 505 days. The world saw that there are flesh and blood souls suffering sadistic abuse by terrorists. What happened when the camera turned off? Were they returned together to the tunnel?That day, I gained two new brothers – Tal and Omer. My two new brothers describe particularly harsh captivity conditions: neglect, complete isolation from the outside world, extreme starvation, random abuse by guards, and lack of sunlight and clean air. Now Guy and Evyatar remain alone. Omer and Tal's strength to fight for Guy and Evyatar doesn't allow us to surrender.""The renewal of fighting in Gaza puts us all under tension and anxiety, especially because of those hostages still left there to rot, facing real and immediate danger. We have no choice but to remain united and fight for the 59 hostages, and deal with Hamas later. Shelly Shem Tov, the mother of Hamas captivity survivor Omer Shem Tov, also shared that ""Omer said he met God so many times in captivity, receiving from Him the power and strength to continue believing he would return home. He told me he always believed he would come home; he constantly saw it there in captivity, and I constantly saw it here. I so want all the hostage families, 59 families – some whose loved ones will return and they'll be able to embrace them, and some who will only be able to bring their loved ones to burial. Every day, there is a matter of life and death. The people of Israel are strong, and our beauty is in our diversity, but our strength is in our unity.""Finally, the brother of the late Uriel Baruch, Roy Baruch, shared that ""Uriel, 35, married and father of 2 wonderful children, was at the Nova party in Re'im and on his way home was shot and kidnapped to Gaza. Fifty-nine hostages are still there, some still alive, and some murdered and held by the cruel enemy Hamas, and all need to be returned home to Israel quickly.

The Heathrow airport in London (LHR), one of the busiest in the world and an important international hub for Indian passengers, was forced shut due to a fire at a power substation near the airport, leading to massive flight disruptions for the day. 

“Heathrow is experiencing a significant power outage across the airport due to a large fire at a nearby electrical substation. Whilst fire crews are responding to the incident, we do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored. To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, we have no choice but to close Heathrow until 23h59 on 21 March 2025,” the airport, which serves as a major gateway for travel between India and the UK, and also as a transit point for those travelling to other parts of Europe or the US, said in a statement. 

According to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, 37 (two-way) flights were to be operated between India and LHR on Friday. Air India had six flights to LHR on Friday with 1,843 seats. As per its website, 1,186 flights are scheduled to operate between LHR and India in March. 

“We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” the airport further said. 

Air India, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic operate direct flights between India and LHR. 

British Airways has eight daily flights to LHR and Virgin Atlantic has five daily non- stop flights to LHR from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. 

“Our operations to and from LHR have been disrupted following the temporary suspension of operations at the airport until 23h59 London time of 21 March… Consequently, Heathrow-bound AI129 from Mumbai is returning to Mumbai; AI161 from Delhi is getting diverted to Frankfurt. All our remaining flights to and from London Heathrow, including AI111 this morning, have been cancelled for 21 March... Flights to London's Gatwick aircraft remain unaffected,” Air India said in a statement. 

Cirium, in an email, stated that 699 flights were scheduled to depart from LHR airport on Friday. “Roughly upwards of 1,45,000 passengers could be impacted. This is an estimate based on the daily total scheduled seats and flights, which will not be full, and noting the various departure times around the world that could arrive at LHR on Friday. On the LHR departures front, upwards of 145,000 total seats are scheduled to fly on March 21. There are 669 flights scheduled to depart March 21, 2025,” it stated. 

A British Airways spokesperson said that as a result of the power outage, customers due to travel from Heathrow on Friday were advised not to travel to the airport until further notice. 

“This will clearly have a significant impact on our operation and our customers and we're working as quickly as possible to update them on their travel options for the next 24 hours and beyond,” a statement from the spokesperson read. 

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said, “Unfortunately, this has had a significant impact on our flying programme, both to and from Heathrow and all Virgin Atlantic arriving and departing flights are cancelled until 21:30 on 21 March…” 

Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International (CSMI) airport also issued an advisory for passengers travelling to the Heathrow airport and requested them to connect with their airlines for information on their scheduled flight. 

Debasish Chakraverty, a Mumbai resident said, “I was aboard the Virgin Atlantic flight VS359 from Mumbai to London on my way to Tampa, Florida on Friday morning. About five-and-a-half hours into the journey, the pilot announced that we would have to turned back and are returning to Mumbai due to the situation at London Heathrow airport. As an Indian American who has lived through the aftermath of 9/11, my first thoughts were that this might be something of a similar magnitude. However, I had opted for Wi-Fi onboard because of which l could learn the actual reason.” 

Chakraverty, however, alleged that the situation had led to chaos at the Mumbai airport as the airport was not prepared to handle the situation. 

However, passengers of the Air India flight that took off from Delhi and had to be diverted to Frankfurt due to the closure, remained stranded in the foreign country. “The passengers were given accommodation, but the status of the flight will be updated once a communication from LHR is received,” an airline official said. 

According to Cirium, marginally fewer flights and seats are scheduled to be flown on Saturday. 

“There are 615 flights scheduled to depart from LHR tomorrow, (with 136,951 seats) and 604 flights scheduled to land in LHR with 134,726 seats,” it said. 

“The impact of this incident can cascade over several days, as aircraft, crew, and passengers are out of place, with limited spare aircraft and seats available to recover passengers,” it concluded.

Hinting that Elon Musk's role in the US government will have limits, President Donald Trump on Friday said war plans should not be shared with his adviser and closest ally, Elon Musk, because of his business interests in rival countries.

Elon Musk, one of the world's richest people in the world, had supported Donald Trump's campaign with rhetoric as well as monetary donations. After the latter became the president of the most powerful country in the world in January, he asked Musk to spearhead his ambitious programme to cut government spending and enhance efficiency by downsizing federal departments.

However, on Friday, Donald Trump hinted there would be limits to Musk's involvement in strategic affairs. Trump made the comments during an Oval Office meeting on developing a new fighter jet, and he rejected reports that Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China, reported AP.

Donald Trump said since Elon Musk has businesses in China, he could be susceptible to the country's influence.

“Elon has businesses in China,” the Republican president said. “And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that.”

Trump, however, praised Elon Musk as a patriot.

Musk has manufacturing facilities in China for his Tesla cars.

Trump had previously brushed off questions about Musk's potential conflicts of interest, simply saying that he would steer clear when necessary.

The president said that Musk visited the Pentagon on Friday morning to discuss reducing costs, which he's been working on through the Department of Government Efficiency, which he leads.

There were allegations that Musk received a classified briefing on China.

China, the world's second-largest economy, is the United States' most formidable strategic rival. Recently, Trump imposed additional tariffs on Chinese imports. Beijing also imposed reciprocal tariffs.

 New Delhi, Virat Kohli has the skill to score runs at a much better strike-rate like any young T20 star but RCB's team composition is such that he needs to adopt a risk-free approach and aim for a high scoring season, says former Australia skipper Aaron Finch. 

 Finch, who led Australia to T20 World Cup victory in UAE back in 2021, feels that high-risk cricket, which someone like Rohit Sharma is playing consistently, has its own pitfalls with regards to consistency. 

 After some underwhelming seasons, Kohli managed a strike-rate of near 140 in 2023 and his best in all IPL seasons came in 2024 where he scored 741 runs at 154.70. 

 So does Virat Kohli need to change his game for RCB to take full advantage, considering that their bowling lineup might not be as good as others? 

 ""Well, the question you have to ask yourself is, do you want 700 or 800 runs or are you happy with 400? Because if you want Virat to strike higher, he can absolutely do that. But with that comes a higher risk and the consistency will go down,"" Finch, a JioStar expert, told PTI in an exclusive interaction ahead of the start of 18th edition of the league. 

 ""So I don't think that there's a huge need to change. Maybe it's changing the tempo up slightly. But overall, I would bank on his runs every single day of the week. And then you start to build your team around somebody like that."" 

 Finch admitted game has changed upside down in terms of how teams are approaching Powerplay overs but each batter's strength is different. 

 ""It's not just about people who walk out of the change rooms and strike at 200 from ball one. I think that that's unrealistic to ask seven batters to do that all in the one team. Because when it doesn't go well, you lose the game. 

 ""I know that the game has gone to a new level in the last two seasons. But you still need to have the foundations and you still need to have that person there that's able to strike and bat deep into the innings."" 

 While Rohit's IPL strike-rate is quite similar to Kohli, in the last phase of his T20I career, he took more risks than ever and also made significant gains at the top of the order. 

 But Finch, an accomplished opener back in the day, put things in perspective about quality of players in that Mumbai Indians line-up, who can pick up pieces and play with same momentum if things go adrift. 

 ""... when you look at the way that Rohit's done it, have a look at the players that he's had around him. He's still had the foundations of a player that the team can bat around him. So it's okay to walk out and swing from the hip and look to try and dominate and hit a lot of sixes from early in your innings. But you have to understand the dynamics of the team around that."" 

 The Mumbai Indians line-up featured Hardik Pandya, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma in the top and middle order. 

 Rohit could afford that risk for India because he had Kohli around him, said Finch. 

 ""When you look, when Rohit's made that conscious decision, he's had Virat coming in behind him at number three. So there's an ability for him to say, you know what, I've got the guy behind that will fix any mistakes that I make. 

 ""But you can't have everybody in the team just looking to swing for the fences from ball one. So that's a really, that's a good question. And I understand that Rohit's done that and he's been very successful doing it."" 

 Finch believes if Kohli bats at a strike-rate of 150, that is job done. ""Maybe if his strike rate goes from 140 to 150, he can absolutely do that. No issues whatsoever. But how many times has he been in a situation where he's had to almost dig RCB out of the hole because everybody else has fallen around him? 

 ""So like I said before, I would bank the runs every day of the week from a top three player. Because that gives the rest of the order so much freedom. That gives you the option to be more aggressive from the other batters,"" he explained.

Amid a spike in abductions and enforced disappearances of Baloch nationals, morgues have been kept out of bounds for local residents who live in fear and uncertainty of their loved ones who are missing.

As bodies lined up over the past week, locals were demanding security agencies to allow them to visit morgues to identify if their missing family members were among those dead. But that was reportedly denied by the Pakistani establishment.

The Baloch Yakjehti Committee, a human rights organisation, has been protesting the gross violation of human rights by Pakistan's military in the war-ravaged region. But they too are facing a crackdown.

After days of protest over ""enforced disappearances"" of Balochis and for not being allowed to visit morgues as bodies piled up, protesters and local residents reportedly barged into the Civil Hospital in Balochistan's capital city Quetta. As per local reports, several corpses were taken away by them.

It is not yet known, if these bodies were taken away after identification or not.

The Pakistan Army says the bodies at the morgue were of members of the militant organisation Baloch Liberation Army, which has been carrying out an armed rebellion against Pakistan for its ""illegal occupation"" of Balochistan.

The BLA had taken an entire train - Jaffar Express - hostage earlier this month, before reportedly releasing women, children, and Baloch passengers, keeping mostly personnel of the Pakistani security forces hostage. Pakistan's Army had launched a military offensive against them.

To get back the corpses, Pakistan's security agencies launched a search operation. Raids have been carried out in Sariab Road and Secretariat Chowk areas in Quetta. Three bodies have reportedly been recovered and several people have been arrested.

""Corpses that were taken away were the unidentified bodies of militants who were killed in the military operation following the attack on the Jaffar Express,"" said a government official.

Activists of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee also confirmed the incident, saying some of the protesters, which included family members of missing persons, had taken away a number of bodies. ""We had been trying to gain access to the morgue for two days to satisfy the missing persons' family members that the bodies kept there were not of their loved ones,"" said a BYC member.

The Baloch Yakjehti Committee, led by rights activist Mahrang Baloch, is now under Pak spy agency ISI's scanner. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The police in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, have shared their key findings in the murder of a former Merchant Navy officer allegedly by his wife and her lover. Saurabh Rajput's body - chopped up into 15 pieces - was found in a drum sealed with cement. He was killed on March 4, more than a week after he had returned from abroad to celebrate his daughter's birthday. His wife Muskaan Rastogi and friend Sahil Shukla, with whom she had an extramarital affair, were later arrested.

A top police officer overseeing the probe has answered 10 questions after the grisly murder sparked speculation over black magic, Muskaan's alcohol addiction, and her alleged aspiration to make it big in Bollywood.



Ayush Vikram Singh, the Superintendent of Police, Meerut City said the police are still investigating the motive and shared the evidence so far collected.

The officer said Muskaan and Sahil had confessed to killing Saurabh. They sealed the victim's body in a drum with cement and fled to Himachal Pradesh. When they returned two days later, they were taken into custody. They admitted their crime during questioning. The weapon used in the murder has also been recovered.

The Extramarital Affair

Muskaan and Saurabh had a love marriage in 2016, but their joy was short-lived.

Mr Singh said Saurabh learnt about Muskaan's affair back in 2021. Their landlord had informed him after spotting Muskaan and Sahil in an ""objectionable"" situation.

""During her interrogation, Muskaan said that she was in an illicit relationship with Sahil since 2019. Saurabh was aware of this and had filed for divorce in 2021. But his family had convinced him to stay with his wife,"" said the SP.

Muskaan has claimed that Sahil was a liquor addict, which often led to quarrels between them. Sahil was also in a financial crunch and her family used to bear his expenses, including rent, she told the police.

An Earlier Attempt

Her family had earlier accused Sahil of getting her addicted to drugs. The police have confirmed that they consumed liquor as frequently as they met, but Muskaan claimed she used to drink even before she met Sahil.

""Since 2023, Saurabh worked at a bakery in London. He came back to India on February 24. The accused tried to kill him on February 25 but could not succeed. They finally executed their plan on March 3,"" said Mr Singh.

Mr Singh said that two teams have been formed to probe the murder. The police have identified the shop from where they bought the drum and other materials allegedly used in the murder, and the shopkeeper has been questioned.

The officer said a police team would leave for Shimla soon to collect more evidence.

""We are collecting information about the places where they went outside Shimla, their phones have been sent for forensic test...so that we can file a chargesheet as soon as possible and give them the harshest punishment through the court,"" said Mr Singh.

Black Magic?

The severed pieces of the victim's body had raised suspicion that there could be a black magic angle, but the officer said no such evidence had been found. It was a well-planned murder, and the black magic angle could be misdirection, he said.

""This was a murder carried out after a well-thought-out conspiracy. To dispose of the body, they could have planned to get rid of the drum as well. They will be questioned what they were going to do with the drum,"" said Mr Singh.

Allegations Over Money

Muskaan claimed that Saurabh had Rs 6 lakh in his account, and out of fear that the money could be seized, he had transferred Rs 1 lakh to her account and about one and a half lakh to his mother's account. The officer said her claims are being verified. They are also checking when Saurabh had gone to London and his activities there.

Saurabh's job in the Merchant Navy and claims that he did not continue education beyond school are yet to be verified.

On Saurabh's family alleging that his in-laws used his money to buy a house and other expensive gadgets, the officer said if such evidence is found it will be added to the charges against the accused.

The murder came to light after Muskaan and Sahil returned from Shimla. Their landlord had sent labourers to vacate the house. When asked about the heavy drum, Muskaan had said it was full of junk and left for her parents' house. But finding a foul smell, they suspected something amiss and called the police.

Muskaan confessed to her mother, who reported her to the police.

Asked whether the victim's daughter knew about her father's death, his mother Renu Devi said the six-year-old girl had been telling neighbours, ""Papa is in the drum."" ""She must have seen something.""

Community impact hearings offer outlet for grievances and gather evidence for ongoing lawsuits, totaling 10 so far

A Minnesota veteran who found work at the Veterans Benefits Administration after suffering two traumatic brain injuries on overseas deployments stood in front of hundreds of people and five Democratic state attorneys general on Thursday night and recalled the moment she learned she lost her job.

“All I was given was a Post-it note,” Joy Marver said, inspiring gasps and boos from a raucous crowd. “The Post-it note contained just the HR email address and my supervisor's phone number. This came from an external source. Doge terminated me. No one in my chain of command knew I was being terminated. No one knew. It took two weeks to get my termination email sent to me.”

The firing was so demoralizing she said she considered driving her truck off a bridge but instead went into the VA for crisis care.

“Don't fuck with a veteran,” she concluded.

The story was one of many shared by former federal workers and others impacted by the Trump administration's policies during a town hall in St Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday, part of a national tour that has offered an avenue for grievances against Donald Trump's first two months, but also a way to gather evidence for ongoing lawsuits, totaling about 10 so far, that Democratic attorneys general have filed against the Trump administration.

“Everybody's putting in double duty. But the point is, we're absolutely up to it. We got four and a half years of gas in our tanks, and we're here to fight for the American people all the way through,” Ellison told reporters before the event began.

The community impact hearings, as they're calling them, kicked off in Arizona earlier this month and will continue in Oregon, Colorado, Vermont and New York, the attorneys general said. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Kris Mayes of Arizona, Letitia James of New York, Matthew Platkin of New Jersey and Kwame Raoul of Illinois attended the event in Minnesota on Thursday, where the crowd filled a high school auditorium and spilled into an overflow room.

Attendees were given the opportunity to take the mic and share their stories.

Another veteran who worked at the Veterans Benefit Administration was fired via email by Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency”, she said. She was part of the probationary employee purge, and her supervisors didn't know she was let go. She recalled that her boss' response to her firing was: “WTF”.

A probationary employee at an unnamed federal agency said she was also let go. She interviewed and did background checks for 11 months to secure her federal role. “Now we are forced to put our plans of starting a family, of owning a home on hold indefinitely, and I feel that this disruption of this dream will be felt for the rest of our lives,” she said.

A former employee of 18F, the federal government's digital services agency, said they were laid off in the middle of the night on a weekend. “I'm grieving. We didn't deserve this,” they said. A former USAID worker said she watched as Doge moved through the agency, accessing files and threatening employees if they spoke up, before she was fired.

After several probationary employees shared their stories, Arizona's Mayes cut in to ask whether the Trump administration or their agencies had reached out to rehire them. The Democratic attorneys general secured a win in a lawsuit over these firings, and a judge ruled they needed to be reinstated. If that wasn't happening, Mayes said, they needed to know.

“We can bring a motion to enforce,” Ellison explained. “We can bring, perhaps, a motion for contempt. There's a lot of things. But if we don't know that, we certainly can't do anything.”

after newsletter promotion

Before the town hall began, the attorneys general said that they had secured temporary restraining orders halting or reversing Trump administration directives in nearly all of their cases so far. In several instances, they have had to file additional actions to get the administration to comply with the orders. In a case that ended a “pause” on federal grants, for example, the pause was ended – but some programs still were not restarted. James said they had to file a motion to enforce to get those programs running again.

Trans people shared how the Trump administration's disdain for their community was affecting them. A young trans athlete was kicked off her softball team, her mom shared. A trans veteran was worried about her access to life-saving healthcare. Doctors who treat trans youth said their patients are on edge.

Immigrants and people from mixed-status families talked about the specter of deportation and how the threat loomed over their day to day. One woman said her mother's partner was deported, as was her husband's uncle. She worries daily whether her mom is next. “The Trump administration has impacted me deeply during these past two months alone, but more than ever, we have to come together organized because I'll be damned if they keep hurting my family,” she said.

Suzanne Kelly, the CEO of the Minnesota Council of Churches, said her organization, which helps resettle refugees, is losing $4m in federal funds that would go directly to their clients, an amount that can't be replaced with local dollars. She has had to lay off 26 employees, most of whom are refugees or asylees themselves. Refugees they were expecting to help are now stranded overseas in refugee camps, she said. People already here will lose rental aid and other assistance.

“Whatever your faith tradition, please pray with us for those individuals, and pray with us for this country. We're better than this,” Kelly said.

After two hours of testimony a Minnesota activist stood up and shared their vision of the way forward: “The first step of that call to action is just to get fucking angry, man.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Researchers spot orange Maori octopus clinging to back of large shark off coast of New Zealand in December 2023

Footage of an octopus riding a shark has stunned scientists – and delighted marine animal enthusiasts.

Researchers spotted the orange Maori octopus clinging to the back of a large shortfin mako shark in the Hauraki Gulf off the northern coast of New Zealand in December 2023. The University of Auckland research team was searching the ocean for feeding frenzies at the time.

The marine scientist Rochelle Constantine was confused at first about what exactly she was seeing, thinking the orange patch on the shark's head might be an injury.

“At first, I was like: ‘Is it a buoy?'” Constantine told the New York Times. “‘Is it entangled in fishing gear or had a big bite?'”

A technician set up a drone for a closer look. As they drew nearer, they saw tentacles – thereby discovering the world's first “sharktopus”.

The Maori octopus is the largest octopus in the southern hemisphere. “You can see it takes a fair amount of real estate on the shark's head,” Constantine said.

Octopuses are typically found on the seabed, which shortfin mako sharks rarely visit, making the incident even stranger.

“We moved on after 10 minutes, so I can't tell you what happened next,” Constantine told Oceanographic. “The octopus may have been in for quite the experience, though, since the world's fastest shark species can reach 50km per hour.”

She said the unusual encounter is another example of how much of the ocean and marine life is still unknown, including the crucial and diverse role sharks play in the marine ecosystem.

“The ‘sharktopus' encounter is a reminder of the wonders of the ocean,” Constantine said. “One of the best things about being a marine scientist is that you never know what you might see next in the sea. By supporting conservation initiatives, we can help to ensure that such extraordinary moments keep happening.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Politicians and teachers unions condemn president's effort to axe department, which can only be done by Congress

Teachers unions and Democratic politicians joined in denouncing Donald Trump's executive order aimed at eliminating the US Department of Education, with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) saying simply: “See you in court.”

Trump's move was long trailed, so much so that Randi Weingarten, the head of the AFT – which represents 1.8 million teachers – put out her statement the day before the order was signed. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents 200,000 members, teachers and other education workers mostly in New York City, said: “We will join our national union and public education allies to protect students and educators. We are working with our partners to file lawsuits to stop this executive overreach.

“In the meantime, we will hold the federal government accountable for providing the resources our school communities have been promised under the laws of our country.”

Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said: “Trump is telling America's public school kids that their futures don't matter.”

Referencing Elon Musk, the world's richest man, whose drastic cuts to federal budgets and staffing are prompting outrage, Warren said: “Billionaires like Trump and Musk won't feel it when afterschool programs are slashed, class sizes go up, and student aid gets cut. It'll be working parents, students and teachers who pay the price.”

Rashida Tlaib, a congresswoman from Michigan, said Trump's order was “really alarming to me because the majority of Americans will tell you they don't want to give up on the Department of Education, they don't want to give up on our education system”.

Polling shows the majority of people in the US oppose dismantling the Department of Education.

This week, a survey from the advocacy group New America found 55% of respondents against eliminating the department. Another group, Third Way released a poll showing majority support among Republicans for issues including improved accountability for federal funding in higher education – a core responsibility of the education department.

Eliminating the department has long been a goal of some parts of the Republican right. On Friday, Margaret Spellings, education secretary under George W Bush, who expanded the department's role, told the Associated Press that Republicans in Congress traditionally voiced support for elimination while voting against it, mindful of how federal funds reach schools in their districts.

“It was always a little bit of a wink and a nod deal,” Spellings said. “Donald Trump has called the bluff.”

The Department of Education's role is primarily financial, dispensing federal funds nationwide. It also upholds civil rights protections such as Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination.

Trump's order will not eliminate the department entirely. Created by Congress in 1972, it can only be eliminated by the same body.

John King Jr, who was education secretary under Barack Obama, told NBC: “I think what you're going to see is bipartisan support in Congress for maintaining the vital functions of the department” – including, he said, “directing resources to vulnerable students, low-income students and students with disabilities, funding the Pell grant program and the student loan program that makes it possible for Americans to access higher education, and civil rights enforcement, which has been the historical role of the department”.

After Trump signed his order, Linda McMahon, the wrestling impresario turned education secretary charged with wrecking her own department, hailed what she called a “history-making action” and said: “We are sending education back to the states where it so rightly belongs.”

King called that “a rhetorical move”. He continued: “The reality is that most decision making about education happens at the state and local level, but there is a crucial federal role that goes back to the civil rights movement … Laws were put in place because we needed the federal government to step in to make sure that students weren't discriminated against, and that role continues.

“We need the federal government to say to a state: ‘You can't ignore the needs of your English learners.' To say to a district: ‘You can't leave Black students or Latino students out of access to advanced placement classes or extracurricular activities at your school. That civil rights role has to be protected.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

New aircraft, to be called F-47, is intended to operate alongside drones 

Donald Trump on Friday awarded Boeing the contract to build the US air force's most sophisticated fighter jet, handing the company a much-needed win.

The Next Generation Air Dominance program will replace Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor with a crewed aircraft built to enter combat alongside drones. The plane's design remains a closely held secret, but would probably include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines.

The Seattle-based company beat out Lockheed Martin for the deal. Shares of Boeing were up 5% after the news. Lockheed's shares fell nearly 6%. Reuters reported Boeing's victory before the official announcement.

Trump, the 47th US president, announced the winner from the White House, saying the new jet will be called the F-47.

For Boeing, the win marks a reversal of fortune for a company that has struggled on both the commercial and defense sides of its business. It is a major boost for its St Louis, Missouri, fighter jet production business.

The engineering and manufacturing development contract is worth more than $20bn. The winner will eventually receive hundreds of billions of dollars in orders over the contract's multi-decade lifetime.

NGAD was conceived as a “family of systems” centered around a sixth-generation fighter to counter adversaries such as China and Russia.

Boeing's commercial operations have struggled as it attempts to get its bestselling 737 Max jet production back up to full speed, while its defense operation has been weighed down by underperforming contracts for mid-air refueling tankers, drones and training jets.

Cost overruns at the KC-46 mid-air refueling tanker program have surpassed $7bn in recent years, while another fixed-price contract to upgrade two Air Force One planes has created a $2bn loss for the top-five US defense contractor.
 Lockheed, which was recently eliminated from the competition to build the navy's next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter, faces an uncertain future in the high-end fighter market after the loss.

The billionaire and presidential adviser Elon Musk has voiced skepticism about the effectiveness of crewed high-end fighters, saying cheaper drones were a better option.

While Lockheed could still protest against the award to Boeing, the fact Trump announced the deal in a high-profile Oval Office press conference could reduce the possibility of a public airing of arguments against the agreement from the defense firm based in Bethesda, Maryland.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President says plans for potential war with China would not be shared with billionaire due to his business interests

Donald Trump said on Friday that plans for possible war with China should not be shared with Elon Musk because of his business interests, a rare admission that the billionaire faces conflicts of interests in his role as a senior adviser to the US president.

Trump rejected reports that Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China, saying: “Elon has businesses in China. And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that.”

The reference to Musk's businesses – which include Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer trying to expand sales and production in China – is an unusual acknowledgment of concerns about Musk balancing his corporate and government responsibilities.

Trump had previously brushed off questions about Musk's potential conflicts of interest, simply saying that he would steer clear when necessary.

The president said that Musk visited the Pentagon on Friday morning to discuss reducing costs, which he has been working on through the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said Musk was there “to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations”.

Musk said while leaving the Pentagon that he was ready to do “anything that could be helpful”. He also refused to answer questions as to whether he received a classified briefing on China as part of the visit.

As a key adviser to Trump and the head of Doge, Musk has exercised broad powers in the two months since Trump returned to the White House, conducting mass layoffs and slashing budgets across the federal government. But while the Pentagon was also in line to be a target for job cuts, Musk has yet to play any role there, including in defense intelligence and military operations.

A senior defense official told reporters on Tuesday that roughly 50,000 to 60,000 civilian jobs would be cut in the defense department.

Musk's involvement in any US plans or dealings with China would raise not only security concerns but questions over a significant conflict of interest, as he has considerable economic interests in China as the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, which also has contracts with the US air force.

In the early hours of Friday morning, Musk denied the reports that he would be briefed on war with China, calling it “pure propaganda” and threatening to find those who leaked the information.

“I look forward to the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information,” he wrote. “They will be found.”

Musk repeated his demand for such prosecutions upon arrival at the Department of Defense on the outskirts of Washington DC on Friday morning. He left the Pentagon about 90 minutes after arriving.

A Pentagon spokesperson, asked by email to explain the true purpose of Musk's briefing given administration denials that it would involve putative war plans with China, referred the Guardian to a statement posted on social media by Hegseth.

In a Friday meeting at the White House to announce new air force fighter planes, Trump and Hegseth both firmly rejected reports that Musk was shown any Pentagon plans regarding a potential conflict with China during his visit earlier that day.

“They made that up because it's a good story to make up. They're very dishonest people,” Trump said about the New York Times reporting. “I called up Pete [Hegseth] and I said: ‘Is there any truth to that?' Absolutely not, he's there for Doge, not there for China. And if you ever mentioned China, I think he'd walk out of the room.”

Hegseth echoed Trump's notion that the visit was focused on discussing government efficiency initiatives and innovation opportunities, adding that there were “no Chinese war plans”.

“We welcomed him today to the Pentagon to talk about [the ‘department of government efficiency'], to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations. It was a great informal conversation,” he said.

Hegseth suggested the reporting was deliberately intended to “undermine whatever relationship the Pentagon has with” the Tesla CEO.

According to a New York Times report, the meeting was set to take place not in Hegseth's office, where informal meetings about innovation would normally take place, but in a secure conference room known as “the Tank”, which is typically used for higher-level meetings. Musk was to be briefed on a plan that contains 20 to 30 slides and details how the US military would fight a conflict with China.

Officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal offered up potential reasons why Musk was receiving the briefing. The Times suggested that Musk, in his Doge capacity, might be looking into trimming the Pentagon's budget and would need to know what military assets the US would use in a potential conflict with China.

One source told the Journal that Musk was receiving the briefing because he asked for one.

Though Musk has a “top-secret” clearance within the federal government, lawyers at SpaceX advised him in December not to seek higher levels of security clearances, which would probably be denied due to his foreign ties and personal drug use.

As Trump pushes ‘drill, baby, drill' agenda, Greenpeace verdict offers startling outlook for environmental activism

A pipeline company's victory in court over Greenpeace, and the huge damages it now faces, will encourage other oil and gas companies to legally pursue environmental protesters at a time when Donald Trump's energy agenda is in ascendancy, experts have warned.

On Wednesday a North Dakota jury ruled that three Greenpeace entities collectively must pay Energy Transfer, which was co-founded by a prominent Trump donor, more than $660m, deciding that the organizations were liable for defamation and other claims after a five-week trial in Mandan, near where the Dakota Access pipeline protests occurred in 2016 and 2017.

“This verdict will embolden other energy companies to take legal action against protesters who physically block their projects,” said Michael Gerrard, the founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.

“It will chill those kinds of protests; whether the chilling goes beyond that remains to be seen. It won't inhibit litigation against fossil fuel projects; we will surely see more of those as the Trump administration advances its ‘drill, baby, drill' agenda.”

Kevin Cramer, the US senator from North Dakota, cheered Wednesday's huge judgment against Greenpeace over the pipeline protests in his state, congratulating the energy company who sued the environmental group for its big win.

Justice was served, he said. “They can think twice now about doing it again,” he said of Greenpeace and other environmental groups who protested against the Dakota Access pipeline.

Brian Hauss, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said that the lawsuit served as a “tax on speech”, one that makes it too expensive to go against “litigious, deep-pocketed corporations”.

“If companies can sue critics, advocates and protesters into oblivion for their speech and the unlawful acts of third parties, then no one will feel safe protesting corporate malfeasance,” Hauss said.

In the days since the ruling was issued, environmental groups and protest movements have reacted with shock and dismay, warning that its impact stretches far beyond any individual organization.

Amnesty International said the “devastating verdict sets an array of deeply damaging precedents on the rights to freedom of speech, association and peaceful protest and puts the very future of Greenpeace at risk”.

Some legal experts were surprised the case even made it before a jury. Similar claims often get tossed out over first amendment concerns or because many states prevent so-called Slapp suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation). North Dakota doesn't have an anti-Slapp law.

Greenpeace's goals – such as protecting the climate and preserving oceans – won't change, said Sushma Raman, the interim executive director of Greenpeace USA. But “it's really going to be a question of capacity and prioritization, which happens in any organization that is facing an existential threat of this kind,” Raman said.

“Ultimately, this isn't about the money for them,” Raman said of Energy Transfer. “It's really about sending a message, and it's trying to silence an organization that they feel is a thorn in their side.”

Energy Transfer's CEO, Kelcy Warren, has donated millions to pro-Trump groups and given directly to the president's campaigns over the years. He has made a mission of going after pipeline opponents, including Greenpeace, filing several lawsuits to that end.

Some conservatives have celebrated his approach. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, said it was “great news!” that the verdict could bankrupt Greenpeace. Erick Erickson, a conservative talkshow host, said Warren was his hero. “I'm a longtime shareholder of Energy Transfer and his campaign to destroy Greenpeace has been awesome to behold. God bless him,” Erickson wrote on X.

Shayana “Shane” Kadidal, a senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, called to mind economic boycotts during the US civil rights movement that inflicted damage on white-owned businesses, and how those businesses retaliated with civil lawsuits against groups such as the NAACP, trying to frame their activism as a conspiracy.

“Billionaire oligarchs like Elon Musk and Energy Transfer's Kelcy Warren now pose one of the most significant risks to free speech globally,” Kadidal said.

Greenpeace began in the 1970s with a campaign led by Canadian activists to block nuclear weapons testing on an Alaskan island, its roots based in direct action. US offshoots grew throughout that decade. It is headquartered in the Netherlands, where it has filed an anti-Slapp lawsuit against Energy Transfer.

It has said it got involved in the Dakota Access protests because the tribe, the Standing Rock Sioux, asked for its help. The organization has a policy of only getting involved in Indigenous-led movements if specifically asked, the New York Times reported.

Waniya Locke, of Standing Rock Grassroots, said the verdict “attempts to erase Indigenous leadership from Standing Rock's history” and part of a “coordinated attack on communities organizing to protect their water and futures from big oil”.

The Greenpeace case isn't the only recent example of a heightened legal attack on free speech. Protesters on US college campuses have been met with disciplinary actions for supporting Palestinian human rights, the most extreme example involving the push to deport a former Columbia student, Mahmoud Khalil. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has sued his critics.

The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law has tracked a rise in anti-protest bills since 2017, corresponding with major protest movements including actions against pipelines, on college campuses, for teachers and for racial justice. These proposals include “extreme” penalties for protest-related offenses like trespassing near a pipeline, the center notes in its analysis. They also call for expanded liability for organizations or individuals that aren't directly involved in protests. “Non-profits, religious groups, and others will be much more reluctant to support or organize protected protests if they face possible penalties for the unlawful actions of others,” the center said in its analysis.

The verdict is not the end for this case – Greenpeace has said it will appeal to the North Dakota supreme court. Legal experts believe the organization has a better shot on appeal, citing the jury's ties to the oil and gas industry and the broad disapproval of the protest among local residents.

In the defeat, there has also been resolve.

“You can't sue or bankrupt a movement,” Raman said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Former special forces soldier made enemies after disagreements with far-right factions in Netanyahu government

Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's powerful internal security service, the Shin Bet, may seem an unlikely rebel.

A former special forces soldier who holds degrees from Tel Aviv and Harvard universities, Bar has devoted three decades of his working life to the service of the state. His frame is lean, greying hair close shaved, features gaunt, manner reserved and speech moderate.

But Bar has found himself on the frontline of Israel's bitter internal political, social and cultural conflicts. On Thursday night, the government of Benjamin Netanyahu voted to dismiss the 59-year-old from his post – the first Shin Bet chief ever to be fired. His sacking prompted massive protests across Israel and revived accusations that Netanyahu wants to dismantle Israel's democracy.

Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli security reporter, said: “He never intended to be a hero to the opposition or the protest movement. He is a typical product of Israel's security establishment. He is not a liberal or a softie but he is honest and brought up in the tradition that the state is important but without the law the state is nothing.”

Bar served his military service in the Sayeret Matkal, Israel's elite special forces. He then opened and ran a bar in Tel Aviv, where he met his wife. After obtaining degrees in political science and philosophy from Tel Aviv University and a master's degree in public administration from Harvard, he joined the Shin Bet and rose steadily through the ranks of its operations division, which manages logistics and support for the frontline teams handling everything from agents to assassinations in the occupied West Bank or elsewhere.

The priority of the Shin Bet is counter-terrorism, but the service also investigates espionage, manages security clearance for thousands of sensitive posts and has a legal duty to defend Israel's democratic system.

Bar took over the service in 2021, having been appointed by the then prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and was expected to serve the standard five-year term. Now only a supreme court judgment can stop him from being summarily dismissed a year early.

One of the first senior security officials to accept responsibility for the many failures that allowed Hamas's deadly surprise attack into Israel on October 7, 2023, Bar made it clear he intended to resign.

He has stayed on so long, associates and supporters say, to work towards the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza and to protect the Shin Bet from political manoeuvres.

That first objective has been partly achieved but not the second. Bar became a target himself when he warned of the threat posed by “Jewish terrorism” – a reference to violence perpetrated by parts of the far-right settler movement – and warned the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, that police action in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem was creating a feeling of collective punishment among Palestinian residents.

This may have been honest but made for powerful enemies. The support of Ben Gvir and other far-right politicians linked to the settlers is vital for Netanyahu to maintain his grip on power.

In March 2023, amid widespread protests against government plans for judicial reforms, Bar told Netanyahu there was a link “between security threats and the social situation in Israel”, according to remarks reported by Israeli media.

A Shin Bet report into the 2023 attack released earlier this month attacked Netanyahu indirectly, saying that Israel had followed for years a “policy of quiet [which] had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup”.

The implicit criticism took place as the Shin Bet stepped up an investigation into allegations that close aides of Netanyahu received payments from Qatar to promote its interests even while the Gulf state was partly financing Hamas in Gaza.

One of Bar's greatest concerns is the appointment of a compliant government loyalist as his replacement, with huge consequences for investigations into the “Qatargate” scandal and much else, Melman said.

For his part, Netanyahu has cited a “persistent loss of professional and personal trust” for Bar's dismissal, due to take effect by 10 April.

Bar denies this, pointing to months of effective collaboration with the prime minister, and in a letter published this week described his dismissal as being motivated primarily by Netanyahu's “personal interests”.

“The dismissal of the Shin Bet director at this time [and] at the prime minister's initiative, poses a direct threat to Israel's security,” the former commando wrote.

Critics have claimed that he is trying to cover up the failures that led to the October 2023 attacks. Supporters said he was doing his job and speaking truth to power.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Prosecutors dropped case against Jamila A after protracted legal battle over tweet about footballer Alexander Isak

A 22-year-old black student has accused police and prosecutors of misusing hate speech laws intended to protect minorities after she was charged for using the N-word in a tweet.

Jamila A, who lives in London, was charged under the Communications Act 2003 in July 2023 after referring to the black Newcastle United footballer Alexander Isak as a “nigga” in a tweet.

Her legal team argued the term was widely used in African American vernacular English and black British English and differed significantly from the racial slur ending in “-er”.

The tweet was flagged by a data monitoring organisation and passed to the Metropolitan police, whose referral to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) led to charges, prompting a legal battle that lasted one and a half years.

The CPS ultimately dropped the case, citing insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.

Jamila told the Guardian she had been prosecuted for speaking in a way “that came naturally to me as a black woman”.

“Everyone was so angry on my behalf: my mum, my siblings, my friends … They just thought it was outrageous because, of all the people they could prosecute for saying the N-word, they chose another black person.”

She added: “I can go outside right now … and there'd be a million people who listen to rap songs that have the N-word in there and they sing along to it but nothing will ever happen to them, but they will get you, a black person, for saying the N-word in your language.”

Jamila said she realised she was in trouble when police turned up at her house last summer. She was not home, but her mother called her, and she was suddenly filled with dread. A text message from the investigating officer told her she was wanted for questioning over a “racial” tweet.

“I was trying to rack my brain to think of what could I possibly have said that anybody could have considered as racist … Then I went to the station, saw the tweet, and thought: are they being for real?”

Her defence team, led by the barrister Ife Thompson of Nexus Chambers and the solicitor Ghislaine Sandoval of Hodge Jones & Allen, argued that the CPS failed to consider the cultural and linguistic context of the term. They said the N-word, when spelled with an “-a”, was commonly used within black communities worldwide as a form of reclamation and solidarity.

They also pointed out that no evidence was provided to show that the tweet was found offensive, indecent or menacing, even by the recipient.

A CPS spokesperson said: “After careful consideration, and in line with our duty to keep all charged cases under review, we have concluded there is no longer sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the case has been discontinued.”

When contacted about the case by the Independent newspaper in July last year, the CPS had said: “Hate crime has a profound impact on victims and communities. Being from an ethnic minority background does not provide a defence to racially abusing someone. Our commitment to tackling these abhorrent crimes through fair and impartial prosecution is unwavering.”

Jamila said: “The hard ‘r' is a slur that was used in the mid-19th century against African Americans … Around the mid-20th century, African Americans, reclaimed that word with an ‘a' as a way to refer to each other … And it was very different in pronunciation, especially with the American accent, between the hard ‘r' and with the ‘a'.”

She said black Britons, too, had been dehumanised and called the N-word, and that through cultural exchange with African Americans, a similar process of reclamation had taken place in the UK.

Jamila claimed the police understood this. “Before I had the interview, he [the police officer] told me: ‘I know that in some languages, in some communities, you have words and phrases that you use that aren't offensive amongst yourselves, but it's been brought to us, so we have to deal with it.'”

Thompson, who led the defence, said the “case raises serious concerns about how the CPS and police are unfairly and inappropriately criminalising Black language speakers”.

Jamila, when asked what she would say to those who believed no one should use the N-word, responded: “I can respect your opinion, but I have my own. And just because you think nobody should be saying it, doesn't mean I should now be in court getting prosecuted for it.”

She added: “Black people can say it because it's their language. If you're going to prosecute people for saying the N-word, surely it should be an actual racist thing.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Agencies and organizations are complying with the directive to not lose funding, but are concerned vulnerable groups will suffer

The US government has ordered law enforcement agencies, the state department and some non-profit organizations working to combat sex trafficking to remove references to victims' LGBTQ+ identities, race and immigration status from their communications and websites, a move experts warn will endanger vulnerable minors.

Interviews with a prosecutor, government personnel, trafficking non-profit executives, as well as email correspondence reviewed by the Guardian show that agencies and organizations are complying with the orders to avoid losing federal funding. Experts in child safety say the policy is fostering a climate of fear, forcing organizations to acquiesce in order to retain crucial funding at the expense of helping victims.

The directive stems from executive orders issued by Donald Trump targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and LGBTQ+ communities. Some non-profits receiving federal funding have been prohibited from using the terms “marginalized”, “vulnerable” and “immigrants” in correspondence from grant funders.

Donald Trump signed the executive orders nixing DEI on 20 January, the day of the presidential inauguration. One order, titled “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing”, mandates the removal of policies, programs, and activities relating to “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility”. Another, titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” instructs the removal of all “radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms”.

Anti-trafficking organizations receive funding from a number of government bureaus including the Department of Justice, office for victims of crime, office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, office on violence against women, Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.

The rollback by the US government will affect the annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report by the state department, which evaluates global anti-trafficking efforts. Internal communications reviewed by the Guardian show that department staff have been directed to omit data on marginalized communities from the report.

The office for victims of crime, part of the Department of Justice, removed the contents of a webpage titled Faces of Human Trafficking, which detailed the stories of survivors, including those of people of color and people who identify as LGBTQ+. The page also contained educational resources on the legal needs and rights for victims, and on providing trauma-informed services. This content was replaced with a notice stating “this content is temporarily unavailable” in early February, according to captures by the Wayback Machine, a digital library website that takes periodical snapshots of websites to preserve their history.

“A lot of people rely on the government for this type of information, accurate information, and it's no longer going to be there. People are only going to care about one specific population of people, which is going to be white, blond hair, blue-eyed, straight cisgendered females,” says Jose Alfaro, a gay Latino survivor of child sex trafficking and anti-trafficking consultant.

According to Alfaro, silencing discussion of vulnerable groups will deter trafficking victims from reporting the crimes committed against them. They may fear harassment, discrimination or not being believed, he said.

“It's going to further stigmatize and also push everything underground. This is going to benefit traffickers,” he said. “When you are further marginalizing and oppressing vulnerable groups, the response is going to be more homophobia, more transphobia, more racism, which then is going to create more vulnerabilities for those populations.”

Traffickers often deliberately target victims from marginalized demographics they believe are less likely to report them. In Alfaro's case, he was trafficked as a minor by a man now serving a 30-year sentence who specifically targeted gay teenagers from the Latino community.

“It was known to him that Latino males who were gay would be basically rejected from their families, and so they would be in an even more vulnerable place,” says Alfaro.

LGBTQ+ individuals face heightened risk of trafficking due to systemic barriers in employment, housing and social services. These challenges make them prime targets for traffickers, who exploit financial instability and lack of familial support. Racism is also a risk factor for being a trafficking victim, since factors such as poverty, harmful stereotypes and being in the foster care system – where Black youth are overrepresented – further heighten vulnerability, creating conditions that traffickers exploit.

Previously collected data illustrates the disparities along fault lines of race and sexual orientation. For instance, in King county, Washington, 84% of child sex trafficking victims are Black, even though Black residents make up just 7% of the population. Latino communities also face high rates of exploitation, according to research by the anti-trafficking non-profit Polaris. The Trump administration's directive prohibits anti-trafficking agencies from collecting such data.

“Trafficking happens to those that are disproportionately vulnerable. We were able to have data to back that up, and then we were able to create and tailor programming specifically for those populations, and these executive orders rolled all of that back,” said one expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns of potential retaliation.

The censorship efforts have also affected the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a major child safety non-profit which works to locate missing children and combat child sexual exploitation and trafficking, particularly online.

NCMEC, whose main funder is the federal government, has been ordered to remove all references to LGBTQ+ people from its public-facing material, according to an email to NCMEC seen by the Guardian.

NCMEC acts as a nationwide clearinghouse for reports about child abuse, which staff triage and forward to relevant law enforcement departments in the US and around the world. The center also provides education resources and data on trafficking, abductions and exploitation for law enforcement and others working on child safety issues. It manages distribution of the “Amber Alert” system that alerts the public to missing children.

Since the issuing of the executive order, the organization has removed publications that reference gender identity, queer and transgender children from its website. This resulted in the removal of guides on missing children who may be suicidal, children missing from care, male victims of child sex trafficking and recognizing and preventing child sex trafficking.

“Like many federally funded non-profits, NCMEC was directed by the DoJ to comply with executive order 14168 regarding gender ideology and to review our publicly facing materials to ensure compliance,” said an NCMEC spokesperson. “No changes to NCMEC services have been made regarding sexual orientation, race or immigration. NCMEC will continue to provide lifesaving support for all families and children who need our services. We remain committed to helping find missing children, combating child sexual exploitation and preventing child victimization.”

Additionally, anti-trafficking non-profits have also been informed by federal workers responsible for grant allocations that conservative Christian organizations that have guidelines more closely aligned with the executive orders will receive preference over federal grants for supporting survivors, according to one source with direct knowledge of the new grant funding mandates.

“Organizations that don't understand those kids or adults and why they're disproportionately vulnerable, that maybe do conversion therapy – could be a faith-based organization that believes that being queer is wrong and will send you to hell – will still get funds,” said one expert. “People will die because of it.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

A statement from the state department read: “We refrain from disclosing specific information regarding the Trafficking In Persons Report until it has received official approval and has been formally released by the Secretary of State to the public. The Department is committed to implementing President Trump's executive orders.”

Major police departments across the country, which receive federal grants for investigations on trafficking crimes from the Department of Homeland Security and the office of justice, have now been instructed to stop collecting data on victims' race and LGBTQ+ identity, including for cases of violent crime and trafficking, according to a federal prosecutor.

The prosecutor, who specializes in violent crime and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, warned that the decision could undermine efforts to address targeted violence and hate crimes.

“Crime data is super important and drives modern policing and law enforcement and making effective and appropriate decisions,” said the prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. “It's particularly important to understand where we're putting our energies.”

The change could also mean that violent perpetrators targeting specific minority groups to assault are not charged with hate crimes or civil rights violations, the prosecutor added. Omitting information about crime victims' sexuality or race from reports can hamper investigations and victim identification, the prosecutor said.

“You can't really take a victim-centered approach if we're not allowed to categorically approach the victim for who they are as a person, like if we can't acknowledge that they are trans,” said the prosecutor. “You can imagine the impact that's going to have on how successful and how much people feel they're willing to open up.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Defence minister issues threat as IDF intensifies offensive with ‘non-stop' overnight attacks across territory

Israel's defence minister said he had instructed the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and threatened to annex part of the territory unless Hamas released 59 Israeli hostages still held in the devastated territory.

Israel Katz's warning on Friday came as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intensified the new offensive launched on Tuesday, when a wave of airstrikes shattered the truce that had brought a fragile and relative calm since mid-January.

Further “non-stop” attacks took place overnight across much of Gaza. “It's all day and all night. Drones, planes, artillery, tanks … all the time. It's as bad as it's ever been,” said one aid worker now based in Gaza City.

After retaking part of the strategic Netzarim corridor that divides Gaza's north from south, Israeli troops have advanced towards the northern town of Beit Lahiya and into the southern border city of Rafah.

Israeli officials have escalated their threats in recent days, calling on Palestinians in Gaza to overthrow Hamas or face the consequences.

“I ordered [the army] to seize more territory in Gaza,” Katz said in a statement. “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel.”

Katz also threatened “to expand buffer zones around Gaza to protect Israeli civilian population areas and soldiers by implementing a permanent Israeli occupation of the area”, should Hamas not comply.

The permanent establishment of wide buffer zones in Gaza, particularly along its northern perimeter, has long been thought by observers to be an objective of many in the Israeli security establishment and government.

The Trump administration reiterated this week its support for Israel, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, saying: “The president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay.”

Gaza's civil defence agency said on Thursday that 504 people had been killed since the bombardment resumed, one of the highest tolls since the war began more than 17 months ago with Hamas's attack on Israel. More than 100 have been killed since then and many more injured, Palestinian medical officials said.

Amjad Shawaa, the head of the Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza, said: “This time it is very, very bad. It is very intensive and very scary. We don't know when we could be hit. We worry always about our loved ones. Everything is very uncertain and then there are these threats that Israel will expand its operations. This is a suffocation, a psychological condition that is very hard.”

The IDF said the new strikes were against “terrorist” targets, including a “Hamas military site in northern Gaza where preparations were being made to fire projectiles” and “several vessels in the coastal area of the Gaza Strip … intended for use in terrorist operations by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad [armed group]”.

It gave new evacuation orders for northern coastal areas, displacing thousands more people. The UN estimates that 124,000 people have been displaced in Gaza since Tuesday, about one in 20 of the population.

Preliminary investigations have found that an explosion that killed a UN staffer in Gaza and seriously injured four others earlier this week was caused by a tank shell, aid officials told the Guardian. The IDF has denied all responsibility for the explosion at a UN guesthouse in the central town of Deir al-Balah.

A three-phase ceasefire was agreed in January but Israel refused to begin talks on the implementation of a second phase, which was supposed to lead to a return of all hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent end to hostilities.

Instead, Israel proposed a new plan, reportedly put forward by the US envoy Steve Witkoff, involving a 30- to 60-day truce and the release of all remaining hostages. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners – a key component of the first phase.

Hamas said on Friday it was still debating Witkoff's proposal and other proposals made by intermediaries, including Egypt. On Thursday, the group fired rockets at Tel Aviv, the coastal Israeli city and commercial hub, in its first military response to Israel's offensive. One was intercepted by air defence systems, while two hit an uninhabited area, Israel's military said.

The new violence in Gaza comes against a backdrop of internal turmoil in Israel, where thousands of protesters have rallied in recent days, accusing the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of seeking to undermine Israel's democratic system and resuming military operations without regard for the safety of the hostages in order to bolster his political position.

On Friday, Israel's supreme court ordered a temporary halt to the government's dismissal of Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, until an appeal could be heard before 8 April. Netanyahu previously cited “mistrust” to justify his sacking of Bar but Israel's attorney general has ruled that a dismissal by the cabinet has no legal basis.

A recent Shin Bet report on the 7 October Hamas attack acknowledged the service's failures but also accused Netanyahu's government of pursuing policies that established some of the conditions for the attack.

Before the IDF's offensive, Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, one of the largest providers of food aid in the strip, said on Friday it had only enough flour to distribute for the next six days.

About 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, died in the surprise attack by Hamas in October 2023. The ensuing Israeli offensive into Gaza has killed more than 49,000 people, mostly civilians.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ruling follows Guardian-led challenge to attempt to withdraw ‘indiscreet' document used in Chinese ‘spy' case

A witness statement containing apparently “embarrassing or indiscreet” comments by an aide to Prince Andrew about his work should be made public, a tribunal has ruled after a legal challenge led by the Guardian.

Though the author of the document, Dominic Hampshire, a close friend of the prince, should have behaved with “discretion” regarding the royal family, that did not outweigh the principles of open justice, the judgment published on Friday said.

The 34-paragraph statement was made by Hampshire in support of Yang Tengbo, a man who became a business partner of the prince but has subsequently been accused of being a Chinese spy, leading to his exclusion from the UK.

The tribunal wrote: “Substantial parts of the witness statement contain material which cannot possibly be said to be confidential, such as information about Mr Hampshire's background or about how he came to know Mr Yang.”

It contained “information about the Duke of York which is in the public domain”, such as “the negative impact of the Duke's 2019 Newsnight interview” in which he tried to explain the nature of his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The judgment said: “There are also comments about Mr Hampshire's work with the duke which might seem embarrassing or indiscreet, but they are not such as to give rise to the inference that a legal duty of confidentiality attaches to them.”

The principle of open justice outweighed the fact that “in Mr Hampshire's dealings with the royal family there is an expectation of discretion” though, the tribunal added, he had not cited any contractual obligations of confidentiality.

The statement was part of unsuccessful legal proceedings brought by Yang to challenge the immigration decision. Hampshire had tried to argue that he had sought to withdraw the document from the court once he realised it would not remain private.

Media organisations led by the Guardian argued the statement should be made public. It was one of many documents used by the tribunal as evidence and was referred to in its public judgment.

On Friday morning, the special immigration appeals commission (Siac) said Hampshire's witness statement, plus other redacted documents relating to Yang's business dealings with the prince, should be made public with minimal redactions.

However, the documents themselves are yet to be released, in case the parties decide to appeal. The tribunal also ruled that two words of Hampshire's witness statement would remain confidential, once the document was released.

“So far as the information concerns commercial activity, there is a substantial public interest in the press being able to report it,” the tribunal said. “Overall, the determining principle is the open justice principle.”

Hampshire had said the statement was originally written for the then home secretary, James Cleverly, to provide context in his review of the original decision to exclude Yang, made by his predecessor Suella Braverman. Yang then asked him to submit it to the tribunal to help his case, Hampshire said.

Hampshire, a former Scots guard, is an old friend of Andrew's. He described himself as a “senior adviser” to the duke in letters written to Yang in 2020, one of which praised the Chinese businessman in gushing terms for sticking with the prince when many others dropped him after the BBC interview.

“You sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on,” the letter said. He praised Yang for his discretion and said he had showed “total support and loyalty” when others had deserted the prince.

In January, when he was opposing the release of the statement, Hampshire described himself as the “secretary of the Quad-Centenary Club”, a society established to raise funds for London's Royal Blackheath golf club, of which Andrew was chair.

Yang has said previously that the allegations against him are “entirely unfounded”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Israel Katz orders army to ‘seize more ground' as he threatens ‘permanent occupation'

Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Friday he ordered the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and warned of partial annexation if Hamas does not release hostages held in the Palestinian territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“I ordered (the army) to seize more territory in Gaza … The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel,” he said in a statement in which he threatened “permanent occupation” of “buffer zones” inside the Gaza Strip.

Israel's defence minister said on Friday he has instructed the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and threatened to annex part of the territory unless Hamas releases the remaining hostages it holds.

Israel Katz's warning came as the army stepped up the renewed assault it launched on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages and brought relative calm since late January.

After retaking part of the strategic Netzarim corridor that divides Gaza's north from south, Israeli troops moved on Thursday towards the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah. The military said it had resumed enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City.

“I ordered [the army] to seize more territory in Gaza,” Katz said. “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel.”

Katz also threatened “to expand buffer zones around Gaza to protect Israeli civilian population areas and soldiers by implementing a permanent Israeli occupation of the area,” should Hamas not comply.

He said the army “will intensify the fight with aerial, naval and ground shelling as well as by expanding the ground operation”, which he said would include implementing Donald Trump's proposal to turn Gaza into a resort after the relocation of its Palestinian inhabitants to other Arab countries.

That's all from me, Tom Ambrose, and the Middle East crisis live blog for today. Thanks for following along.

Palestinian militant group Hamas is to blame for deaths in the Gaza Strip since hostilities resumed, the United States told the UN security council on Friday.

“Hamas bears full responsibility for the ongoing war in Gaza and for the resumption of hostilities. Every death would have been avoided had Hamas accepted the bridge proposal that the United States offered last Wednesday,” acting US ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea told the 15-member council.

Russian president Vladimir Putin has said he is “concerned” by Gaza escalation and is “ready to help cool tensions”, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

More details soon …

The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), one of the largest providers of food aid in Gaza, warned on Friday it only had enough flour to distribute for the next six days. “We can stretch that by giving people less, but we are talking days, not weeks,” Unrwa official Sam Rose told reporters in Geneva in an online briefing from central Gaza, reports Reuters.

Israel's supreme court on Friday froze the decision by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to sack Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, in order to review appeals filed against the dismissal. “It is hereby ordered that a provisional measure be taken to stay the effect of the decision subject to the appeals until another decision is made,” the court said in a document obtained by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

The head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, has been dismissed, a week after Benjamin Netanyahu said he had lost confidence in him, and despite three days of protests against the move. “The government unanimously approved prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA [Israeli Security Agency] director Ronen Bar's term of office,” a statement from the prime minister's office said.

Israel's government is due to meet Sunday for a no confidence vote on the attorney general, a vocal critic of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, marking the start of a lengthy dismissal process, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “We resolve to express our lack of confidence in the government's legal adviser, Gali Baharav-Miara, due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and the government's legal adviser,” said a cabinet meeting agenda on the website of the prime minister's office on Friday.

Less than half of Palestinian Red Crescent emergency vehicles are operating due to fuel shortages in Gaza, reports Reuters. Of 53 vehicles in total, 23 remain operational after aid supplies into Gaza, including fuel, were halted in early March, Tommaso Della Longa from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told reporters in Geneva.

The situation in Gaza is gravely concerning with massive reductions in distribution of aid supplies, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa) said, reports Reuters. “This is the longest period since the start of conflict in October 2023 that no supplies whatsoever have entered Gaza. The progress we made as an aid system over the last six weeks of the ceasefire is being reversed,” Sam Rose from Unrwa told reporters, speaking from central Gaza.

Hamas said on Friday it is still discussing US envoy Steve Witkoff's proposal and various other ideas, with the aim of reaching a deal to release prisoners, end the war in Gaza, and achieve a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territory. Witkoff presented last week a “bridge” plan to extend the ceasefire in Gaza into April beyond Ramadan and Passover and allow time to negotiate a permanent cessation of hostilities.

Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Friday he ordered the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and warned of partial annexation if Hamas does not release hostages held in the Palestinian territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “I ordered (the army) to seize more territory in Gaza … The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel,” he said in a statement in which he threatened “permanent occupation” of “buffer zones” inside the Gaza Strip.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Friday that Tehran has no proxies in the region and that the groups it backs act independently, reports Reuters. US president Donald Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Yemeni Houthi group that it says Iran supports.

The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), one of the largest providers of food aid in Gaza, warned on Friday it only had enough flour to distribute for the next six days.

“We can stretch that by giving people less, but we are talking days, not weeks,” Unrwa official Sam Rose told reporters in Geneva in an online briefing from central Gaza, reports Reuters.

The humanitarian situation in Gaza was once again alarming due to massive reductions in distribution of aid, Unrwa said.

“Six of 25 bakeries that the World Food Programme were supporting had to close down. There are larger crowds on streets outside bakeries,” Rose said.

“This is the longest period since the start of conflict in October 2023 that no supplies whatsoever have entered Gaza. The progress we made as an aid system over the last six weeks of the ceasefire is being reversed,” Rose added.

Israel's supreme court on Friday froze the decision by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to sack Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, in order to review appeals filed against the dismissal.

“It is hereby ordered that a provisional measure be taken to stay the effect of the decision subject to the appeals until another decision is made,” the court said in a document obtained by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

It added that the freeze will remain in place until the appeals are presented to the court before 8 April.

The Israeli supreme court has stayed the government's decision to sack Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

As we reported earlier, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, has been dismissed, a week after Benjamin Netanyahu said he had lost confidence in him, and despite three days of protests against the move.

“The government unanimously approved prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA [Israeli Security Agency] director Ronen Bar's term of office,” a statement from the prime minister's office said.

According to the statement, Bar will leave his post when his successor is appointed, or by 10 April at the latest. You can read more on this story in Lorenzo Tondo's latest piece:

France opposes any kind of annexation by Israel of the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, the French foreign minister said on Friday, after Israel's defence minister threatened to annex parts of Gaza unless Hamas released Israeli hostages.

“France is opposed to any form of annexation whether it concerns the West Bank or the Gaza Strip. We have a very clear vision of the future of the region – a solution of two (Israeli and Palestinian) states living side-by-side in peace,” foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot told reporters in the eastern city of Dijon, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Agence France-Presse (AFP) has a bit more detail on Israeli defence minister Israel Katz's orders to the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza.

“I ordered (the army) to seize more territory in Gaza … The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel,” he said in a statement.

Should Hamas not comply, Katz also threatened “to expand buffer zones around Gaza to protect Israeli civilian population areas and soldiers by implementing a permanent Israeli occupation of the area”.

Katz vowed to step up the assault, using civilian as well as military “pressure points” to defeat Hamas. He added:

We will intensify the fight with aerial, naval and ground shelling as well as by expanding the ground operation until hostages are freed and Hamas is defeated, using all military and civilian pressure points.”

He said these included implementing president Donald Trump's proposal for the United States to redevelop Gaza as a Mediterranean resort after the relocation of its Palestinian inhabitants to other Arab countries.

On Thursday, the Israeli military said troops had begun “conducting ground activity” in the Shabura area of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city near the Egyptian border. It said it had also closed off the territory's main north-south route as it expanded the ground operations which resumed on Wednesday.

Israel's government is due to meet Sunday for a no confidence vote on the attorney general, a vocal critic of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, marking the start of a lengthy dismissal process, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“We resolve to express our lack of confidence in the government's legal adviser, Gali Baharav-Miara, due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and the government's legal adviser,” said a cabinet meeting agenda on the website of the prime minister's office on Friday.

Less than half of Palestinian Red Crescent emergency vehicles are operating due to fuel shortages in Gaza, reports Reuters.

Of 53 vehicles in total, 23 remain operational after aid supplies into Gaza, including fuel, were halted in early March, Tommaso Della Longa from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told reporters in Geneva.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

PM says government will decide who heads domestic spy agency as protests against Ronen Bar dismissal continue



Benjamin Netanyahu is locked in a fierce battle with Israel's judicial system after the supreme court blocked his attempt to fire the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency.

Amid protests against ministers' vote to sack Ronen Bar, the top court on Friday froze the decision, with the order remaining in place until the court can hear petitions filed by the opposition and an NGO against the dismissal of the chief of the Shin Bet.

Netanyahu said in a post on X that “the government of Israel will decide” who headed the domestic security agency, writing: “The State of Israel is a state of law, and according to the law, the government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”

The Shin Bet has been investigating Netanyahu's close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media, and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.

In a letter made public late on Thursday, Bar said his dismissal was motivated by Netanyahu's “personal interests”. The security chief referred to the conclusions drawn by his agency's investigation into the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, which said “a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup”.

He added: “The dismissal of the head of the service at this time at the initiative of the prime minister sends a message to all those involved, a message that could put the optimal outcome of the investigation at risk. This is a direct danger to the security of the state of Israel.”

The court ruling said the freeze on Bar's dismissal would remain until the appeals were presented to the court before 8 April. According to the earlier government statement announcing his dismissal, Bar was supposed to leave his post when his successor was appointed, or by 10 April at the latest.

Bar, whose tenure was meant to end next year, was appointed by the previous Israeli government, which briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.

His relations with the prime minister had been strained even before the 7 October Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza, notably over a proposed judicial overhaul that had split the country. Relations worsened after the 4 March release of the internal Shin Bet report on the attack, which acknowledged the agency's own failures but also pointed to wider policy issues in the run-up.

In a statement on Friday, a Netanyahu spokesperson said: “The Israeli government, which is in charge of the Shin Bet, has lost all confidence in Ronen Bar, who continues to cling to his seat while cynically using the families of the kidnapped and politically incorrect use of his position to fabricate futile, unfounded investigations.

“Ronen had the opportunity to retire with honour after his searing failure on October 7 … But [he] preferred not to attend the government meeting dealing with his case.”

A series of high-ranking officials seen as responsible for mistakes and misjudgments in the period before the Hamas attack have resigned. Netanyahu himself has not accepted any responsibility for Israel's worst ever security disaster, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and has resisted calls for a powerful commission of inquiry.

After the government vote against Bar, Israel's opposition and an NGO said on Friday they had filed a petition against the decision. Their initiative was upheld by the supreme court, ruling as the high court of justice on state decisions, which subsequently issued a temporary injunction.

The Movement for Quality Government in Israel NGO had denounced “an unlawful decision … posing a real risk to the national security of the state of Israel”, while the opposition leader Yair Lapid's centre-right party denounced what it called “a decision based on flagrant conflict of interest”.

The communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, said in response to the ruling that the judges had no right to interfere in the government's decision to fire Bar. “Bar will end his tenure on April 10 or earlier, with the appointment of a permanent head of the Shin Bet,” he said. “You have no legal authority to interfere in this. This is the government's authority. Your order is void.”

A former head of the Shin Bet, Yoram Cohen, condemned Bar's sacking in an interview with Israel's Channel 12 on Friday, and alleged that the prime minister had compelled him to carry out acts of questionable legitimacy when he was in charge of the agency.

He has previously alleged that in 2011 Netanyahu asked him to wiretap the government's top defence officials to ensure “they were not leaking information from a particularly sensitive security meeting”, the Times of Israel reported.

In a separate move on Friday, Netanyahu's cabinet said it would debate on Sunday a motion of no confidence in the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, accusing her of acting “as the long arm of the government's opponents”.

Baharav-Miara previously warned Netanyahu he could not fire Bar before her office had reviewed his motives for doing so.

“According to the decision of the supreme court, it is prohibited to take any action that harms the position of the head of the Shin Bet, Ronen Bar,” Baharav-Miara said in a message to Netanyahu published by a spokesperson on Friday. “It is prohibited to appoint a new head of Shin Bet, and interviews for the position should not be held.”

Netanyahu is facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. The 75-year-old politician, who came to power for the first time in 1996 and has served 17 years as prime minister, is giving evidence twice weekly.

On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators protested for a fourth consecutive day against the move to sack Bar, joining protesters angry at the decision to resume fighting in Gaza while 59 Israeli hostages remain in the Palestinian territory.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The day's football news ahead of England facing Albania at Wembley to begin their World Cup qualifying campaign

That concludes the news blog. Our coverage of England v Albania will be along soon enough. Thanks for reading.

Alisson was forced off the field after a clash of heads during Thursday's 2-1 win over Colombia in a World Cup qualifier and has left the Brazilian national team and will return to Liverpool.

Alisson and Colombia defender Davinson Sanchez both collapsed after clashing heads during the second half. Medical staff rushed onto the pitch to treat them, before both players were substituted.

Media reports said Alisson, 32, was taken off as a precaution after feeling dizzy following the injury. “Alisson is travelling back to Merseyside and will undergo assessment from the Reds' medical staff,” Liverpool said in a statement. (Reuters)

Arsenal manager says more players will be injured if matches continue to be played on sub-standard pitches. (PA Media)

The Gunners' 2-0 Champions League defeat at Real Madrid on Tuesday night took place on a rain-sodden surface was held at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium, the 6,000-seater home of Real's reserves, while Arsenal are guaranteed a better pitch when they host Liverpool in the WSL at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, as well as the return leg with Real next Wednesday.

“Of course we like to play on a good surface, I think every team does. It makes football a bit more easy,” said Slegers. I think women's football deserves to play on good surfaces. Not least because of player injury risks.”

The conditions appeared to have caused a nasty injury to Real's Melanie Leupolz, who caught her studs in the mud while playing a pass, with the Germany midfielder departing the field in tears. Real later confirmed the former Chelsea player had suffered a torn lateral ligament and will be sidelined for two months.

“That's not for me to assess and that would be a hard call for anyone to make, why that happened,” added Slegers. But there was an injury on the pitch and, yeah, we want good pitches, for player health.”

Redmond Grimes nominates Neil Finn as a famous Kiwi. It's only natural.

Reading could be thrown out of the English Football League if their owner, Dai Yongge, does not sell the club before 5 April. The Chinese businessman was disqualified as an owner under the league's owners' and directors' test last month, an action made public at commercial court in London on Friday.

During the proceedings, a letter from the EFL was referenced by the lawyer Martin Budworth, who was acting for Dai and Reading, detailing their decision to disqualify Dai. The EFL previously pushed to disqualify Dai after multiple breaches of regulations but was overruled by an independent panel and instead a financial sanction was imposed.

Neil Lennon is the new manager of Dunfermline Athletic, on a short-team deal until the end of the season, the aim to keep the Pars in the Scottish Championship.

Club statement: “Dunfermline Athletic are delighted to announce the appointment of Neil Lennon as First Team Manager on an initial short term deal, until the end of the season. Neil Lennon has a seriously successful track record as a manager.”

Chairman and CEO David Cook commented, “We very quickly identified Neil as the outstanding candidate for the role. Having managed at the very highest level in the country he will bring a huge wealth of experience to the club.

“Whilst it's been a team effort in securing the services of such a high calibre manager, this wouldn't have been possible without James Bord's personal involvement in the negotiations.”

James Bord is the ex-professional poker player who took over the club, with Evan Sofer, both are resident in Las Vegas.

According to the Dunfermline Press: “Bord, a former banker and professional poker player, is the founder of San Francisco-based company Short Circuit Science, a sports analytics provider utilising artificial intelligence.

“He also has minority football ownership interests in Bulgarian outfit Septemvri Sofia, and Spanish side Córdoba CF, the latter of whom co-owner Sofer, who works closely with Bord on a number initiatives, including Short Circuit Science, also holds a minority stake.”

Modern football, right?

More details on Club Leon via PA Media: “Both sides are owned by Grupo Pachuca.
 The decision to allow both teams to enter had been challenged by a Costa Rican club, Alajuelense.

“Fifa said on Friday that a replacement club would be announced in due course. Article 10.1 of the tournament regulations states that no club participating in the competition may directly or indirectly hold or deal in the securities or shares of any other club participating in the competition.

“Chelsea were due to face Leon in Atlanta on June 16. The other teams in Chelsea's group are Flamengo of Brazil and Tunisian side Esperance.”

Club León said they disagreed with Fifa's decision and would appeal in the sport's highest courts if they were denied a place at the Club World Cup.

“In the last few months we have presented all the evidence and documents confirming that Club Leon manages itself in an autonomous manner in all economic, administrative and sporting aspects,” it said.

Club León will be removed from the Club World Cup later this year as it and another Mexican club in the tournament, CF Pachuca, failed to meet criteria on multi-club ownership.

“Fifa has determined that Club León will be removed from the competition, with the club to be admitted as a replacement to be announced in due course,” Fifa said in a statement.

Pachuca's spot at the 14 June to 13 July competition in the US is unaffected. Here's the group León were in. Meanwhile, Léon are not the only club with multi-club ownership; Manchester City are part of such a structure.

Kári Tulinius gets in touch: “I think singers Lorde and Kiri Te Kanawa must be in with a shout as world's most famous New Zealander.”

Bob O'Hara: Surely Sirocco (of Last Chance to See infamy) is still the most famous kiwi. Even though he's actually a kākāpō.
  More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirocco_(parrot), including the line “Sirocco's preference for head-mating and resistance to massage techniques has made it difficult to collect his semen.”

Thanks, both.

Seb gets in touch: “Positioning schmozitioning - Kane was awful in the Euros and WC, at times missing clear cut opportunities. Just because there's no obvious replacement doesn't mean that England are going to win anything by persevering with a striker who's *way* past his best.
 ”I mean, how many times have we been here - a former ‘great' getting selected on past glories? There's a reason he cut his losses and moved to the Bundesliga.
 ”Anyway Kane will probably blow a gasket trying and Tuchet will have no option but to throw Bellingham up there. Then when it works everyone will call him a genius etc etc...”

A debate in the office: is Chris Wood currently the world's most famous Kiwi? Maybe Russell Crowe excepted…

Per Reuters

New Zealand forward Chris Wood received one of the strangest yellow cards of the season when he was booked for signing autographs in the stands after scoring a hat-trick in his side's 7-0 defeat of Fiji in a World Cup qualifier.

Wood, who has enjoyed a superb season at Premier League club Nottingham Forest, was substituted to a standing ovation after his third goal in Wellington and headed straight to the stands to sign autographs and have his photo taken with fans.

However, Wood's act of goodwill incurred the wrath of referee Norbert Hauata who cautioned the striker as he made his way back to the pitch-side because the game was still going on.

“If that's the rules, that's the rules, Wood was quoted as saying by France 24. “Just doing something nice and trying to sign for the fans.”

The All Whites will meet New Caledonia in the final of Oceania qualifying in Auckland on Monday as they try to book their first World Cup spot since South Africa 2010.

Per Reuters

Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Matheus Cunha has been handed an additional one-match ban and fined £50,000 pounds after admitting to acting in an improper manner after his red card at Bournemouth in the FA Cup.

Cunha was initially handed a three-match ban after being sent off for a clash with Milos Kerkez, argued with referees, teammates and staff before leaving the pitch. Wolves lost the match on penalties.

“Matheus Cunha will now be suspended from domestic football until Sunday, 13 April,” the FA said. Cunha, currently on international duty with Brazil, has already missed two of Wolves' Premier League matches, and will also be absent from their games against West Ham United and Ipswich Town next month before returning against Tottenham Hotspur on April 13.

Wolves sit 17th in the league, nine points clear of the relegation zone.

A back four is the talk from the England camp, though will Tuchel expect there to be flexibility? This is the era of attacking full-backs, and Livramento and old warhorse Kyle Walker will expect to bomb on. Will those roles eventually fall to Trent Alexander-Arnold and Lewis Hall, both missing with injury?

Krishna gets in touch: “Bring football home” is a war cry delivered by ignoramuses. It is essentially pointless in that it puts unrealistic expectations (and hence pressure) on players who must be focusing on their game. It is also insulting to other (more) capable opponents. Let us be fair; England has won it once; at home. We will make it to the quarter finals with reasonable ambition.

Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Netherlands, Germany, France, England and there will always be one dark horse (Morocco, South Korea, Japan, Uruguay, USA….). We are also assuming that England is not that dark horse. The group stages, the form of the opponents, injuries, weather (summer in USA), VAR, poor decisions, red mists (Scholes, Terry and the likes) – so many factors play a role in making progress in a tournament where after the formality of the group stage, it is knockout straightaway with no cushion of a two legged last 32, last 16, QF or a SF. Forget “ bring football home”, let us bring back Joga Bonito.”

In my editing days, I used to remove any mention of the beautiful game.

Hello there. Just chewing over the England team that will play tonight – will it be three at the back, four?

Three at the back worked in Russia, in 2018. That semi-final team against Croatia: all those players still eligible and the back five, minus Harry Maguire but plus Harry Kane, are all part of the squad. Ashley Young, 40 this year, has been excellent for Everton. If it's only next year then why not?

And with that, my work here is done. The estimable John Brewin is stepping into the breach.

Tonight's World Cup qualifying fixtures in Europe are as follows:

Group G
 Malta v Finland
 Poland v Lithuania

Group H
 Cyprus v San Marino
 Romania v Bosnia-HerzegovinaGroup K
 Andorra v Latvia
 England v Albania

There's also Northern Ireland v Switzerland in an international friendly. You can see all the fixtures here.

Rick, who we all agree with, is back!

He writes:

“Interesting reading the article on how best to accommodate Harry Kane as I note that France failed to score against Croatia last night despite having Mbappé, Dembélé and Barcola with goals dripping from their boots in club football, and were beaten by a team with 400-year-old Luka Modric and 399-year-old Ivan Perisic. Oh, and hot-streak Rasmus Hojlund scored the winner against the CR7 monster wielding Portugal.”

Here is a piece on Japan's 2026 World Cup qualification from Dan Orlowitz:

“Not bored by Kane at all,” emails Mark. “Probably the best English footballer I have ever seen alongside Wayne Rooney, Glenn Hoddle and Sol Campbell.”

“I think it's remarkable that the Uefa qualifiers start tonight, and Japan have already qualified,” emails Kári Tulinius. “It can't have happened very often in modern times that a non-hosting country has qualified ahead of the first ball being kicked in a European qualifier.

“I'll admit that I'm finding it hard to get excited about tonight's opening round of fixtures. As a resident of Finland I have an emotional interest in the Eagle-Owls' game against Malta, but most of these seem like the sort of matches that might be described as banana skins. The only exception is Romania v Bosnia-Herzegovina, who should be fighting it out for the second spot in Group H, and might even get automatic qualification if Austria stumble.

“The African qualifiers are a bit more exciting, with Algeria attempting to keep up in Group G with pacesetters Mozambique by beating Botswana, who are currently in third. Meanwhile in Group C, which is probably the most finely poised, Lesotho travel across their only border to take on South Africa, who have been making characteristically heavy weather of qualifying, currently lying in third behind Rwanda, who face Nigeria, who have yet to win a single match.

“The big match tonight is undoubtedly when Uruguay welcome Argentina to the Estadio Centenario. The same fixture as the first World Cup final, in the very ground where it took place. Since it kicks off at half past one in the morning here in Finland, it's a bit late for me, but I know which highlights I'll be looking up first when I wake up.”

Marc Guéhi could be a surprising omission from the England team later. The centre-back was a regular during last year's run to the Euros final but this is a new era. It's worth remembering that Tuchel likes height - see the call up of Dan Burn, who could make his debut next to Ezri Konsa tonight. Tuchel is also the manager who sold Guéhi from Chelsea to Crystal Palace.

Are you bored of Harry Kane? Get in touch.

If you missed it … Harry Kane believes his achievements are taken for granted and that people are “bored” by his goal-scoring.

“It's like when Ronaldo and Messi were throwing these crazy numbers out there and the next season they'd score 40 goals instead of 50 and it was like they were having a bad season,” Kane said. “People take it for granted and maybe a little bit with England as well. I've scored 69 goals and when you score against Albania or Latvia, or these teams, people just expect it so it's not spoken about so much.

“Say if I was 25 now and doing what I'm doing, the excitement around me would maybe be a little bit different to what it is now. Again, that's part of where we are with football and I've seen it with some other players as they get into their 30s. Maybe people just get a little bit bored of what you do, but I'm certainly not bored. I'm excited for these games and the games ahead.”

Kane's goals this season for Bayern have fired them to the brink of the Bundesliga title while they are also in the Champions League quarter-finals, but it has not made him immune to to criticism.

“It's hard. Sometimes it motivates me. Sometimes, to be honest I try to stay away from it as much as I can,” he added. “Probably, when I was young I listened to more than what I do now. Ultimately, I criticise myself more than anyone could do on the outside but … always use it as fuel to prove people wrong.

“Today's game, I feel like there's such a difference between a high and a low. You go from not scoring for a couple of games, to people saying he's not sharp enough ... to scoring and you're a Ballon d'Or contender and it's like, the difference is too high and too low. I know what I've done in my career and I feel like I have a lot of respect from a lot of football people out there and I've achieved a lot in my career.” (PA Media)

Declan Rice hosting Myles Lewis-Skelly and Dan Burn, for an episode of “England Generations” on the official channels, is actually excellent content:

Myle Lewis-Skelly of Arsenal, called up by England for the first time by Thomas Tuchel, has been having a chat with the FA's media team.

“Initially, the day before I got the call-up, I was on the phone with my friends and I got a call when I was on the phone with them,” said Lewis-Skelly.

“It said no number so I told my friends, ‘one second, I need to take this call'. I'm thinking, ‘there's a good chance that it could be a call-up' but I ended up picking up and it was Uber Eats for my mum! I was like, ‘ah, man'. Then the next day, I got a text confirming it.”

Of his first experience of a senior England camp, Lewis-Skelly added: “There's been so much to take in, but I feel like every moment, I've been present and I've taken it day by day. It's something that you dream of and when it actually comes, obviously I visualised it and I work towards these moments but when it actually comes, you're still so happy.

“I would say that it hasn't been by accident because I've put in the work and I've really had self-belief and trust in my ability to do what I'm doing.”

Enough of all this England gubbins: Jeff Stelling says go and watch your non-league team this weekend. Quite right, Jeff, and not in the least bit unbelievable:

Non-league clubs can offer fans looking to get a live football fix over the international break something different, according to Hartlepool president Jeff Stelling. While Premier League and Championship clubs are not in action this weekend, with some EFL games also postponed, there is a full programme of fixtures down the pyramid.

As part of this year's Non-League Day on March 22 - which sees its partnership with Prostate Cancer UK continue for an 11th season - there is an opportunity for fans to get a picture alongside the Premier League trophy during a two-day ground hop around the Essex Senior League.

While trips to the likes of Benfleet or Takeley may not normally hold appeal, Stelling feels taking a chance to help provide “lifeblood” to the clubs with extra people through the gates will prove money well spent.

“Hopefully, just for a weekend, it puts non-league football a little more in the spotlight,” said Stelling, who has been honorary president of Hartlepool since 2015. “I know a lot of fans of big clubs hate international breaks, so it is a great opportunity for fans of those teams to just have a little look at non-league football and what it has to offer.

“It might well be something they have never thought about doing before, but if they go, they will realise it is a very different, much more all-embracing experience than it is to go and watch a Premier League side.

“This is a chance for people to go along and sample that, and I think for a lot of people, after they do it once, they will go back on a relatively regular basis.”

Stelling added: “Getting people paying to go into those non-league games is significantly more important to those clubs than it is at the top level, because they have got so much funding and sponsorship.

“But at a lower level, attendance money is still really important. It is still the lifeblood of those clubs really, so it is important that people go along.” (PA Media)

Also from Barney Ronay, this is from last Friday after Tuchel's press conference, and well worth a read:

“Thomas Tuchel's first squad conference was in the event a highly convincing production, expertly phrased, and hitting just the right note of hope versus realism.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar amid mass protests against the move and Israel's resumption of hostilities in Gaza.

JERUSALEM — As Israeli forces carried out more strikes in a renewed Gaza offensive, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed forward on the home front to oust two senior officials in a development that roiled Israeli politics.

In a late-night Thursday cabinet session, Netanyahu's ministers voted unanimously to dismiss Ronen Bar, the director of the Shin Bet intelligence service who Netanyahu said no longer had his trust. Hours later, on Friday morning, the government scheduled another discussion for Sunday over firing Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who had advised Netanyahu not to fire the spy chief.

Netanyahu's moves to dismiss two of the most prominent and powerful dissenting voices in his government were criticized as unconstitutional by opposition leaders and sparked calls for further protests after large, occasionally chaotic demonstrations already took place this week in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Almost immediately, opposition parties petitioned the supreme court for an injunction on Bar's dismissal pending a judicial review — which was a granted by the court. The Business Forum, a group of 200 leading Israeli business leaders, threatened to “bring the Israeli economy to a halt” if the government did not obey the court order to temporarily freeze Bar's removal.

Netanyahu was unmoved as the outcry mounted Friday. “There will be no civil war!” he said in a post on X. ""The State of Israel is a country governed by law, and according to the law, the Government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”

If the court ultimately sides with the government, Bar will leave his post sometime before April 10. But a ruling against the government might pit the supreme court in a direct battle with Netanyahu.

“What's taking shape is a more ominous clash between the government and the court, with mixed signals about whether the prime minister will — or will not — comply with its ruling,” said Shalom Lipner, a former Netanyahu aide who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “After many long months of stage-setting, a constitutional crisis could be fast upon Israel.”

Tensions have been building for months between Netanyahu and his internal security chief, with the two men and their supporters openly blaming each other for the policy and intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to carry out a devastating attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Bar has also been seen as one of the leading voices calling on Netanyahu to prioritize striking a deal with Hamas to recover all Israeli hostages, while Netanyahu and some of his allies, particularly on the political right-wing and the far-right, have stressed that the Gaza war must continue until Hamas is wholly eliminated.

Last month, Netanyahu removed Bar from the negotiating team with Hamas, and the prime minister has accused Bar of disobedience and leaking information about the hostage talks — allegations the Shin Bet director has denied.

Further fueling the feud, the Shin Bet, which is responsible for counterintelligence and protecting the integrity of Israeli democracy, opened a probe in February into allegations that three Netanyahu aides were on Qatar's payroll and maintained improper ties with a Gulf nation that is not seen as a friendly state. Baharav-Miara, who authorized the Qatar investigation, has warned Netanyahu against firing Bar, saying it would be a conflict of interest and would jeopardize the independence of the Shin Bet.

In an X post that was widely discussed in Israel this week, Netanyahu criticized the Shin Bet investigation as a conspiracy and likened himself to President Donald Trump. “In America and Israel, when a strong right-wing leader wins, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people's will,"" Netanyahu wrote in an X post that was shared by Elon Musk. “They won't win in either place!”

At the cabinet meeting late Thursday, Netanyahu accused Bar of disloyalty and leaking information about the hostage negotiations, according to Israeli media reports. Bar, in response, issued a letter to the cabinet saying it was the Shin Bet's duty to work “for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and not for the benefit of personal interests,” and criticized Netanyahu for blocking a probe into “serious incidents.”

“The urgent national need for such an investigation cannot be subordinated to the personal considerations of those involved in the matter,” Bar said in the letter, which was reviewed by The Post.

Bar's removal would likely represent a boost for hawkish voices within Netanyahu's government who have been calling for Israel to return to more intense fighting against Hamas. After Netanyahu announced his intention to fire Bar and resumed hostilities in Gaza this week, he brought Jewish Power party leader Itamar Ben Gvir back into his cabinet. In recent weeks, another far-right minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has urged Israel to cut off electricity and water to Gaza, return to fighting in the Strip, and gradually annex land if Hamas harms any hostages.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz appeared to echo Smotrich on Friday by warning that if Hamas did not release all hostages, the Israeli military will seize additional territory in Gaza.

“The more Hamas persists in its refusal, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed to Israel,” Katz said in a statement. He added that Israel will use “all measures to apply military and civilian pressure — including the evacuation of the Gazan population southward and the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump's voluntary relocation plan for Gaza residents.”

In Gaza on Friday, Israeli forces destroyed the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, according to footage posted on social media and the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed it struck “terrorists in a Hamas terrorist infrastructure site that previously had served as a hospital” and said the location has not been used as an active hospital for more than a year.

Last year, a Washington Post examination of satellite footage found that the IDF appeared to be using the hospital near the strategic Netzarim Corridor as a base of operations. The hospital previously served as an important cancer treatment center in Gaza before it was forced to close in the early days of the war due to nearby airstrikes and lack of fuel.

In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned Israel's destruction of the hospital, which was built by Turkey and run by local authorities, and called on the international community to “take concrete and deterrent measures against Israel's unlawful attacks.”

Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Updated on:  March 21, 2025 / 1:23 PM EDT
          / CBS Miami
        

The massive brush fire that has been burning in southern Miami-Dade County this week has now grown bigger than the Palisades Fire of California that captured national headlines earlier this year.

The Palisades Fire, which first ignited on Jan. 7 in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, burned 23,707 acres before it was fully contained on Jan. 31, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The wildfire sparked national news as a ""life-threatening"" Santa Ana windstorm produced 100 mph gusts throughout Southern California that hampered firefighting efforts for weeks, causing insurmountable damage and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes.

But the Miami-Dade fire, which ignited just days ago, has now grown to 26,437 acres at 30% containment, according to Friday morning data from the Florida Forest Service, making it nearly 300 acres larger than the Southern California wildfire.

Miami-Dade Fire Rescue crews, alongside state and local agencies, have been attacking the fire from both the ground and the air, using helicopters to drop on the blaze.

Meanwhile, the flames have forced the closure of Card Sound Road, one of only two roadways to the Florida Keys. The other road U.S. 1's 18-Mile Stretch, has been sporadically shutting down and reopening over the last few days, and could face intermittent shutdowns in the coming days due to heavy smoke and firefighting operations.

At this time, there haven't been any reports of major damage to homes or businesses nearby, but the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said that Comcast has had patchy service due to the fires affecting some of their infrastructure. There also have not been any major evacuation orders issued, though a juvenile residential facility in the area was evacuated due to the conditions the fire presented.

Authorities are advising people to stay indoors if they smell smoke, keep doors and windows closed and set air conditioning units to recirculate.

Vulnerable groups, including young children, the elderly and those with respiratory issues, should take extra precautions.

Drivers in the affected regions are advised to keep vehicle windows rolled up and use air conditioning in recirculation mode to limit exposure to smoke, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue said.

Though the southern Miami-Dade fire is big and growing, it is not the largest wildfire in Florida history. That record belongs to the Florida wildfires of 1998.

Also known as the ""1998 Florida Firestorm,"" the massive blaze —   like the Palisades and other Southern California fires of January —   was a series of wildfires that swept across the state during the summer of 1998. It involved thousands of separate woodland and mixed-urban rural wildfires that burned over 500,000 acres, destroying over 300 homes and costing $300 million of lost timber value.

In the aftermath of the 1998 wildfires, Florida lawmakers initiated stricter fire prevention regulations and emergency management protocols following the fires.

The first successful use of a radio telescope on the moon has kicked off a new era of astronomy that could shed light on the cosmic dark ages – despite a bumpy landing.

NASA's ROLSES-1 (Radio wave Observations at the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath) telescope was mounted on the Odysseus lander, an Intuitive Machines spacecraft that made the first ever private lunar landing last year. While Odysseus was the first such spacecraft to survive a landing, it tipped on its side, rendering most of the equipment on…

A new artificial intelligence (AI)-driven weather prediction system could transform forecasting, researchers predict

The system, dubbed Aardvark Weather, generates forecasts tens of times faster than traditional forecasting systems using a fraction of the computing power, researchers reported Thursday (March 20) in the journal Nature.

""The weather forecasting systems we all rely on have been developed over decades, but in just 18 months, we've been able to build something that's competitive with the best of these systems, using just a tenth of the data on a desktop computer,"" Richard Turner, an engineer at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, said in a statement.

Current weather forecasts are generated by inputting data into complex physics models, a multi-stage process that requires several hours on a dedicated supercomputer.

Aardvark Weather circumvents this demanding process: the machine learning model uses raw data from satellites, weather stations, ships and weather balloons to make its predictions without relying on atmospheric models. Satellite data are particularly important for the model's predictions, the team noted.

This new approach could offer major advantages in terms of cost, speed and accuracy of weather forecasts, the researchers claimed. Instead of requiring a supercomputer and a dedicated team, Aardvark Weather can generate a forecast on a desktop computer in just a few minutes.

The team compared Aardvark's performance to existing forecasting systems that generate global predictions. Using just 8% of the observational data that traditional forecasting systems need, Aardvark outperformed the U.S. national Global Forecast System (GFS)system and was comparable to forecasts made by the United States Weather Service.

However, Aardvark's spatial resolution is somewhat lower than those of current forecasting systems, which could make its initial predictions less relevant for hyper-local weather forecasting. Aardvark Weather operates at 1.5-degree resolution, meaning each box in its grid covers 1.5 degrees of latitude and 1.5 degrees of longitude. For comparison, the GFS uses a 0.25-degree grid.

However, the researchers also said that because the AI learns from the data it is fed, it could be tailored to predict weather in specific arenas — such as temperatures for African agriculture or wind speeds for renewable energy in Europe. Aardvark can incorporate higher-resolution regional data, where they exist, to refine local forecasts.

""These results are just the beginning of what Aardvark can achieve,"" study coauthor Anna Allen, of the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. ""This end-to-end learning approach can be easily applied to other weather forecasting problems, for example hurricanes, wildfires, and tornadoes. Beyond weather, its applications extend to broader Earth system forecasting, including air quality, ocean dynamics, and sea ice prediction.""

Aardvark could also support forecasting centers in areas of the world that lack the resources to refine global forecasts into high-resolution regional predictions, the researchers said.

""Aardvark's breakthrough is not just about speed, it's about access,"" Scott Hosking, an AI researcher at The Alan Turing Institute in the U.K., said in the statement. ""By shifting weather prediction from supercomputers to desktop computers, we can democratize forecasting, making these powerful technologies available to developing nations and data-sparse regions around the world.""

Oops, something went wrong

(Reuters) - Yahoo has signed a deal to sell its 20-year-old technology news website, TechCrunch, to media investment firm Regent, the companies said on Friday.

TechCrunch, a popular online platform providing news and analysis on global tech companies, startups and entrepreneurs, was among the media assets of Verizon Communications, including Yahoo.

In 2021, private equity firm Apollo Global Management acquired the media assets for $5 billion, subsequently rebranding the combined assets under the Yahoo name.

Regent has been actively expanding its tech news site portfolio, with its recent acquisition of Foundry, the parent company of leading publications such as PCWorld, Macworld, InfoWorld, CIO, and TechAdvisor.

The financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close in the coming weeks, were not disclosed.

""We believe this next chapter under Regent can help maintain TechCrunch's influence and support its continued growth,"" Yahoo said in a statement.

Yahoo hosts a suite of news sites, including Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports and Engadget, in addition to other services like Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Search.

At long last, it appears that Aaron Rodgers might be close to finalizing his plans for the 2025 season. Rodgers visited the Pittsburgh Steelers on Friday, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and confirmed by CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. No deal is imminent, though, according to NFL Media, with ESPN reporting that the two sides are currently not close regarding a deal. 

Rodgers' time in Pittsburgh revolved around meeting with coaches as the 41-year-old continues to sort through his options. It's safe to assume that Rodgers spent time with Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, whose background includes successful partnerships with Ryan Tannehill and Justin Fields. Fields elected to sign with the Jets in free agency instead of re-signing with Pittsburgh. 

Rodgers has reportedly been trying to decide between signing with the Steelers, the New York Giants or retirement. The Minnesota Vikings, who had also been linked with Rodgers, have reportedly decided to instead move forward with 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy, who missed his entire rookie season season due to injury. 

A four-time league MVP, Rodgers is coming off a 2024 season that saw him rank in the top 10 in the NFL in both passing yards and touchdown passes. While most would consider that a banner year, it was not a typical season for Rodgers, who suffered through the worst year of his career from a win-loss standpoint. The Jets' 5-12 record last year prompted major change within the organization that included the team's new brass electing not to bring back Rodgers, who officially became a free agent shortly after free agency officially started on March 12. 

Fields' departure led to the Steelers' interest in Rodgers. The Steelers have a contingency plan in place if they don't sign Rodgers after re-signing Mason Rudolph, who went 8-4-1 as a starter during his first go-around with the Steelers.

SMU is hiring Maryland athletic director Damon Evans to serve in the same position, sources told CBS Sports. 

Evans will replace Rick Hart, who helped guide SMU into the ACC last year. Previously serving as Georgia athletic director, Evans has been at Maryland since 2014 and worked as the school's AD since 2018. He was recently named to the College Football Playoff Selection Committee. 

SMU recently hired away Jay Hartzell from Texas to be its new president. Hartzell is believed to have made a run at Texas athletics director Chris Del Conte, who brushed away those rumors in February. 

The timing of SMU hiring Evans is particularly interesting for Maryland as speculation continues to swirl around Villanova's interest in Terrapins basketball coach Kevin Willard. He guided Maryland to a second-place regular season finish in the Big Ten and a No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament. 

The Terps are scheduled to play 13-seed Grand Canyon on Friday afternoon. Willard previously spent 12 seasons coaching in the Big East at Seton Hall, and sources have indicated he still has a strong affinity for the conference. 

Speaking ahead of the first-round game, Willard said Evans ""is probably going to SMU,"" and he spoke about the challenges of NIL demands. 

Villanova fired Kyle Neptune after three seasons in which the Wildcats did not make an NCAA Tournament berth. Neptune succeeded Jay Wright, who won two national championships at the Philadelphia-area school.

Pro Bowl quarterback Joe Burrow got his wish for the Cincinnati Bengals offense. His wide receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, who was designated as a franchise player for a second straight year, signed long-term deals. Higgins' second franchise tag cost $26,179,200.

Chase, who was scheduled to make a fully guaranteed $21.816 million in 2025 on his fifth-year option, became the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback with a four-year, $161 million contract extension, averaging $40.25 million per year. The maximum value of Chase's extension is $162 million thanks to a $250,000 annual incentive in the new contract years (2026-2029) for each Super Bowl win with 65% or more offensive playtime in the game as well as 65% or more offensive playtime during the same regular season. 

Higgins is now the league's highest-paid No. 2 receiver at $28.75 million per year. He received a four-year, $115 million deal worth up to $121.8 million through incentives.

The Bengals made an exception for Chase and Higgins by giving both traditional salary guarantees that have only been reserved for Burrow on a veteran contract. Chase has $109.8 million guaranteed for injury with $73.9 million of this money fully guaranteed at signing. An additional $2.2 million can become fully guaranteed to make the total guarantee $112 million.

Chase's deal has a $22 million roster bonus due the day after signing. In lieu of a signing bonus, the Bengals have started giving unsecured roster bonuses due on the day of or day after signing. The roster bonus is prorated just like signing bonus. Chase also has a separate unsecured $10 million March 25 roster bonus, which isn't prorated.

A major benefit is recoupment of a roster bonus can only occur in the year the money is earned. In Chase's case, he would have to breach his contract in 2025 to forfeit money. Recoupment of signing bonus with a breach or default can occur as long as there is signing bonus proration still in the deal. A Chase signing bonus would be subject to recapture though 2029 given he signed a four-year contract extension.

Chase's deal has two option bonuses. An option bonus is prorated over the life of a contract (up to a maximum of five years), including the option years, beginning in the league year when the option is exercised. 

Chase's option bonus in 2026 to pick up a dummy/voiding 2030 contract year is $15 million. Chase's fully guaranteed $32.73 million 2026 base salary gets reduced to $17.73 million in the process. 

The option bonus in 2027 for a dummy/voiding 2031 contract year is $5 million. Chase's $28.9 million 2027 base salary is guaranteed for injury at signing and becomes fully guaranteed on the fifth day of the 2026 league year. After this option is exercised Chase's 2027 base salary becomes $23.9 million rather than $28.9 million.

Higgins has $30 million fully guaranteed at signing. He got a $15 million roster bonus due one day after signing. There's also a $5 million March 25 roster bonus that isn't prorated. Both of these roster bonuses are being considered as part of the full guarantee. The signing bonus/option bonus structure was not used like in Chase's contract. Higgins' $10 million fifth day of the 2026 league year roster bonus is also fully guaranteed at signing, which is prorated like signing bonus. 

Curiously, Higgins' $13.8 million 2025 base salary isn't guaranteed. For all practical purposes, it is because of the two roster bonuses. An additional $10.9 million, Higgins' 2026 base salary, goes from unsecured to completely secured on the fifth day of the 2026 league year to make the total amount that can be guaranteed $40.9 million. He also has an unsecured $5 million fifth day of the 2027 league year roster bonus. There aren't any dummy/voiding years in Higgins' contract.

Both deals contain large per-game roster bonuses. Chase has $1 million ($58,823.53 for each game active with a 17-game regular season) in every year of his contract. Higgins' are $2 million ($117,647.06 for each game active) annually. With per-game roster bonuses, the amount is only payable each time a player is on the game day active roster.

The cash flow in each contract leaves a lot to be desired. Both are a little backloaded. For example, Chase has $44.816 million in 2029, the final year of his extension. He is getting 72.16% of his new money through his third new contract year. 

Higgins is slightly better with $29.8 million in 2028 so he has 74.08% of his money through his third contract year, which is 2027. In a neutral deal, that is neither frontloaded nor backloaded, 75% of the money in a straight four-year deal would be made through the third contract year. It's 75% of the new money earned through the third new contract year with a four-year extension.

Obviously, the amount of money is much different, which really shouldn't matter, but the cash-flow percentages don't measure up to previous Bengals four-year deals. The following chart illustrates the difference with former Bengals wide receiver Tyler Boyd, who signed a four-year, $43 million extension, averaging $10.75 million per year, in 2019. Linebacker Logan Wilson's four-year, $36 million extension from 2023, averaging $9 million per year, is also included for comparison purposes.

Allowing Cincinnati to preserve its antiquated contract structure under the right circumstances would have been preferable to accepting Chase's actual deal with $73.9 million fully guaranteed at signing and $112 million that can become fully guaranteed. The same basic concept would apply to Higgins but to a lesser degree since he and Chase both have the same agent. The idea would be to forgo the security that the other highly paid wide receivers and Burrow have in their contracts in exchange for phenomenal cash flow.

Typically, the only guaranteed money in Cincinnati veteran contracts is a signing bonus and/or a roster bonus payable within a few days of signing. The bigger deals contain an unsecured third or fifth day of the league year roster bonus in the second and third years. The roster bonuses are supposed to be substitutes for additional contract guarantees. The overall guarantees in Cincinnati contracts are less than comparable deals on other teams. 

Prior to Chase and Higgins signing, the only exception made had been with Burrow. The five-year extension, averaging $55 million per year, Burrow signed in September 2023 right before the start of the regular season has $219.01 million of salary guarantees. Out of the $219.01 million, $146.51 million was fully guaranteed at signing. 

In addition to strong contract guarantees, Burrow got an extremely player-friendly structure from the Bengals. He has an unheard of 66.89% of his new money over his first three new contract years, which run through 2027. Burrow's first three new contract years average $61,320,327 per year. To put Burrow's percentage in perspective, Justin Herbert and Jalen Hurts, who signed five-year extensions for $52.5 million and $51 million per year with the Los Angeles Chargers and Philadelphia Eagles in 2023, are at 60.98% and 60% after their respective first three new contract years. 

The Bengals wouldn't be asked to go into unchartered territory for Chase. Previous four-year deals or four-year extensions Cincinnati has done would be used against them. 

Getting Orlando Brown Jr.-type cash flow would be the goal. Brown signed a four-year, $64.092 million contract, averaging $16.023 million per year, in 2023 as an unrestricted free agent. His $31.1 million roster bonus the day of his contract's execution is still the most upfront money ever given to an offensive lineman.

Brown has 52.62% of his money in the first year and 66.07% through the second year, which is ridiculous. He has 77.81% of his cash through the third year.

Cincinnati might balk at providing such outrageous cash flow again. The fallback position would be landing somewhere between Brown's and Wilson's cash-flow percentages for the first two new years. 

Shattering the record in upfront money for a non-quarterback would be a necessity. San Francisco 49ers edge rusher Nick Bosa's $50 million signing bonus is the current benchmark. A substantial fifth day of the league year roster bonus in 2027 would also be required.

The massive per-game roster bonuses in Chase's contract would be a deal breaker. Burrow doesn't have any per-game roster bonuses in his contract despite missing the last six games of his rookie season in 2021 because of a torn ACL and MCL in his left knee. Chase has missed the same amount of games in his entire four-year NFL career. 

Cincinnati has been structuring contracts with option bonuses recently. It really wouldn't make a lot of sense to go this route if the signing bonus and option bonus contract model wasn't used. A single option bonus like in Wilson's deal would be sufficient. The option bonus in the second year (2026) would also have to be pretty significant so the additional proration would help act as a deterrent against getting released early.

The breakdown of Chase's unsecured contract would be as follows: 

The $60 million 2025 roster bonus would be prorated at $12 million annually through 2029. There would be $61.316 million of total cash in the first year since Chase's 2025 base salary would be $1.316 million. 

Hitting certain cash benchmarks throughout the deal would be important. The first one would be $100 million in the first two contract years running through 2026. Having $39 million in 2026 would accomplish this. There would be $100.316 million in the first two years. The other benchmarks would be $125 million and $150 million in cash, respectively, after the third and fourth contract years.

Out of the $39 million in 2026, $35 million would be an option bonus prorated at $8.75 million from 2026 through 2029. The window to exercise the option for Chase's 2029 contract year worth $32 million would be the first 10 days of the 2026 league year as in his actual contract. 

Chase would be vulnerable to being released until the option was exercised since his 2026 base salary isn't guaranteed. If for some strange reason Chase was released prior to the option year being picked up, he would have $39.5 million of new money without playing any of the new contract years. He would need to sign a four-year deal worth $122.5 million in 2026, averaging $30.625 million per year, to break even with the extension.

After the option is exercised, 2028 would be first year where the dead money, a salary cap charge for a player who is no longer on a team's roster, is less than Chase's cap number. Since Chase would be making $25 million in 2027, his cap number would be $45.75 million because of $12 million in roster bonus proration and $8.75 million in option bonus proration. There would be a $62.25 million cap charge associated with releasing Chase for a $16.5 million difference in his cap number and the dead money. 

Chase's aggressive cash flow wouldn't be unprecedented for a four-year contract extension that set a positional market. The top cash-flow percentages for a non-quarterback in recent years came from the four-year, $69 million extension, averaging $17.25 million per year, Tre'Davious White signed with the Buffalo Bills in 2020 to briefly become the NFL's highest-paid cornerback. 

T.J. Watt's four-year, $112.011 million extension from the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2021 that made him the NFL's highest-paid edge rusher as well as non-quarterback at $28,002,750 per year is also noteworthy. The Steelers had refused to have traditional salary guarantees in veteran contracts until giving Watt $80 million fully guaranteed at signing, which was a record for non-quarterbacks at the time.

The cash-flow percentages for Watt, White and the unsecured Chase deal are in the chart below.

The Bengals would be the party with more of a sense of urgency to get a deal done sooner rather than later. Patience would have been Chase's friend because of Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin going on the record at the NFL Scouting Combine in late February about Chase becoming the league's highest-paid non-quarterback. If it meant an agreement wouldn't be reached until right before the start of regular season as in Burrow's case, then so be it. 

By the time the regular season starts, Chase probably won't be at the top of the NFL non-quarterback salary hierarchy. Edge rushers Micah Parsons and Watt are in contract years with the Dallas Cowboys and the Steelers.

Cincinnati's feet could have been held to fire with established team precedents for four-year deals until there were the right circumstances. The cash-flow difference in Chase's actual contract and the proposed unsecured deal is quite dramatic. The cumulative new money after each year is below.

That's the price that would have to be paid for the Bengals to be able to remain in the dark ages for the foreseeable future when it comes to structuring contracts for veteran players. Without Chase and Higgins getting traditional contract guarantees, the extension that's reportedly being discussed for 2024 NFL sack leader Trey Hendrickson wouldn't have any chance of security like in the wide receivers' contracts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","These teams are the Group of Five's legitimate College Football Playoff contenders for the 2025 season","https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/these-teams-are-the-group-of-fives-legitimate-college-football-playoff-contenders-for-the-2025-season/","Fri, 21 Mar 2025 13:25:00 GMT","

Though the expanded College Football Playoff isn't without its flaws, perhaps its greatest virtue is the fact that it guarantees access to the Group of Five. Though most seasons the Group of Five will be consigned to just one of the five automatic bids, it's a much better alternative to the four-team format, in which deserving teams like 2017 UCF and 2020 Cincinnati got left by the wayside. 

It also means that competition across the Group of Five is heightened, and teams really need to elevate their play if they want to stand out from 67 other teams all vying for the same goal. 

Boise State did just that last year. Not only did the Broncos qualify for the College Football Playoff, they were one of four teams to snag a first-round bye after posting a 12-1 record and winning a second consecutive Mountain West Conference title. The Broncos are looking to make it back to the field of 12, but there's some stiff competition from around the country. 

With over five months left until the 2025 season begins, and even more time until the CFP Selection Committee makes its final cuts, here's a look at some Group of Five programs that can push for the playoff. 

Boise State should be the odds-on favorite to run it back in the College Football Playoff. Boise State got that far last year behind star running back and Heisman Trophy finalist Ashton Jeanty, who's now off to the NFL as an expected first-round pick in April's draft. While Jeanty leaves a gaping hole on Boise State's roster, he's not the only important loss. The Broncos have to replace stalwarts like edge rusher Ahmed Hassanein and leading wide receiver Cam Camper, who plans to enter the transfer portal after initially declaring for the NFL Draft. 

Even so, a solid core returns for third-year coach Spencer Danielson. He offset the loss of Jeanty, in part, at least, by adding Fresno State transfer Malik Sherrod, who rushed for 966 yards and nine touchdowns in 2023. Boise State is also high on running back Sire Gaines. It also helps the run game that the Broncos return four of five offensive line starters, including potential All-American offensive tackle Kage Casey. Though the receiver room is undergoing an overhaul, starting quarterback Maddux Madsen is back. He'll have to take another step if Boise wants to reach its potential, but there's no doubt that this is still a strong squad. 

Want a potential sleeper to keep an eye on? Look no further than James Madison, which has acclimated well to the FBS level since moving up from the FCS in 2022. Former coach Curt Cignetti, who just led Indiana to a surprising College Football Playoff berth, set a high standard with a 19-4 record while leading the Dukes from 2022-23. New coach Bob Chesney, Cignetti's replacement, maintained the momentum by going 9-4 in his first year at James Madison. That included a statement 70-50 win against North Carolina. 

James Madison, which did struggle a bit once Sun Belt play began, is looking for even more in 2025. The Dukes will have a chance to make a serious impression in the nonconference slate with a pair of road games against a likely preseason top-25 team in Louisville and Liberty, a consistent Group of Five power under coach Jamey Chadwell. Those wins could resonate when the selection committee is making its final cuts, so long as JMU handles business in the conference. 

Navy captured the nation's attention amid its 6-0 start to the 2024 season, but a blowout loss to Notre Dame curtailed any hopes Navy had of making a serious postseason push, and setbacks against Rice and Tulane cost them a spot in the American Athletic Conference Championship Game. Still, the Midshipmen won 10 games and beat Oklahoma in the Armed Forces Bowl to build some momentum towards what could be a huge 2025. 

Navy returns an overwhelming amount of production off of its 2024 team, headlined by starting quarterback Blake Horvath, who received some Heisman consideration after tallying 30 total touchdowns with 17 rushing. He'll lead an offense stacked with standout backs like Alex Tecza and Eli Heidenreich. Perhaps most importantly, Navy returns both of its coordinators in Drew Cronic, who helped the Mids develop their best offense in years, and P.J. Volker, who guided the AAC's third-best scoring defense (22.2 points per game) last season. 

Tulane is in an interesting spot entering the 2025 season. The Green Wave were gutted by NFL Draft declarations and the transfer portal, where they lost starting quarterback Darian Mensah (Duke) and 1,000-yard rusher Makhi Hughes (Oregon). So Tulane turned to the portal its self, where it added 26 new players that are expected to maintain a big role throughout 2025. That includes three new quarterbacks with plenty of experience in TJ Finley (Western Kentucky), Donovan Leary (Illinois) and Kadin Semonza, the 2024 Mid-American Conference Freshman of the Year at Ball State. 

Even with all that roster turnover, it's hard to count Tulane coach Jon Sumrall out. He's never won fewer than nine games as a head coach, and competing in the AAC gives his Green Wave plenty of visibility. Tulane also has a stacked nonconference schedule that could boost its résumé. The Green Wave start the year at home against Northwestern, travel to play a solid South Alabama team in Week 2, return home to host Duke and Mensah in Week 3, and then wrap things up in Week 4 on the road against Ole Miss. Going at least 3-1 in that span will solidify Tulane's status as a real contender. 

UNLV, arguably, came one game away from the College Football Playoff last season. The Rebels had their chance to steal a bid but fell short in the Mountain West Championship Game against Boise State. Then they lost coach Barry Odom, who had a 19-8 record in his two years in Las Vegas, to Purdue. And yet UNLV should be right back in the national conversation after the splash hiring of Dan Mullen and his years of SEC head coaching experience. 

Mullen made 11 straight postseason appearances at Mississippi State and Florida from 2010-2200 and led the Gators to their only SEC Championship Game appearance since 2016. He'll provide an immediate spark for UNLV's offense, which welcomes an impressive quarterback transfer in Virginia's Anthony Colandrea. He's the type of playmaker that should thrive under Mullen, and he's also one of 22 Power Four transfers headed to Vegas in 2025.

If there was an early NFL offseason loser, it may be the San Francisco 49ers. Following the first season in which they missed the playoffs in four years, the 49ers lost left tackle Jaylon Moore, guard Aaron Banks, safety Talanoa Hufanga, linebacker Dre Greenlaw, cornerback Charvarius Ward and other contributors in free agency, and also traded wide receiver Deebo Samuel to the Washington Commanders. The 49ers' defensive line will also look very different, as Javon Hargrave, Maliek Collins and Leonard Floyd are no longer on roster. 

What is San Francisco doing? General manager John Lynch says the team has a plan, and ""some big things coming our way.""

""We've got this thing called the draft, and we've got a lot of picks,"" Lynch said, per The Athletic. ""And I think the thing the fans should know is we have a plan. And we're gonna execute that plan. And we're excited about the opportunity.""

It's true that real teams are built through the draft compared to free agency, and the 49ers are poised to make a splash next month in Green Bay with four picks in the top 100 selections. Ultimately, this 49ers roster was due for a reset after ""doubling down"" last year following San Francisco's overtime Super Bowl loss. 

""Last year, we had such a good roster,"" Lynch said. ""I think we doubled down and said, 'Let's go for this thing.' And we kinda pushed all the chips in knowing that at some point you're gonna have to have that reset. And this was the year. So guys like Leonard Floyd and Maliek — believe me, their impact was felt. They were great. It was nothing they did wrong. We just felt like it was the time to do it, and we're excited about what we can add and replenish.""

Lynch said you have to clear room to be able to make these ""big things"" come to fruition. One of those ""big things"" could be the extension of quarterback Brock Purdy -- although that's something Lynch declined to discuss this week. Team owner Jed York has said they want the former Mr. Irrelevant in San Francisco for years to come, and that they will ""do everything we can to make that work."" It's fair to assume some of this cleaning house has to do with that looming, massive contract.

During spring training this year, Major League Baseball used a challenge system for balls and strikes based on ABS (automated ball-strike system). For those unaware, ABS uses a Hawk-Eye camera that plots where the pitch crosses home plate to determine if any part of the ball touched the strike zone or not. To challenge, either a pitcher, hitter or catcher will immediately signal to the umpire (usually a tap on his own head) after the ball or strike call.

The system isn't going to be used in the major-league regular season, though it's already been utilized in the minors the last several years. Having it here in spring training this year was tantamount to a test with big-league players. 

How was it? Let's run through some pros and cons. 

The goal behind replay reviews in sports is a noble one: to fix missed calls that could have an adverse affect on the athletic contest in question. Given that sports are entertainment performed by humans, however, sitting around and waiting for a review just sucks up extra time and can be pretty annoying. Take the last two minutes of a close college basketball game, for example. It's brutal. 

Through this lens, there's an argument to be had with replay that less is more. And more replay, then, can annoy people. 

If you've seen this ABS challenge system in reality, though, the time suck is very minimal. Start to finish, it's, what, 15 seconds? In the grand scheme of things, that's nothing. Far less than replays on the bases.

Remember, each team has two challenges a game and though they don't lose it if they are successful in overturning a ball-strike call, it's not like we're replaying every single pitch. It's certainly worthwhile to fix missed calls, too, so those aren't considered a waste of time.

And, again, there's the speed factor. A hitter or member of the battery must challenge a call immediately. This isn't like a play in the field where a defender or baserunner starts emphatically pointing to the dugout and then the manager holds up his hand to pause play on the field while a guy in a room somewhere whether or not to challenge. This is virtually automatic.

We're still, ultimately, talking about being entertained by human beings and missed calls are part of the so-called human element. It's not like the players are perfect, so why should we expect the officiating to be perfect? 

Nearly every detractor of replay cites the human element as part of the argument against it. 

On the other hand, I think most officials would like the ability to fix their honest misses. Sometimes you just miss a call and it's a rotten feeling. 

One of the biggest ways home-plate umpires get fooled is when the catcher sets up outside and a pitcher misses his spot with the pitch sailing over the plate. That's still a strike and definitely looks that way to a hitter. Here's an example. 

That's a strike. One can easily understand how an umpire misses that call, but it's still a strike. The ABS system allows for a fix. 

This one depends on your point of view, but an ABS challenge could certainly override an excellent frame job by the catcher.

Framing is a skill. We measure it and give catchers credit in defensive discussions for their ability to change balls into strikes. There are discussions on ""framing metrics"" that have even bled into the Hall of Fame with candidates this past year like Brian McCann and Russell Martin that we'll continue to have with Yadier Molina and into the foreseeable future. 

On the other hand, isn't the strike zone the strike zone? Just because a catcher fools an umpire into thinking a ball is actually a strike doesn't mean it should remain a strike, right? There's a reason some people refer to good framing as ""stealing strikes."" Good framing means getting a call for the defense via deception. Yeah, it's a skill, but should it be? 

It's an interesting discussion and it's possible to see a good number of fans fall both in the ""pro"" or ""con"" camp regarding the ability of ABS to overturn a good catcher frame job into a ball. 

The bottom line here is an ABS challenge system is there to avoid disaster. Let's say it's the bottom of the ninth in Game 7 of the World Series. The team pitching has a one-run lead with the bases loaded, two out and a full count. The pitcher is a hard slider that misses the zone, but the umpire rings up the batter, seemingly giving the pitching team the World Series title. 

But it was a bad call. Is that really how we want our champion decided? 

The ABS system could fix it. 

I know, I know, I hear you. Are we really going to pause a championship celebration for a challenge? 

I think the easy answer is yes. Keep in mind in this system it would be an immediate challenge and only take a few seconds. If there's an obvious missed call, it's better to get it right. 

Right?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","Top free agents remaining by position: Aaron Rodgers, Stefon Diggs highlight top players available","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/best-remaining-free-agents-by-position-aaron-rodgers-stefon-diggs-highlight-top-players-available/","Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:53:00 GMT","

NFL free agency has gone by in a blur, as many of the top free agents agreed to terms immediately when the legal tampering period began March 10. Once the new league year began March 12, pen was put to paper and the top free agents were immediately off the board. 

Through two weeks of free agency, not much has changed. 

This free agency class wasn't great by any means, but that doesn't mean there aren't good players available. Teams can still make good moves during the second wave of free agency and the third wave after the draft. There are still plenty of moves to be made, and good players can still be released and become available. Teams are waiting patiently this free agent cycle to make the right move. 

Which free agents are the best remaining at every position? Are there still good players at certain positions to be had? Of course some positions have stronger players remaining than others, but that's how free agency works. Plenty of offensive and defensive linemen were off the board quickly this offseason as teams heavily invested in the trenches. 

These are the best free agents remaining at every position:

Even after coming off the worst season of his Hall of Fame career, the 41-year-old Rodgers is the best quarterback available. Rodgers is playing a holding game with the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants before making a decision -- which could be holding up the quarterback market. The Minnesota Vikings are proceding to go forward with J.J. McCarthy, so they may not be an option. 

Rodgers had his lowest completion rate (63.0%) since 2019 and the lowest passer rating (90.5) in a full season in his career. He threw for 3,897 yards with 28 touchdowns to 11 interceptions. 

Dobbins responded from his Achilles injury in a major way last season, rushing for 905 yards and nine touchdowns in 13 games while averaging 4.6 yards per carry. The 26-year-old Dobbins has played in just 22 of a possible 68 games over the past four seasons, yet is still incredibly productive when he's on the field. Since the Los Angeles Chargers signed Najee Harris, it's unlikely Dobbins returns to Los Angeles. 

Diggs is coming off a torn ACL suffered last October but still has proven himself to be a playmaking wideout at 31. He had 47 catches for 496 yards and three touchdowns in eight games with the Texans, averaging 10.6 yards per catch.

Prior to last season, Diggs notched six straight 1,000-yard seasons with the Vikings and Bills and was selected to four straight Pro Bowls. Diggs had a recent visit with the Patriots. 

The tight end market was thin this year, and Conklin is the best free agent available after the top players were off the board early. Conklin, 29, is a starter in the league -- recording 449 yards receiving and four touchdowns last season while averaging 8.8 yards per catch. Conklin's market will certainly be interesting as free agency continues. 

Conklin had a recent free agent visit with the Chargers. 

A good offensive lineman when healthy, Noteboom played just four games last season due to an ankle injury. Injuries have gotten the better of Noteboom in his career, from a torn ACL and MCL to a calf injury followed by a torn Achillies. Noteboom allowed a pressure rate per dropback of 10.1% in his games, but he also wasn't fully healthy, either. 

Noteboom can play both guard and tackle, but may be better inside at this stage in his career. Still just 29, a team will get a good lineman if Noteboom can stay on the field. 

Once one of the top guards in the league, Scherff is a free agent once again at the age of 33. Scherff didn't allow a sack last season, and just 14 pressures while playing all 17 games. His pressure rate allowed per dropback was just 2.4% and just 2.1% over the last two seasons.

There are some good guards left, and Schreff is one of them. 

The longtime Patriot has hit the free agent market. A starter at center for a decade (on two Super Bowl title teams), Andrews played just four games last season due to a shoulder injury. The 32-year-old Andrews allowed one sack and a pressure rate per dropback of 4.0% in his 187 snaps. Andrews should garner interest since he is still a reliable starter, especially with his experience in the league. 

Still productive at the age of 32, Smith had nine sacks and 63 pressures for both the Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions last season. Not only did Smith finish with a 15.9% pressure rate but that number went up to 17.8% in Detroit after the Lions acquired him. Smith has a 16.3% pressure rate over the past four seasons with 24.5 sacks. He's good at getting to the quarterback. 

The defensive tackle market has some solid players left, but the best ones were signed early and often. Fotu was a solid rotational player in Arizona before signing with the New York Jets and playing just two games. 

A hamstring injury in training camp followed by a knee injury ruined Fotu's season, but he still is only 26 and doesn't have a lot of miles in him. Fotu visited the Raiders and is set to visit the Bills. 

Kendricks didn't sign until July last season, but is the best off-ball linebacker left. The Cowboys were a disaster in 2024, but Kendricks finished with 138 tackles, three sacks and two interceptions at the MIKE backer spot. Kendricks can play both off-ball linebacker positions, which is valuable for defenses. There should be an opportunity for him in 2025 if he wants it. 

A veteran who's been with several teams, Douglas is one of the underrated cover corners in the league. Last year was a weird year for Douglas, as opposing quarterbacks targeting him had a 90.6 passer rating -- a year in which Douglas had zero interceptions in 15 games. Douglas has allowed just a 58.2 passer rating in coverage over the past four seasons with 14 interceptions. He's a strong veteran for any roster at this stage of his career. 

Crazy at it seems, Williams is still only 28 years old. Last season was a disaster, as he failed to record an interception and allowed a 115.6 passer rating when targeted as the primary defender in coverage in 11 games. Teams could get a good player in Williams with the right scheme. Williams did allow just a 52.0 passer rating in coverage over his first six seasons.

The West Virginia men's basketball team won 19 games in its first season under head coach Darian DeVries, but it will try to build on that momentum under a new head coach. DeVries left Morgantown for the opening at Indiana, leaving the Mountaineers with a coaching change for the third consecutive offseason. They parted ways with Bob Huggins in the summer of 2023, playing the following season under the guidance of interim coach Josh Eilert. DeVries was hired as the full-time replacement last summer, leading the Mountaineers to a 19-win season that came up just short of an NCAA Tournament berth.

With DeVries leaving for Indiana, the administration will embark on the next West Virginia basketball coaching search. The Mountaineers made the Sweet 16 four times from 2010 to 2018, so their next coach will be tasked with leading them back to that stage of the Big Dance. If you love the Mountaineers, or just want to know who will call the shots for West Virginia basketball in the future, be sure to see what the proven team of insiders are saying at EerSports, the 247Sports affiliate that covers West Virginia.

One name the staff has identified as a potential target is Utah State head coach Jerrod Calhoun. The former West Virginia assistant coach is coming off arguably the most impressive season of his coaching career, leading Utah State to a 26-7 record and a trip to the NCAA Tournament in his first season with the school. He previously finished 86 games over the .500 mark at Division II Fairmont State and played for the Division II title game.

Calhoun then spent seven seasons at Youngstown State, going 33 games over .500 in his final five seasons. The Penguins had never had five straight winning seasons prior to that, and they won the conference's regular-season title in 2023. Calhoun has flipped multiple rosters and proven that he can utilize the transfer portal, making him one of the top candidates for this job. See more candidates at EerSports.

The rest of the list includes several exciting options who are proven winners in college basketball, including a former Big Ten Coach of the Year. You can only see who they are at EerSports.

Golf fans expected to see plenty of Tiger Woods playing golf in 2025 between signature events (where he has a lifetime exemption), majors championships and the upstart TGL simulator golf league he co-founded with Rory McIlroy. However, it appears the SoFi Center will be the only place golf fans will get to watch the greatest of all-time hit balls this year as personal tragedy and a devastating injury will keep him from competing on the PGA Tour. 

After skipping the tournament he hosts, the Genesis Invitational, following the death of his mother, Woods was working his way back into playing shape when he ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg. The 49-year-old had surgery on March 11 and is now faced with yet another grueling injury rehabilitation before he can get back on the golf course. 

The silver lining, if there is such a thing with an Achilles, is that Woods has plenty of experience working his way back from an injury and knows the physical and mental demands it will require to regain a personally acceptable level of form. The mental aspect is arguably as important as the physical side, of course.

According to friend and peer Fred Couples, Tiger is doing quite well less than two weeks removed from surgery. 

Couples offered an update on his buddy during a Champions Tour stop in Newport Beach on Friday, explaining that Woods was in ""great spirits"" when they recently spoke.

""I've texted him. As soon as it happened, he got back to me, and I texted him on a couple other things -- about TGL, his daughter just won that state soccer thing,"" Couples said. ""I mean, that was before he hurt himself. He was on Cloud 20. It was amazing. He's in great spirits for a ruptured Achilles. He really is.

""He'll be fine. It's such a bummer because people think, 'When's he gonna play?' He was scheduled to play a few events. Not a ton, but a few events. And you know, his mother passing away would slow anyone down. But he's my man, and texting him is a lot of fun.""

It's not clear when we'll see Woods next -- perhaps he'll make the trip up to Augusta National for the Masters Champions Dinner, even though he won't be playing -- but it's certainly positive to hear that he's doing well after his injury.

Alex Prince, who was first drafted by the Mercury in 2017, returns to the organization where it all began after a lengthy career overseas.  





Alexis Prince was drafted by the Phoenix Mercury in the third round in 2017, after a successful collegiate career at Baylor University. 

But, like most third-round picks in the WNBA, Prince wasn't able to find a long-term home in the league. She appeared nearly half of the Mercury's games in her rookie season, averaging 7.2 minutes a night, then in a pair of games for the Atlanta Dream the following year, and then went overseas before returning to the WNBA in 2020, where she signed with the Chicago Sky. 

Now 31 years old, Prince has played for numerous overseas teams, including the French club Tarbes Gespe Bigorre (2018-19), the Turkish club Hatayspor (2020-23), the Spanish club CB Avenida (2023-24), and the Israeli club Elitzur Ramla (2024). 

On Thursday, the Mercury announced Prince had signed a training camp contract with the team, meaning that the former Baylor standout is giving the WNBA another go. It's been 5 years since she last appeared in a WNBA game — a 9-minute outing in a Sky game in 2020 — and a training camp contact is no guarantee. But, it signals the guard's unwavering desire to try to find a spot in the women's basketball's most competitive league. 

At 6'2, Prince is a bucket-getter who has been very efficient in Israel this winter. Prince is averaging 19.3 points per game on 52.4% shooting. She's also averaged 8.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1 block while shooting 36.9% from three. 

The Mercury currently have 16 players under contract for training camp, so at least 4 will be cut before the season's tip-off. If Prince can show that she can score at a high level and consistently defend the way she did in college, she could find herself earning one of those spots. 

The Mercury will be centered around their new trio of Alyssa Thomas, Kahleah Copper, and Satou Sabally next season. All three players can score at a high level and, at their best, should be able to form a formidable lineup that can compete with the best of them. 

But, basketball is a 5-on-5 game, and around Thomas, Copper, and Sabally, Phoenix will need to rely on a lengthy list of bench players. Some — like former Dallas Wings center Kalani Brown, Turkish guard Sevgi Uzun, and Australian guard Sami Whitcomb — already have proven WNBA experience. 

But, for many, training camp will be an opportunity to showcase that they have what it takes to compete in the best league in women's basketball for a team that hopes to contend for a championship. Prince, who began her pro career nearly a decade ago in Phoenix, will hope to show she has what it takes.

Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo were seemingly still in love when they filmed Southern Charm season 10 — but after breaking up, not all their onscreen interactions have aged well.

“My whole life is business now. That's the fun stuff for me now,” Craig told Austen Kroll during season 10, episode 4, which aired in January. “Making money, getting healthy and f—ing my girlfriend.”

Craig's life motto for season 10 — which was filmed before he and Paige parted ways in December 2024 after three years of dating — isn't the only thing that makes Us do a double take watching it back.



Many of Craig's plans were made with Paige in mind, including his choice to freeze his sperm and delay his vision of becoming a dad until she was ready. The two also were very relaxed about their hopes for marriage, which hits differently now that they aren't a couple.

“She is doing housewife duties,” Madison LeCroy pointed out during episode 5 after Paige made floral arrangements for a party at Craig's house. She then asked, “What about just engagement without being engaged?”

Craig responded that the duo were “basically” engaged — and Paige didn't disagree.

Scroll down to see which of Craig and Paige's comments from season 10 haven't gotten better with age:


“For Paige and I, time spent in the backyard, that's our quality time,” Craig revealed during episode 3, which aired in December 2024, showing off his finished Charleston house. “When we first started dating, we were out and about all the time.”

He explained, “We just I guess [have] grown with each other. We'd rather spend the time at home relaxing than out partying. I built this sanctuary for us to be away from the world and be able to relax and connect.”

Craig shocked pals Austen and Shep Rose during episode 4 when he revealed, “Me and Paige have decided to freeze my sperm.”

His conversation with Paige, however, was equally as surprising. “I was thinking about freezing my sperm,” Craig told his then-girlfriend. “That's like the craziest thing in the world,” a stunned Paige said in response.

Craig went through with the process, telling his friends that it was Paige's decision to hold off on having kids, confessing that “without any influence from Paige” he would have his own timeline. “You date a little while, then you get married, then you have kids,” he said.

During the same episode, Craig said, “I want kids one day. Have I ever told you that I want kids right now?” He claimed, “I never said I want kids right now.”

Austen, however, told the cameras, “Ever since I've known Craig, he's wanted to get married, wanted to have kids.” Austen added, “I'm not entirely sold that Craig wants what Paige wants.”

Craig later confessed that his timeline had shifted after meeting the Summer House star. “The version of life that I saw myself living isn't what I'm living, which is this stable home that I grew up with,” he told the cameras. “Every night at dinner, my mom and dad were there with my brother. I just loved that.”

He concluded: “But I think If you find the right person and they happen to be a feisty Italian from New York things aren't always going to go how you have them planned.”

Paige was supportive of Craig's Sewing Down South company throughout their romance. They even joked about his crafts during episode 4, which aired on January 2, while envisioning one of the rooms in his house.

“Don't worry about me, you do what you want in that room,” Paige told Craig, who revealed he wanted the space to be “a multifunctional room where I can craft.”

Paige teased, “I want you to be able to hem things for me. It's been three years, and you haven't hemmed a single pair of freaking pants for me!”

While Paige was on board with a sewing nook, she shut down one of Craig's more outlandish suggestions for the room. “What about a wrapping paper wall?” he asked to which Paige replied, “What the f—? No.”

During episode 5, Craig joked about hosting a party to celebrate him freezing his sperm. He then revealed that he was leaving Paige his sperm if he dies, and she wants more kids.

“Is there a return policy,” she said with a laugh. Craig, however, was serious because of his dreams of their future.

“In the rom-com world that I live in, I die and you're like, ‘But I still want to have his children,'” he said. Paige, however, noted she “would never do that.”

She argued, “What, I'm going to have a child and then actively not give them a dad?” Craig responded by saying he understood that, but “instead of throwing it away immediately” she would now have a “choice” and it was a “gift” from him.

Craig and Shep had a heart-to-heart during episode 7, which aired on January 23, talking about his ups and downs with Paige. “You have been itching for this white picket fence existence. Now you have it,” Shep said, applauding Craig for his new life.

Craig admitted, “I think everyone knows, if it was up to me we would just get engaged. But she changes her mind a lot about stuff.”

He detailed Paige's inner thoughts, explaining, “One day she'll text me and say, ‘Let's build a f—ing farmhouse in the middle of nowhere.' Or like, ‘I'm moving to Charleston.' Then she'll have a good day in New York and be like, ‘I love it up here.'”

Shep asked if that's “hard to hear” to which Craig confessed, “It gets confusing.” He added, “I think that's life. It's a bunch of decisions and compromise.”

Craig later told the cameras that he did have some reservations about going off of Paige's timeline and not his own. “Me waiting a few years to have a kid, not a big deal. But what I'm risking is, ‘What if Paige wants to turn those couple years into 10 years?'” he asked.

During episode 9, which aired on February 6, Craig and Paige went to purchase bees for his Charleston home. While Craig called the experience his “fantasy,” Paige revealed she didn't love the idea of living on a farm.

“Sometimes I do fall into that fantasyland of being like, ‘Oh, wow, we could have a farm and a bunch of kids,'” Craig said. Paige acknowledged that she also makes up “fake scenarios” in her head but claimed she's more “realistic” than him.

Craig told Paige he's happy she's “grounded” but confessed, “It's also fun to hear excitement for the future too.”

Paige claimed that she didn't have a “checklist” of items she wants to do before they get married and have kids, but said she should be “allotted” the same time that Craig was in his early 30s to make her own timeline choices.

“I definitely feel a little pressure. I'm only 31,” Paige told Craig. “I'm not gonna lie, sometimes you make me feel like I'm 75.”

Paige then expressed frustration over anyone telling her when she should have kids, saying, “F— yeah it's my decision because I'm the one that holds it in my f—ing body,” she declared. “If you said to me right now, ‘We need to have a baby or I'm leaving,' you'd have to leave.”

Craig understood where she was coming from, but confessed that when Paige talks about “our kids” or says, “I'd be a great husband,” it makes him feel like, “Oh, she likes me.”

“[Is] who I am not enough? Do I not show enough love?” Paige fired back, adding, “If you can't handle the amount of love that I give then that's, like, a personal problem.”

Craig called the conversation “stupid” and said he was simply trying to be “lovey dovey” about their future.

Despite arguing during episode 9, Craig told his pals that he and Paige were heading toward engagement sooner rather than later.

“We're gonna get married,” Craig told Patricia Altschul at her annual guys' dinner, adding, “We're not really letting the ceremonial stuff keep us from living our lives.

He later clarified, “I'm gonna propose soon. Soon as in by the end of the year.” Craig also revealed, “I showed her a sheet of rings and told her to pick her favorite. She picked an emerald cut and elongated cushion.”

When asked if a proposal would prompt Craig to ask Paige to move to Charleston full-time, he confessed, “We don't know where we're going to end up.” He then asked, “What rule says we have to pick one city?”

“You shouldn't have to force someone into liking you. If the person likes you, they'll make time for you,” Craig said during the February 13 episode while reflecting on Shep's one-sided romance.

He confessed to his own shortcomings, revealing, “It's an insecurity that I have dealt with because Paige is so busy.” Craig noted, “Her career is one of her biggest priorities and I had to learn how to exist in that world.”

During the March 6 episode, Craig confided in Austen that he was an “addict” and had struggled with alcohol over the past few years. Craig explained that he had retreated from his friendship with Austen to help himself stay on track, but Paige was always there for him.

“I am very sorry for not understanding what you were going through,” Austen said during their group trip to the Bahamas, asking, “[Are] you and Paige strong as hell? You're fine with the distance? You're not like sitting at your house and being alone and battling, or no?”

Craig revealed that Paige was “right with me this entire time.” He explained, “There's a reason that me and Paige are so close. I just could not imagine being closer to someone. I'm so lucky that she chose to be like, ‘I see someone there.' She helped me, like, beat this demon.”

During the March 13 episode, Craig spoke more about his ups and downs with alcohol, revealing alcoholism runs in his family. “It was cyclical. I would be good for a few months and then I'd go too far,” he explained.

Craig noted that he wanted to get better when he saw how it affected Paige. “I got to my bottom when I could just see it on Paige's face. Just this look of, like, I wasn't the guy that she had seen herself marrying,” he shared, revealing, “So Paige was pretty much done.”

He confessed, “It wasn't until almost losing Paige for me to change my behaviors. Paige was my rock.”

Paige, meanwhile, told Craig during the episode that she “bit my tongue so many times because it truly is a personal journey.” She revealed that once Craig got on track she was “very proud” of him and his “self-awareness” over the past year.

“I will always be grateful I didn't lose you when I hit my bottom. I don't plan on going back there,” Craig vowed. Paige then teased, “But just know if I ever need to leave in the middle of the night with kids, I will.”

During season 10, episode 14, which aired on March 13, Austen came over for a visit to see both Craig and Paige. During their poolside chat, Paige made it clear that her allegiance was to Craig after Austen and Craig finally made up after being at odds for months.

“Look, I do love you. I love you as a friend. But my loyalty will always be to Craig no matter what,” Paige said. “So if Craig is fighting with someone, I also have to hate them.”

Once they buried the hatchet, Paige and Austen started talking about his love life and new girlfriend Audrey Pratt, who is 10 years his junior. “Honestly, I love that she lives in Charlotte. I'm not even going to think about that shit until we've hit the two-year mark of dating,” Austen shared.

Paige totally understood where Austen was coming from but pointed out that her relationship with Craig wasn't that relaxed to start. “Want to hear what a mind f— this is, Craig and I have been dating two and a half years,” she said. “Right when we started dating, it was like, ‘But are you going to move?' I was like, ‘I've known this man for six months.'”

Craig was visibly upset by the comment, asking, “Would it be weird to ever talk about if you wanted kids at six months in?” Austen said the kid conversation is fine to have early, revealing he and Audrey already talked about it and she wants four kids.

“She should marry Craig, Craig wants four,” Paige quipped. Craig replied that Paige wanted three, but she fired back, “I want two.”

Craig explained, “You said if you don't have one of each though, you will keep having kids,” which Paige acknowledged was the truth, noting two was her dream number.

“When I'm with them, I've noticed things are not as calm and cool as he makes it seem,” Austen later told the cameras of the then-couple. “Like, did she just snap at him a bit or is he, like, annoyed with her? I'm going to be honest, they are so on opposite sides of, like, the spectrum of life.”

During the season 10 finale, which aired on March 20, Craig was melancholy when Paige had to leave Charleston for work before heading on a family trip to Italy and then her “Giggly Squad” podcast tour.

“When am I going to see you?” he asked before dropping Paige off at the airport. She teased, “Never, this is the last time you're ever going to see me and you just don't know it.”

When they kissed outside the terminal, Craig confessed, “Aw, I don't know why, usually it doesn't feel like this.”

Later in the episode, Craig gushed to Austen about his and Paige's life plans, saying, “[I'm] 99 percent confident I'm going to propose this year, and I think we're both very excited about it.” Five months after filming that scene, Paige and Craig's breakup made headlines.

Members of the respective Summer House and Southern Charm casts chose violence this week while discussing Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conover's relationship and subsequent breakup.

Paige, 32, and Craig, 36, split late last year after three years together, with her initiating the breakup.

“Craig and I have decided to no longer be together,” she said during a December 2024 episode of the “Giggly Squad” podcast. “I love him, I think he loves me. I think we will remain friends. No one did anything. It wasn't a bad thing.”

In the months that have followed, especially as the current seasons of Summer House and Southern Charm air, more details about the breakup — and the aftermath — continue emerging. Several Bravo stars have spoken out, but this week's Summer House and Southern Charm aftershows brought some savage commentary.



“I feel like when I know I met my husband, I'll want to call him before I call my dad,” Paige said during the Summer House aftershow. “And I haven't met anyone like that yet.”

Keep scrolling to read the wildest aftershow quotes:


Producers asked Paige if she thinks Craig had “a different” version of her in his head.

“Who knows, I'd love to meet her?” she quipped during the aftershow. “Sometimes he'd be like, ‘You talk really dirty on your podcast.' … Whatever. I don't think he really, you know.”

Paige got honest during the Summer House aftershow, claiming that she would “stay more quiet” while Craig was “voicing his opinions” about their relationship.

“Him voicing his opinion that he wanted to be prioritized above my career,” she said. “He knows that even if I marry you, my kids are going to come before you anyway, so you'll always be third.”

She also admitted to not telling Craig career highs. “When I would get certain milestones, no I wouldn't tell him because I knew he would want to be happy for me but I knew deep down he would not be,” she confessed.

“I loved him so much that I tolerated too much,” Paige said. “Now that I'm out of it and I look back on things, I'm like, ‘Oh wait.' Anytime I had a career milestone, he found a way to make it about him.'”

She added: “Anytime it was something for me, my friend's wedding or a family wedding, he would find a way to make it about him and make me have a bad time. It was just embarrassing. That's something I look back on now and I'm like, ‘Oh wow, I was really blinded.'”

Paige has been honest about experiencing panic attacks, and she shared Craig's reaction.

“After I had my panic attack, he watched a documentary about the band Abba … and he told me to watch this documentary because it was about how tour ruined their marriages and their lives,” she claimed. “I was like, ‘I just got a beta blocker prescription but thank you so much for the nightly TV watch.'”

Kyle Cooke and Craig had some major beef that reverberated throughout the Summer House cast. This week's episode showed the two Bravo men talking out their drama — about alcohol brands, mind you — face-to-face after Kyle called out Craig on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.

During the Summer House aftershow, Kyle's wife, Amanda Batula, asked if he “should” have any regrets about the drama with Craig. Paige was quick to chime in and add, “No,” which is some tea if you ask Us.

“You heard it straight from her mouth,” Amanda added.

During the Southern Charm aftershow, Shep bluntly stated that it was “total f—ing bulls—” that Paige never went on the cast's trips.

“I couldn't get away with that if I had a girlfriend, I'll tell you that much,” he claimed, calling it “incomprehensible” that she wasn't around.

“Every time she'd come down here, except for a few occasions, she never made an attempt to get to know Charleston, to get to know members of the group,” Patricia Altschul claimed during the after show. “They were isolated.”

Madison LeCroy told Craig that he's “good at everything” during the Southern Charm aftershow and he had quite the response.

“Except keeping a girlfriend. … That's my limit, I guess. Three years. The three-year itch, they just disappear,” he claimed. “God, I did so well on her birthday too, guess what I got her? A bag from The Row.”

Former Gilligan's Island star Tina Louise is the last living original cast member from the classic 1960s sitcom.

Louise, 91, memorably played spoiled starlet Ginger Grant for three seasons on Gilligan's Island between 1964 and 1967, but also made news in the ‘60s for her marriage to talk show host Les Crane at the height of her fame. Crane's occasionally confrontational interview style was a forerunner for the combative talk shows that would become the norm decades later. Louise and Crane were only married for five years, but welcomed daughter (and future MTV producer) Caprice Crane before splitting in 1971. These days, Louise lives a quiet life away from the spotlight and dedicates most of her time to helping children learn to read.

Keep scrolling for a look at the Louise's high-profile marriage, her daughter's huge success in TV and what the actress's life is like today:


Louise (real name Tina Blacker) was the daughter of fashion model Sylvia Horn and Brooklyn candy store owner Joseph Blacker. Horn was only 18 years old when she gave birth to her daughter in 1934, and her marriage to Blacker broke down by the time Louise was 4 years old.



In a 2025 New York Times profile, Louise recalled being bounced between harsh boarding schools and her parents' dysfunctional homes throughout her childhood. After a brief period living with her father, Tina's mother took her in at age 11 after marrying her third of four husbands.

“I didn't have hugs,” she said of her childhood. “I didn't have loving situations.”

Blacker recalled being angry that her father didn't put up any legal fight to retain custody when her mother cut off all communication between them. Louise ended up estranged from her dad until her career breakthrough in 1958's Golden Globe-winning movie God's Little Acre when she was 24.

The actress now says she holds a sympathetic view of her mother since Sylvia was only a teenager when she gave birth.

“She didn't have the loving that she needed,” Louise said. “She always needed a man to lean on.”



Louise married Crane while working on Gilligan's Island in 1966. Crane had a varied and influential career as both a talk show host and an actor.

Crane's late-night show, Night Line (later known as The Les Crane Show), aired on WABC-TV in New York City starting in 1963, and was perhaps most notable in its local format for hosting The Rolling Stones in their American TV debut in June 1964.

After ending his talk show, Crane drifted between hosting and acting jobs before moving into the software industry in the 1980s. Perhaps his most famous acting gig was starring with Louise as a married couple in a 1970 episode of the ABC's anthology comedy show Love, American Style.

Les died at age 74 in July 2008. His and Louise's daughter, Caprice Crane, later paid tribute to her father's innovations in numerous industries.

“He was amazing. He was a fighter pilot. He was a radio DJ. He was a TV talk show host,” she told Pop Entertainment in 2009. “He won a Grammy. He started an internet company. He was all over the map. And everything he did, he succeeded in.”

Caprice went on, “He was always the first one to do something new. He was right on the edge, finding the next thing, before anyone else did. He was so smart and so funny and he died too young.”



Tina and Les' daughter, Caprice, was born in November 1970, only a few months before her parents called it quits.

After graduating from New York University, Caprice got her start in the entertainment industry as a writer-producer for MTV, where she worked on the MTV Movie Awards and was involved in the production of sports specials for the network.

She later moved on to writing novels and screenplays for Hollywood, including working on the reboots of Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place in the 2000s.

In 2009, Caprice told Pop Entertainment that Louise was always hugely “supportive” of her Hollywood aspirations even though the actress walked away from the industry.

“My mom is fantastic. She's so great, so adorable, so supportive. And we're obviously so close,” she said. “She misses me, and if there is one thing I don't like about living [in LA], it's not being so close to my mom. Some people think this is insane, but when I'm in New York, my apartment is literally one block away from my mom's apartment. And I love it. I could even live in the same building as her, but probably not the same floor. I love having her that close.”



Louise never officially retired from acting but has chosen to live away from the spotlight in recent years. The actress infamously refused to reprise her role as Ginger Grant for three Gilligan's Island TV movies in the 1970s and ‘80s, but did appear in 1975's classic science fiction film The Stepford Wives and later costarred with Brad Pitt in 1991's Johnny Suede.

The actress told The New York Times in March 2025 that, while she's “very grateful” of her time on Gilligan's Island, she would prefer “to be known for other things.” Louise explained that part of her reticence with the legacy of Gilligan's Island is due to the cast making “so little money” during production and “not a cent” from more than 50 years of reruns.

In 1996, Louise got involved with the advocacy group Learning Leaders, which helps train tutors to teach children to read.

“I loved it, being anonymous, just being the person who read to the children,” Louise told the publication. “That was very important to me because nobody ever read to me.”

She went on, “I love being in their presence for an hour. It's better than vitamins. I can't get back what I went through, but outside of being with my family, doing this is my special thing.”

In a March 2025 Forbes profile, Louise said she'd recently promised Caprice and her newborn granddaughter that she would “live [another] 40 years.”

“I'm going to do the best I can. I'm not thinking about leaving,” she insisted. “I don't think of that. I don't want to think about it. I'm running to stay healthy. I'm walking to the gym. I'm just thinking about staying alive for my family. I love being alive.”

Andrew Garfield and Monica Barbaro are enjoying public outings now that the world knows they are a couple!

The 41-year-old actor and the 34-year-old actress, who are both Oscar nominees, were seen getting into their car to head home after attending a Mumford & Sons concert on Thursday (March 21) at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.

Andrew and Monica first sparked dating rumors a little over a month ago when they were spotted together in public for the second time. Hours later, it was confirmed that they are dating.

“They've been really lowkey and have been spending time together quietly,” a source told People back in February.

Andrew and Monica are spending time together in Los Angeles these days and they were also spotted earlier in the week on a grocery run in Malibu.

The new musical Operation Mincemeat is now open on Broadway after taking London's West End by storm!

Original cast members Zoe Roberts, Claire-Marie Hall, Jak Malone, Natasha Hodgson, and David Cumming walked the red carpet together at the opening night performance on Thursday (March 21) at the Golden Theatre in New York City.

The five actors, several of whom also helped co-write the musical, all starred in the West End production back in 2023 and they've brought the show to New York for a limited run. Originally scheduled to run for 16 weeks only, Operation Mincemeat has already extended its run two times due to popular demand and tickets are on sale through August 18.

Several celebs stepped out for the opening night performance, including Jesse Eisenberg, Samuel L. Jackson with director Kenny Leon, Dylan Mulvaney, and Sydney Lemmon.

In Operation Mincemeat, ""it's 1943, and the Allied Forces are on the ropes. Luckily, they've got a trick up their sleeve. Well, not up their sleeve, per se, but rather inside the pocket of a stolen corpse. Equal parts farce, thriller, and Ian Fleming-style spy caper (with an assist from Mr. Fleming himself), Operation Mincemeat tells the wildly improbable and hilarious true story of the covert operation that turned the tide of WWII."" 

The show was nominated for six Olivier Awards and won two - Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical for Jak Malone.

Broadway critics are giving glowing reviews to the musical with TheaterMania calling it ""a highlight of the season"" and Variety notes the show has ""comic madness and theatrical joy.""
