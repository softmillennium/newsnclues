A new artificial intelligence (AI)-driven weather prediction system could transform forecasting, researchers predict

The system, dubbed Aardvark Weather, generates forecasts tens of times faster than traditional forecasting systems using a fraction of the computing power, researchers reported Thursday (March 20) in the journal Nature.

"The weather forecasting systems we all rely on have been developed over decades, but in just 18 months, we've been able to build something that's competitive with the best of these systems, using just a tenth of the data on a desktop computer," Richard Turner, an engineer at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, said in a statement.

Current weather forecasts are generated by inputting data into complex physics models, a multi-stage process that requires several hours on a dedicated supercomputer.

Aardvark Weather circumvents this demanding process: the machine learning model uses raw data from satellites, weather stations, ships and weather balloons to make its predictions without relying on atmospheric models. Satellite data are particularly important for the model's predictions, the team noted.

This new approach could offer major advantages in terms of cost, speed and accuracy of weather forecasts, the researchers claimed. Instead of requiring a supercomputer and a dedicated team, Aardvark Weather can generate a forecast on a desktop computer in just a few minutes.

The team compared Aardvark's performance to existing forecasting systems that generate global predictions. Using just 8% of the observational data that traditional forecasting systems need, Aardvark outperformed the U.S. national Global Forecast System (GFS)system and was comparable to forecasts made by the United States Weather Service.

However, Aardvark's spatial resolution is somewhat lower than those of current forecasting systems, which could make its initial predictions less relevant for hyper-local weather forecasting. Aardvark Weather operates at 1.5-degree resolution, meaning each box in its grid covers 1.5 degrees of latitude and 1.5 degrees of longitude. For comparison, the GFS uses a 0.25-degree grid.

However, the researchers also said that because the AI learns from the data it is fed, it could be tailored to predict weather in specific arenas — such as temperatures for African agriculture or wind speeds for renewable energy in Europe. Aardvark can incorporate higher-resolution regional data, where they exist, to refine local forecasts.

"These results are just the beginning of what Aardvark can achieve," study coauthor Anna Allen, of the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. "This end-to-end learning approach can be easily applied to other weather forecasting problems, for example hurricanes, wildfires, and tornadoes. Beyond weather, its applications extend to broader Earth system forecasting, including air quality, ocean dynamics, and sea ice prediction."

Aardvark could also support forecasting centers in areas of the world that lack the resources to refine global forecasts into high-resolution regional predictions, the researchers said.

"Aardvark's breakthrough is not just about speed, it's about access," Scott Hosking, an AI researcher at The Alan Turing Institute in the U.K., said in the statement. "By shifting weather prediction from supercomputers to desktop computers, we can democratize forecasting, making these powerful technologies available to developing nations and data-sparse regions around the world."

	Common coot nests preserve layers of plastic dating back decades

Biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra excavates a common coot nest he and colleagues collected in Amsterdam. City birds have been making their nests out of plastic waste for decades, the team's research shows.

13 seconds ago

One man's trash is a common coot's treasure, at least when it comes to plastic.

In Amsterdam, the birds have been constructing nests out of plastic food wrappers, masks and other waste for at least 30 years, researchers report in the February Ecology. The revelation shows not only how much plastic now litters the environment but also the power of using human-made products to learn about the natural world.

“It's ironic to think that many of these plastic single-use items have just been used for minutes by people, yet these coots have used them for decades,” says Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands.

Hiemstra has been studying nesting materials used by city birds for years. He's documented coots adding face masks to their nests during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — a building material that coots and other birds still use — and found rebellious magpies and crows that built their homes out of antibird spikes. Many birds these days use human trash as nest-building material, Hiemstra says.

In 2021, Hiemstra and colleagues excavated a common coot (Fulica atra) nest built on a wooden beam poking out of Rokin canal in Amsterdam. The nest had multiple layers of plastic waste, especially food packages. By analyzing the expiration dates on the coots' collection, Hiemstra used the plastic the way an archaeologist would use fossils, to build a history of the nest layer by layer.

Coots typically build their nests out of plant material that quickly decays, so the birds can't reuse nests year after year. With the incorporation of plastics, however, the nests become much more stable, so the coots can return to old nests and build upon their solid foundations.

In total, Hiemstra's team found 15 nests that had plastic dating to multiple years, indicating the birds had been reusing them.

Using expiration dates to understand nest history can be imprecise. Since plastic lasts so long, old pieces of it can find their way into recent nest layers. For instance, Hiemstra found a bag of paprika chips from a 1970s brand toward the top of one nest. But when packages with similar expirations are bunched together, Hiemstra says, it builds confidence that that part of the nest was constructed around that time.

In the deepest part of the Rokin nest, he found several wrappers dating to the early 1990s, including a Mars Bar wrapper promoting the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

“Weirdly enough, the wrapper is in pristine condition, as if it were littered yesterday,” Hiemstra says. “Yet you know it is 30 years old. It really shows plastic is here to stay.”

There have been hundreds of measles cases reported in the U.S. since the beginning of the year. Here's what you need to know about measles immunity.

Hundreds of people have caught measles in the United States this year, with the majority of the cases tied to outbreaks of the disease. So far, Texas has been the hardest hit, with the highest number of reported illnesses.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 301 people in the U.S. have had confirmed measles infections this year, as of March 13. Additional, probable cases have been reported by various states, but they've yet to be independently confirmed by the CDC.

Kids under 5 years old account for 34% of the confirmed measles cases, with a further 42% affecting children and teens ages 5 to 19. In total, 17% of the cases have resulted in hospitalization.

There has been one confirmed death related to the outbreaks, and a second remains under investigation. The first fatal case was in an unvaccinated school-age child in Texas, marking the first death from measles in the U.S. since 2015. The second deadly case was reported in a New Mexico resident by local health authorities, but the CDC has yet to conclude its own investigation of the case, which would help confirm its connection to ongoing outbreaks.

The vast majority of the confirmed measles infections — 95% — have been in people who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most of the infections have been reported in Texas, with data from the Texas Department of State Health Services showing that 279 measles cases were identified between late January and March 18.

Experts say the Texas outbreak is likely related to low rates of vaccination in the state. For instance, data suggest that around 18% of school-age children in Gaines County have been exempted from at least one vaccine, and 191 measles cases have occurred in that county so far. Meanwhile, Gaines' neighboring counties of Dawson, Yoakum, Terry and Martin have reported 11, 11, 36 and 3 cases, respectively.

As measles continues to spread, here's what to know about the protection of the measles vaccine, how long it lasts, and how to know if you're immune to the disease.

Measles can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella; or the MMRV vaccine, which additionally protects against the chickenpox-causing varicella virus. The CDC recommends that children receive their first dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine between the ages of 12 and 15 months and their second dose between 4 and 6 years old.

(For measles protection, the MMR vaccine is generally recommended over the MMRV vaccine, because it's less likely to trigger fevers in children. For those who get the MMR shot, a separate vaccine is recommended to protect against chickenpox (varicella).)

Unvaccinated older children and adults are also advised to receive two doses of a measles vaccine, at least 28 days apart.

One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are 97% effective, according to the CDC. The MMRV vaccine offers the same level of measles protection.

"It's probably one of the best vaccines that we have," Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton in the U.K., told Live Science in an email.

"For example, the COVID-19 vaccines are very good at reducing mortality, but less good at preventing a mild COVID-19 infection," Head said. The measles vaccine is highly protective against measles infections of all severity levels.

Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 thanks to widespread vaccination against the disease. The CDC defines "elimination" as the "absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area." Measles is not yet "eradicated" worldwide, meaning it still spreads regularly in other countries and can be imported to the U.S.



The MMR vaccine provides long-lasting measles protection for most people, with immunity typically being lifelong after two doses, according to the CDC. However, one 2024 study published in the journal The Lancet Public Health reported that measles immunity does fade slightly over time.

"Like with COVID vaccines, antibody levels do reduce over time," Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science via email. Antibodies are protective immune proteins that appear in the days and weeks after a person receives a vaccine, but these proteins are expected to disappear over time.

"However there is likely continued immunity with memory immune cells that can be activated as needed (as we have seen in COVID vaccines)," Chin-Hong added. When exposed to the measles vaccine, the body generates "memory" cells in the immune system, which can quickly mount an immune response and make new antibodies if a person encounters the measles virus.

"In general, protection once immunized against measles, wanes very little," Chin-Hong said. The Lancet study suggested that, on average, measles immunity waned by about 0.039% per year after the age of 5.

Yes, if a person survives a bout of measles infection, they typically have lifelong immunity against the virus. However, even as the immune system mounts a powerful response against measles, its guard against other infections gets lowered.

Many studies find that measles infections induce a kind of "immune amnesia," in which memory cells tasked with remembering pathogens are lost and the body is unable to rev up its antibody responses, as it used to. This leaves a person at increased risk of other infections for years following their brush with measles.

Other complications of measles infection include a rare but deadly central nervous system condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which can develop seven to 10 years after the infection. Some people can also experience brain swelling (encephalitis) during a measles infection, which can cause convulsions, permanent hearing loss and intellectual disability.

The measles vaccine provides lifelong immunity against the virus without these dangerous complications associated with measles infection.

If you've received two doses of the MMR vaccine, you're considered immune for life in most cases. Additionally, if you've had a confirmed case of measles in the past, you're likely immune for life.

If someone is still unsure whether they've either been vaccinated or had the disease, there's a test that checks for measles-specific antibodies in your blood. The type of measles antibody it screens for belongs to a broad class called immunoglobulin G (IgG), which protects the body from infection by binding to pathogens.

If enough measles-specific IgG antibodies are present, compared to a standard threshold, a person has immunity.

"You can check an antibody level with the help of a health care provider," Chin-Hong said. The test will give you a number back that's called a "titer"; this is a measure of your antibody levels. However, the test will not pick up memory cells, Chin-Hong said, so it could miss that additional layer of evidence that you're immune to measles.



If a person is unsure about how protected they are against measles, they can get a booster shot of the vaccine to bolster their immunity.

"It is perfectly safe to have another dose," Head said. "The recommendation to get an extra dose will typically come from public health teams, and it's always best to see the advice of a healthcare worker if anyone is unsure."

If someone has had two doses of the measles vaccine in their lifetime, there is likely no need for a booster shot. The exception is a group of people who received the measles vaccine in the 1960s, who would need an additional MMR vaccine to ensure their protection.

That's because the measles vaccine used in the U.S. between 1963 and 1967 was less effective than modern measles vaccines. Unlike the current shots, which contain live-but-weakened viruses, the old shot contained an inactivated virus, so it was completely "killed." In response to the old vaccine, the immune system did not develop long-lasting memory cells, unlike the vaccines used today. Many people who received the old vaccine lost their immunity within a few years, leaving them vulnerable to measles later in life.

In addition to people who received only this old vaccine, anyone who has gotten only one dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine is recommended to get the recommended second dose.

The CDC started recommending two doses of the MMR shot in 1989, Chin-Hong noted, so those vaccinated before that time may need a second dose.

Individuals traveling to areas experiencing measles outbreaks, including within the U.S., can also consider getting another dose even if they're fully vaccinated, Chin-Hong said.

Additionally, health care workers, immunocompromised people and those who live with them, and college students should check their vaccination records to confirm they've received two MMR doses, and perhaps get an immunity test if they are unsure, Chin-Hong suggested. Individuals can speak with their health care provider about getting a booster shot, if they're interested in receiving one.

Fully vaccinated people may still catch measles, but only in rare circumstances.

About 3% of fully vaccinated people may still develop measles symptoms after an exposure to the virus, according to the CDC. However, people who have been fully vaccinated tend to experience milder symptoms than unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, and they are also less likely to spread the virus to others.

These "breakthrough" cases become more likely in the context of large outbreaks or high-exposure settings — when an individual has prolonged, close contact with an infected person. About 5% of total measles cases in the U.S. are breakthrough cases, according to the CDC.

Additionally, people with weakened immune systems — due to medical conditions or medications — might not maintain full protection, even if they're fully vaccinated. So they can be more prone to breakthrough cases.

In the current Texas outbreak, there were a "handful" of people who contracted measles after having only one shot," Chin-Hong noted. In a study that looked at measles cases in California between 2000 and 2015, most of those infected were unvaccinated, but 11% of the total cases were among people who had gotten two doses of measles vaccine. The fully vaccinated group did have milder disease, however.

Herd immunity refers to when a high percentage of a population is immune to a disease, making it difficult for the infection to spread. Reaching this collective level of immunity protects even those who can't be vaccinated, such as newborn babies, pregnant people or immunocompromised people.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, and because of that, at least 95% of a given population needs to be immune to prevent major outbreaks.

—US has already had more measles cases in 2024 than all of 2023

—Measles deaths jumped over 40% from 2021 to 2022, CDC reports

"Measles is so infectious, with very high levels of transmission. Typically, we refer to 95% coverage as the magic number of that 'herd immunity threshold,'" Head told Live Science. "At this level of coverage, there may still be individual case[s], but the majority of the population is protected, and the outbreaks will remain small and very localised."

MMR coverage among U.S. kindergartners has declined in recent years, according to the CDC. In the 2019-2020 school year, 95.2% of kindergartners had received two doses of the MMR vaccine, but in the 2023-2024 school year, that coverage dropped to 92.7%. That marked the "fourth consecutive year" that national coverage had been below the targeted 95%.

Several states — including Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia and Florida — had less than 90% coverage during the 2023-2024 school year.

Researchers have counted the number of trees in China and mapped their distribution across the country using a laser-based technique called lidar.

A new estimate suggests China is home to 142.6 billion trees, meaning the country has roughly 100 trees per inhabitant.

These numbers are considerable, given how densely populated China is, an expert told Live Science. Still, the total figure may be an underestimate due to the limitations of the technology used to count the trees, the authors of the new study said.

"The actual number could be higher," said Qinghua Guo, a professor in the Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System at Peking University and the lead author of the study. China's Ninth National Forest Resources Inventory counted an average of 426 trees per acre (1,052 trees/hectare) across the country in 2019, which is much higher than the new study's estimate of 279 trees per acre (689 trees/hectare), Guo told Live Science in an email.

The true number of trees could be somewhere in the middle, but more research is needed to figure out what it is, he said.

An accurate estimate of China's tree population is crucial to evaluating forest ecosystem conditions and the amount of carbon that is being locked away in trees, Guo said. He and his colleagues also created a detailed map showing the distribution of China's trees, which they say will help the country hit its ecological and climate targets.

"The study represents the first high-resolution mapping of tree density across China," Guo said. "Ultimately, this research contributes to China's approach to global sustainable ecosystem management and restoration."

To produce the estimate, the researchers used a laser-based mapping technique called lidar (light detection and ranging). The team has been collecting lidar data from drones since 2015, amounting to an area covering 540 square miles (1,400 square kilometers).

For the new study, the scientists counted the number of trees in this area using software called Lidar360 that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI). They then extrapolated the resulting tree density estimate to obtain a national figure, with the results published Feb. 6 in the journal Science Bulletin.



The technology is cutting-edge, but some features need ironing out, Guo said. For example, Lidar360 cannot detect trees growing below thick canopies. "In densely forested areas, overlapping canopies obstruct the accurate detection of mid-story and understory trees, leading to lower-than-actual tree counts," Guo said. Incorporating terrestrial lidar data and improving the software could provide more accurate tree counts, he added.

Despite certain limitations, the results broadly align with researchers' previous understanding of China's tree population, said Tom Crowther, an assistant professor in the department of environmental systems science at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. "Globally, there are closer to 400 trees per person, but in such a densely populated region, it makes sense that this number is lower," Crowther, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.

China's tree population may soon increase, however, because the country is planting seedlings at a dizzying rate. Tree counts could skyrocket this spring as drones are deployed to seed the "Great Green Wall" — a huge belt of trees in the north of China that is being planted to prevent the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts from expanding. The Great Green Wall project — also known as the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program — started in 1978 and is due to be completed in 2050, by which point it could hold 100 billion trees. The wall is already the world's largest seeded forest with more than 66 million trees, but its success in staving off desertification is debated.

The technology used for the study not only helps to count and map trees, but it could also optimize where China chooses to focus its tree-planting efforts.

"The fusion of high-precision data and intelligent models ensures that every tree can be planted in the most suitable location," Guo said.

The Neurosurgeon Who Advised Severance Breaks Down Its Science

A neurosurgeon who has acted as a consultant for Severance explains the science behind the show's brain-altering procedure—and whether it could ever become reality.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Naeem Amarsy & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Today we're talking about the science of Severance.

What if instead of struggling to find work-life balance, you could completely separate your professional identity from your personal one? That question kicks off the Apple TV+ show Severance, which just wrapped up its second season.

In the world of the show, a company called Lumon Industries requires certain employees to undergo its “severance” procedure, which its spokespeople say means you'll never have to take work home with you again. It also means you have to get a microchip implanted into your brain.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

To help make the procedure and its effects as realistic as possible, the folks behind Severance brought on a real-life neurosurgeon to consult on the show. Vijay Agarwal is chief of the [Division] Skull-Base [and Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery] [and Director of Brain] Tumor Center at Montefiore Einstein [Medical Center]. We sat down with him to get the inside scoop on the science of severance.

Before we get into that chat, just a brief spoiler warning: we did our best to avoid any super-specific spoilers for recent episodes, but we'd recommend waiting until you've watched at least episode seven of season two before listening.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Vijay Agarwal: Yeah, my pleasure.

Feltman: So tell me how you got involved with the show Severance and what that's entailed.

Agarwal: You know, it's sort of hard for people to believe, but it really was just a call out of the blue. Just one day at work I got a call that they were looking for someone for a concept for a show that hadn't come out yet. That was pre-COVID, in a very different world ...

Feltman: Right.

Agarwal: Than we live in now. And it was just as simple as that. It was just a thought at that stage—you know, “We wanna develop a procedure that implants a chip that separates your work life from your social life, from your everyday life.” And we were off to the races.

Feltman: Yeah. What were your initial thoughts and reactions when you first heard that premise?

Agarwal: I thought it was a very cool concept, and I think I just directly went into how that could be a reality. You know, one of the things that Ben Stiller was really strict on was that he wanted this to be as believable as possible ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: As real as possible. There are some sort of creative allowances that happen as part of this process, but he really wanted the science to be real and to be believable, and I think that's part of the reason that people have really bonded with the show and in particular the science.

Feltman: Yeah, well, that's a great segue to my next question, which is: What are some of the, the real science concepts and, you know, factual medical procedures that you've baked into the concept of the severance procedure?

Agarwal: I made a statement a while ago that I don't think we're far off from things like this happening, and I really firmly believe that. And we're actually much closer than when I made that statement.

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: So if we had told somebody a few years ago that we would be implanting electrodes in the brain to stimulate the brain to treat people who are paralyzed and allow them to be able to walk again or treat their obsessive-compulsive disorder, their addiction, their severe suicidal depression, obesity, things like that, we would think people are crazy, but those things are actually happening currently in science. And almost every major academic center around the world is doing these sorts of procedures every day, in particular to help people with diseases like Parkinson's disease. And so it seems like a very science fiction-type concept, but it's part of our everyday life as neurosurgeons and neuroscientists.

Feltman: Well, and can you walk me through, you know, in creating the concept for the severance procedure, where did you sort of pepper in factual details, you know, for example, the placement of the chip?

Agarwal: I actually think that that scene is very, very realistic.

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: And so we—I borrowed from the science and the surgeries that we do today, even. So some of the navigation equipment that we use, I had that equipment shipped in. And so when I started, it really was just a concept: “How do we develop the severance procedure? How do we ‘sever' people?” Then we sort of developed the science, and I remember very—in the early days of the show sitting at a, you know, a big conference table with Ben and Dan [Erickson] and a lot of the producers, and we just had a whiteboard in it, and we would just spitball concepts ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Until we found one that was, you know, really believable and the one that people liked and the one that Ben thought would fit with his vision.

And so we really implant in an area that is able to process memories but, interestingly, associates those memories with emotion. It's the amygdala and hippocampus, so those sort of middle part of the structures, on the left side of the brain, which is the dominant side of the brain for most people. So what a great area to stimulate to really facilitate this ability to separate our “innies” from our “outies”: number one, the ability to process memories, but then, number two, the ability to, to associate those memories with emotion. So that was a perfect place to do it. And then, actually, the procedure was very realistic. So how we put the hole in the skull, the needle with which we use to implant the chip, those are things that we use every day in neurosurgery and neuroscience currently.

Feltman: And you actually appear on camera to do the procedure, is that right?

Agarwal: Season one, episode two—so when we implant the chip in Helly. So we really designed that set. So, you know, Ben had a very specific vision in mind, and then our goal was really to try to make that vision become a reality. And so everything was important on that set, from the scientific accuracy to the lighting to the cinematography. And so it was all specifically laid out to capture a purpose. And so that's the episode that I appeared in and very proud with the, the way it came out.

Feltman: Yeah. So just to really spell out the actual neuroscience here, which I think is so cool, in your mind—pardon the pun—what is that chip doing in there, in that part of the brain?

Agarwal: As I mentioned before there are se—multiple companies trying to do something on a different scale, which is trying to stimulate the brain to alter the way that it functions: so Elon Musk's Neuralink; a lot of my friends are working on this technology at different centers around the country; Synchron is another company based out of New York that's trying to do something similar in terms of being able to modify the function of the brain by inputting electrical stimulation.

And Elon, he gave a talk at one of our recent neurosurgery meetings, and he's compared the brain to a big circuit board. And then he likened the work that they're doing with Neuralink is really adjusting the electricity that's going into the circuit board to modify the way that it fires, to change the way that it fires and really dictate how that circuit board functions to make your computer run a certain way, your TV run a certain way. And I think that's really the best way to look at what we're doing in the severance procedure.

If you look at the brain as, as one big computer, if you change the way that you, instruct the computer to function by really changing the way you're putting electricity in, by firing all of these neurons across the brain, you can really affect the way that your brain processes or pulls memories from its memory bank—and then also to potentially modify what emotions are associated with those memories as well.

And that's what the amygdala and hippocampus does: so the amygdala is very famous for fear responses and things like that, very profound emotion. And if you followed season two, I think this concept of fear and these really dark emotions are really prevalent in this season. And so when—one of the recent episodes, where we follow Cobel going to where she grew up, it's a very kind of dark, fearful episode. And so that's exactly the type of brain and the emotions that we're trying to conjure, is the stimulation of this amygdala and hippocampus.

Feltman: Yeah, speaking of season two—I mean, back in season one, we were introduced to this concept of “reintegration,” where the severed consciousnesses kind of come back together, and we've seen a lot more of the messiness of that process in season two. Did you weigh in at all on what that might look like from a neuroscience perspective?

Agarwal: Yeah, so I was actually on set for a lot of that work in terms of the reintegration, just to make sure that work was being done well. I worked with Adam Scott, who plays Mark, on some of the things, such as, in one of the recent episodes ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Agarwal: He had a seizure, and I thought he did an absolutely brilliant job portraying that, and, you know, it really shows sort of the academic stint a lot of the actors and Ben take in the show; I think Adam Scott and Ben Stiller in particular really look at this as almost homework, to try to really understand it. And so I helped Adam, and I was, you know, send—texting with him after that episode because I was just so proud with how that seizure came out. It was, you know, it was very realistic, and that's a hard thing to capture.

So we worked on that, and then the reintegration procedure, I had a lot of input with how that would work—you know, what sort of science would go into something like a reintegration procedure—so I remember sending and reviewing ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Articles from the literature about being able to do things that would be likened to reintegration or to really enhance things like electrical stimulation. We were able to use almost like a transmagnetic stimulation-type device. We were able to really use very realistic scientific methods to incorporate into this reintegration.

Feltman: Yeah, and for listeners who don't know, could you talk a little bit about what TMS is and how it relates to what we saw in that reintegration episode?

Agarwal: Yeah, transmagnetic stimulation, it's an amazing technology, and it's basically putting these magnetic fields into the brain to alter the way that your brain fires. And there's very good data to show that people who have become paralyzed can regain some functionality—so some ability to move—in areas that are either weak or paralyzed.

And so there's a lot of different uses for transmagnetic stimulation, and it's delivered very similarly to the way that we saw in one of the earlier episodes, where Reghabi is reintegrating Mark in his basement. And so there's actually, today in society, transmagnetic stimulation medical spas ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: That you could go to to receive this very intense therapy. And so there's a lot of people who feel that this is really gonna be a major advance for us to use against things like paralysis and depression and things like that.

Feltman: Yeah, that's super interesting.

Speaking of reintegration we've seen some random acts of basement neurosurgery [laughs] in this season. From a neurological standpoint what kind of risks would someone like Mark be facing in that situation?

Agarwal: I think there was a bit of a red herring—so in one of the earlier episodes this season, where Reghabi was reintegrating Mark, you could see, as she was delivering this transmagnetic-type stimulation on the left side of the brain, his right hand start to shake ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Really the left side of the brain controlling the right side of the body. And so the same risks that we saw, namely seizure, which we saw him have a very sort of total body seizure, those sorts of things would be a big risk. So bleeding in the brain: the brain didn't—doesn't like anything sort of entering into the brain or disturbing the brain; it's about a 1 percent risk of what we say is hemorrhage. Infection: so there being a big infection in that area, that's also a possibility. But I think irritating the brain is one of the most common side effects of a procedure like that. And when the brain is irritated, oftentimes it'll manifest by seizing ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Which means really firing electrons abnormally in the brain, which is what we saw.

Feltman: So we've talked about season two a little bit and about fear and, and emotion in memory. Obviously, in one of the kind of biggest and most impactful episodes of season two, we saw a character who seemed to be severed many times over and have this, like, very compartmentalized consciousness and was experiencing a lot of emotions that were then cut off when they emerged from, you know, that area of the floor they were on. How much more complicated do you think that would be than sort of a standard severance floor chip behavior we've seen so far?

Agarwal: You mean in real life?

Feltman: Yeah.

Agarwal: I think it would actually be less complicated ...

Feltman: Oh, yeah?

Agarwal: So currently, right now, there's these amazing videos—people who wanna go to YouTube and see this, they can—these very amazing videos of people with Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disease, and oftentimes one of the biggest symptoms they have is uncontrollable shaking. So we actually, as part of the standard of care of treating these patients, we'll put electrodes into very specific parts of the brain and deliver electricity, and when you turn it on they'll almost completely stop shaking. And when you turn it off, which is a flip of a switch externally, they start shaking uncontrollably, to the point that they can't care for themselves, they can't shower, they can't eat, they can't function in society—just from a flip of a switch externally.

So imagine you're able to do that from, like, your phone, anywhere in the world. But then it all—you know, it begs the question: “Who is the one flipping that switch? And ethically who should have the right to flip that switch?”

Feltman: Yeah. Last question: you know, Severance is one of those shows that inspires so many fan theories, more and more with every episode. I'm just curious, when friends and patients talk to you, how often do you get people trying to, you know, pull some secret Severance info out of you or get you to weigh in on their theories?

Agarwal: Yeah, you know, it's—I think people have strayed away from doing that. What I've noticed is that I actually rarely get asked, and that's good because my response is always, “Well, I guess you'll just have to see the rest of the season,” so I've been trained well.

But I actually have more people, even in the general community, just wanna talk about ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: The show, not specifically trying to figure out what happens in the later episodes; they're just so fascinated with the show and the concept and the way that it's written and the work that, you know, Ben, Dan and Mark have done—and the rest of the team as well. And it's really amazing to see the response to the show 'cause people just wanna talk about it.

It's like when people read a good book and they wanna talk to other people who have read the book and they just really delve into, you know, “What did this mean? What do you think this means?” And people just wanna talk about the show. And I absolutely love it 'cause I think it's brilliant, I love the show, I love watching the show, and I, you know, love talking about it. And so I actually don't get people really poking about what happens later on in the show. I get people who really genuinely enjoy it and actually just wanna talk about it, just wanna talk shop, and I enjoy that as well, and I think that really speaks to the response the show has had.

Feltman: Absolutely. Well, thank you so much for joining us to chat. As a Severance fan I have really loved this, so we really appreciate it.

Agarwal: Yeah, my pleasure, and I'm excited for you guys to see the rest of the season.
