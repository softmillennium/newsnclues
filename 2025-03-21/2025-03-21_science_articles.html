                <p>Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport in Europe, was shut down following a fire at a single electricity sub-station on the night of March 20. The fire at the North Hyde substation in Hayes, about 1.5 miles from Heathrow in west London, seriously disrupted the area’s power supply, including that of the airport.

The closure has caused chaos, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. More than 1,300 flights have been affected, according to the plane tracking website Flightradar24. About 120 of these were already in the air.

Below, a panel of experts offer their insights – and consider the implications of such a major incident. (Elements of this panel were sourced by the Science Media Centre, which published a version here.)

Power in west London is highly constrained

Barry Hayes, associate professor in electrical power systems, University College Cork

It appears that a transformer fire in the North Hyde 275kV substation caused the power outage (videos from the scene clearly show one of the large power transformers ablaze). This is a large electrical substation which supplies the area to the northeast of Heathrow airport as well as the Heathrow airport site. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, the local electricity distributor, said 67,000 homes and businesses in the area were cut off overnight as a result of this issue.

While the North Hyde substation is a very important part of the west London electricity grid, it is generally not expected that this would cause such a big impact at Heathrow airport. There are also dedicated supplies to other parts of the airport site.

Typically, a critical electricity load such as Heathrow would be served from multiple supply points in the electricity grid, and therefore there would be an option to feed the loads at Heathrow from an alternative supply point. There are some reports that parts of the airport (for example, Terminal 5) have power.

The exact reasons for such a big impact are unclear at this point, but we do know the North Hyde substation is in a highly constrained area of the UK electricity grid – an area where there has been “a steep increase in the number of new electricity connection requests across west London, driven by new housing developments, commercial investment and datacentres”.

The UK power grid (as in many developed countries) is generally old or outdated, with many of its components at the end of their anticipated service lifetime and in urgent need of modernisation. These issues may be a factor in the power outage affecting Heathrow. However, it will take some time before the exact causes of this incident are established.

Weather, ageing equipment or malicious attacks could be to blame

Chenghong Gu, professor in smart energy systems, University of Bath

This is a very rare event. Substations are built and operated according to very strict standards, and they are monitored 24/7. There are also many automatic devices in substations like this one to deal with faults.

A substation has many components including transformers, circuit breakers, an isolator, busbars and measuring equipment. Transformers are the most vulnerable to fire. There is insulation oil in them and in high-temperature, high-pressure situations, they can explode – meaning the insulation oil leaks and can catch fire.

However, it is very unusual for big substations like this to catch fire. One cause can be extreme weather such as lightning strikes, which could cause extreme high voltage on the equipment. Extreme hot weather together with high demand can also cause transformers to become overheated, thus leading to faults.

Another factor is the ageing of transformers. The insulation gas can degrade, which could cause an explosion inside a transformer. Or there could be a malfunction of other auxiliary devices such as the insulator, switch gears or circuit breakers inside the substation.

Other possible causes include a malicious attack on the substation – someone setting fire to it deliberately, for example. Cyber-attacks on IT systems can also cause a malfunction of devices in the substation, leading to fire.

Serious questions about Heathrow’s back-ups

Kirk Chang, professor of management and technology, University of East London

The airport lost power because of the fire – we understand that. But the back-up system didn’t work. It’s difficult to understand how that could happen.

There are two things we need to look at. Number one is the technical part. Why did the back-up machines not work? Maybe the machines did not have sufficient fuel, or for some reason the system was not linked to the grid. The backup should kick in immediately.

The second point is more the human side. Who is responsible for the power management, and what intervention strategies were attempted? I would assume they would need a second back-up system if the first fails. It’s very unusual to see both Plan A (the back-up) and Plan B (the back-up to the back-up) not working.

Usually, a main back-up (Plan A) will supply about 90% of the power the facility usually receives. Whereas Plan B will usually only supply a fraction of the power – maybe 50% or 30%. The reason is that Plan B is usually expensive to maintain all the time. It may be outsourced to a third party – either the power company or a software company which manages their power distribution network.

Critical infrastructure arguably needs more security

Paul Cuffe, assistant professor, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin

An airport like Heathrow requires a lot of electricity to operate, equivalent to a large town. As such, it would be typical for it to be given a dedicated connection from the substation at Hayes.

There is likely a dedicated power line and transformer there that connects the airport to the wider grid. When a major fire severs that link, it will no longer be possible to bring bulk electricity to the airport.

I would anticipate that a major airport like Heathrow would have some on-site emergency capability to ride through a grid disturbance. I would hope the traffic control tower and runway lights weren’t totally plunged into darkness!

However, processing planeloads of passengers requires Heathrow in its totality to consume a town’s worth of electricity, and the inability to meet this requirement is probably why the flights had to be cancelled.

The failure is not overtly abnormal. We can anticipate that, from time to time, substation equipment will fail and downstream power outages will result. But one could argue that a critical piece of national infrastructure like Heathrow deserves special grid connection arrangements to secure its supply of electricity further. For instance, sometimes critical loads like this are fed from two separate substations to provide redundancy when outages happen.

It is ultimately a political and economic question to determine the right level of capital investment into grid infrastructure to avoid the problems that outages like this cause. Redundant power supplies for an airport the size of Heathrow do not come free.

Climate change means the grid will face more threats like this

Hayley J. Fowler, professor of climate change impacts; Colin Manning, postdoctoral research associate in climate science; and Sean Wilkinson, professor of structural engineering, Newcastle University

The closure of one of the world’s largest airports due to a failure of just one electricity substation underlines how important it is that critical national energy infrastructure – pylons, substations and so on – keeps functioning. This is only becoming more important as demand for electricity increases, thanks to transport and domestic heating switching to lower-carbon electrified alternatives – notably electric cars and heat pumps.

Yet the UK’s energy system is facing growing threats from unprecedented risks. We still don’t know what caused the Heathrow fire, but it appears to be unusual in this regard, as threats to energy systems come mainly from extreme weather. In the UK, that tends to mean windstorms, flooding, heatwaves and associated wildfires, and cold spells.

2024 was the warmest calendar year on record, and the “fingerprints” of climate change are increasingly evident in more intense and frequent extreme weather events. It is crucial to ensure the energy network can handle this weather.

Gas and electricity operators in the UK have established protocols for managing networks in adverse weather, investing large amounts to protect critical assets. But recent events have exposed vulnerabilities. The storms Arwen and Éowyn left thousands without power for days, underscoring the previous UK government’s admission that the country is underprepared for extreme weather events.

                <p>The UK government is calling it the “biggest shakeup to the welfare system in a generation” – prompted by what the prime minister described as the “devastating” cost of sickness and disability benefits. Planned reforms to cut those costs are designed to save £5 billion a year by 2030, from a welfare budget that will reach £70 billion on current projections.

Similar warnings about unsustainable welfare payments can be heard in other countries struggling with the rising costs of social security, state pensions and subsidised healthcare.

Germany’s new chancellor thinks his country’s welfare system is wasteful and discourages full-time work. France, meanwhile, has been preparing for social security to absorb half the spending cuts it says it needs in 2025.

All of these social security funds collect contributions from the people enrolled in them, and pay out to those who retire or cannot work. Technically, some of them can reach a point of bankruptcy, when payouts become unaffordable – unless governments reduce entitlements or raise taxes.

In some cases, their solvency can be calculated using projections of future claims, employment levels and demographic trends. On present predictions, for example, the US social security fund will “go broke” between 2033 and 2035. The Trump administration, while denying it will cut benefits, is promising to trim the bill with a clampdown on “fraud and waste”.

The UK is slightly different because it does not put social security into a separate fund – so its sustainability depends on the overall state of public finance. But the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projects an unsustainable acceleration of public debt growth from the late 2030s as the costs of welfare, public services and debt interest lift public spending towards 60% of GDP.

As welfare accounts for almost a third of public spending in 2024-5, it is inevitably a target when savings are needed. Put simply, if more working-age people take jobs and stay in them for longer, there will be extra funds available for those who genuinely cannot work or need additional income.

So, underlying the government’s stated motive of providing opportunities for people with sickness or disabilities is the Treasury’s agenda – of boosting economic growth while borrowing and spending less.

After all, current fiscal rules and growth prospects left the government little room for additional spending after last autumn’s budget. And now it wants to raise defence spending to 2.6% of GDP by 2027, so that £5 billion saving would certainly be useful.

The productivity problem

The projected savings come at a social cost, however. There is evidence, for example, of a genuine worsening of young people’s (especially mental) health, which could be further damaged by a forced move into inappropriate employment.

And personal independence payment (Pip) applications (which the government says have “skyrocketed” among the young) are already designed to help claimants find work. The proportion who do so has stayed steady at around one in six.

A rapid rise in benefit claims from younger people is one motivation for the reform plans. But they are likely to boost Pip claims by making it the basis of universal credit eligibility.

And although ministers argue that an unusually high proportion of working-age people in Britain are not in employment, the participation rate of 16- to 64-year-olds (74.9%) is the same as it was in 2017, and comparable to other industrial countries.

Past efforts to move more people into work by restricting benefits have often hurt those who lose them, without expanding the available workforce in areas that employers most need.

It’s true that present arrangements leave some claimants in a “poverty trap”, where they are effectively penalised for getting a job or promotion, because the loss of means-tested benefits exceeds any gain in income.

The Department for Work and Pensions proposes tackling this with the right to try a job before eligibility is re-assessed. But Pip, designed to cover the extra costs of disability or chronic ill-health, is one of the few non-means-tested benefits that helps avoid these traps.

The argument that working-age participation must rise to support the growing number of retired people reflects the long-running inability of UK governments to get UK labour productivity growing again. OBR projections assume that hourly productivity growth will average 1.1% from 2025 to 2029, but it was zero in 2023-24. And there is no sign of any pick-up in the vital investment or innovation that might actually deliver this.

Output per UK worker has dropped since 2022, falling back to 2019 levels. And UK productivity growth since 2010 has been significantly slower than in the US, Germany or France.

The UK government is looking keenly at new technology, especially AI, to streamline its own service delivery so as to reduce public sector costs. But current fiscal problems stem from the slow growth of private sector productivity. Compelling more people to work – especially when in fragile health – could erode this even further.</p></b>

                <p>Aardvark Weather generates forecasts more quickly and with less computing power than existing forecasting systems.

A new artificial intelligence (AI)-driven weather prediction system could transform forecasting, researchers predict

The system, dubbed Aardvark Weather, generates forecasts tens of times faster than traditional forecasting systems using a fraction of the computing power, researchers reported Thursday (March 20) in the journal Nature .

"The weather forecasting systems we all rely on have been developed over decades, but in just 18 months, we've been able to build something that's competitive with the best of these systems, using just a tenth of the data on a desktop computer," Richard Turner , an engineer at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, said in a statement .

Current weather forecasts are generated by inputting data into complex physics models, a multi-stage process that requires several hours on a dedicated supercomputer .

Aardvark Weather circumvents this demanding process: the machine learning model uses raw data from satellites, weather stations, ships and weather balloons to make its predictions without relying on atmospheric models. Satellite data are particularly important for the model's predictions, the team noted.

This new approach could offer major advantages in terms of cost, speed and accuracy of weather forecasts, the researchers claimed. Instead of requiring a supercomputer and a dedicated team, Aardvark Weather can generate a forecast on a desktop computer in just a few minutes.

Replacing the weather prediction pipeline with AI

The team compared Aardvark's performance to existing forecasting systems that generate global predictions. Using just 8% of the observational data that traditional forecasting systems need, Aardvark outperformed the U.S. national Global Forecast System (GFS)system and was comparable to forecasts made by the United States Weather Service.

However, Aardvark's spatial resolution is somewhat lower than those of current forecasting systems, which could make its initial predictions less relevant for hyper-local weather forecasting. Aardvark Weather operates at 1.5-degree resolution, meaning each box in its grid covers 1.5 degrees of latitude and 1.5 degrees of longitude. For comparison, the GFS uses a 0.25-degree grid.

However, the researchers also said that because the AI learns from the data it is fed, it could be tailored to predict weather in specific arenas — such as temperatures for African agriculture or wind speeds for renewable energy in Europe. Aardvark can incorporate higher-resolution regional data, where they exist, to refine local forecasts.

"These results are just the beginning of what Aardvark can achieve," study coauthor Anna Allen , of the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. "This end-to-end learning approach can be easily applied to other weather forecasting problems, for example hurricanes, wildfires, and tornadoes. Beyond weather, its applications extend to broader Earth system forecasting, including air quality, ocean dynamics, and sea ice prediction."

Aardvark could also support forecasting centers in areas of the world that lack the resources to refine global forecasts into high-resolution regional predictions, the researchers said.</p></b>

                <p>London’s Heathrow Airport has been forced to close temporarily after a fire in a nearby electricity substation. More than 1,300 flights have been suspended and thousands of passengers left stranded.

Substations take high-voltage electricity from pylons and transform it into the lower voltages you use at home. This happens in a transformer filled with oil to insulate the electricity. In this case, it appears that more than 20,000 litres of this oil caught fire.

The closure of one of the world’s largest airports due to a failure of just one electricity substation underlines how important it is that critical national energy infrastructure – pylons, substations and so on – keeps functioning. This is only becoming more important as demand for electricity increases, thanks to transport and domestic heating switching to lower-carbon electrified alternatives – notably electric cars and heat pumps.

Yet the UK’s energy system is facing growing threats from unprecedented risks. We still don’t know what caused the Heathrow fire, but it appears to be unusual in this regard, as threats to energy systems come mainly from extreme weather. In the UK, that tends to mean windstorms, flooding, heatwaves and associated wildfires, and cold spells.

2024 was the warmest calendar year on record, and the “fingerprints” of climate change are increasingly evident in more intense and frequent extreme weather events. It is crucial to ensure the energy network can handle this weather.

Gas and electricity operators in the UK have established protocols for managing networks in adverse weather, investing large amounts to protect critical assets. But recent events have exposed vulnerabilities. The storms Arwen and Éowyn left thousands without power for days, underscoring the previous UK government’s admission that the country is underprepared for extreme weather events.

Major hazards to UK energy infrastructure

As part of a UK government research programme on climate vulnerability, we identified four major climate hazards that affect the UK’s energy infrastructure. We then used high-resolution climate simulations to assess how these hazards would change in a worst-case scenario, where the world keeps emitting greenhouse gases as usual.

Windstorms: These are projected to increase in severity, especially in northern and western regions of the UK, posing risks to overhead power lines.

Hot spells: Extreme heat of 35°C or more, once rare, could happen every other year by the 2060s. This will strain electricity networks as buildings and pipes need to be cooled, while efficiency will be reduced and transformers may be damaged.

Cold spells: The most extreme cold weather will happen less often as the world warms. But the climate will become more variable, causing more sudden temperature shifts which may challenge energy distribution and demand management.

Flooding: Higher-intensity rainfall, particularly in winter, will increase the risk of flooded substations and gas pressure reduction stations. The former has led to large power outages.

This worst-case emissions scenario probably won’t happen, as the world is currently on a better trajectory. Nonetheless our results, alongside observed consequences of past events, underscore the need to safeguard the UK’s energy system against increasing climate threats.

Making the UK energy system more resilient

We propose several strategies to make UK energy infrastructure more resilient. Importantly, energy operators, policymakers and regulators should adopt a system-wide approach, as failures in one area can cascade across the entire network and affect other critical infrastructure. The Heathrow closure perfectly illustrates this.

Our report promotes adaptation measures that are currently available and will be beneficial regardless of future climate changes.

For instance, we could strengthen and protect vulnerable network assets like substations and power lines to better withstand extreme weather. This might involve building flood defences around substations or raising them off the ground, undergrounding critical overhead lines, and protecting infrastructure vulnerable to falling trees blown over during windstorms.

We could use smart sensors and predictive analytics to monitor things like power lines and detect failures early. We could minimise disruptions during extreme weather by getting better at forecasting, and by improving rapid response capabilities. And we could further encourage off-peak energy use, to ease grid stress during extreme weather.

To build a resilient UK energy network, we need better tools to quantify and simulate climate risks, ensuring decision-making is based on robust scientific evidence.

We also urgently need new resilience metrics and standards. While guidelines such as ETR 138 exist for flood resilience, there is a lack of equivalent standards for other climate hazards such as windstorms or extreme heat. These standards help identify critical assets and parts of the network most in need of further protection.

The UK’s transition to net zero emissions should consider climate resilience as a priority. Investments in renewable energy infrastructure, battery storage and smart grids should incorporate resilience assessments from the outset.

We should also consider providing generators or other ways to produce energy at highly vulnerable locations where it is of critical need, including hospitals and airports such as Heathrow.

Finally, the energy sector needs to work closely with other critical infrastructure operators – such as transport, water and telecommunications – to mitigate cascading risks and ensure a coordinated response to extreme weather events. We’re part of a project that has begun to do this for transport. But resilience strategies should be extended to consider risks from climate, cyber-attacks, asset failures and extreme energy demand.

While the fire and power cut at Heathrow was not related to extreme weather, it highlights the consequences of such failures. By acting now, we can safeguard the UK’s energy networks against unprecedented extreme weather and ensure a secure, reliable and sustainable energy system for generations to come.</p></b>

                <p>Scientists have developed new blood tests that can detect early chemical signatures of cancer. For diseases like pancreatic cancer, that could lead to earlier diagnosis and a better prognosis.

Around four years ago, now 77-year-old John Gormly went for what was supposed to be a routine blood test. But the results were life-changing.

The test suggested Gormly had colon cancer, which a colonoscopy later confirmed was Stage 2, meaning the cancer had spread through the wall of the colon but not to his lymph nodes.

"I thought [my doctor] was wrong," Gormly, CEO of a construction company near Newport Beach, California, told Live Science. "I go, 'Nah, I don't feel anything.' But there it was. It was real; the colonoscopy showed it."

Gormly was one of the first patients to take a newly approved test called Shield, which its makers say can detect colon cancer from a blood sample. After his diagnosis, Gormly had surgery to remove the tumor and was back to work within 10 days.

Science Spotlight takes a deeper look at emerging science and gives you, our readers, the perspective you need on these advances. Our stories highlight trends in different fields, how new research is changing old ideas, and how the picture of the world we live in is being transformed thanks to science.

An early version of Guardant Health's Shield test has been commercially available since 2022, but it wasn't covered by insurance. However, after approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2024 , a diagnostic version of Shield was launched commercially and is now covered by Medicare.

Shield is only a blood drop in an ocean of emerging "liquid biopsies."

Scientists have developed blood tests for several cancers, including those of the breast , pancreas and stomach . Some blood tests even detect multiple types of cancer. If these liquid biopsies can be rolled out widely, they could help detect cancer earlier, more easily, or with fewer invasive measures — which, in turn, could lead to earlier detection and fewer cancer deaths.

But many of these tests are still in their early stages. They often detect a lower fraction of cancer cases than gold-standard screening tools like colonoscopies do, meaning they will likely supplement, rather than replace, traditional screening methods. Others may have unacceptable rates of "false positives," meaning a person is initially told they have cancer but diagnostic follow-ups show they do not. This can lead to needless worry or additional invasive tests. These include traditional biopsies, which involve removing tissue samples via needles or surgery. And for some diseases, it's not clear that early diagnosis on a blood test will lead to better outcomes.

However, as these kinks are ironed out, it's likely that blood-based cancer screening will become a normal part of our medical care — one that has the potential to improve cancer outcomes dramatically, experts say.

Simplifying screening

Gormly's doctor recommended a Shield test after noticing that Gormly hadn't had a colonoscopy in a while. He's not alone. Current recommendations suggest that people ages 45 to 75 who are at average risk of colon cancer get a screening, such as a colonoscopy or a stool-based test, every five to 10 years. Yet around 1 in 3 of these people have never been screened.

That's a problem, because colon cancer is the fourth-most-common cancer . Experts have argued that early detection could eliminate 90% of colon cancer deaths . It typically takes around 10 years for early, precancerous growths like polyps to morph into deadly cancer cells, and if these cells are caught early, they can easily be removed.

Despite the potential for early diagnosis and cure, many people avoid these screenings. This may be one reason colon cancer is the second-most-common cause of cancer death .

People avoid screenings for many reasons, said Dr. William Grady , a professor of translational science and therapeutics at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle who helped lead the Shield trials. Some people feel embarrassed during screenings such as colonoscopy or fear that it may be painful, he told Live Science. Those opting for colonoscopy may struggle to get time off work, whereas others may dislike the idea of handling stool for a stool-based test, he said.

"That's why there's an opportunity for blood tests that is really powerful because people are inclined to do blood tests; they're convenient and can be done during a health care encounter," Grady said.

Shield works by detecting small DNA fragments that are released into the blood from colon cancer cells or precancerous cells called adenomas , a type of polyp. The test also picks up on subtle differences between cancerous cells and normal cells in chemical tags on DNA known as methyl groups.

In a paper published in March 2024 in The New England Journal of Medicine , Grady's team showed that Shield detected 83% of colonoscopy-confirmed colon cancer cases in a cohort of almost 10,000 people. It also had a false positive rate of 10%.

Because Shield detects a smaller percentage of colon cancer cases than stool-based tests (92%) or colonoscopies (95%) do, it won't replace those diagnostic tests, Grady said. However, it could expand the number of screening options available to patients, he added. This additional option may improve screening compliance, which could lead to earlier disease detection and thus a reduction in colon cancer deaths.

The Shield test is approved for use every three years, Grady said. However, current studies are investigating whether it would be more accurate if it were done every year or two, he added.

If Gormly's cancer had spread to the rest of his body, it would have been much harder to treat. People whose colon cancer is caught at Stage 2, like Gormly, have an 85% chance of living at least another five years . By Stage 4, when it has spread throughout the body, those odds go down to just 10%.

"That could have been the end of me, so it [Shield] definitely changed my life," Gormly said.

Accelerating diagnosis

Pancreatic cancer is another disease that could benefit from a blood-based diagnostic test. Unlike colon cancer, pancreatic cancer is relatively uncommon, affecting 1 in 56 men and 1 in 60 women . Yet pancreatic cancer is the third-most-common cause of cancer death in the U.S.

That's because, by the time most people notice symptoms, such as abdominal pain or discomfort, the disease is already very advanced , said Ajay Goel , a professor and chair of the Department of Molecular Diagnostics and Experimental Therapeutics at the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope in Duarte, California.

There is no broad-based screening program in the U.S. for people at average risk of pancreatic cancer. Later stages of the disease are easily detectable via MRI or CT scan , Goel told Live Science. But by that point, the five-year survival rate is extremely low : around 3% once the cancer has spread throughout the body, compared with 44% if it is still limited to the pancreas. Once cancer has spread beyond the pancreas, surgical removal is usually no longer possible, and treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are minimally effective .

A potential solution is a new blood test developed by Goel's team. It aims to detect early-stage pancreatic cancer by identifying small cancer-specific molecules called microRNAs. These molecules regulate whether genes are switched on or off and are found in the blood of patients with early-stage disease, as well as inside exosomes , which are tiny packages that cancer cells release into the blood.

In a study of nearly 1,000 people, the test (which is still unnamed) detected between 88% and 93% of early- and late-stage pancreatic cancer cases, using blood drawn from people in the U.S., South Korea and China. When the test was modified to also measure the amount of a protein known as CA-19 in the blood, it picked up 97% of early-stage cases in the U.S. group. CA-19 is a known biomarker of pancreatic cancer, but on its own, it is not reliable enough to be used for diagnosis. When combined with CA-19 detection, the new test had a 5% to 10% false positive rate, Goel said.

The findings, which haven't been peer-reviewed yet, were presented at the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in San Diego.

"If you can find more and more of these cancers early on, there is a hope that many of these patients can be cured," Goel said.

The team envisages the test being taken yearly — for instance, when patients see their doctor for an annual physical exam. However, in those who have a family history of pancreatic cancer, it may make sense to test more frequently — perhaps every six months, Goel said.

Multicancer detection

Scientists are also developing multicancer detection (MCD) tests that screen for many types of cancer at once. MCD tests differ slightly in the types of cancer they detect and how they do it . But like many of the single-cancer detection tests, MCD tests look for cancer-specific molecules, such as tumor DNA, but on a larger scale. Some MCD tests sample urine or another bodily fluid in addition to blood.

In theory, such tests could not only provide a less-invasive approach to screening but also reduce the number of tests a person has to take at once. However, most of these tests are still in early development . The ones that are farther along, such as Grail's Galleri and Exact Sciences' Cancerguard , have not received FDA approval yet. And some experts have argued that the tests' efficacy claims are overhyped .

Even if MCD tests do work and they become more affordable (Galleri, for example, currently costs around $950), experts still aren't sure of the best way to use them. "There's this belief that if we could only detect all cancers early, we would solve the cancer problem," Ruth Etzioni , a professor at Fred Hutchinson who was not involved in Grady's work with Shield, told Live Science. But sometimes there is no good treatment for early cancers, so catching them ahead doesn't necessarily lead to improved outcomes.

And there's always a risk of false positives. After taking an MCD test, patients may wait up to six months to know one way or the other, Dr. Jennifer Croswell , a medical officer at the National Cancer Institute, told Live Science. There may be many reasons for this delay, including that it takes time to perform multiple rounds of follow-up testing to figure out which organ is affected, she said. There are also currently no evidence-based clinical guidelines that tell doctors the best way to follow up on positive results from MCD tests, Croswell said. Consequently, these tests may create uncertainty for patients.

The way forward

While many diagnostic blood tests for cancer are still in the pipeline, at least some of these tests will likely affect diagnosis and treatment in the next several years. For instance, Goel and colleagues are now running a clinical trial to see if their test can detect early-stage pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals who have not yet been diagnosed. If it's successful, they intend to test it in the general population.

"I think if things go well, we foresee that probably in the next two to four years, this test should be on the marketplace to be used for early detection of pancreatic cancer worldwide," Goel said.

Meanwhile, Grady's team is planning to investigate whether Shield helps get more people screened for colon cancer who are often missed, such as underrepresented minority groups or those who live in areas with restricted health care access.

Shield is "the first of, I think, a whole series of tests that we're going to be seeing coming up for screening for not only colon cancer but also for breast cancer, lung cancer , liver cancer ," Grady said.

Four years later, tests show Gormly is cancer-free. He hopes his experiences help others who may be tempted to skip colon cancer screening.

"I hope that as a result of this [speaking up]," he said, "someone else tries it and has the same success I did."</p></b>

                <p>Hundreds of measles infections have been reported in the U.S. so far this year. Are you protected against the illness? And how can you check?

Hundreds of people have caught measles in the United States this year, with the majority of the cases tied to outbreaks of the disease. So far, Texas has been the hardest hit, with the highest number of reported illnesses.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , 301 people in the U.S. have had confirmed measles infections this year, as of March 13. Additional, probable cases have been reported by various states, but they've yet to be independently confirmed by the CDC.

Kids under 5 years old account for 34% of the confirmed measles cases, with a further 42% affecting children and teens ages 5 to 19. In total, 17% of the cases have resulted in hospitalization.

There has been one confirmed death related to the outbreaks, and a second remains under investigation. The first fatal case was in an unvaccinated school-age child in Texas, marking the first death from measles in the U.S. since 2015 . The second deadly case was reported in a New Mexico resident by local health authorities, but the CDC has yet to conclude its own investigation of the case, which would help confirm its connection to ongoing outbreaks.

The vast majority of the confirmed measles infections — 95% — have been in people who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most of the infections have been reported in Texas, with data from the Texas Department of State Health Services showing that 279 measles cases were identified between late January and March 18.

Experts say the Texas outbreak is likely related to low rates of vaccination in the state. For instance, data suggest that around 18% of school-age children in Gaines County have been exempted from at least one vaccine, and 191 measles cases have occurred in that county so far. Meanwhile, Gaines' neighboring counties of Dawson, Yoakum, Terry and Martin have reported 11, 11, 36 and 3 cases, respectively.

As measles continues to spread, here's what to know about the protection of the measles vaccine, how long it lasts, and how to know if you're immune to the disease.

How effective is the measles vaccine?

Measles can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella; or the MMRV vaccine, which additionally protects against the chickenpox-causing varicella virus. The CDC recommends that children receive their first dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine between the ages of 12 and 15 months and their second dose between 4 and 6 years old.

(For measles protection, the MMR vaccine is generally recommended over the MMRV vaccine, because it's less likely to trigger fevers in children . For those who get the MMR shot, a separate vaccine is recommended to protect against chickenpox (varicella).)

Unvaccinated older children and adults are also advised to receive two doses of a measles vaccine, at least 28 days apart.

One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are 97% effective, according to the CDC . The MMRV vaccine offers the same level of measles protection.

"It's probably one of the best vaccines that we have," Michael Head , a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton in the U.K., told Live Science in an email.

"For example, the COVID-19 vaccines are very good at reducing mortality, but less good at preventing a mild COVID-19 infection," Head said. The measles vaccine is highly protective against measles infections of all severity levels.

Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 thanks to widespread vaccination against the disease. The CDC defines "elimination" as the "absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area." Measles is not yet "eradicated" worldwide, meaning it still spreads regularly in other countries and can be imported to the U.S.

How long does the MMR vaccine's protection last?

The MMR vaccine provides long-lasting measles protection for most people, with immunity typically being lifelong after two doses, according to the CDC . However, one 2024 study published in the journal The Lancet Public Health reported that measles immunity does fade slightly over time.

"Like with COVID vaccines, antibody levels do reduce over time," Dr. Peter Chin-Hong , a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science via email. Antibodies are protective immune proteins that appear in the days and weeks after a person receives a vaccine, but these proteins are expected to disappear over time.

"However there is likely continued immunity with memory immune cells that can be activated as needed (as we have seen in COVID vaccines)," Chin-Hong added. When exposed to the measles vaccine, the body generates "memory" cells in the immune system, which can quickly mount an immune response and make new antibodies if a person encounters the measles virus.

"In general, protection once immunized against measles, wanes very little," Chin-Hong said. The Lancet study suggested that, on average, measles immunity waned by about 0.039% per year after the age of 5.

Does catching measles give you lifelong immunity?

Yes, if a person survives a bout of measles infection, they typically have lifelong immunity against the virus. However, even as the immune system mounts a powerful response against measles, its guard against other infections gets lowered.

Many studies find that measles infections induce a kind of "immune amnesia," in which memory cells tasked with remembering pathogens are lost and the body is unable to rev up its antibody responses, as it used to. This leaves a person at increased risk of other infections for years following their brush with measles.

Other complications of measles infection include a rare but deadly central nervous system condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) , which can develop seven to 10 years after the infection. Some people can also experience brain swelling (encephalitis) during a measles infection , which can cause convulsions, permanent hearing loss and intellectual disability.

The measles vaccine provides lifelong immunity against the virus without these dangerous complications associated with measles infection.

Is there a way to check if you're immune to measles?

If you've received two doses of the MMR vaccine, you're considered immune for life in most cases. Additionally, if you've had a confirmed case of measles in the past, you're likely immune for life.

If someone is still unsure whether they've either been vaccinated or had the disease, there's a test that checks for measles-specific antibodies in your blood. The type of measles antibody it screens for belongs to a broad class called immunoglobulin G (IgG), which protects the body from infection by binding to pathogens.

If enough measles-specific IgG antibodies are present, compared to a standard threshold, a person has immunity.

"You can check an antibody level with the help of a health care provider," Chin-Hong said. The test will give you a number back that's called a "titer"; this is a measure of your antibody levels. However, the test will not pick up memory cells, Chin-Hong said, so it could miss that additional layer of evidence that you're immune to measles.

Should anyone get a booster for measles, if they've been fully vaccinated in the past?

If a person is unsure about how protected they are against measles, they can get a booster shot of the vaccine to bolster their immunity.

"It is perfectly safe to have another dose," Head said. "The recommendation to get an extra dose will typically come from public health teams, and it's always best to see the advice of a healthcare worker if anyone is unsure."

If someone has had two doses of the measles vaccine in their lifetime, there is likely no need for a booster shot. The exception is a group of people who received the measles vaccine in the 1960s, who would need an additional MMR vaccine to ensure their protection.

That's because the measles vaccine used in the U.S. between 1963 and 1967 was less effective than modern measles vaccines. Unlike the current shots, which contain live-but-weakened viruses, the old shot contained an inactivated virus, so it was completely "killed." In response to the old vaccine, the immune system did not develop long-lasting memory cells , unlike the vaccines used today. Many people who received the old vaccine lost their immunity within a few years, leaving them vulnerable to measles later in life.

In addition to people who received only this old vaccine, anyone who has gotten only one dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine is recommended to get the recommended second dose.

The CDC started recommending two doses of the MMR shot in 1989 , Chin-Hong noted, so those vaccinated before that time may need a second dose.

Individuals traveling to areas experiencing measles outbreaks, including within the U.S., can also consider getting another dose even if they're fully vaccinated, Chin-Hong said.

Additionally, health care workers, immunocompromised people and those who live with them, and college students should check their vaccination records to confirm they've received two MMR doses, and perhaps get an immunity test if they are unsure, Chin-Hong suggested. Individuals can speak with their health care provider about getting a booster shot, if they're interested in receiving one.

Can vaccinated people still catch measles sometimes?

Fully vaccinated people may still catch measles, but only in rare circumstances.

About 3% of fully vaccinated people may still develop measles symptoms after an exposure to the virus, according to the CDC. However, people who have been fully vaccinated tend to experience milder symptoms than unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, and they are also less likely to spread the virus to others.

These "breakthrough" cases become more likely in the context of large outbreaks or high-exposure settings — when an individual has prolonged, close contact with an infected person. About 5% of total measles cases in the U.S. are breakthrough cases, according to the CDC .

Additionally, people with weakened immune systems — due to medical conditions or medications — might not maintain full protection, even if they're fully vaccinated. So they can be more prone to breakthrough cases.

In the current Texas outbreak, there were a "handful" of people who contracted measles after having only one shot," Chin-Hong noted. In a study that looked at measles cases in California between 2000 and 2015, most of those infected were unvaccinated, but 11% of the total cases were among people who had gotten two doses of measles vaccine. The fully vaccinated group did have milder disease, however.

How high do vaccination rates in a community need to be to reach "herd immunity"?

Herd immunity refers to when a high percentage of a population is immune to a disease, making it difficult for the infection to spread. Reaching this collective level of immunity protects even those who can't be vaccinated , such as newborn babies, pregnant people or immunocompromised people.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, and because of that, at least 95% of a given population needs to be immune to prevent major outbreaks.

"Measles is so infectious, with very high levels of transmission. Typically, we refer to 95% coverage as the magic number of that 'herd immunity threshold,'" Head told Live Science. "At this level of coverage, there may still be individual case[s], but the majority of the population is protected, and the outbreaks will remain small and very localised."

MMR coverage among U.S. kindergartners has declined in recent years, according to the CDC. In the 2019-2020 school year, 95.2% of kindergartners had received two doses of the MMR vaccine, but in the 2023-2024 school year, that coverage dropped to 92.7%. That marked the "fourth consecutive year" that national coverage had been below the targeted 95%.

Several states — including Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia and Florida — had less than 90% coverage during the 2023-2024 school year.</p></b>

                <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 paved the way for the democratisation of many eastern European countries and triumphantly ushered in the era of global liberal democracy that some scholars celebrated as “the end of history”. The idea was that human political history followed a steady path and that western liberal democracy was the end point of the evolution of human government. Unfortunately, events unfolded a little differently.

The last 20 years did not follow a linear arc of progress, let alone marked the end of history. The growing electoral success of extreme rightwing parties in many western countries, from France to Finland and from the Netherlands to Germany, has turned the end of history into the possible end of democracy.

What is prompting so many Europeans to turn away from a political system that has successfully rebuilt the continent after the second world war and transformed it into the world’s most prosperous single market?

The reasons are manifold, ranging from economic crises and rising inequality to the negative impact of social media on political behaviour and breaches of democratic norms by elites. But there is another driver that is rarely discussed: the power of personal experience.

Over the past two decades, behavioural scientists have extensively explored how our actions are driven by our experiences. The pain, pleasure, rewards, losses, information and knowledge that arise from living through events help us evaluate our past actions and inform future ones.

A positive experience that is associated with a particular option increases the likelihood of that option being chosen again; a negative experience has the opposite effect. Mapping people’s experiences – especially in response to life’s risks – can illuminate otherwise perplexing risky behaviour such as people building homes on flood plains, in regions with high seismic risk or at the foot of an active volcano.

The last violent eruption of Vesuvius, Europe’s “ticking time bomb”, occurred 81 years ago. Vesuvius is considered one of the highest-risk volcanoes in the world. Nonetheless, some 700,000 residents live in the “red zone” at its foot, apparently disregarding the dire warnings from volcanologists.

To comprehend this complacency in the face of possible Armageddon, one must analyse individual and collective experience with the risk in question. Most residents in the red zone have never personally experienced Mount Vesuvius erupting. Their personal experience, day in and day out, probably reassures them with a sense of “all clear”.

Numerous psychological experiments have confirmed how this everyday behaviour can emerge. Our experience tends to underweight and underestimate the likelihood and impact of rare events for the very reason that they are rare.

Extremely rare and catastrophic events, especially in the financial market, have been called black swan events. Neglecting their possibility has contributed to insufficient banking regulation and catastrophic financial meltdowns such as the global financial crisis in 2008.

People in western Europe have experienced democracy and growing prosperity for more than 70 years. They have been spared, up to now, the experience of autocratic takeovers and therefore may underestimate the risk of democratic collapse.

Paradoxically, the very success of democratic systems may thus also sow the seeds of their potential undoing. This is a phenomenon akin to the paradox of disease prevention, where the success of preventive measures such as childhood vaccinations may undermine their perceived need, thus increasing complacency and vaccine hesitancy.

A further ominous connection exists between the erosion of a democratic system and the experiences of its citizens. As history has shown, democracies do not suddenly go up in flames. Democracies tend to die slowly, one stab at a time, until a tipping point is reached.

The public is unlikely to perceive a risk to democracy when a political leader breaks with a convention. But when repeated breaches of democratic norms by political elites are tolerated, when rhetorical transgressions escalate, and when a deluge of lies and manipulative claims becomes “normal”, then the public’s failure to punish the early signs of such behaviour at the ballot box may have drastic consequences.

In the same way that a nuclear power plant may appear to be operating safely until the last safety valve is broken, democracies can appear stable right up until they flip into autocracy.

One way to counter these problems may be to simulate experience of the risks, even if only through proxies. For instance, disaster training centres in Japan simulate the experience of the visceral dimensions of an earthquake and its swift temporal dynamic in a way that even the most graphic warnings cannot.

We argue that we can, equally, simulate how life feels in an authoritarian regime. Europe is home to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have lived in autocracies and who can be invited to classrooms to share their personal experiences.

Vicarious detailed experiences can be highly persuasive. Similarly, people can gain insight into what it meant to be a political prisoner by visiting places like the former Stasi prison Hohenschönhausen in Berlin, especially when the guide is a former inmate. There are numerous other ways to emulate the experience of oppression and authoritarianism, thereby informing those who have been fortunate enough never to endure it.

The seemingly persistent non-occurrences of risky events can be seductive and misleading. But we are not enslaved by what we haven’t yet experienced. We can also use the positive power of experience to protect and appreciate our democratic systems.</p></b>

                <p>Yellowstone bison were nearly driven to extinction in the late 19th century as a result of commercial hunting.

Bison in Yellowstone National Park spent over 100 years as two genetically distinct herds. But now they're roaming as one interbreeding population, a new study suggests.

Herds of wild bison (Bison bison) have meandered through Yellowstone's vibrant landscape since prehistoric times. Grazing freely in the expansive grasslands of the park, these are the last free-range bison in the United States.

Although these animals are now abundant in the national park, poaching pushed the local population near extinction by the turn of the 20th century. Park managers tried several methods to help conserve Yellowstone’s bison, halting poaching and even introducing a new herd to the region.

Thanks to conservation efforts, both the native herd and the introduced herd, which consisted of adults from Montana and Texas and calves from Yellowstone’s native herd, were able to thrive. Later genetic analyses showed that descendants of this introduced group remained genetically distinct from the native bison — until now.

In the past 20 years, Yellowstone's two bison subpopulations have become one large interbreeding herd, according to the new genetic study, published Sept. 13, 2024 in the Journal of Heredity .

"I think the kinds of questions that we ask about this population at Yellowstone can only be answered using genetic technology," study senior author Jim Derr , a professor at Texas A&M's College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, told Live Science. "No observational information is going to help you because you don't know who's breeding with who."

To reveal the breeding dynamics of the droves of bison in Yellowstone, workers at the National Park Service (NPS) collected tissue samples biopsied from 282 individuals for analysis.

Closely analyzing the bison's genetic markers gave the researchers clues into their lineage and how the population has changed over time.

Comparing the genetic markers they found in Yellowstone's current bison population to those from samples taken in the early 2000s, the researchers concluded that the two groups roaming the land interbred frequently enough that they are no longer genetically distinct.

The exact cause of the change isn't clear, but the researchers say it was likely a gradual shift in behavior over the past 20 or more years. "Part of it is just the bison exploring different areas and figuring their way out and running into each other," study lead author Sam Stroupe , a postdoctoral research associate at Texas A&M University, told Live Science.

The researchers hope this new analysis will help with ongoing efforts to conserve and manage the herd at Yellowstone.

Staff at the national park have been managing the bison population as two groups since individuals were first brought in from out-of-state in 1907. Having only one herd to look after could make conservation and management of the species easier, the researchers said.

"I think everyone wants bison in Yellowstone National Park to be managed appropriately and to have good stewardship of that herd," Derr said. "Hopefully we can give them a little bit of insight with this genetic information."</p></b>

                <p>Constructed with precision optical lenses, high-quality materials, a variety of illumination choices and a trinocular eyepiece tube, Celestron Labs has created a promising instrument for advanced biological microscopy with its CB2000C model.

Why you can trust Live Science Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best ones for you. Find out more about how we test.

Celestron Labs’ CB2000C Advanced Biological Microscope is a mid-priced instrument that boasts a wealth of professional features, such as 40X to 2000X magnification, stereo imagery, trinocular eyepiece tube, XY mechanical stage and adjustable illumination, and comes with a set of prepared slides and filters.

Key specifications Head: Binocular with 45-degree incline and additional trinocular eyepiece tube

Eyepieces: Two WF 10x with pointer, two WF 20X

Objective lenses: 4X, 10X, 40X and 100X achromatic

Stage: Mechanical stage with XY navigation (140 mm x 140 mm)

Light source: Adjustable, halogen

Condenser: Abbe N.A. 1.25 with adjustable height

Focusing: Coaxial (coarse and fine)

We enjoyed reviewing the CB2000C. Its trinocular capability enabled collaborative working and pupils had the benefit of real-time advice and feedback. As an educational tool, this was hugely beneficial. The large magnification range meant it was possible to examine a wide variety of biological specimens from whole mini organisms to microorganisms and cellular organelles.

Made from sturdy, quality materials, this biological microscope by Celestron Labs is robust and durable and well suited to use in a professional, commercial or educational laboratory. Some features were complex and the microscope did need setting up. However, we would gladly recommend this model to anyone with a little experience.

Celestron Labs CB2000C Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope review

Design

Trinocular eyepiece tube allows second viewer

Multiple professional features

Robust

The CB2000C Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope by Celestron Labs has been designed with a number of aims: to be robust, to give stereo images, to allow for a secondary viewer and to give a professional feel via a number of technical features.

The solid, wide base gave a confident sturdiness to this microscope. Coupled with high-quality materials such as a metal body and glass optics, this machine felt reassuringly robust. At 5.5 kg (12lbs), it is one of the heavier student microscopes, but has a strong carry handle and is unlikely to be used by small children. The knobs and dials all fit and turn well and felt durable in use..

Secondary viewer capability has been made possible by attaching a third eyepiece tube to the head. Trinocular viewing allowed us to observe the specimens ocularly, in real time. To deal with the change in light intensity that comes with a trinocular microscope, Celestron Labs has designed a binocular to trinocular button, so that the trinocular eyepiece tube is not illuminated when not in use. Thus, optimum illumination can be achieved through the binocular eyepieces.

Additionally, as the light pathway moves independently through each binocular eyepiece, stereo images are observed.

We were impressed to find that the CB2000C by Celestron Labs has been designed with numerous features that mechanically and optically improve the quality of images possible with a mid-range microscope and help it to live up to its ‘Advanced’ title.

Firstly, having a quadruple nosepiece has enabled four objective lenses to be fitted, from 4X to 100X. Although we needed to set up the head, the lenses screwed in securely and easily. As the binocular eyepieces came in 10X and 20X, we achieved a range of magnification from 40X to 2000X, resulting in a design that could be used to view specimens from whole insects all the way down to organelles inside body cells.

Secondly, the slide clip is activated from the side and is secure and unobtrusive. The XY mechanical stage had a decent movement, 140 mm x 140 mm, and was smooth and easy to maneuver, making slide navigation a pleasure.

A third design mechanism is to have the rough and fine focusing knobs rotating about the same axis. This coaxial movement is more ergonomic as the hand can remain in the same place throughout operation.

Lastly, the CB2000C has multiple ways in which luminosity can be altered. The halogen illuminator is adjustable, so can be dimmed or made brighter where necessary. The Abbe condenser is movable and can be raised and lowered simply with the Abbe adjustment knob. For directing the light onto the slide, the iris diaphragm can be opened or closed as required.

Some viewers also experience reduced eye strain with a blue filter.

Finally, this Celestron Labs Microscope comes with three filters to enhance images. A frosted one to diffuse the light, a blue filter to color-correct the yellow light from the halogen bulb and a green one to make the images clearer.

Overall, we were impressed with the amount of advanced features that have been deployed to ensure the Celestron Labs Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope feels professional and worth its mid-range price tag.

Stereo viewing

Decent resolution

Clarity better through stereo eyepiece tubes

Having an abundance of advanced mechanical, technical and optical features and bearing the Celestron name, we anticipated a high-performing precision instrument when reviewing the CB2000C. While the high-quality glass optics, range of lenses and illumination options did deliver in terms of stereo images with high resolution and high power magnification, it was hugely frustrating that a number of quality control issues made using the microscope annoying and less pleasurable.

Setting up the binocular interpupillary distance using the binocular tube slide and the diopters was fiddly, but worth it to see the prepared slides in 3D. Some more economic stereo microscopes give three-dimensional images at the expense of magnification. The CB2000C model, by Celestron Labs, showed superb layering of spirogyra algae at low magnification. At high power, using the blue filter, we were able to identify subcellular structures such as the nucleus, chloroplasts, cytoplasmic strands and the cell wall. The blue filter helped to reduce some visual graininess seen at magnifications of 400X and above.

(Image credit: Heather Barker)

The XY mechanical stage performed flawlessly and was smooth, well functioning and a pleasure to use. The slide clip provided a secure fastening for the slide and allowed quick and easy exchange of slides.

The main downside to this particular microscope was with quality control. There seemed to be a problem with either the focusing knobs or the stage. The knobs felt smooth and moved the stage up and down to achieve focus with ease. Unfortunately, the mechanics did not hold focus and when the focusing knobs weren’t being held, the image went went fuzzy instantly and was completely out of focus within a few seconds. While investigating the problem, we noticed that the stage visibly fell downwards once free to do so. Over a minute, the stage lowered by 5 mm (0.2-inches). We managed to reduce this distance by activating the stage height restriction switch, but it was still noticeable enough to impair focusing and affect clarity.

Although we could still achieve focus and test functionality, by keeping hold of the rough focusing knob, doing so limited the amount of freedom we had to perform multiple operations. It is beneficial to have both hands free to simultaneously interchange objective lenses, navigate the slide, adjust illumination etc. It is also essential for focus to be held while two-handed tasks such as changing a slide, filter or lenses are carred out.

Functionality

Excellent for shared viewing

Easy and secure slide navigation

Adjustable illumination and filters

When considering the functionality of the Celestron Labs CB2000C Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope, we need to be mindful of the impact of simultaneously using multiple functions. We also need to address its trinocular function as a tool for teaching and its production of stereo imagery.

It is also worth mentioning that the CB2000C, by Celestron Labs, needed setting up before use: it is not supplied ready for use. It is quite usual to have to insert the eyepiece lenses, especially if they are interchangeable anyway. However, the CB2000C needed much more construction than is standard.

The head needed to be inserted into the microscope arm and needed locking into place. The four objective lenses needed to be securely screwed into the nosepiece holes, in the correct order. Additionally, the trinocular eyepiece tube needed to be screwed into the head and an eyepiece lens attached. On the plus side, detailed instructions for this set-up process were included in the user manual, in multiple languages, and were simple to follow.

As a tool for teaching, the CB2000C by Celestron Labs relies on secondary viewing via the trinocular tube. Tutors can view a pupil’s specimen while in use, without disturbing them. We found this hugely beneficial when pointing out cheek cells, subcellular structures and insect anatomy. Note that the trinocular eyepiece lens will always be a different magnification to the binocular eyepiece lenses because there are only two of each type. This will affect both the resolution and field of view observed by each viewer. At one point we did have three users, one on each eyepiece. Although this made stereo viewing impossible, it was great for collaborative work.

The advanced features all functioned well together, to enable the creation of good quality images. Navigating the slide using the XY mechanical stage increased functionality if operated while focusing at varying magnifications. Light could pinpoint the specimen using a small diaphragm aperture. Once scanning the slide, light intensity could be adjusted with the illuminator knob, or by changing the Abbe condenser height or iris diaphragm.

We found the knobs to be ergonomically placed and we were able to control the microscope by feel, rather than having to look. To minimise the risk of lens damage, Celestron Labs has added a height restriction knob. This is particularly good for preventing damage to longer, high-power lenses.

Image 1 of 1 Frustratingly, once the stage is lowered and meets the Abbe condenser they become coupled. The condenser rises with the stage and has to be detached manually via the Abbe height adjustment knob. (Image credit: Heather Barker)

One functionality issue was with the Abbe condenser. It has been designed to have an adjustable height, to help control illumination — a lovely idea, in theory. However, when focusing requires the stage to be moved downwards, it grabs onto the Abbe condenser. When the stage is raised, it then pulls the condenser up with it, rather than letting the two move independently. Perhaps this is another quality control issue, rather than being intentional. Whatever the reason, it would be better if this did not happen.

In summary, we enjoyed using this microscope for teaching, and students reported that they liked being able to view in three dimensions. We were sometimes frustrated by quality control issues but could see beyond these, to agree that the CB2000C has a lot of potential as a trinocular biological microscope with multiple advanced features. We recommend the Celestron Labs Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope for use in professional or teaching laboratories, for budding microbiologists with a little experience.

Should you buy it?

Buy it if: ✅ You want to upgrade to a mid-range microscope: The XY navigation, choice of illumination and quadruple nosepiece offer intermediate users a more professional and robust optical instrument. ✅ You would like to view your specimens in 3D: The separate images from both eyepiece tubes combine to create a three-dimensional image.

Don't buy it if: ❌ You would like to examine solid specimens: There is no top light option with the CB2000C Advanced Biological Microscope. ❌ You have impaired sight in one eye: The stereo viewing capacity depends on ocular information from both eyes.

The Celestron Labs Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope has a wealth of functions that will give an experienced user the opportunity to manipulate minute details of their optical images, and to view clear, highly magnified biological specimens. We recommend this mid-range microscope for home, school or laboratory use, for research or teaching purposes, if you desire a stereo image.

If this product isn't for you

For a trinocular microscope with a camera function, Swift does the SW380T compound trinocular with up to 2,500X magnification.

For a binocular compound microscope, the CB1000CF by Celestron Labs is ideal if you do not need stereo viewing. It comes with a lower price tag, too.

How we test

During an adult learning session, the microscope was constructed and set up. Users learned how to create and view slides of their own cheek cells, as well as leaf peels from a variety of different plants; to observe stomata distribution. Collaborative viewing and discussion was possible due to the trinocular eyepiece tube.

Later, we had free rein with the prepared slides that came with the CB2000C. We experimented with lighting options via the adjustable condenser height, changing the diaphragm dilation and investigated the image differences with the supplied filters.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>More than 305 million people require lifesaving humanitarian aid today. Most of them live in areas wracked by conflict, such as Sudan, Gaza, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

By many estimates, there is more need than ever for this assistance – and the need is growing. But humanitarian funding, which is primarily provided by governments, is declining. The Trump administration stopped disbursing nearly all U.S. humanitarian aid on Jan. 20, 2025. It made these cuts at a time when the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Belgium and other wealthy countries are slashing their own aid spending.

Judges have ruled that the U.S. government must rehire aid workers and make overdue payments for aid already delivered by nongovernmental organizations, international agencies and private contractors. While legal disputes wend through the courts, these cuts are already having disastrous consequences for people in Afghanistan, Sudan and other places facing crises.

As scholars who study humanitarian aid, we are seeing not just a crisis of funding but also one that jeopardizes the credibility of the entire global system that provides this lifesaving assistance.

When conflict breaks out or a disaster like an earthquake strikes, people require emergency medical care, temporary shelter, food and water. In countries where the government is unable or unwilling to provide these services, humanitarian organizations and international agencies step in to fill the gaps. Humanitarian aid is based on empathy and the recognition that everyone has a right to live with dignity.

When discussing the impacts of its aid freeze and challenging the Trump administration’s misinformation about the U.S. Agency for International Development, many NGOs and experts on humanitarian assistance have not focused on empathy and rights.

They have in their defense of the agency responsible until now for most of the foreign aid the U.S. provides instead relied on arguments that appeal to U.S. national security, soft power and economic interests.

Sen. Chris Coons, a Connecticut Democrat, has warned that China will benefit from the U.S. aid cutoff.

“Our biggest global competitor and adversary is delighted that we’ve handed them an opportunity to say to communities and countries around the world that we are not a reliable partner,” Coons said.

By highlighting geopolitical, security and economic arguments for humanitarian aid, in our view, they risk further hurting the sector’s legitimacy.

A ‘seismic shock’

Tom Fletcher, who leads the United Nations’ humanitarian efforts, has called the Trump administration’s aid reduction “a seismic shock to the sector.” But the latest cuts are part of a longer-term trend.

While needs have increased, humanitarian funding has been flat or declining for years, leaving millions of people who need food, health care, shelter and protection without the assistance they need.

Every year, the U.N. assesses humanitarian need for the coming year and issues what amounts to a global budget request to meet those needs. Government donors commit funds toward that budget request, and those funds are then distributed to U.N. agencies and NGOs that implement humanitarian programming.

Since 2016, the gap between funding requirements and funding commitments has grown. In 2024, the U.N. requested US$49.5 billion in humanitarian funding and received less than half, or $23.9 billion, with the U.S. contributing 41% of that amount.

Until January 2025, the U.S. accounted for 35%-46% of total annual global humanitarian funding. The abrupt cutoff of funds has led to a scramble to pay for food for malnourished children in Sudan, health care for refugees from Myanmar, and maternal health services in Yemen.

Without U.S. funding, the humanitarian work of the United Nations agencies and NGOs that deliver humanitarian aid in part funded by governments is in jeopardy.

Because of the cuts, Catholic Relief Services and the International Rescue Committee, for example, have laid off staff and shuttered health clinics that prevent or treat infectious diseases like malaria and HIV/AIDS. They can no longer provide access to clean water and sanitation services or other lifesaving aid in many places where they work.

Core principles violated

Humanitarian groups have historically embraced a set of core principles that emphasize the alleviation of human suffering wherever it may occur while remaining independent, neutral and impartial.

In conflict zones, these principles are essential for gaining access to people who need help. Aid workers build trust and acceptance by not picking sides in a conflict and providing aid based on need.

Focusing on what benefits donor countries instead of what serves humanitarian needs in areas experiencing famine, disasters or conflicts is at odds with these principles. However, in January, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that U.S. interests would decide how aid is allocated.

“Every dollar we spend, every program we fund and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions,” Rubio said. “Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?”

Since late January, the Trump administration has cut 83% of USAID’s programs, according to recent reports.

Transactional arguments

In March, the State Department sent a questionnaire to nongovernmental organizations and U.N. agencies asking how they will conform to President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy and distribute aid in alignment with foreign policy goals.

Governments always consider their own interests as one factor when making decisions about humanitarian aid. But, we are concerned that humanitarian organizations and the public are not pushing back on these purely transactional arguments.

Instead, some organizations seem to be falling in line.

“This investment pays dividends by preventing humanitarian crises, containing disease outbreaks, and countering adversarial influence in vulnerable regions,” stated InterAction, an association of U.S.-based NGOs that distribute humanitarian aid and development assistance. “That’s why foreign aid has maintained decades of support across party lines — it is vital for U.S. security and international stability.”

We also see in these comments signs that justifications for aid are changing.

When former Secretary of State Colin Powell called nongovernmental organizations a “force multiplier” in 2001, it stirred controversy because he suggested that they were an extension of the government and a pillar of U.S. strategy. Even still, he acknowledged that NGOs required independence from government to do their essential work.

An important choice

Humanitarian organizations are grappling with the financial and operational consequences of their reliance on a small number of donor governments that have cut off or cut back aid. As they adjust to the new reality, we believe that they must make a choice.

They can embrace the increasingly transactional agendas of the rich countries that have historically provided most humanitarian aid funding. Doing so may increase aid flows but compromise humanitarian neutrality and impartiality – potentially restricting their access to the places they need to go to do their work.

Or they can focus on people affected by crises – as recipients of assistance and as agents of change. This option would likely mean operating on an even smaller budget at a time when needs are increasing.

Either way, the decisions made today will have significant implications for the future of humanitarian action.</p></b>

                <p>Are you angry about politics right now? Seething? You’re not alone. According to the Mood of the Nation Poll by researchers at Penn State, 9 in 10 Americans can name a recent news event or something about American politics that made them angry.

Political scientists Steven Webster, Elizabeth Connors and I have investigated what happens to people’s social networks – their friends, family and neighbors – when partisan anger takes over. For example, suppose your neighbor is a member of the opposite political party. You’ve always watered their plants when they go on vacation. Given the news these days and how angry you’re feeling, what will you say when they ask for help during their next trip?

We found that when someone is angry with the opposite party, they avoid people with those views. That can include not assisting neighbors with various tasks, avoiding social gatherings attended by people from the other side, and refusing to date people who vote differently. It means being disappointed if your son or daughter marries a supporter of the opposing party, and even severing close friendships or distancing yourself from close relatives.

We see that political anger disrupts ordinary life – coffee with a friend – as well as more major life decisions. Political anger breaks our social networks.

People rely on their relationships to understand our world – and to vote. The more we isolate ourselves from people who see things differently, the easier it is to misunderstand them, pushing us to separate even more.

Stereotype vs. reality

During the Obama administration, my collaborators and I asked a nationally representative sample of voters to describe their stereotypes about the opposite party. Our questions were intended to tap into perceptions of the other side’s lifestyles and cultural values, in addition to policy attitudes.

First, we wanted to establish each side’s actual views. Our 2012-2016 study asked around 1,300 Americans whether they agreed with statements that are often associated with one party or the other – including creationism, guns, taxes and eco-friendliness.

For example, 42.5% of all Republicans we surveyed agreed with the statement that “this country would be safer if every law-abiding citizen possessed a firearm,” versus 25.1% of independents and 14.2% of Democrats. Meanwhile, 38.7% of Democrats agreed that “this country would be better if every citizen drove an electric car,” compared with 22% of independents and 11.4% of Republicans.

Two months later, we went back to the same voters and asked them a different question: What percentage of Democrats and Republicans did they think would agree with these statements?

We saw dramatic evidence of stereotypes. For example, only 19% of Democrats agreed that all Americans should pay more taxes, but more than 80% of Republicans believed the percentage to be higher. The same pattern occurred with electric cars and firearms. Just over 42% of Republicans agreed that all “law-abiding” citizens should have a gun, but the typical Democrat believed the percentage to be 60%-80%.

Americans do not understand each other across the red-blue divide. Importantly, respondents with more ideologically extreme views themselves had less accurate perceptions of the other party.

Avoiding the Joneses

The more extreme our beliefs become, the harder it will be to understand our neighbors.

Suppose you are a Republican. You learn that your Democratic neighbors believe that everyone should drive an electric car, marijuana should be legal in all states, and universal health care should be available to all citizens. Or suppose you are a Democrat, and you learn that your Republican neighbors believe that humans and dinosaurs walked the Earth at the same time, that elementary school students should be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, and that a fence should be built between the U.S. and Mexico.

Would you want to be friends?

These hypothetical neighbors have stereotypical beliefs – and most Americans say they do not want those neighbors in their social networks. Specifically, according to our 2023 study, they reported not wanting to become friends, not having this neighbor over for a family meal, and not feeling comfortable allowing their children to play with the neighbor’s kids, among other activities.

Stereotypes don’t just drive individual people and families apart; they make neighborhoods less cohesive. We ascribe stereotypical beliefs to people who are members of the opposite party – and then we react to these stereotypes, not to our neighbors themselves.

Social citizens

Cutting off those in-person relationships isn’t just a problem for safety and friendliness around the block. It’s a problem for democracy because Americans need relationships with people whose politics are different than their own.

A majority of Americans have social circles that are politically homogeneous. Even in 2020, 53% of Republicans said that their network was exclusively composed of Donald Trump supporters, and 55% of Democrats said that their network was exclusively composed of Joe Biden supporters.

In her book “Through the Grapevine,” political scientist Taylor Carlson documents that approximately 1 in 3 American voters mostly learn about politics from socially transmitted information: news they get from talking with friends or scrolling on social media. Relying on these sources is particularly problematic in social networks that are homogeneous, as exposure to information from someone in your own party can lead people to have more extreme positions. Carlson’s work highlights that voters who rely on friends to shape their views rely upon a resource that is heavily biased.

In my own book “The Social Citizen,” I investigated the influence peers have on political decisions, from voting and donating to identifying with a political party. For example, if a neighbor knocks on your door and asks you to turn out to vote, you are 4%-11% more likely to go cast a ballot than if a stranger knocked on your door.

Democracy in action

What can we do to remedy the fractures? We need to understand each other.

The U.S. has a long tradition of political dialogue. Indeed, after a brutal election tested their friendship, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did not exchange letters for 11 years. But the pair resumed their correspondence in 1812 with Adams’ statement – later echoed by Jefferson – “You and I, ought not to die, before We have explained ourselves to each other.”

What Adams and Jefferson understood in the 19th century still applies to the divisions in American society today: Reconciliation requires understanding. These conversations are frequently painful and hard; data scientists have noted that Thanksgiving dinners with guests who cross party lines are frequently shorter. But as my own research shows, we are most able to persuade people with whom we have the closest ties.

Democracy challenges us to participate in more ways than simply by voting. It challenges everyone to understand those around us and seek what is in the collective best interest.

And we have the most influence over people in our social networks. So that friend you’re really angry with about their politics? It’s time to give them a call and have a conversation.</p></b>

                <p>When companies advertise job openings, they often use buzzwords like “ambitious” and “self-reliant” to describe their ideal candidate. These traits sound appealing — what hiring manager wouldn’t want a driven employee?

But there’s a catch. In my latest study, published in the journal Management Science with co-authors Scott Jackson and Nick Seybert, I found that these terms may attract job applicants with more narcissistic tendencies.

As behavioral researchers in accounting, we are interested in executives who bend the rules. We decided to study job postings after noticing that the language used to describe an “ideal candidate” often included traits linked to narcissism. For example, narcissists tend to see themselves as highly creative and persuasive. Prior research also shows that narcissistic employees are more innovative and willing to take risks to get the success and admiration they crave, even if it means bending the rules.

Based on these observations, we compiled two sets of terms commonly used in job postings. We call the two sets “rule-follower” and “rule-bender” language.

Some examples of rule-bender language include “develops creative and innovative solutions to problems,” “communicates in a tactical and persuasive manner” and “thinks outside the box.” In contrast, the rule-follower language includes terms like “relies on time-tested solutions to problems,” “communicates in a straightforward and accurate manner” and “thinks methodically.”

Through a series of experiments, we found that rule-bender language attracts individuals with higher levels of narcissism for accounting-specific jobs, as well as other industries. To measure narcissism, we used a personality assessment that asks people to choose whether they identify more with more narcissistic statements like, “I always know what I am doing,” or less narcissistic statements like “Sometimes I am not sure of what I am doing.”

We also found that recruiters are more likely to use rule-bender terms when hiring for highly innovative, high-growth companies. For accounting positions, recruiters are more likely to use such terms when aggressive financial reporting could benefit the firm.

Why it matters

Companies write job postings carefully in hopes of attracting the ideal candidate. However, they may unknowingly attract and select narcissistic candidates whose goals and ethics might not align with a company’s values or long-term success. Research shows that narcissistic employees are more likely to behave unethically, potentially leading to legal consequences.

While narcissistic traits can lead to negative outcomes, we aren’t saying that companies should avoid attracting narcissistic applicants altogether. Consider a company hiring a salesperson. A firm can benefit from a salesperson who is persuasive, who “thinks outside the box” and who is “results-oriented.” In contrast, a company hiring an accountant or compliance officer would likely benefit from someone who “thinks methodically” and “communicates in a straightforward and accurate manner.”

Bending the rules is of particular concern in accounting. A significant amount of research examines how accounting managers sometimes bend rules or massage the numbers to achieve earnings targets. This “earnings management” can misrepresent the company’s true financial position.

In fact, my co-author Nick Seybert is currently working on a paper whose data suggests rule-bender language in accounting job postings predicts rule-bending in financial reporting.

Our current findings shed light on the importance of carefully crafting job posting language. Recruiting professionals may instinctively use rule-bender language to try to attract someone who seems like a good fit. If companies are concerned about hiring narcissists, they may want to clearly communicate their ethical values and needs while crafting a job posting, or avoid rule-bender language entirely.

What still isn’t known

While we find that professional recruiters are using language that attracts narcissists, it is unclear whether this is intentional.

Additionally, we are unsure what really drives rule-bending in a company. Rule-bending could happen due to attracting and hiring more narcissistic candidates, or it could be because of a company’s culture – or a combination of both.

                <p>When someone sees something that isn’t there, people often refer to the experience as a hallucination. Hallucinations occur when your sensory perception does not correspond to external stimuli.

Technologies that rely on artificial intelligence can have hallucinations, too.

When an algorithmic system generates information that seems plausible but is actually inaccurate or misleading, computer scientists call it an AI hallucination. Researchers have found these behaviors in different types of AI systems, from chatbots such as ChatGPT to image generators such as Dall-E to autonomous vehicles. We are information science researchers who have studied hallucinations in AI speech recognition systems.

Wherever AI systems are used in daily life, their hallucinations can pose risks. Some may be minor – when a chatbot gives the wrong answer to a simple question, the user may end up ill-informed. But in other cases, the stakes are much higher. From courtrooms where AI software is used to make sentencing decisions to health insurance companies that use algorithms to determine a patient’s eligibility for coverage, AI hallucinations can have life-altering consequences. They can even be life-threatening: Autonomous vehicles use AI to detect obstacles, other vehicles and pedestrians.

Making it up

Hallucinations and their effects depend on the type of AI system. With large language models – the underlying technology of AI chatbots – hallucinations are pieces of information that sound convincing but are incorrect, made up or irrelevant. An AI chatbot might create a reference to a scientific article that doesn’t exist or provide a historical fact that is simply wrong, yet make it sound believable.

In a 2023 court case, for example, a New York attorney submitted a legal brief that he had written with the help of ChatGPT. A discerning judge later noticed that the brief cited a case that ChatGPT had made up. This could lead to different outcomes in courtrooms if humans were not able to detect the hallucinated piece of information.

With AI tools that can recognize objects in images, hallucinations occur when the AI generates captions that are not faithful to the provided image. Imagine asking a system to list objects in an image that only includes a woman from the chest up talking on a phone and receiving a response that says a woman talking on a phone while sitting on a bench. This inaccurate information could lead to different consequences in contexts where accuracy is critical.

What causes hallucinations

Engineers build AI systems by gathering massive amounts of data and feeding it into a computational system that detects patterns in the data. The system develops methods for responding to questions or performing tasks based on those patterns.

Supply an AI system with 1,000 photos of different breeds of dogs, labeled accordingly, and the system will soon learn to detect the difference between a poodle and a golden retriever. But feed it a photo of a blueberry muffin and, as machine learning researchers have shown, it may tell you that the muffin is a chihuahua.

When a system doesn’t understand the question or the information that it is presented with, it may hallucinate. Hallucinations often occur when the model fills in gaps based on similar contexts from its training data, or when it is built using biased or incomplete training data. This leads to incorrect guesses, as in the case of the mislabeled blueberry muffin.

It’s important to distinguish between AI hallucinations and intentionally creative AI outputs. When an AI system is asked to be creative – like when writing a story or generating artistic images – its novel outputs are expected and desired. Hallucinations, on the other hand, occur when an AI system is asked to provide factual information or perform specific tasks but instead generates incorrect or misleading content while presenting it as accurate.

The key difference lies in the context and purpose: Creativity is appropriate for artistic tasks, while hallucinations are problematic when accuracy and reliability are required.

To address these issues, companies have suggested using high-quality training data and limiting AI responses to follow certain guidelines. Nevertheless, these issues may persist in popular AI tools.

What’s at risk

The impact of an output such as calling a blueberry muffin a chihuahua may seem trivial, but consider the different kinds of technologies that use image recognition systems: An autonomous vehicle that fails to identify objects could lead to a fatal traffic accident. An autonomous military drone that misidentifies a target could put civilians’ lives in danger.

For AI tools that provide automatic speech recognition, hallucinations are AI transcriptions that include words or phrases that were never actually spoken. This is more likely to occur in noisy environments, where an AI system may end up adding new or irrelevant words in an attempt to decipher background noise such as a passing truck or a crying infant.

As these systems become more regularly integrated into health care, social service and legal settings, hallucinations in automatic speech recognition could lead to inaccurate clinical or legal outcomes that harm patients, criminal defendants or families in need of social support.

Check AI’s work

Regardless of AI companies’ efforts to mitigate hallucinations, users should stay vigilant and question AI outputs, especially when they are used in contexts that require precision and accuracy. Double-checking AI-generated information with trusted sources, consulting experts when necessary, and recognizing the limitations of these tools are essential steps for minimizing their risks.</p></b>

                <p>When bots – automated agents that perform tasks on behalf of humans – become more active in online communities, it has profound effects on how humans interact with each other on those platforms. Bots designed to help users see more content increase the number of people users connect with but also decrease the interactions between people.

In online communities, replies, likes and comments between users form a network of interactions. Analysis of these social networks shows patterns, such as who is connecting and who is popular or important in the community.

My colleagues Nicholas Berente and Hani Safadi and I analyzed the network structure of communities on Reddit, called subreddits, that had seen increased use of bots from 2005 to 2019. Our goal was to see whether the presence of bots affected how the human community members interacted with each other.

Based on recent research, we knew that we were looking for two types of bots: reflexive and supervisory bots.

Reflexive bots are coded to plug into a community’s application programming interface. Based on how they are coded, they either post content based on specific rules or search for specific content and post a reply based on their preprogrammed rules. Supervisory bots have more permissions in the community and can delete or edit posts or even ban users based on preprogrammed community moderation rules.

We found that when there is more reflexive bot activity in a community – more bots posting content – there are more human-to-human connections. This means that the reflexive bots posting content enable people to find novel content and engage with other users they otherwise would not have seen. However, this high bot activity leads to less back-and-forth discussion between users. If a user posts on a subreddit, it is more likely that a bot will reply or interject itself into the conversation instead of two human users engaging in a meaningful back-and-forth discussion.

When there are supervisory bots moderating a community, we see less centralization in the human social network. This means that those key people who were important to the community have fewer connections than before. Without supervisory bots, these members would be the ones who establish and enforce community norms. With supervisory bots, this is less necessary, and those human members are less central to the community.

Why it matters

Bots are prevalent across online communities, and they can process vast amounts of data very quickly, which means they can react and respond to many more posts than humans can.

What’s more, as generative AI improves, people could use it to create more and more sophisticated bot accounts, and the platforms could use it to coordinate content moderation. Tech companies investing heavily in generative AI technologies could also deploy generative AI bots to increase engagement on their platforms.

Our study can help users and community leaders understand the impact of these bots on their communities. It can also help community moderators understand the impact of enabling automated moderation through supervisory bots.

What’s next

Bots are rigid because of their rules-based nature, but they are likely to become more advanced as they incorporate new technologies such as generative AI. More research will be needed to understand how complex generative AI bots affect human-to-human interactions in online communities.

At the same time, automating platform moderation can lead to strange effects, because bots are more rigid in their enforcement and cannot deal with potential issues on a case-by-case basis. How generative AI changes moderator bots remains to be seen.

                <p>When I taught research methods to undergraduates, I would start by asking whether anyone in the class had $20. Though harder to come by thanks to digital payment options, inevitably someone would produce a $20 bill. I would then ask whether they knew how the bill came to look the way it does. Students would take guesses – often rooted in history and counterfeiting concerns.

While valid, the larger font and picture designs that came about in the 1990s and early 2000s were also the result of research intended to make the bills more accessible for the 3.5 million Americans with low vision. One of those Americans with low vision was a researcher on the team designing the new bill, experimental psychologist Gordon Legge.

These changes made it easier for those low-vision Americans, their families and others around the world to read and use American dollars. In other countries, bills and coins come in different sizes that pertain to their value, making them much easier for people with low vision and the blind to use. Legge’s research saved Americans the cost of having to completely redesign the currency to come in different sizes.

My goal in talking about the currency redesign with my students was to show them how research has shaped their lives, often in ways they didn’t even realize.

Now, following President Donald Trump’s executive order on federal projects related to DEIA – diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility – many research initiatives similar to the bill redesign project will lose funding.

As a social psychologist, some of the studies I’ve worked on would be considered DEIA work. Social psychology as a field grew, in part, during World War II as researchers tried to understand bias-motivated atrocities such as the Holocaust.

DEIA initiatives are projects that seek to reduce discrimination and promote equal opportunities and equal access in multiple spaces such as school and workplaces, as well as in legal, housing and medical systems.

While frequently focused on those who have faced long-standing barriers to these resources – for example, racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities – the results of research related to DEIA are often applied to help all people achieve their potential.

The Trump administration’s list of DEIA-related terms is so broad that it’s flagging non-DEIA related work for potential termination. I’ve heard many scientists discuss how their programs of research have been wrongfully included in the anti-DEIA sweeps because they use terms such as “biodiversity.”

However, research that would be considered DEIA work has made influential contributions to society over the past few decades – it raises the question of whether any flagging is actually right. The backlash to anti-DEIA research seems to have started with criticism of DEI-related human resources training in workplaces. But the word list goes well beyond what would appear in HR training.

DEIA research identifies the problems and proposes the solutions. Solutions such as translation services for the hearing impaired, parental leave for mothers and fathers, pay equity, time off for religious holidays and lactation rooms for nursing mothers all stem from what could be labeled DEIA research and advocacy.

For instance, lactation rooms came about based on research into what working mothers needed to ease their return to work after pregnancy. This included research into breast pumps and even architectural research on how to best design these rooms.

DEIA contributions

DEIA work is nothing new – just the label is. After all, it was DEIA research in the 1950s that psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark presented to the Supreme Court to argue that school segregation harmed children, leading to the banning of the policy.

This work continues today as new DEIA research reveals that schools are often still racially homogenous. That means many American students still go to schools where the student bodies are primarily white or primarily racial minorities. However, the reasons for these divides are no longer due to segregation being the law.

In the 1970s, it was DEIA research that inspired the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and led to the creation of special education practices for neurodiverse students. These practices have improved educational outcomes for students with dyslexia, ADHD, autism and a variety of other neurodiversities.

And DEIA research is continuing to review and improve these practices today.

Starting in the 1980s, it was also DEIA research that led to HIV/AIDS, a virus disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ+ community, no longer being a death sentence. Doctors now have a drug that prevents HIV, including preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to infant.

Just today, I received a news alert about scientific breakthroughs in the neurological study of postpartum depression. Because “women” and “pregnant people” are on the list of terms flagged as DEIA-related, studies on postpartum depression could be considered DEIA.

DEIA science on DEIA science

It is DEIA science that has demonstrated how diverse research teams promote innovative performance. This research would suggest that America’s diversity may very well be one of the key elements shaping its prosperity.

Some might say “of course DEIA research will show DEIA works,” but it is also DEIA research that critiques the limitations of training to reduce bias – such as human resources workshops intended to teach workers about inclusive language, cultural sensitivity or implicit bias. Other non-DEIA HR training also faces criticism.

Scientists discuss these limitations, and the scientific process is constantly self-correcting as researchers search for better solutions. Recommendations about better training are proposed based on new research.

For instance, racial colorblindness is an ideology that grew out of the civil rights era and a desire to treat individuals equally regardless of race. However, it has led to some problems where people say they ignore race when really they don’t. For instance, in one study looking at race and dating preferences, white people endorsing a colorblind ideology were actually more likely to say they wouldn’t date a Black person than those who didn’t endorse colorblindness.

Colorblindness can also make people feel uncomfortable bringing up race in any context. One study shows how young people, who are not yet wary of identifying people by race, can outperform adults, who avoid race, during a game of Guess Who.

These studies are just some examples of DEIA science that showed the colorblindness approach is a mixed bag at best. Other times, it is harmful for minority groups and majority groups alike, or even backfires, making people more, not less, discriminatory and uncomfortable.

Alleged alternatives to DEIA

Despite its shortcomings, many prominent figures in the anti-DEIA movement have seemingly endorsed colorblindness.

For example, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott created executive order GA-55 to end DEIA policies and institute a “color-blind” approach instead. Texas public universities had to eliminate DEIA offices and practices but not legacy admissions and scholarships that studies show disproportionately benefit white students.

In his second inaugural address, Trump promised that his administration would “forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.” While a meritocracy may sound good on paper, DEIA research has suggested that meritocracies don’t work in the current society.

Meritocracies assume a level playing field and can ignore disparities, such as wealth, that may afford some more opportunities than others – social mobility between income levels is rare and can take generations.

Where we stand

Despite the anti-DEIA rhetoric present in American discourse, most Americans do not have negative attitudes toward DEIA; 52% even still think DEIA in the workplace is good. Most Americans, including white people, men and Republicans, also do not report having been harmed by DEIA policies. Overall, studies report that Americans value inclusivity.

Ultimately, blanket bans on anything remotely DEIA harm advancement across scientific disciplines. The disparities DEIA research examines still exist – in courts, in schools, in jobs, in health, in housing and in violent victimization rates.

Stopping cancer research because cancer prevention training doesn’t always work and sometimes backfires won’t stop cancer. Ignoring disparities will not make them go away. DEIA-related science is an ingrained part of the scientific enterprise, and cutting its funding could mean missing out on important breakthroughs.</p></b>

                <p>President Donald Trump gave no specific reason for firing Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff less than halfway through Brown’s four-year term in office.

Nor did he give an explanation for similarly ousting other senior military leaders, including the only women ever to lead the Navy and the Coast Guard, as well as the military’s top three lawyers – the judge advocates general of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The president is the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces. But since the days of George Washington, the military has been dedicated to serving the nation, not a specific person or political agenda. I know this because I served 36 years in the U.S. Air Force before retiring as a major general. Even now, as a lecturer in history, national security and constitutional law, I know that nonpartisanship is central to the military’s primary mission of defending the country.

Trump’s actions could raise concerns about whether he is trying to change those centuries of precedent.

If so, military personnel at all levels would face a crucial question: Would they stand up for the military’s independent role in maintaining the integrity and stability of American democracy or follow the president’s orders – even if those orders crossed a line that made them illegal or unconstitutional?

Political neutrality from the start

Washington and other U.S. founders were very aware that a powerful military could overthrow the government or be subjected to political whims as different parties or factions controlled the presidency or Congress, so they thought long and hard about the role of the militia and the use of military power.

Julius Caesar, who used his army to seize power in ancient Rome, was a cautionary tale. So was Oliver Cromwell’s use of his military power in the English Civil War to execute King Charles I and rule England.

One of Washington’s most significant contributions to the apolitical tradition of the military was his resignation as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army after the American Revolution officially ended, in 1783. By voluntarily giving up his military power and returning to civilian life, the man who would become the nation’s first president demonstrated his commitment to civilian control of a military grounded in allegiance to the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, not allegiance to any one party, faction or person.

Washington’s act set a powerful example for future generations. A few years later, the founders embedded civilian control over the military in the U.S. Constitution. Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the power to declare war and fund armies, while Article II, Section 2 designates the president as the commander-in-chief of the military.

This check and balance ensures the military remains neutral and subordinate to elected leaders. It also solidifies the allegiance of military leaders to a principled document, not to the ebbs and flows of politics.

Training and response to orders

Polling consistently shows that the American people trust the military more than any other element of the U.S. government. In part that trust comes from the military’s professional dedication to political neutrality, which includes training its personnel to uphold values like duty, honor and integrity.

Military members up and down the ranks take their allegiance to the Constitution seriously. At the beginning of their service, at every reenlistment and usually during promotion ceremonies, all military members – officers and enlisted – swear to support and defend the Constitution. The enlisted oath also includes a promise to follow the lawful orders of the president and of the officers appointed above them.

This foundational oath ensures that if members of the military receive orders that they believe are questionable, they will not follow those orders blindly. They are taught throughout their career – during basic training, officer candidate training and in recurring sessions through the years – to seek clarification. If necessary, they are told to challenge those orders through their chain of command, or through attorneys associated with their units, or by contacting their branch’s inspector general.

Depending on their ranks, military members’ responses to questionable orders can vary. Senior officers, who have extensive experience and higher levels of responsibility, have the authority and the duty to ensure that any orders they follow or pass down are lawful and in line with the Constitution. When evaluating uncertain orders or navigating unclear situations, they often consult with legal advisers, discuss the implications with peers and thoroughly analyze the situation before taking action.

Junior officers and senior enlisted personnel often find themselves in positions where they must make quick decisions based on the information available to them. While they are trained to follow orders, they are also encouraged to use their judgment and seek guidance when they believe an order to be unlawful – including getting advice from people with direct access to attorneys.

Junior enlisted personnel, who make up more than 40% of the military force, are also taught the importance of the legality and constitutionality of orders. They have the right to seek clarification if they believe an order is unlawful.

Even so, their training focuses heavily on discipline and obedience. This can make it challenging for them to question orders, especially in high-pressure situations.

Ultimate responsibility

The responsibility of scrutinizing orders falls on senior military leaders – admirals and generals, colonels and Navy captains. Junior officers and senior enlisted and junior enlisted personnel rely on their leaders to navigate the complexities of politics and ensure orders they receive are lawful and focused on national defense, not politics.

If senior military leaders fail in their responsibility, chaos could ensue: Units may end up following conflicting orders or ignoring directives altogether. This can lead to a breakdown in command and control, with some units acting independently or based on politically motivated directives. This would be a dangerous shift, making the military extremely vulnerable to operational failures and enemy attack.

Such a situation has never happened in the history of the U.S. military. But some events have come close to crossing the line. For instance, during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson was determined to demonstrate American strength and resolve, famously stating, “I will not lose in Vietnam.” His pressure landed on the shoulders of Gen. William Westmoreland.

Westmoreland responded by publicizing the numbers of enemy personnel killed in battle, attempting to show that U.S. efforts were reducing the size of opposing forces. But historians have found that this emphasis lacked clear military objectives, meaning troops faced confusion and contradictory orders. The price was a longer war, and more deaths for Americans and for Vietnamese civilians.

Ultimately, Westmoreland was accused of manipulating enemy troop strength estimates to create an impression of progress – in service of Johnson’s political desire to avoid defeat. His decisions did not directly violate the Constitution or U.S. law, but they exemplify how political pressures can adversely influence military strategies, with devastating consequences.

Unbiased sources of information

In addition to senior military leaders’ responsibility to remain apolitical, leaders also have clear responsibilities to the civilians elected and appointed above them.

For example, the president needs factual and unbiased information about the military’s capabilities from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, based on their experience and professional opinions. If advisers are hesitant to speak freely about what is and is not possible in any given situation, and about potential consequences both good and bad, the president will miss out on the kinds of critical insights that shape effective strategies.

The bottom line is that when top military experts give advice and take action influenced by politics, they undermine the centuries-old system of military training and ethics. Some traditions are worth keeping.</p></b>

                <p>Founded in 1870 as Missouri School of Mines, Missouri University of Science and Technology primarily educated mining engineers and surveyors. The campus really started to grow right after World War II. As the need for engineers and scientists grew, so did the university. The campus evolved into a world-class technological research university, one that was making an impact beyond the state and nation.

In 1964, the institution’s name was changed to the University of Missouri-Rolla. UMR was the technology flagship of the four-campus University of Missouri System.

Then, in 2008, the name officially became Missouri University of Science and Technology. As a technological research university, Missouri S&T is a member of a small but elite group of American institutions that distinguish themselves by having a mission-based commitment to improving the world through the study and application of advanced sciences and technology.

There are 16 technological research universities in the nation, including MIT, Caltech, Missouri S&T, Rensselaer, Georgia Tech and the Colorado School of Mines. Many of these institutions complement their technological strengths by offering good programs in humanities, liberal arts and social sciences. Missouri S&T is admired around the world for preparing students and creating research that solves the problems of a technological society.</p></b>

                <p>Social media platforms tend not to be that bothered by national boundaries.

Take X, for example. Users of what was once called Twitter span the globe, with its 600 millions-plus active accounts dotted across nearly every country. And each of those jurisdictions has its own laws.

But the interests of national regulatory efforts and that of predominantly U.S.-based technology companies often don’t align. While many governments have sought to impose oversight mechanisms to address problems such as disinformation, online extremism and manipulation, these initiatives have been met with corporate resistance, political interference and legal challenges invoking free speech as a shield against regulation.

What is brewing is a global struggle over digital platform governance. And in this battle, U.S. platforms are increasingly leaning on American laws to challenge other nation’s regulations. It is, we believe as experts on digital law – one an executive director of a forum monitoring how countries implement democratic principles – a form of digital imperialism.

A rumble in the tech jungle

The latest manifestation of this phenomenon occurred in February 2025, when new tensions emerged between Brazil’s judiciary and U.S.-based social media platforms.

Trump Media & Technology Group and Rumble filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, challenging his orders to suspend accounts on the two platforms linked to disinformation campaigns in Brazil.

The case follows earlier unsuccessful efforts by Elon Musk’s X to resist similar Brazilian rulings.

Together, the cases exemplify a growing trend in which U.S. political and corporate actors attempt to undermine foreign regulatory authority by pressing the case that domestic U.S. law and corporate protections should take precedence over sovereign policies globally.

From corporate lobbying to lawfare

At the core of the dispute is Allan dos Santos, a right-wing Brazilian influencer and fugitive from justice who fled to the U.S. in 2021 after De Moraes ordered his preventive arrest for allegedly coordinating disinformation networks and inciting violence.

Dos Santos has continued his online activities abroad. Brazil’s extradition requests have gone unanswered due to claims by U.S. authorities that the case involves issues of free speech rather than criminal offenses.

Trump Media and Rumble’s lawsuit attempts to do two things. First, it seeks to frame Brazil’s judicial actions as censorship rather than oversight. And second, it seeks to portray the Brazilian court action as territorial overreach.

Their position is that as the target of the action was in the U.S., they are subject to U.S. free speech protections under the First Amendment. The fact that the subject of the ban was Brazilian and is accused of spreading disinformation and hate in Brazil should not, they argue, matter.

For now, U.S. courts agree. In late February, a Florida-based judge ruled that Rumble and Trump Media need not comply with the Brazilian order.

Big Tech pushback to regulation

The case signals an important shift in the contest over platform accountability – a move from corporate lobbying and political pressure to direct legal intervention in foreign jurisdictions. U.S. courts are now being used to challenge overseas decisions regarding platform accountability.

The outcome and the broader legal strategy behind the lawsuit could have far-reaching implications not only for Brazil but for any country or region – such as the European Union – attempting to regulate online spaces.

The resistance against digital regulation predates the Trump administration.

In Brazil, efforts to regulate social media platforms have long faced substantial opposition. Big Tech companies – including Google, Meta and X – have used their economic and political influence to lobby against tighter regulation, often framing such policies as a threat to free expression.

In 2020, the Brazilian “Fake News Bill,” which sought to hold platforms accountable for the spread of disinformation, was met with strong opposition from these companies.

Google and Meta launched high-profile campaigns to oppose the bill, warning it would “threaten free speech” and “harm small businesses.” Google placed banners on its Brazilian homepage urging users to reject the legislation, while Meta ran advertisements questioning its implications for the digital economy.

These efforts, alongside lobbying and political resistance, were successful in helping to delay and weaken the regulatory framework.

Mixing corporate and political power

The difference now is that challenges are blurring the line between the corporate and the political.

Trump Media was 53% owned by the U.S. president before he moved his stake into a revocable trust in December 2024. Elon Musk, the free speech fundamentalist owner of X, is a de facto member of the Trump administration.

Their ascent to power has coincided with the First Amendment being wielded as a shield against foreign regulations on digital platforms.

Free speech protections in the U.S. have been applied unequally, allowing authorities to suppress dissent in some cases while shielding hateful speech in others.

This imbalance extends to corporate power, with decades of legal precedent expanding protections for private interests. The case law cemented corporate speech protections, a logic later extended to digital platforms.

U.S. free speech advocates in Big Tech and the U.S. government are seemingly escalating this trend to an even more extreme interpretation: that American free speech arguments can be deployed to resist the regulation of other jurisdictions and challenge foreign legal frameworks.

For instance, in response to the European Union’s Digital Services Act, U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, expressed concerns that the act could threaten American free speech principles.

Such an argument may have been fine if the same interpretation of free speech – and its appropriate protections – were universally accepted. But they are not.

The concept of free speech varies significantly across nations and regions.

Countries such as Brazil, Germany, France and others adopt what legal experts refer to as a proportionality-based approach to free speech, balancing it against other fundamental rights such as human dignity, democratic integrity and public order.

Sovereign countries using this approach recognize freedom of expression as a fundamental and preferential right. But they also acknowledge that certain restrictions are necessary to protect democratic institutions, marginalized communities, public health and the informational ecosystem from harms.

While the U.S. imposes some limits on speech – such as defamation laws and protection against incitement to imminent lawless action – the First Amendment is generally far more expansive than in other democracies.

The future of digital governance

The legal battle over platform regulation is not confined to the current battle between U.S.-based platforms and Brazil. The EU’s Digital Services Act and the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom are other examples of governments trying to assert control over platforms operating within their borders.

As such, the lawsuit by Trump Media and Rumble against the Brazilian Supreme Court signals a critical moment in global geopolitics.

U.S. tech giants, such as Meta, are bending to the free speech winds coming out of the Trump administration. Musk, the owner of X, has given support to far-right groups overseas.

And this overlap in the policy priorities of social media platforms and the political interests of the U.S. administration opens a new era in the deregulation debate in which U.S. free speech absolutists are seeking to establish legal precedents that might challenge the future of other nations’ regulatory efforts.

As countries continue to develop regulatory frameworks for digital governance – for instance, AI regulation imposing stricter governance rules in Brazil and in the EU – the legal, economic and political strategies platforms employ to challenge oversight mechanisms will play a crucial role in determining the future balance between corporate influence and the rule of law.</p></b>

                <p>New research suggests there are about 100 trees per inhabitant in China.

A new estimate suggests China is home to 142.6 billion trees, meaning the country has roughly 100 trees per inhabitant.

These numbers are considerable, given how densely populated China is, an expert told Live Science. Still, the total figure may be an underestimate due to the limitations of the technology used to count the trees, the authors of the new study said.

"The actual number could be higher," said Qinghua Guo , a professor in the Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System at Peking University and the lead author of the study. China's Ninth National Forest Resources Inventory counted an average of 426 trees per acre (1,052 trees/hectare) across the country in 2019, which is much higher than the new study's estimate of 279 trees per acre (689 trees/hectare), Guo told Live Science in an email.

The true number of trees could be somewhere in the middle, but more research is needed to figure out what it is, he said.

An accurate estimate of China's tree population is crucial to evaluating forest ecosystem conditions and the amount of carbon that is being locked away in trees, Guo said. He and his colleagues also created a detailed map showing the distribution of China's trees, which they say will help the country hit its ecological and climate targets.

"The study represents the first high-resolution mapping of tree density across China," Guo said. "Ultimately, this research contributes to China's approach to global sustainable ecosystem management and restoration."

To produce the estimate, the researchers used a laser-based mapping technique called lidar (light detection and ranging). The team has been collecting lidar data from drones since 2015, amounting to an area covering 540 square miles (1,400 square kilometers).

For the new study, the scientists counted the number of trees in this area using software called Lidar360 that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI). They then extrapolated the resulting tree density estimate to obtain a national figure, with the results published Feb. 6 in the journal Science Bulletin .

The researchers created a map showing the distribution and density of trees in China. (Image credit: Cheng et al., Science Bulletin (2025). Reprinted with permission from Kai Cheng.)

The technology is cutting-edge, but some features need ironing out, Guo said. For example, Lidar360 cannot detect trees growing below thick canopies. "In densely forested areas, overlapping canopies obstruct the accurate detection of mid-story and understory trees, leading to lower-than-actual tree counts," Guo said. Incorporating terrestrial lidar data and improving the software could provide more accurate tree counts, he added.

Despite certain limitations, the results broadly align with researchers' previous understanding of China's tree population, said Tom Crowther , an assistant professor in the department of environmental systems science at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. "Globally, there are closer to 400 trees per person, but in such a densely populated region, it makes sense that this number is lower," Crowther, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.

China's tree population may soon increase, however, because the country is planting seedlings at a dizzying rate. Tree counts could skyrocket this spring as drones are deployed to seed the "Great Green Wall" — a huge belt of trees in the north of China that is being planted to prevent the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts from expanding. The Great Green Wall project — also known as the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program — started in 1978 and is due to be completed in 2050, by which point it could hold 100 billion trees . The wall is already the world's largest seeded forest with more than 66 million trees , but its success in staving off desertification is debated .

The technology used for the study not only helps to count and map trees, but it could also optimize where China chooses to focus its tree-planting efforts.

"The fusion of high-precision data and intelligent models ensures that every tree can be planted in the most suitable location," Guo said.</p></b>

                <p>Scientists in Japan have developed a new kind of "universal" computing memory that is much faster and less energy-hungry than modules used in the best laptops and PCs today.

Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is a type of universal memory device that can overcome some of the limitations of conventional RAM, which can slow down at peak demand due to a relatively low capacity. Universal memory is a storage format that combines the speed of existing RAM and the ability of storage to retain information without a power supply

Universal memory like MRAM is a better proposition than the components used in computers and smart devices today as it offers higher speeds and much greater capacity, as well as better endurance.

This new technology operates at faster speeds and with greater capacity than conventional RAM, but overcomes the problem of high power requirements for data writing — which has previously been a challenge for MRAM.

MRAM devices consume little power in their standby state but need a large electric current to switch the direction of magnetization vector configurations of magnetic tunnel junctions, thereby using the direction of magnetization to represent the binary values in computers. That makes it infeasible for use in most computing systems and to achieve low-power data writing, a more efficient method for switching these vectors was needed.

In a paper published Dec. 25 2024 in the journal Advanced Science , researchers reported developing a new component for controlling the electric field in MRAM devices. Their method requires far less energy to switch polarity, thereby lowering the power requirements and improving the speed at which processes are performed.

Next-generation computing memory

The prototype component they built was called a "multiferroic heterostructure" — a ferromagnetic material and piezoelectric material, but with an ultrathin vanadium between them — that can be magnetized by an electric field. This differs from other MRAM devices, which did not have the vanadium layer.

Structural fluctuations in the ferromagnetic layer meant that it was difficult for a stable direction of magnetization to be maintained in previous MRAM devices. In order to overcome this stability issue, the Vanadium wafer between the ferromagnetic and piezoelectric layers acts as a buffer between the two.

By passing an electric current through the materials, the scientists demonstrated that the magnetic state could switch direction. The materials could maintain their shape and form, which previous versions could not do. Furthermore, the magnetic state was maintained after the electric charge was no longer present, allowing a stable binary state to be maintained without power.

The study did not cover the degradation in the switching efficiency over time. This tends to be a common problem with a wide range of electrical devices. For example, a common complaint with rechargeable household batteries is that they can only be charged a certain number of times (approximately 500) before their capacity degrades.

Ultimately, the new MRAM technology could enable more powerful commercial computing while also offering a longer use life, the scientists said. That's because the new switching technique requires far less power than previous solutions, has a greater resilience than current RAM technologies and does not require moving parts.</p></b>

                <p>One man’s trash is a common coot’s treasure, at least when it comes to plastic.

In Amsterdam, the birds have been constructing nests out of plastic food wrappers, masks and other waste for at least 30 years, researchers report in the February Ecology. The revelation shows not only how much plastic now litters the environment but also the power of using human-made products to learn about the natural world.

“It’s ironic to think that many of these plastic single-use items have just been used for minutes by people, yet these coots have used them for decades,” says Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands.

Hiemstra has been studying nesting materials used by city birds for years. He’s documented coots adding face masks to their nests during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — a building material that coots and other birds still use — and found rebellious magpies and crows that built their homes out of antibird spikes. Many birds these days use human trash as nest-building material, Hiemstra says.

In Amsterdam, common coots like this one build their nests out of plastic waste and other human-made materials. Auke-Florian Hiemstra

In 2021, Hiemstra and colleagues excavated a common coot (Fulica atra) nest built on a wooden beam poking out of Rokin canal in Amsterdam. The nest had multiple layers of plastic waste, especially food packages. By analyzing the expiration dates on the coots’ collection, Hiemstra used the plastic the way an archaeologist would use fossils, to build a history of the nest layer by layer.

Coots typically build their nests out of plant material that quickly decays, so the birds can’t reuse nests year after year. With the incorporation of plastics, however, the nests become much more stable, so the coots can return to old nests and build upon their solid foundations.

Expiration dates on wrappers helped researchers date nest layers and uncover how long the birds have been using plastic to build their nests. Auke-Florian Hiemstra

In total, Hiemstra’s team found 15 nests that had plastic dating to multiple years, indicating the birds had been reusing them.

Using expiration dates to understand nest history can be imprecise. Since plastic lasts so long, old pieces of it can find their way into recent nest layers. For instance, Hiemstra found a bag of paprika chips from a 1970s brand toward the top of one nest. But when packages with similar expirations are bunched together, Hiemstra says, it builds confidence that that part of the nest was constructed around that time.

In the deepest part of the Rokin nest, he found several wrappers dating to the early 1990s, including a Mars Bar wrapper promoting the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

“Weirdly enough, the wrapper is in pristine condition, as if it were littered yesterday,” Hiemstra says. “Yet you know it is 30 years old. It really shows plastic is here to stay.”</p></b>

                <p>Memory Lane

Ciara Greene and Gillian Murphy

Princeton Univ., $29.95

There are countless metaphors for memory. It’s a leaky bucket, a steel trap, a file cabinet, words written in sand.

But one of the most evocative — and neuroscientifically descriptive — invokes Lego bricks. A memory is like a Lego tower. It’s built from the ground up, then broken down, put away in bins and rebuilt in a slightly different form each time it’s taken out. This metaphor is beautifully articulated by psychologists Ciara Greene and Gillian Murphy in their new book, Memory Lane.

Perhaps the comparison speaks to me because I have watched my kids create elaborate villages of Lego bricks, only to be dismantled, put away (after much nagging) and reconstructed, always with a similar overall structure but with minor and occasionally major changes. These villages’ blueprints are largely stable, but also fluid and flexible, subject to the material whims of the builders at any point in time.

Memory works this way, too, Greene and Murphy propose. Imagine your own memory lane as a series of buildings, modified in ways both small and big each time you call them to mind. “As we walk down Memory Lane, the buildings we pass — our memories of individual events — are under constant reconstruction,” Greene and Murphy write.

In accessible prose, the book covers a lot of ground, from how we form memories to how delicate those memories really are. Readers may find it interesting (or perhaps upsetting) to learn how bad we all are at remembering why we did something, from trivial choices, like buying an album, to consequential ones, such as a yes or no vote on an abortion referendum. People change their reasoning — or at least, their memories of their reasoning — on these sorts of events all the time.

Modern dilemmas also come up, such as whether fake news and deepfake videos have particular sway over our memories or even create false ones. Don’t panic, the authors write. Digital fakes can influence memories, sure. But so can written stories, gossip from a neighbor or a leading question from a cop. “We don’t need to generate technophobic fears of a digital future where our memories will be distorted — our memories can already be distorted very effectively by nondigital means.” The sentiment is alarming, but also strangely comforting.

Greene and Murphy offer another comforting message again and again: Our memories are fallible and flawed, but these slips are features, not bugs. These imperfections are a product of a flexible memory system that allows us to learn from the past, plan for the future and respond to unexpected events. Forgetting may make our brains more efficient by jettisoning extraneous fluff so we can focus on the important memories. It may even keep us happier by allowing time to ease the sting of painful experiences, the authors write. “Instead of attempting to force your memory to be something it is not, we advocate accepting it just the way it is — flaws and all.”

                <p>The Big Wheel alongside some of its neighbors.

Deep observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an exceptionally large galaxy in the early universe. It's a cosmic giant whose light has travelled over 12 billion years to reach us. We've dubbed it the Big Wheel, with our findings published March 17 in Nature Astronomy .

This giant disk galaxy existed within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, meaning it formed when the universe was just 15% of its current age. It challenges what we know about how galaxies form.

What is a disk galaxy?

Picture a galaxy like our own Milky Way : a flat, rotating structure made up of stars, gas and dust, often surrounded by an extensive halo of unseen dark matter .

Disk galaxies typically have clear spiral arms extending outward from a dense central region. Our Milky Way itself is a disk galaxy, characterized by beautiful spiral arms that wrap around its center.

Studying disk galaxies, like the Milky Way and the newly discovered Big Wheel, helps us uncover how galaxies form , grow and evolve across billions of years.

These studies are especially significant, as understanding galaxies similar to our own can provide deeper insights into the cosmic history of our galactic home.

A giant surprise

We previously thought galaxy disks form gradually over a long period: either through gas smoothly flowing into galaxies from surrounding space, or by merging with smaller galaxies.

Usually, rapid mergers between galaxies would disrupt the delicate spiral structures, turning them into more chaotic shapes. However, the Big Wheel managed to quickly grow to a surprisingly large size without losing its distinctive spiral form. This challenges long-held ideas about the growth of giant galaxies.

Our detailed JWST observations show that the Big Wheel is comparable in size and rotational speed to the largest "super-spiral" galaxies in today's universe. It is three times as big in size as comparable galaxies at that epoch and is one of the most massive galaxies observed in the early cosmos.

In fact, its rotation speed places it among galaxies at the high end of what's called the Tully-Fisher relation , a well-known link between a galaxy's stellar mass and how fast it spins.

Remarkably, even though it's unusually large, the Big Wheel is actively growing at a rate similar to other galaxies at the same cosmic age.

The Big Wheel galaxy is seen at the center. In striking contrast, the bright blue galaxy (upper right) is only about 1.5 billion light years away, making the Big Wheel roughly 50 times farther away. Although both appear a similar size, the enormous distance of the Big Wheel reveals its truly colossal physical scale. (Image credit: JWST)

Unusually crowded part of space

What makes this even more fascinating is the environment in which the Big Wheel formed.

It's located in an unusually crowded region of space, where galaxies are packed closely together, ten times denser than typical areas of the universe. This dense environment likely provided ideal conditions for the galaxy to grow quickly. It probably experienced mergers that were gentle enough to let the galaxy maintain its spiral disk shape.

Additionally, the gas flowing into the galaxy must have aligned well with its rotation, allowing the disk to grow quickly without being disrupted. So, a perfect combination.

A fortunate finding

Discovering a galaxy like the Big Wheel was incredibly unlikely. We had less than a 2% chance to find this in our survey, according to current galaxy formation models.

So, our finding was fortunate, probably because we observed it within an exceptionally dense region, quite different from typical cosmic environments.

Besides its mysterious formation, the ultimate fate of the Big Wheel is another intriguing question. Given the dense environment, future mergers might significantly alter its structure, potentially transforming it into a galaxy comparable in mass to the largest ones observed in nearby clusters, such as Virgo.

The Big Wheel's discovery has revealed yet another mystery of the early universe, showing that our current models of galaxy evolution still need refinement.

With more observations and discoveries of massive, early galaxies like the Big Wheel, astronomers will be able to unlock more secrets about how the universe built the structures we see today.</p></b>

                <p>A new mRNA vaccine could prevent pancreatic cancer from returning — potentially for the long haul.

In a small clinical trial, some patients who received the vaccine remained cancer-free for more than three years, researchers reported February 19 in Nature.

That is “pretty remarkable,” says Aaron Sasson, who directs the Pancreatic Cancer Center at Stony Brook Medicine in New York and was not involved with the work. Despite facing a notoriously lethal cancer, these patients lived “a lot longer than we would have otherwise expected,” he says.

The new research, which is still in the proof-of-concept stage, suggests that a cancer vaccine strategy could one day offer patients a long-lasting treatment option.

The results come amid recent news that officials at the National Institutes of Health are telling scientists to avoid mentioning mRNA vaccine technology in grant applications. It’s a move that could significantly hamper the advancement of mRNA vaccines in cancer research and patient care, Sasson says.

Unlike a traditional vaccine — such as the annual flu shot — which helps our bodies ready defenses for future viral encounters, this type of cancer vaccine acts therapeutically, after someone has already developed cancer. It works by teaching patients’ immune cells what pancreatic cancer looks like. Those educated cells can then seek out and destroy tumors. This approach is part of a growing field of cancer immunotherapies that enlist people’s own immune systems in treatment.

Dozens of similar cancer vaccines are in the works. Researchers are testing the new mRNA cancer vaccine in melanoma and colorectal cancer as well as other vaccines in even more cancers. Excitement about this technology has been brewing in the cancer vaccine field, says Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City who led the recent pancreatic cancer vaccine trial.

He hopes the work could offer a blueprint for developing effective vaccines against even more types of cancer. Science News spoke with Balachandran and Sasson to understand how cancer vaccines work, the future of the field and why some researchers are focusing on pancreatic cancer.

We need more therapies for pancreatic cancer

Doctors already have a set of therapies for treating pancreatic cancer. The problem is, they just don’t work very well, Sasson says. “A lack of effective therapy has really plagued the field.”

Diagnosing pancreatic cancer can be tricky; it kills more than 450,000 people globally every year, so patients often learn they have the disease at an advanced stage. The pancreas is a flattened, pear-shaped gland tucked away inside the body, behind the stomach. That makes it difficult for doctors to manually check for lumps, unlike breast cancer. And some symptoms, such as weight loss and fatigue, aren’t obvious clues that someone has the disease.

Current treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and drugs that attack cancer cells. Nevertheless, the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is around 13 percent, meaning that five years after diagnosis, 87 out of 100 patients will have died.

“If you’re diagnosed with pancreas cancer,” Sasson says, “the odds are extremely high you’re going to die from pancreas cancer.”

Cancer vaccines harness the power of the immune system

Cancer vaccines may extend patients’ lives and are part of an expanding class of therapies that harness our bodies’ own defenses to fight disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved dozens of such immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, which rev up the immune system; therapeutic antibodies, which help the immune system spot cancer; and T-cell transfer therapy, which involves supercharging a patient’s own immune cells.

The common thread here is the immune system, Sasson says. “Our immune system is a very, very efficient killing machine.”

Cancer vaccines like the one Balachandran’s team is testing, which was jointly developed by the biotechnology companies BioNTech and Genentech, take a different approach. They show patients’ bodies a tiny, nonfunctional piece of their tumor, serving as a Bat-Signal for the immune system. In response, the body produces immune cells called T cells that can recognize cancer as something that’s not supposed to be there — something that’s to be destroyed.

RNA cancer vaccines use some of the same technology as COVID vaccines

The cancer vaccine works similarly to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but instead contains instructions for building cancer proteins rather than coronavirus proteins and is given after the disease develops, rather than before. There’s another major difference: The cancer vaccine is personalized for every patient.

“Each individual tumor has a unique combination of genetic mutations,” Balachandran says. To create the vaccine, doctors first surgically remove a patient’s tumor and analyze its DNA for genetic errors. Some of these errors produce mutant tumor proteins, which the immune system can recognize like red flags warning danger. Patients receive a personalized vaccine containing RNA sequences that encode those red flags, Balachandran says.

This process teaches patients’ immune systems to be on the lookout; when immune cells see the red flags, they know it’s time to strike. Your body makes “these cells that can recognize the cancer, kill the cancer, and last in the body for long periods of time” in case the cancer ever comes back, Balachandran says.

An effective cancer vaccine needs to be long-lasting

In a small clinical trial involving pancreatic cancer patients, the vaccine spurred a strong immune response in eight out of 16 participants, generating a legion of red flag–targeting T cells. Balachandran’s team reported those results in 2023. At the time, the prevailing wisdom was that “you could not teach the immune system to recognize pancreatic cancer,” he says.

Many scientists thought pancreatic cancer did not create enough red flags to alert the immune system. The team’s results challenged that view. Scientists now know that the cancer produces these red flags — and they can identify them, build a vaccine around them and use that vaccine to grow an army of T cells that hunt for pancreatic cancer.

But an effective cancer vaccine requires more, Balachandran says. “Not only do you need to make the cells, but the cells need to last and retain function long-term.” His team followed the 16 patients for up to about four years; all had undergone surgery and subsequently received an immune checkpoint inhibitor, their personalized vaccine and a standard chemotherapy regimen. Of the eight people who mounted an immune response to the vaccine, only two saw their cancers return. In contrast, seven of the eight who did not respond saw their cancer return after about a year.

“It’s a big deal,” Sasson says, because it suggests the vaccine can generate immune cells that patrol the body like guard dogs even several years later.

Balachandran can’t say for sure why the vaccine didn’t work for everybody, though it’s possible the spleen may be involved. Some patients had their spleens removed prior to vaccination. The organ is part of the immune system and helps generate immune responses. Without it, the immune response to the vaccine may be weaker.

He and his colleagues are now enrolling patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering and other sites around the world in a larger trial to test whether the vaccine is safe and effective.</p></b>

                <p>In the Global Risks reports of 2024 and 2025 of the World Economic Forum, misinformation was pointed out as a great risk to humanity and a reason for great concern in the short and medium term.

In this context, reality can become increasingly complex and difficult to understand, considering that the platformization of life and, especially, the meeting of the interests of large technology corporations with the content production market has enabled the exponential growth of misinformation and the enhancement of its reach in various countries.

On the other hand, unilateralism and exacerbation of national security actions in the political agendas of countries, especially the US, are mentioned by respondents at Global Risks Report 2025 as provocators of negative repercussions around the world. Such conduct may impact transparency, as in authoritarian regimes. And, as the report emphasizes, such measures can contribute to the consolidation of authoritarian regimes and the regression of democratic regimes.

It is noteworthy that contemporary democracy as a whole is experiencing crises that put their liberal principles and their set of rights, duties and freedoms guaranteed by the Republican State at stake. This scenario indicates that liberal democratic regimes may not be fulfilling their promises of inclusion and equality, which may be leading populations from many historically democratic countries to disappointment in relation to this type of regime.

Since the late 20th century, authoritarian ideologies have gradually conquered voters and public space around the world. And these new configurations of political power, combined with moments of disappointment with democracy, have been aggravated by the growing influence of social networks and, more recently, artificial intelligence, political narratives that misrepresent facts and relativize the truth for extremist ideals.

Artificial intelligence and misinformation in electoral processes

When we relate fake news campaigns using disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, you must keep in mind that there is no more amateurism in this sector. The misinformation market today already has a “production chain” that covers from the creation of lies to the execution of content distribution strategies.

To exemplify what we are investigating in terms of misinformation and their interconnections with other phenomena, it is worth mentioning the use of AI tools in electoral communication used in the 2024 claims.

According to the artificial intelligence report in the world, from the Brazilian project “Media and Democracy”, from the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, last year in India, a country with almost 1 billion voters and where only 46% of the population have access to the internet, AI tools were recently used to make Deepfake videos with images of already dead politicians. These assemblies were taken to public squares during election rallies, to interfere with public opinion and direct votes.

According to the same report, Mexico - which has around 100 million voters and 24% of the population without internet access - also underwent assemblies with deepfakes that circulated at great speed. During last year's election campaign, current President Claudia Sheinbaum was presented on her main opponent's media as a “communist”. Similar practices are reported in researching the media and democracy report in countries such as South Africa and even elections for the European Parliament.

The Artificial Generative Report Intelligence and Elections of the Center for Mediagement of The University for Texas and Austin, which focused on the elections of Mexico, India, South Africa and the United States, identified the main uses of translation tools, voice clones and video editing, in addition to the automated processes of creating and distribution of desinctive contents with uses of uses Ia.

In Brazil, the Observatory was in the elections, consolidated from a partnership of Alafia-LAB with misinforman and Datapivacy, listed the main uses of AI in the municipal elections of 2024. We highlight AI uses to disinform, create polarizations and arouse hatred, racism and misogyny. These contents exploit the dynamics of the platforms and appropriate the algorithmic logic, coupled with the exploitation of the aesthetics of digital structures.

Given these unusual scenarios that exclude truth and reality, can you question how such uses can cause systemic risks and impact democracies? The answers indicate the events on January 8, 2023 as one of the most glaring and visible examples of attack on democracy in Brazilian political history. And at the time, the invasion of public buildings and the breach of heritage was coordinated by digital social networks.

The Twilight of Democracies

Both Democracy Index of the Economist Intelligence and V-Dem Index, linked to the V-PE-DEM Institute of the University of Gotemburg point to the deterioration of democratic regimes and a consequent growing self-cathization of the world. The Economist Intelligence index is based on 60 indicators grouped into five categories, namely: civil freedoms; Government operation; Political participation; Political culture and, finally, electoral process and pluralism. In 2011, Democracy Index qualified as imperfect democracies 54 countries, and there are also hybrid regimes located in 37 nations and authoritarian regimes in 51 countries.

Democracy Index published in 2024 situates Brazil of 2023 still in 51st position as imperfect democracy. However, as regards the world, the report points out that unlike 2011, when 11% of the population lived in full democracies, currently only 7.8% reside in qualified countries in this way. Since the index was created in 2006, Brazil fell from a note, from 7.8 to 6.7; Already the US fell from 8.2 to 7.8, coming from full to imperfect democracy.

On the other hand, and according to the V-Dem-Variesties of Democracy 2024 report, which focused on elections held in 60 countries last year, 42 countries would be in the process of self-catualization. And only 18 would be in the process of democratization. Among these Brazil, whose population encompasses half of all that are resuming democratic directions. It is worth considering that among the 42 countries in the process of autocratization, according to the mentioned index, is India, which has 18% of the world population and represents a large part of the 2.8 billion people living in countries that are in the process of totaling power.

Also according to the V-Dem Institte report, the level of democracy enjoyed by people globally in 2023 fell to 1985 levels. As a result, about 5.7 billion people are living today in autocracies, and with the results of the 2024 elections this number has increased.

Already the recently published V-DEM 2025 highlights the 25 years of growth of autocratization in the world. And it questions, in its conclusions, if democracy is being defeated globally.

Interdependence between politics, capital and technology

The twilight of democracies can be analyzed from the interdependence between this political system, the capitalism and the digital technology that constitute one of the most important paradoxes of contemporary times. The public opening suggested by digital technology allowed to reflect on the feasibility of the principles of democracies, for the first time in political history. Participation, transparency, accountability, public debate, equality and freedom could be made possible through instruments, structures, processes and the digital ease of establishing communication, immanent public communication to democracies.

In fact, the so-called digital democracy surprised epistemologically and took place in research agendas as scientific production and the functioning of associations and institutes such as INCT-DD (National Institute in Science and Technology in Digital Democracy) demonstrates. The different configurations of democracies (direct, representative, participatory and deliberative) benefited from so many mechanisms capable of bringing state, society and media closer.

At the same time, the fascination and facilitation of the uses of this technology also arbitrarily expanded any speeches - without ethical shame - and created an uncontrollable global industrial hub. An industry that violates the constitution of countries with technology as innovative as dystopian, as it changes realities, disregards the truth, imposes doubt on people and concepts, unbalances the educational process, influences new types of behavior and creates doubts about knowledge and the future.

This whole scenario and its intricate consequences have put democracies in crisis, and in four dimensions: economic, political, social and epistemic.

We therefore live a time when existing democracies live different stages, which can be identified considering the breadth of inequalities, the disqualification of politics, the rise of the far right, the rationality subjected to the emotions and the power of digital devices defining the limits of misinformation and truth.</p></b>

                <p>In a surprisingly emphatic result, 41-year-old Kirsty Coventry, Zimbabwe’s Sport Minister, was selected as the new president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at its 144th session in Greece.

Coventry is the first woman, the first African, and the youngest person ever to take on the role.

So how did she rise to this position, and what should sports in Australia and globally expect?

Unpacking the votes

Coventry comes well-credentialed as a five-time Olympic swimmer, representing Zimbabwe from 2000 to 2016 and winning seven medals, two of them gold.

An IOC member since 2013, Coventry was initially an athlete-elected member.

She has taken on various IOC roles, including most recently on the Coordination Committee for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Although Coventry was one of the three favourites, along with Sebastian Coe from the United Kingdom and Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr from Spain (son of the previous IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch), she won the vote in a landslide on the first ballot, securing 49 votes of the 97.

Having obtained the required 50% majority, no further rounds were held.

So begins a new dawn for the IOC’s now extremely powerful inaugural woman leader, who will face several challenges.

How did she win?

Foremost, Coventry had longstanding president Thomas Bach’s informal endorsement and support.

Bach no doubt had a huge sway over the voting members, many of whom were elected to the IOC during his 12-year reign.

Bach’s appointment as Honorary President for Life from June this year means he will still have a powerful role and be able to mentor and influence Coventry.

A lack of transparent voting for the position means we cannot know who voted for whom. Some will presume the new president garnered the majority of votes from women and African delegates, but such an observation can only be speculative.

With women comprising 43% of IOC members, it is a reasonable assumption this cohort provided a strong support base.

Several candidates proposed quite significant (and in some cases radical) changes, suggesting a vote for Coventry was a nod to keeping the status quo.

Or was it just time to break the hold of male presidents?

The 2024 Paris Olympics were the first games with equal 50-50 men-women participation. The IOC membership has also changed over the past few decades, with growing representation of women. As a result, its long-held reputation as an “old boys’ club” is slowly shifting.

Coventry triumphed despite previous doubts about her domestic political ties, and a limited change agenda that seemed to be mainly a legacy choice for Bach.

In this context, Bach might continue to exert his influence.

Global challenges for the new president

As Olympic Agenda 2020+5 draws to its end, the new president will have the opportunity to set a future-focused strategy.

There are plenty of areas she will need to consider in taking the reins. Here are our top ten:

1. Safeguarding athletes. The provision of safe spaces for sport is an area of global concern as the incidents of athlete harm are brought to light.

2. Environmental, sustainability and global warming issues, such as lack of snow for the winter games, venue rationale, spending on mega events, and lack of bidders for future games.

3. The impact of AI and digital transformation on all aspects of sport, from athlete performance and officiating to governance and management.

4. Bidding processes for future host cities.

5. Transgender athletes and diversity, equity and inclusion considerations.

6. The (Australian-initiated) proposal for the pharmaceutical free-for-all Enhanced Games.

7. Sponsorship changes – longtime sponsors Toyota and Panasonic have dropped out but others have come in, with some from China.

8. Relations with Russia and the United States

9. Athlete advocacy – perhaps giving the athletes more of the financial windfall the Olympics generate.

10. Addition of new sports and culling or dropping existing less popular ones.

What about Australia?

Coventry comes from an impressive swimming background, and this could work to Australia’s advantage.

Although she will step down from her role on the Coordination Committee for the Brisbane Olympics and Paralympics to handle other pressing presidential duties, she will no doubt retain a close link to the third Australian Olympic host city.

The Australian Olympic Commission was quick to congratulate her on her ascension to the IOC presidency.

Coventry knows AOC President Ian Chesterman, a fellow IOC member, so we can expect a close, friendly working relationship between them.

With the Brisbane games only seven years away, the new IOC president will certainly have a strong vested interest in Australia and aspects of the Olympic and Paralympic movement in this part of the world.</p></b>

                <p>Great hammerhead sharks are known for their long migrations, but scientists have now discovered that some individuals in the Bahamas instead spend all year snacking without leaving their plentiful and protected home waters. Why would some individuals take off if others are happy to stay put?

The answer to this mystery might be their favorite foods, researchers report March 21 in Frontiers in Marine Science.

Great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) have been recorded making 3,000-kilometer journeys between Bimini, the Bahamas and offshore Virginia. But tracking tags and tissue samples from hammerheads in Andros, Bahamas, reveal that the country, designated as a shark sanctuary in 2011, could be more than just a part-time haven.

“Resource availability is a key driver,” says shark ecologist Tristan Guttridge, founder of the marine nonprofit Saving the Blue, which does most of its research in Andros. “But why don’t all of them stay if food is so abundant?”

Food choices could influence hammerheads’ travel habits, in the same way that you can be surrounded by pizza joints but still drive across town because all you’re craving is a poke bowl.

Tracking tags and tissue samples from hammerheads in the Bahamas have given researchers a clue to where — and if — these sharks are traveling. Gabby Lozada

From 2018 to 2024, 78 hammerheads were observed or captured. Scientists measured and took tissue samples from 22 of them and put satellite tags on seven. Although some sharks made long-distance migrations away from the Bahamas, as is typical for the species, others stayed in Andros year-round.

When Guttridge and his colleagues analyzed where atoms in the sharks’ tissue came from, they found that different sharks prefer different prey. One hammerhead munched on silky sharks for nearly two-thirds of its meals, while others chowed down on mainly barracuda and stingray.

The different habitats of these fish — silky sharks are largely found in the open ocean while stingrays tend to live on the seabed and barracuda can lurk in both environments — could indicate the types of places where the sharks are feeding. “We found evidence of individual variation in their diets, so deciding whether to stay or go might depend on what they feed on,” Guttridge says.

As these critically endangered animals migrate across immense distances, they can travel into waters where they’re at risk of being harmed or killed by industrial fisheries. “The global population of great hammerheads is thought to have reduced by more than 80 percent over the last three generations,” Guttridge says.

Understanding hammerhead diet preferences may help protect the long-distance travelers. “Although some individuals reside year-round in protected waters, others do not, emphasizing the need for international collaboration on conservation efforts for these mobile species,” Guttridge says.</p></b>

                <p>“Those chemical modifications that decorate [histones] and modify gene expression — they’re metabolites, full stop,” said Finley, the cancer biologist. “Chemical modifications themselves are metabolites, and their removal is dependent on metabolites.”

Fifteen years ago, when Kathryn Wellen was a postdoc studying cancer cells, she discovered that the epigenetic marks on histones change in response to the presence of nutrients. When food is plentiful, mitochondria make a metabolite called acetyl-CoA. It diffuses into the nucleus, where the genome resides, through large pores. There, enzymes break down the metabolites into epigenetic marks known as acetyl groups and place them on histones to activate one set of genes. However, when the cells are starving, enzymes strip off the acetyl groups. Some of those acetyl groups are turned back into acetyl-CoA and consumed for energy, while others are recycled to activate a different set of genes.

Clearly there’s a lot of metabolic activity occurring in the nucleus. Wellen wondered whether the nucleus had its own unique metabolism and could therefore be considered a “metabolic compartment.” Working with Nate Snyder, a biochemist at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Wellen and other researchers developed new methods to measure metabolites in different parts of the cell and saw that metabolic activity in the nucleus is not identical to activity occurring elsewhere.

Kathryn Wellen, who studies metabolism and epigenetics, discovered that the nucleus is a metabolic compartment with unique metabolic activity. Penn Medicine

“Although that may sound obvious, it was not,” Wellen said. The nucleus’s metabolic activity was specific to the functions in that compartment, including epigenetic activity. “There are a lot of metabolic enzymes that are actually in the nucleus and are dynamically regulated in the nucleus,” said Wellen, who now heads a lab at the University of Pennsylvania. “We were really excited to find that.”

This idea of the nucleus as a metabolic compartment was foundational to understanding how metabolism impacts embryonic development. In early embryonic cells, as developmental decisions are made that direct cells to become ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, all of the epigenetic marks on the histones get repositioned. They can be removed, added and relocated to activate certain genes and repress others.

“What is intriguing is that all of this is associated with a massive accumulation of metabolic enzymes in the nucleus,” said Żylicz, the developmental biologist. These enzymes make molecules, which then activate other enzymes that remove epigenetic marks and lay down new ones as cells grow, divide and take on different fates.

During this period, the cell moves many enzymes from the cytoplasm and mitochondria to the nucleus. That way, the metabolites necessary for gene activity can be produced locally, in the nucleus, where they are needed, Żylicz said. “The moment where you reprogram the epigenome — that happens to be the same time when you’re also really using this nucleus as a metabolic compartment.”

Early in human development, the embryo is a ball of cells. The cells on the outside form the placenta; the cells on the inside form the embryo. The major difference between these two types of cells is in the activity of metabolic genes. Recently, Żylicz’s team pinpointed differences between these cells in alpha-ketoglutarate, a well-studied metabolite, and showed that the metabolite accelerated the differentiation of stem cells into cells that will become the placenta.

Alpha-ketoglutarate not only controls differentiation in stem cells; it does the same in cancer cells, Finley’s team and other groups found a few years ago. They were studying p53, a protein that is well known for its anticancer effects; its gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. Their study, published in Nature, found that p53 caused alpha-ketoglutarate to accumulate; this alpha-ketoglutarate altered the fate of the cancer cells so that they were less likely to form tumors. This was striking and unexpected because researchers had assumed that p53 has an anticancer effect by directly regulating the activity of genes. It also works by altering metabolism.

“This is particularly exciting because if changing metabolism can change cell fate in a meaningful way, there is the possibility that you might be able to manipulate that therapeutically, where aberrant decisions of differentiation are causal for the disease — like in many forms of cancer,” said Rutter, who was not involved in the study.

In some ways, this interplay between metabolism and genes is obvious: We know that life is influenced by both its genes and its environment. This new, exciting field of research shows at a molecular level how the materials available to our cells influence their fates, and ours.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>In 2000, a reporter attended a climate conference and wrote in an article for the Dutch alternative magazine Ode that purveyors of nuclear power hailed the energy source as “a ‘safe and clean’ way to generate electricity.” Perhaps, the speakers said, nuclear energy was even the singular solution to climate change.

The reporter framed the meeting’s discussion in the negative, citing evidence that nuclear power has “nothing good to bring to people and nature,” and concluded that “now is the time to bring the nuclear industry down, before it can ruin the twenty-first century.”

Years later, Marco Visscher stumbled across this article while doing research for his recent book “The Power of Nuclear,” which makes a provocative case in favor of nuclear power.

BOOK REVIEW — “The Power of Nuclear,” by Marco Visscher ( Bloomsbury Sigma, 320 pages).

The Ode reporter, it turned out, was himself.

Back in 2000, Visscher writes, he “wanted nothing to do with anything nuclear.” He gradually moderated his stance over time, but it wasn’t until Dutch politicians started talking seriously about nuclear energy in his own country that he conducted the research that caused him to do a full 180. “Just about everything we think we know about nuclear power turns out to be wrong,” he writes, including his former self in that “we.”

In “The Power of Nuclear,” Visscher aims to right those wrongs, offering “the incredible story of a technology that was misunderstood from the beginning,” he writes. “A story of life and death, of hope and fear.”

Today, Visscher finds nuclear power to be “a great miracle” and he wants to convince others of the same. “Throughout society nuclear power is met with deep-rooted suspicion,” he writes. “For many, nuclear has something evil about it, something shady. To these people, there is a mysterious, ominous feel to it, a threat of imminent danger. It’s almost as if the fission of atoms, as in a nuclear reactor, does not belong in this world.”

To show skeptics it does belong, his account systematically lays out reasons why widespread fears and hesitations about atomic energy are misguided, illogical, and propelled by unscientific thinking.

Visscher begins with a bit of history, exploring the origins of atomic oomph in the typically conversational and philosophical style that carries the book. “Scientists discovered this power out of curiosity and developed it further — not to supply energy to society, but to create a brutal military weapon for the world’s most powerful country,” he writes. “What nature had hidden so well, they had uncovered.” He is writing here, of course, about the Manhattan Project that first created nuclear bombs.

“Throughout society nuclear power is met with deep-rooted suspicion,” he writes. “For many, nuclear has something evil about it, something shady.”

It was only after these brutal weapons were created that calmer uses of radioactivity entered society, spurred on by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The “fearful atomic dilemma,” he said in a speech that later came to be called “Atoms for Peace,” was to figure out a “way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.”

That way was nuclear energy generation.

But the atomic reactions that enable nuclear weapons to be weapons are the same ones that make nuclear power powerful, forever connecting the two — in reality and in the collective consciousness. That connection shows up, Visscher points out, in the language of anti-nuclear protests, which he details early in the book and where “No Nukes” meant both bombs and power plants when energy opposition took off in the 1970s and ’80s. “In the nuclear reactor, neutrons split atoms; outside, they split society,” he writes, in one of many pithy distillations that sometimes make his point seem like a propaganda pamphlet — territory the book’s goal of advocacy and its strident language can veer into.

In those early anti-nuclear protests, and general opposition to atomic energy, Visscher sees a divide that remains to this day. Nuclear opponents rely on the limbic system to make their points; proponents rely on statistics and schematics. “They showed their emotions and appealed to those of others,” he writes of the opposition, “while nuclear advocates came across as detached accountants.”

If that is true, “The Power of Nuclear” is only partly successful in humanizing the pro-nuclear lobby. While the book does share stories that call upon the pro-nuclear side’s feelings, its fundamental argument is be logical. If that accountant’s call didn’t bring people and their emotions to favor of nuclear power before, it’s unlikely to work in this book.

But Visscher makes a valiant attempt, in part by looking backward. The second section of the book re-examines the nuclear power industry’s most famous accidents, like the meltdowns at Chernobyl, in the Soviet Union (now Ukraine), and Fukushima, in Japan. The first was caused by design flaws and human error, the second by an earthquake and resulting tsunami.

Visscher narrates these accidents with personal and colorful details, describing, for instance, a propaganda sign at Chernobyl that read, “Let the atom be a worker, not a soldier!” After the initial reaction explosion, he notes, “some thought: the Americans have come.”

Despite the cacophony, the Chernobyl disaster, he says, wasn’t as disastrous as it is in our collective memory, resulting in only dozens of deaths in the short-term and, according to a 2006 report from the United Nations Chernobyl Forum, a few thousand more due to cancer projected to occur during the lifetimes of those alive during the accident. In comparison, other industries have seen far more people killed directly in a single accident.

Similarly, he points out that no one died from the reactor meltdown in Fukushima — though thousands of people did die during the evacuation, and suffered psychological trauma afterward. Among the relocated, for instance, “the children were bullied and excluded; the other children said they were radioactive,” he writes.

A number of misconceptions, Visscher says in the final section of the book, have left nuclear power stifled and sidelined in discussions of climate-change solutions.

In fact, he writes, the non-radioactive effects of the accidents may be worse than the radioactive ones. After all, Visscher points out, we encounter plenty of it naturally in small doses. “Could it be,” he asks, “that radiation is not nearly as terrible as we think?”

But most people are bad at assessing raw risk, he notes. “Basic knowledge of statistical probability changes little, because we humans are selective in how we process information,” he writes. “Even the mind of the smartest person can be held hostage to incorrect assumptions and irrational fears.”

Still, Visscher spends much of the book trying to dispel assumptions and fears with logic and empirical data. Much of the argument, in terms of accidents, hinges on the idea that they’re uncommon and kill few people. Similar arguments, later in the book, apply to nuclear weapons themselves. “Compared to the destruction caused by regular air raids the effects of the atomic bomb were not that special,” he writes “Would it really have been less bad if Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been hit by hundreds of regular bombs?”

But such arguments aren’t likely to win over many readers.

Nevertheless, in following chapters, Visscher develops similar lines of thought, looking at the medical protocols around radioactivity, which are based on the idea that any radiation is harmful and all radiation exposure should be minimized, ideas he claims aren’t very scientific.

Similarly, he writes, nuclear waste — which has inspired some of the most vocal opposition to atomic energy — isn’t as dangerous as it’s treated. He cites energy analyst Rauli Partanen of Finland, who “wonders what message the industry is sending to the public when it ‘packs the waste in several layers of different protective materials, digs a hole that is half-a-kilometer [1,600ft] deep for the waste and fills it with concrete afterwards.’”

“Partanen provides the answer,” the author writes: “Who in their right mind would believe that the waste is anything but the most dangerous and deadly stuff on the planet?”

These kinds of misconceptions, Visscher says in the final section of the book, have left nuclear power stifled and sidelined in discussions of climate-change solutions.

But things may be turning around, he argues. “It is too early to say that nuclear power is on the rise,” he writes. “Between 2000 and 2023, a total of 117 nuclear reactors were connected to the grid. However, in the same years, 121 have been permanently shut down.”

“The problems with nuclear power have nothing to do with technology. The problems are between the ears.”

And Visscher does find himself in increasingly popular company, as other thinkers and doers — including the likes of Bill Gates — bring nuclear back to the climate-solution table, and as startups get big money to try to make fusion energy happen.

That’s one innovation, but nuclear power researchers have also been focusing on so-called advanced reactors — a general term for many new nuclear technologies, which includes smaller reactors that use thorium instead of uranium. But Visscher maintains that the pivot to novelty is actually also a reaction to preconceived notions about nuclear danger, and the bad reputations of the old reactor designs. “Why is there so much focus on innovation, really?” he writes. “Nuclear plants have a pretty good track record. The problems with nuclear power have nothing to do with technology. The problems are between the ears.”

That may be true, but what’s between the ears is important, even if its gears sometimes turn illogically. Revamping nuclear power’s reputation may take more than just informing readers that they’re wrong.</p></b>
