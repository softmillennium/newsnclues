Expert panel</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 18:14:50 <p>
The closure has caused chaos, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. More than 1,300 flights have been affected, according to the plane tracking website Flightradar24. (Elements of this panel were sourced by the Science Media Centre, which published a version here.) Barry Hayes, associate professor in electrical power systems, University College Cork Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, the local electricity distributor, said 67,000 homes and businesses in the area were cut off overnight as a result of this issue. While the North Hyde substation is a very important part of the west London electricity grid, it is generally not expected that this would cause such a big impact at Heathrow airport. There are also dedicated supplies to other parts of the airport site. Typically, a critical electricity load such as Heathrow would be served from multiple supply points in the electricity grid, and therefore there would be an option to feed the loads at Heathrow from an alternative supply point. There are some reports that parts of the airport (for example, Terminal 5) have power. The exact reasons for such a big impact are unclear at this point, but we do know the North Hyde substation is in a highly constrained area of the UK electricity grid – an area where there has been “a steep increase in the number of new electricity connection requests across west London, driven by new housing developments, commercial investment and datacentres”. These issues may be a factor in the power outage affecting Heathrow. However, it will take some time before the exact causes of this incident are established. Weather, ageing equipment or malicious attacks could be to blame Chenghong Gu, professor in smart energy systems, University of Bath There are also many automatic devices in substations like this one to deal with faults. A substation has many components including transformers, circuit breakers, an isolator, busbars and measuring equipment. There is insulation oil in them and in high-temperature, high-pressure situations, they can explode – meaning the insulation oil leaks and can catch fire. However, it is very unusual for big substations like this to catch fire. The insulation gas can degrade, which could cause an explosion inside a transformer. Other possible causes include a malicious attack on the substation – someone setting fire to it deliberately, for example. Cyber-attacks on IT systems can also cause a malfunction of devices in the substation, leading to fire. Who is responsible for the power management, and what intervention strategies were attempted? Whereas Plan B will usually only supply a fraction of the power – maybe 50% or 30%. Paul Cuffe, assistant professor, School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin I would hope the traffic control tower and runway lights weren’t totally plunged into darkness! But one could argue that a critical piece of national infrastructure like Heathrow deserves special grid connection arrangements to secure its supply of electricity further. For instance, sometimes critical loads like this are fed from two separate substations to provide redundancy when outages happen. It is ultimately a political and economic question to determine the right level of capital investment into grid infrastructure to avoid the problems that outages like this cause. Redundant power supplies for an airport the size of Heathrow do not come free. Climate change means the grid will face more threats like this Hayley J. Fowler, professor of climate change impacts; Colin Manning, postdoctoral research associate in climate science; and Sean Wilkinson, professor of structural engineering, Newcastle University This is only becoming more important as demand for electricity increases, thanks to transport and domestic heating switching to lower-carbon electrified alternatives – notably electric cars and heat pumps. Yet the UK’s energy system is facing growing threats from unprecedented risks. We still don’t know what caused the Heathrow fire, but it appears to be unusual in this regard, as threats to energy systems come mainly from extreme weather. It is crucial to ensure the energy network can handle this weather.

Similar warnings about unsustainable welfare payments can be heard in other countries struggling with the rising costs of social security, state pensions and subsidised healthcare. All of these social security funds collect contributions from the people enrolled in them, and pay out to those who retire or cannot work. In some cases, their solvency can be calculated using projections of future claims, employment levels and demographic trends. On present predictions, for example, the US social security fund will “go broke” between 2033 and 2035. Put simply, if more working-age people take jobs and stay in them for longer, there will be extra funds available for those who genuinely cannot work or need additional income. So, underlying the government’s stated motive of providing opportunities for people with sickness or disabilities is the Treasury’s agenda – of boosting economic growth while borrowing and spending less. There is evidence, for example, of a genuine worsening of young people’s (especially mental) health, which could be further damaged by a forced move into inappropriate employment. The proportion who do so has stayed steady at around one in six. A rapid rise in benefit claims from younger people is one motivation for the reform plans. But they are likely to boost Pip claims by making it the basis of universal credit eligibility. Past efforts to move more people into work by restricting benefits have often hurt those who lose them, without expanding the available workforce in areas that employers most need. It’s true that present arrangements leave some claimants in a “poverty trap”, where they are effectively penalised for getting a job or promotion, because the loss of means-tested benefits exceeds any gain in income. OBR projections assume that hourly productivity growth will average 1.1% from 2025 to 2029, but it was zero in 2023-24. And there is no sign of any pick-up in the vital investment or innovation that might actually deliver this. Output per UK worker has dropped since 2022, falling back to 2019 levels. And UK productivity growth since 2010 has been significantly slower than in the US, Germany or France. But current fiscal problems stem from the slow growth of private sector productivity. Compelling more people to work – especially when in fragile health – could erode this even further.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Aardvark Weather generates forecasts more quickly and with less computing power than existing forecasting systems. A new artificial intelligence (AI)-driven weather prediction system could transform forecasting, researchers predict Current weather forecasts are generated by inputting data into complex physics models, a multi-stage process that requires several hours on a dedicated supercomputer . Related: Google builds an AI model that can predict future weather catastrophes The team compared Aardvark's performance to existing forecasting systems that generate global predictions. However, Aardvark's spatial resolution is somewhat lower than those of current forecasting systems, which could make its initial predictions less relevant for hyper-local weather forecasting. However, the researchers also said that because the AI learns from the data it is fed, it could be tailored to predict weather in specific arenas — such as temperatures for African agriculture or wind speeds for renewable energy in Europe. Aardvark can incorporate higher-resolution regional data, where they exist, to refine local forecasts. "This end-to-end learning approach can be easily applied to other weather forecasting problems, for example hurricanes, wildfires, and tornadoes. Beyond weather, its applications extend to broader Earth system forecasting, including air quality, ocean dynamics, and sea ice prediction."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

More than 1,300 flights have been suspended and thousands of passengers left stranded. Substations take high-voltage electricity from pylons and transform it into the lower voltages you use at home. This happens in a transformer filled with oil to insulate the electricity. This is only becoming more important as demand for electricity increases, thanks to transport and domestic heating switching to lower-carbon electrified alternatives – notably electric cars and heat pumps. Yet the UK’s energy system is facing growing threats from unprecedented risks. We still don’t know what caused the Heathrow fire, but it appears to be unusual in this regard, as threats to energy systems come mainly from extreme weather. It is crucial to ensure the energy network can handle this weather. We then used high-resolution climate simulations to assess how these hazards would change in a worst-case scenario, where the world keeps emitting greenhouse gases as usual. Hot spells: Extreme heat of 35°C or more, once rare, could happen every other year by the 2060s. Flooding: Higher-intensity rainfall, particularly in winter, will increase the risk of flooded substations and gas pressure reduction stations. This worst-case emissions scenario probably won’t happen, as the world is currently on a better trajectory. We propose several strategies to make UK energy infrastructure more resilient. Importantly, energy operators, policymakers and regulators should adopt a system-wide approach, as failures in one area can cascade across the entire network and affect other critical infrastructure. Our report promotes adaptation measures that are currently available and will be beneficial regardless of future climate changes. This might involve building flood defences around substations or raising them off the ground, undergrounding critical overhead lines, and protecting infrastructure vulnerable to falling trees blown over during windstorms. And we could further encourage off-peak energy use, to ease grid stress during extreme weather. To build a resilient UK energy network, we need better tools to quantify and simulate climate risks, ensuring decision-making is based on robust scientific evidence. While guidelines such as ETR 138 exist for flood resilience, there is a lack of equivalent standards for other climate hazards such as windstorms or extreme heat. The UK’s transition to net zero emissions should consider climate resilience as a priority. Investments in renewable energy infrastructure, battery storage and smart grids should incorporate resilience assessments from the outset. We should also consider providing generators or other ways to produce energy at highly vulnerable locations where it is of critical need, including hospitals and airports such as Heathrow. We’re part of a project that has begun to do this for transport. But resilience strategies should be extended to consider risks from climate, cyber-attacks, asset failures and extreme energy demand. By acting now, we can safeguard the UK’s energy networks against unprecedented extreme weather and ensure a secure, reliable and sustainable energy system for generations to come.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/simple-blood-tests-could-be-the-future-of-cancer-diagnosis'>Simple blood tests could be the future of cancer diagnosis</a></h2><b>Source:</b> livescience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 16:00:10 <p>
Scientists have developed new blood tests that can detect early chemical signatures of cancer. For diseases like pancreatic cancer, that could lead to earlier diagnosis and a better prognosis. Around four years ago, now 77-year-old John Gormly went for what was supposed to be a routine blood test. "I thought [my doctor] was wrong," Gormly, CEO of a construction company near Newport Beach, California, told Live Science. Our stories highlight trends in different fields, how new research is changing old ideas, and how the picture of the world we live in is being transformed thanks to science. An early version of Guardant Health's Shield test has been commercially available since 2022, but it wasn't covered by insurance. Shield is only a blood drop in an ocean of emerging "liquid biopsies." Scientists have developed blood tests for several cancers, including those of the breast , pancreas and stomach . If these liquid biopsies can be rolled out widely, they could help detect cancer earlier, more easily, or with fewer invasive measures — which, in turn, could lead to earlier detection and fewer cancer deaths. But many of these tests are still in their early stages. They often detect a lower fraction of cancer cases than gold-standard screening tools like colonoscopies do, meaning they will likely supplement, rather than replace, traditional screening methods. These include traditional biopsies, which involve removing tissue samples via needles or surgery. And for some diseases, it's not clear that early diagnosis on a blood test will lead to better outcomes. However, as these kinks are ironed out, it's likely that blood-based cancer screening will become a normal part of our medical care — one that has the potential to improve cancer outcomes dramatically, experts say. John Gormly went in for a routine blood test and learned he likely had colon cancer. After follow-up diagnostic tests and a relatively simple surgery to remove the cancer, he is now in remission. Experts have argued that early detection could eliminate 90% of colon cancer deaths . It typically takes around 10 years for early, precancerous growths like polyps to morph into deadly cancer cells, and if these cells are caught early, they can easily be removed. Despite the potential for early diagnosis and cure, many people avoid these screenings. People avoid screenings for many reasons, said Dr. William Grady , a professor of translational science and therapeutics at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle who helped lead the Shield trials. Some people feel embarrassed during screenings such as colonoscopy or fear that it may be painful, he told Live Science. "That's why there's an opportunity for blood tests that is really powerful because people are inclined to do blood tests; they're convenient and can be done during a health care encounter," Grady said. However, it could expand the number of screening options available to patients, he added. This additional option may improve screening compliance, which could lead to earlier disease detection and thus a reduction in colon cancer deaths. The Shield test is approved for use every three years, Grady said. By Stage 4, when it has spread throughout the body, those odds go down to just 10%. "That could have been the end of me, so it [Shield] definitely changed my life," Gormly said. Pancreatic cancer is another disease that could benefit from a blood-based diagnostic test. There is no broad-based screening program in the U.S. for people at average risk of pancreatic cancer. Later stages of the disease are easily detectable via MRI or CT scan , Goel told Live Science. It aims to detect early-stage pancreatic cancer by identifying small cancer-specific molecules called microRNAs. When combined with CA-19 detection, the new test had a 5% to 10% false positive rate, Goel said. "If you can find more and more of these cancers early on, there is a hope that many of these patients can be cured," Goel said. However, in those who have a family history of pancreatic cancer, it may make sense to test more frequently — perhaps every six months, Goel said. Scientists are also developing multicancer detection (MCD) tests that screen for many types of cancer at once. Some MCD tests sample urine or another bodily fluid in addition to blood. In theory, such tests could not only provide a less-invasive approach to screening but also reduce the number of tests a person has to take at once. The ones that are farther along, such as Grail's Galleri and Exact Sciences' Cancerguard , have not received FDA approval yet. And some experts have argued that the tests' efficacy claims are overhyped . Even if MCD tests do work and they become more affordable (Galleri, for example, currently costs around $950), experts still aren't sure of the best way to use them. "There's this belief that if we could only detect all cancers early, we would solve the cancer problem," Ruth Etzioni , a professor at Fred Hutchinson who was not involved in Grady's work with Shield, told Live Science. But sometimes there is no good treatment for early cancers, so catching them ahead doesn't necessarily lead to improved outcomes. After taking an MCD test, patients may wait up to six months to know one way or the other, Dr. Jennifer Croswell , a medical officer at the National Cancer Institute, told Live Science. There may be many reasons for this delay, including that it takes time to perform multiple rounds of follow-up testing to figure out which organ is affected, she said. There are also currently no evidence-based clinical guidelines that tell doctors the best way to follow up on positive results from MCD tests, Croswell said. While many diagnostic blood tests for cancer are still in the pipeline, at least some of these tests will likely affect diagnosis and treatment in the next several years. For instance, Goel and colleagues are now running a clinical trial to see if their test can detect early-stage pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals who have not yet been diagnosed. "I think if things go well, we foresee that probably in the next two to four years, this test should be on the marketplace to be used for early detection of pancreatic cancer worldwide," Goel said. Meanwhile, Grady's team is planning to investigate whether Shield helps get more people screened for colon cancer who are often missed, such as underrepresented minority groups or those who live in areas with restricted health care access. He hopes his experiences help others who may be tempted to skip colon cancer screening.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hundreds of measles infections have been reported in the U.S. so far this year. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , 301 people in the U.S. have had confirmed measles infections this year, as of March 13. Kids under 5 years old account for 34% of the confirmed measles cases, with a further 42% affecting children and teens ages 5 to 19. There has been one confirmed death related to the outbreaks, and a second remains under investigation. The second deadly case was reported in a New Mexico resident by local health authorities, but the CDC has yet to conclude its own investigation of the case, which would help confirm its connection to ongoing outbreaks. Related: US measles outbreak tops 300 cases — what to know about the disease Additionally, most of the infections have been reported in Texas, with data from the Texas Department of State Health Services showing that 279 measles cases were identified between late January and March 18. For instance, data suggest that around 18% of school-age children in Gaines County have been exempted from at least one vaccine, and 191 measles cases have occurred in that county so far.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors (For measles protection, the MMR vaccine is generally recommended over the MMRV vaccine, because it's less likely to trigger fevers in children . For those who get the MMR shot, a separate vaccine is recommended to protect against chickenpox (varicella).) Unvaccinated older children and adults are also advised to receive two doses of a measles vaccine, at least 28 days apart. Measles is not yet "eradicated" worldwide, meaning it still spreads regularly in other countries and can be imported to the U.S. The MMR vaccine provides long-lasting measles protection for most people, with immunity typically being lifelong after two doses, according to the CDC . "Like with COVID vaccines, antibody levels do reduce over time," Dr. Peter Chin-Hong , a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science via email. Antibodies are protective immune proteins that appear in the days and weeks after a person receives a vaccine, but these proteins are expected to disappear over time. "However there is likely continued immunity with memory immune cells that can be activated as needed (as we have seen in COVID vaccines)," Chin-Hong added. "In general, protection once immunized against measles, wanes very little," Chin-Hong said. Many studies find that measles infections induce a kind of "immune amnesia," in which memory cells tasked with remembering pathogens are lost and the body is unable to rev up its antibody responses, as it used to. This leaves a person at increased risk of other infections for years following their brush with measles. Other complications of measles infection include a rare but deadly central nervous system condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) , which can develop seven to 10 years after the infection. Some people can also experience brain swelling (encephalitis) during a measles infection , which can cause convulsions, permanent hearing loss and intellectual disability. If someone is still unsure whether they've either been vaccinated or had the disease, there's a test that checks for measles-specific antibodies in your blood. The type of measles antibody it screens for belongs to a broad class called immunoglobulin G (IgG), which protects the body from infection by binding to pathogens. "You can check an antibody level with the help of a health care provider," Chin-Hong said. However, the test will not pick up memory cells, Chin-Hong said, so it could miss that additional layer of evidence that you're immune to measles. Should anyone get a booster for measles, if they've been fully vaccinated in the past? If a person is unsure about how protected they are against measles, they can get a booster shot of the vaccine to bolster their immunity. "It is perfectly safe to have another dose," Head said. "The recommendation to get an extra dose will typically come from public health teams, and it's always best to see the advice of a healthcare worker if anyone is unsure." If someone has had two doses of the measles vaccine in their lifetime, there is likely no need for a booster shot. Many people who received the old vaccine lost their immunity within a few years, leaving them vulnerable to measles later in life. In addition to people who received only this old vaccine, anyone who has gotten only one dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine is recommended to get the recommended second dose. The CDC started recommending two doses of the MMR shot in 1989 , Chin-Hong noted, so those vaccinated before that time may need a second dose. Individuals traveling to areas experiencing measles outbreaks, including within the U.S., can also consider getting another dose even if they're fully vaccinated, Chin-Hong said. Additionally, health care workers, immunocompromised people and those who live with them, and college students should check their vaccination records to confirm they've received two MMR doses, and perhaps get an immunity test if they are unsure, Chin-Hong suggested. Individuals can speak with their health care provider about getting a booster shot, if they're interested in receiving one. Fully vaccinated people may still catch measles, but only in rare circumstances. These "breakthrough" cases become more likely in the context of large outbreaks or high-exposure settings — when an individual has prolonged, close contact with an infected person. Additionally, people with weakened immune systems — due to medical conditions or medications — might not maintain full protection, even if they're fully vaccinated. So they can be more prone to breakthrough cases. In the current Texas outbreak, there were a "handful" of people who contracted measles after having only one shot," Chin-Hong noted. In a study that looked at measles cases in California between 2000 and 2015, most of those infected were unvaccinated, but 11% of the total cases were among people who had gotten two doses of measles vaccine. The fully vaccinated group did have milder disease, however. Reaching this collective level of immunity protects even those who can't be vaccinated , such as newborn babies, pregnant people or immunocompromised people. "Measles is so infectious, with very high levels of transmission. Typically, we refer to 95% coverage as the magic number of that 'herd immunity threshold,'" Head told Live Science. MMR coverage among U.S. kindergartners has declined in recent years, according to the CDC. Several states — including Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia and Florida — had less than 90% coverage during the 2023-2024 school year.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

What is prompting so many Europeans to turn away from a political system that has successfully rebuilt the continent after the second world war and transformed it into the world’s most prosperous single market? The reasons are manifold, ranging from economic crises and rising inequality to the negative impact of social media on political behaviour and breaches of democratic norms by elites. Every week, we bring you informed analysis of developments in government and fact check the claims being made. Sign up for our weekly politics newsletter, delivered every Friday. The pain, pleasure, rewards, losses, information and knowledge that arise from living through events help us evaluate our past actions and inform future ones. Mapping people’s experiences – especially in response to life’s risks – can illuminate otherwise perplexing risky behaviour such as people building homes on flood plains, in regions with high seismic risk or at the foot of an active volcano. The last violent eruption of Vesuvius, Europe’s “ticking time bomb”, occurred 81 years ago. To comprehend this complacency in the face of possible Armageddon, one must analyse individual and collective experience with the risk in question. Most residents in the red zone have never personally experienced Mount Vesuvius erupting. Numerous psychological experiments have confirmed how this everyday behaviour can emerge. Our experience tends to underweight and underestimate the likelihood and impact of rare events for the very reason that they are rare. People in western Europe have experienced democracy and growing prosperity for more than 70 years. They have been spared, up to now, the experience of autocratic takeovers and therefore may underestimate the risk of democratic collapse. This is a phenomenon akin to the paradox of disease prevention, where the success of preventive measures such as childhood vaccinations may undermine their perceived need, thus increasing complacency and vaccine hesitancy. As history has shown, democracies do not suddenly go up in flames. But when repeated breaches of democratic norms by political elites are tolerated, when rhetorical transgressions escalate, and when a deluge of lies and manipulative claims becomes “normal”, then the public’s failure to punish the early signs of such behaviour at the ballot box may have drastic consequences. In the same way that a nuclear power plant may appear to be operating safely until the last safety valve is broken, democracies can appear stable right up until they flip into autocracy. For instance, disaster training centres in Japan simulate the experience of the visceral dimensions of an earthquake and its swift temporal dynamic in a way that even the most graphic warnings cannot. Similarly, people can gain insight into what it meant to be a political prisoner by visiting places like the former Stasi prison Hohenschönhausen in Berlin, especially when the guide is a former inmate. There are numerous other ways to emulate the experience of oppression and authoritarianism, thereby informing those who have been fortunate enough never to endure it. The seemingly persistent non-occurrences of risky events can be seductive and misleading. We can also use the positive power of experience to protect and appreciate our democratic systems.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Yellowstone bison were nearly driven to extinction in the late 19th century as a result of commercial hunting. Bison in Yellowstone National Park spent over 100 years as two genetically distinct herds. But now they're roaming as one interbreeding population, a new study suggests. Park managers tried several methods to help conserve Yellowstone’s bison, halting poaching and even introducing a new herd to the region. Later genetic analyses showed that descendants of this introduced group remained genetically distinct from the native bison — until now.

(Image credit: Heather Barker) Celestron Labs’ CB2000C is sturdily constructed with a robust metal body, four high-quality objective lenses and third eyepiece tube. The solid, wide base gave a confident sturdiness to this microscope. Coupled with high-quality materials such as a metal body and glass optics, this machine felt reassuringly robust. At 5.5 kg (12lbs), it is one of the heavier student microscopes, but has a strong carry handle and is unlikely to be used by small children. Secondary viewer capability has been made possible by attaching a third eyepiece tube to the head. Trinocular viewing allowed us to observe the specimens ocularly, in real time. To deal with the change in light intensity that comes with a trinocular microscope, Celestron Labs has designed a binocular to trinocular button, so that the trinocular eyepiece tube is not illuminated when not in use. Thus, optimum illumination can be achieved through the binocular eyepieces. Additionally, as the light pathway moves independently through each binocular eyepiece, stereo images are observed. We were impressed to find that the CB2000C by Celestron Labs has been designed with numerous features that mechanically and optically improve the quality of images possible with a mid-range microscope and help it to live up to its ‘Advanced’ title. As the binocular eyepieces came in 10X and 20X, we achieved a range of magnification from 40X to 2000X, resulting in a design that could be used to view specimens from whole insects all the way down to organelles inside body cells. The XY mechanical stage had a decent movement, 140 mm x 140 mm, and was smooth and easy to maneuver, making slide navigation a pleasure. Image 1 of 1 XY slide navigation, a sturdy slide clip, rough and fine focusing knobs and four objective lenses help to give this microscope a professional feel. Lastly, the CB2000C has multiple ways in which luminosity can be altered. The halogen illuminator is adjustable, so can be dimmed or made brighter where necessary. Some viewers also experience reduced eye strain with a blue filter. Finally, this Celestron Labs Microscope comes with three filters to enhance images. Overall, we were impressed with the amount of advanced features that have been deployed to ensure the Celestron Labs Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope feels professional and worth its mid-range price tag.

Each binocular eyepiece can be further adjusted with its diopter. Having an abundance of advanced mechanical, technical and optical features and bearing the Celestron name, we anticipated a high-performing precision instrument when reviewing the CB2000C. While the high-quality glass optics, range of lenses and illumination options did deliver in terms of stereo images with high resolution and high power magnification, it was hugely frustrating that a number of quality control issues made using the microscope annoying and less pleasurable. Some more economic stereo microscopes give three-dimensional images at the expense of magnification. The CB2000C model, by Celestron Labs, showed superb layering of spirogyra algae at low magnification. The blue filter helped to reduce some visual graininess seen at magnifications of 400X and above. Image 1 of 1 Celestron Labs’ Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope has a wealth of mechanical adjustments to increase its performance: an adjustable height condenser, XY slide navigation, rough and fine focusing knobs, an adjustable diaphragm and a swing-out filter holder. The main downside to this particular microscope was with quality control. We managed to reduce this distance by activating the stage height restriction switch, but it was still noticeable enough to impair focusing and affect clarity. Although we could still achieve focus and test functionality, by keeping hold of the rough focusing knob, doing so limited the amount of freedom we had to perform multiple operations. It is also essential for focus to be held while two-handed tasks such as changing a slide, filter or lenses are carred out. Image 1 of 1 Celestron Labs’ Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope has a wealth of mechanical adjustments to increase its performance: an adjustable height condenser, XY slide navigation, rough and fine focusing knobs, an adjustable diaphragm and a swing-out filter holder. It is also worth mentioning that the CB2000C, by Celestron Labs, needed setting up before use: it is not supplied ready for use. On the plus side, detailed instructions for this set-up process were included in the user manual, in multiple languages, and were simple to follow. Tutors can view a pupil’s specimen while in use, without disturbing them. We found this hugely beneficial when pointing out cheek cells, subcellular structures and insect anatomy. Note that the trinocular eyepiece lens will always be a different magnification to the binocular eyepiece lenses because there are only two of each type. This will affect both the resolution and field of view observed by each viewer. Although this made stereo viewing impossible, it was great for collaborative work. Light could pinpoint the specimen using a small diaphragm aperture. To minimise the risk of lens damage, Celestron Labs has added a height restriction knob. This is particularly good for preventing damage to longer, high-power lenses. Perhaps this is another quality control issue, rather than being intentional. Whatever the reason, it would be better if this did not happen. We were sometimes frustrated by quality control issues but could see beyond these, to agree that the CB2000C has a lot of potential as a trinocular biological microscope with multiple advanced features. We recommend the Celestron Labs Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope for use in professional or teaching laboratories, for budding microbiologists with a little experience. Buy it if: ✅ You want to upgrade to a mid-range microscope: The XY navigation, choice of illumination and quadruple nosepiece offer intermediate users a more professional and robust optical instrument. Don't buy it if: ❌ You would like to examine solid specimens: There is no top light option with the CB2000C Advanced Biological Microscope. ❌ You have impaired sight in one eye: The stereo viewing capacity depends on ocular information from both eyes. The Celestron Labs Advanced Biological Trinocular Microscope has a wealth of functions that will give an experienced user the opportunity to manipulate minute details of their optical images, and to view clear, highly magnified biological specimens. We recommend this mid-range microscope for home, school or laboratory use, for research or teaching purposes, if you desire a stereo image. For a binocular compound microscope, the CB1000CF by Celestron Labs is ideal if you do not need stereo viewing. During an adult learning session, the microscope was constructed and set up. Users learned how to create and view slides of their own cheek cells, as well as leaf peels from a variety of different plants; to observe stomata distribution. Collaborative viewing and discussion was possible due to the trinocular eyepiece tube.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It made these cuts at a time when the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Belgium and other wealthy countries are slashing their own aid spending. Judges have ruled that the U.S. government must rehire aid workers and make overdue payments for aid already delivered by nongovernmental organizations, international agencies and private contractors. While legal disputes wend through the courts, these cuts are already having disastrous consequences for people in Afghanistan, Sudan and other places facing crises. As scholars who study humanitarian aid, we are seeing not just a crisis of funding but also one that jeopardizes the credibility of the entire global system that provides this lifesaving assistance. When conflict breaks out or a disaster like an earthquake strikes, people require emergency medical care, temporary shelter, food and water. In countries where the government is unable or unwilling to provide these services, humanitarian organizations and international agencies step in to fill the gaps. Humanitarian aid is based on empathy and the recognition that everyone has a right to live with dignity. Sen. Chris Coons, a Connecticut Democrat, has warned that China will benefit from the U.S. aid cutoff. “Our biggest global competitor and adversary is delighted that we’ve handed them an opportunity to say to communities and countries around the world that we are not a reliable partner,” Coons said. By highlighting geopolitical, security and economic arguments for humanitarian aid, in our view, they risk further hurting the sector’s legitimacy. While needs have increased, humanitarian funding has been flat or declining for years, leaving millions of people who need food, health care, shelter and protection without the assistance they need. Until January 2025, the U.S. accounted for 35%-46% of total annual global humanitarian funding. Without U.S. funding, the humanitarian work of the United Nations agencies and NGOs that deliver humanitarian aid in part funded by governments is in jeopardy. Humanitarian groups have historically embraced a set of core principles that emphasize the alleviation of human suffering wherever it may occur while remaining independent, neutral and impartial. In conflict zones, these principles are essential for gaining access to people who need help. Focusing on what benefits donor countries instead of what serves humanitarian needs in areas experiencing famine, disasters or conflicts is at odds with these principles. However, in January, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that U.S. interests would decide how aid is allocated. Since late January, the Trump administration has cut 83% of USAID’s programs, according to recent reports. In March, the State Department sent a questionnaire to nongovernmental organizations and U.N. agencies asking how they will conform to President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy and distribute aid in alignment with foreign policy goals. Governments always consider their own interests as one factor when making decisions about humanitarian aid. “This investment pays dividends by preventing humanitarian crises, containing disease outbreaks, and countering adversarial influence in vulnerable regions,” stated InterAction, an association of U.S.-based NGOs that distribute humanitarian aid and development assistance. “That’s why foreign aid has maintained decades of support across party lines — it is vital for U.S. security and international stability.” We also see in these comments signs that justifications for aid are changing. Even still, he acknowledged that NGOs required independence from government to do their essential work. Humanitarian organizations are grappling with the financial and operational consequences of their reliance on a small number of donor governments that have cut off or cut back aid. This option would likely mean operating on an even smaller budget at a time when needs are increasing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

According to the Mood of the Nation Poll by researchers at Penn State, 9 in 10 Americans can name a recent news event or something about American politics that made them angry. Political scientists Steven Webster, Elizabeth Connors and I have investigated what happens to people’s social networks – their friends, family and neighbors – when partisan anger takes over. For example, suppose your neighbor is a member of the opposite political party. You’ve always watered their plants when they go on vacation. Given the news these days and how angry you’re feeling, what will you say when they ask for help during their next trip? That can include not assisting neighbors with various tasks, avoiding social gatherings attended by people from the other side, and refusing to date people who vote differently. It means being disappointed if your son or daughter marries a supporter of the opposing party, and even severing close friendships or distancing yourself from close relatives. The more we isolate ourselves from people who see things differently, the easier it is to misunderstand them, pushing us to separate even more. First, we wanted to establish each side’s actual views. Our 2012-2016 study asked around 1,300 Americans whether they agreed with statements that are often associated with one party or the other – including creationism, guns, taxes and eco-friendliness. Two months later, we went back to the same voters and asked them a different question: What percentage of Democrats and Republicans did they think would agree with these statements? For example, only 19% of Democrats agreed that all Americans should pay more taxes, but more than 80% of Republicans believed the percentage to be higher. Americans do not understand each other across the red-blue divide. Importantly, respondents with more ideologically extreme views themselves had less accurate perceptions of the other party. Or suppose you are a Democrat, and you learn that your Republican neighbors believe that humans and dinosaurs walked the Earth at the same time, that elementary school students should be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, and that a fence should be built between the U.S. and Mexico. Specifically, according to our 2023 study, they reported not wanting to become friends, not having this neighbor over for a family meal, and not feeling comfortable allowing their children to play with the neighbor’s kids, among other activities. Stereotypes don’t just drive individual people and families apart; they make neighborhoods less cohesive. Cutting off those in-person relationships isn’t just a problem for safety and friendliness around the block. It’s a problem for democracy because Americans need relationships with people whose politics are different than their own. A majority of Americans have social circles that are politically homogeneous. In her book “Through the Grapevine,” political scientist Taylor Carlson documents that approximately 1 in 3 American voters mostly learn about politics from socially transmitted information: news they get from talking with friends or scrolling on social media. Relying on these sources is particularly problematic in social networks that are homogeneous, as exposure to information from someone in your own party can lead people to have more extreme positions. In my own book “The Social Citizen,” I investigated the influence peers have on political decisions, from voting and donating to identifying with a political party. Indeed, after a brutal election tested their friendship, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did not exchange letters for 11 years. But the pair resumed their correspondence in 1812 with Adams’ statement – later echoed by Jefferson – “You and I, ought not to die, before We have explained ourselves to each other.” Democracy challenges us to participate in more ways than simply by voting. It challenges everyone to understand those around us and seek what is in the collective best interest. And we have the most influence over people in our social networks. So that friend you’re really angry with about their politics?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

When companies advertise job openings, they often use buzzwords like “ambitious” and “self-reliant” to describe their ideal candidate. These traits sound appealing — what hiring manager wouldn’t want a driven employee? In my latest study, published in the journal Management Science with co-authors Scott Jackson and Nick Seybert, I found that these terms may attract job applicants with more narcissistic tendencies. For example, narcissists tend to see themselves as highly creative and persuasive. Prior research also shows that narcissistic employees are more innovative and willing to take risks to get the success and admiration they crave, even if it means bending the rules. Based on these observations, we compiled two sets of terms commonly used in job postings. We also found that recruiters are more likely to use rule-bender terms when hiring for highly innovative, high-growth companies. For accounting positions, recruiters are more likely to use such terms when aggressive financial reporting could benefit the firm. Companies write job postings carefully in hopes of attracting the ideal candidate. A significant amount of research examines how accounting managers sometimes bend rules or massage the numbers to achieve earnings targets. This “earnings management” can misrepresent the company’s true financial position. Our current findings shed light on the importance of carefully crafting job posting language. If companies are concerned about hiring narcissists, they may want to clearly communicate their ethical values and needs while crafting a job posting, or avoid rule-bender language entirely. Rule-bending could happen due to attracting and hiring more narcissistic candidates, or it could be because of a company’s culture – or a combination of both.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/what-are-ai-hallucinations-why-ais-sometimes-make-things-up-242896'>What are AI hallucinations? Why AIs sometimes make things up</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 12:54:00 <p>
When someone sees something that isn’t there, people often refer to the experience as a hallucination. Hallucinations occur when your sensory perception does not correspond to external stimuli. Researchers have found these behaviors in different types of AI systems, from chatbots such as ChatGPT to image generators such as Dall-E to autonomous vehicles. We are information science researchers who have studied hallucinations in AI speech recognition systems. Wherever AI systems are used in daily life, their hallucinations can pose risks. Hallucinations and their effects depend on the type of AI system. With large language models – the underlying technology of AI chatbots – hallucinations are pieces of information that sound convincing but are incorrect, made up or irrelevant. With AI tools that can recognize objects in images, hallucinations occur when the AI generates captions that are not faithful to the provided image. This inaccurate information could lead to different consequences in contexts where accuracy is critical. The system develops methods for responding to questions or performing tasks based on those patterns. Supply an AI system with 1,000 photos of different breeds of dogs, labeled accordingly, and the system will soon learn to detect the difference between a poodle and a golden retriever. Hallucinations often occur when the model fills in gaps based on similar contexts from its training data, or when it is built using biased or incomplete training data. Hallucinations, on the other hand, occur when an AI system is asked to provide factual information or perform specific tasks but instead generates incorrect or misleading content while presenting it as accurate. The key difference lies in the context and purpose: Creativity is appropriate for artistic tasks, while hallucinations are problematic when accuracy and reliability are required. The impact of an output such as calling a blueberry muffin a chihuahua may seem trivial, but consider the different kinds of technologies that use image recognition systems: An autonomous vehicle that fails to identify objects could lead to a fatal traffic accident. An autonomous military drone that misidentifies a target could put civilians’ lives in danger. This is more likely to occur in noisy environments, where an AI system may end up adding new or irrelevant words in an attempt to decipher background noise such as a passing truck or a crying infant. As these systems become more regularly integrated into health care, social service and legal settings, hallucinations in automatic speech recognition could lead to inaccurate clinical or legal outcomes that harm patients, criminal defendants or families in need of social support. Regardless of AI companies’ efforts to mitigate hallucinations, users should stay vigilant and question AI outputs, especially when they are used in contexts that require precision and accuracy. Double-checking AI-generated information with trusted sources, consulting experts when necessary, and recognizing the limitations of these tools are essential steps for minimizing their risks.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In online communities, replies, likes and comments between users form a network of interactions. My colleagues Nicholas Berente and Hani Safadi and I analyzed the network structure of communities on Reddit, called subreddits, that had seen increased use of bots from 2005 to 2019. Reflexive bots are coded to plug into a community’s application programming interface. This means that the reflexive bots posting content enable people to find novel content and engage with other users they otherwise would not have seen. However, this high bot activity leads to less back-and-forth discussion between users. When there are supervisory bots moderating a community, we see less centralization in the human social network. This means that those key people who were important to the community have fewer connections than before. Without supervisory bots, these members would be the ones who establish and enforce community norms. Our study can help users and community leaders understand the impact of these bots on their communities. It can also help community moderators understand the impact of enabling automated moderation through supervisory bots. Bots are rigid because of their rules-based nature, but they are likely to become more advanced as they incorporate new technologies such as generative AI. More research will be needed to understand how complex generative AI bots affect human-to-human interactions in online communities. At the same time, automating platform moderation can lead to strange effects, because bots are more rigid in their enforcement and cannot deal with potential issues on a case-by-case basis.

Students would take guesses – often rooted in history and counterfeiting concerns. In other countries, bills and coins come in different sizes that pertain to their value, making them much easier for people with low vision and the blind to use. My goal in talking about the currency redesign with my students was to show them how research has shaped their lives, often in ways they didn’t even realize. Now, following President Donald Trump’s executive order on federal projects related to DEIA – diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility – many research initiatives similar to the bill redesign project will lose funding. As a social psychologist, some of the studies I’ve worked on would be considered DEIA work. While frequently focused on those who have faced long-standing barriers to these resources – for example, racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities – the results of research related to DEIA are often applied to help all people achieve their potential. I’ve heard many scientists discuss how their programs of research have been wrongfully included in the anti-DEIA sweeps because they use terms such as “biodiversity.” However, research that would be considered DEIA work has made influential contributions to society over the past few decades – it raises the question of whether any flagging is actually right. But the word list goes well beyond what would appear in HR training. This work continues today as new DEIA research reveals that schools are often still racially homogenous. These practices have improved educational outcomes for students with dyslexia, ADHD, autism and a variety of other neurodiversities. Starting in the 1980s, it was also DEIA research that led to HIV/AIDS, a virus disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ+ community, no longer being a death sentence. Just today, I received a news alert about scientific breakthroughs in the neurological study of postpartum depression. It is DEIA science that has demonstrated how diverse research teams promote innovative performance. This research would suggest that America’s diversity may very well be one of the key elements shaping its prosperity. Some might say “of course DEIA research will show DEIA works,” but it is also DEIA research that critiques the limitations of training to reduce bias – such as human resources workshops intended to teach workers about inclusive language, cultural sensitivity or implicit bias. Scientists discuss these limitations, and the scientific process is constantly self-correcting as researchers search for better solutions. Recommendations about better training are proposed based on new research. For instance, racial colorblindness is an ideology that grew out of the civil rights era and a desire to treat individuals equally regardless of race. For instance, in one study looking at race and dating preferences, white people endorsing a colorblind ideology were actually more likely to say they wouldn’t date a Black person than those who didn’t endorse colorblindness. Colorblindness can also make people feel uncomfortable bringing up race in any context. These studies are just some examples of DEIA science that showed the colorblindness approach is a mixed bag at best. Other times, it is harmful for minority groups and majority groups alike, or even backfires, making people more, not less, discriminatory and uncomfortable. Despite its shortcomings, many prominent figures in the anti-DEIA movement have seemingly endorsed colorblindness. Greg Abbott created executive order GA-55 to end DEIA policies and institute a “color-blind” approach instead. In his second inaugural address, Trump promised that his administration would “forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.” While a meritocracy may sound good on paper, DEIA research has suggested that meritocracies don’t work in the current society. Meritocracies assume a level playing field and can ignore disparities, such as wealth, that may afford some more opportunities than others – social mobility between income levels is rare and can take generations. Despite the anti-DEIA rhetoric present in American discourse, most Americans do not have negative attitudes toward DEIA; 52% even still think DEIA in the workplace is good. Most Americans, including white people, men and Republicans, also do not report having been harmed by DEIA policies. Ultimately, blanket bans on anything remotely DEIA harm advancement across scientific disciplines. DEIA-related science is an ingrained part of the scientific enterprise, and cutting its funding could mean missing out on important breakthroughs.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

President Donald Trump gave no specific reason for firing Gen. Charles Q. Even now, as a lecturer in history, national security and constitutional law, I know that nonpartisanship is central to the military’s primary mission of defending the country. Trump’s actions could raise concerns about whether he is trying to change those centuries of precedent. If so, military personnel at all levels would face a crucial question: Would they stand up for the military’s independent role in maintaining the integrity and stability of American democracy or follow the president’s orders – even if those orders crossed a line that made them illegal or unconstitutional? Julius Caesar, who used his army to seize power in ancient Rome, was a cautionary tale. So was Oliver Cromwell’s use of his military power in the English Civil War to execute King Charles I and rule England. By voluntarily giving up his military power and returning to civilian life, the man who would become the nation’s first president demonstrated his commitment to civilian control of a military grounded in allegiance to the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, not allegiance to any one party, faction or person. Washington’s act set a powerful example for future generations. In part that trust comes from the military’s professional dedication to political neutrality, which includes training its personnel to uphold values like duty, honor and integrity. This foundational oath ensures that if members of the military receive orders that they believe are questionable, they will not follow those orders blindly. They are taught throughout their career – during basic training, officer candidate training and in recurring sessions through the years – to seek clarification. Depending on their ranks, military members’ responses to questionable orders can vary. Senior officers, who have extensive experience and higher levels of responsibility, have the authority and the duty to ensure that any orders they follow or pass down are lawful and in line with the Constitution. When evaluating uncertain orders or navigating unclear situations, they often consult with legal advisers, discuss the implications with peers and thoroughly analyze the situation before taking action. Junior officers and senior enlisted personnel often find themselves in positions where they must make quick decisions based on the information available to them. Even so, their training focuses heavily on discipline and obedience. This can make it challenging for them to question orders, especially in high-pressure situations. If senior military leaders fail in their responsibility, chaos could ensue: Units may end up following conflicting orders or ignoring directives altogether. This can lead to a breakdown in command and control, with some units acting independently or based on politically motivated directives. This would be a dangerous shift, making the military extremely vulnerable to operational failures and enemy attack. But some events have come close to crossing the line. For instance, during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson was determined to demonstrate American strength and resolve, famously stating, “I will not lose in Vietnam.” His pressure landed on the shoulders of Gen. William Westmoreland. Westmoreland responded by publicizing the numbers of enemy personnel killed in battle, attempting to show that U.S. efforts were reducing the size of opposing forces. But historians have found that this emphasis lacked clear military objectives, meaning troops faced confusion and contradictory orders. His decisions did not directly violate the Constitution or U.S. law, but they exemplify how political pressures can adversely influence military strategies, with devastating consequences. If advisers are hesitant to speak freely about what is and is not possible in any given situation, and about potential consequences both good and bad, the president will miss out on the kinds of critical insights that shape effective strategies. The bottom line is that when top military experts give advice and take action influenced by politics, they undermine the centuries-old system of military training and ethics.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Founded in 1870 as Missouri School of Mines, Missouri University of Science and Technology primarily educated mining engineers and surveyors. The campus really started to grow right after World War II. The campus evolved into a world-class technological research university, one that was making an impact beyond the state and nation. In 1964, the institution’s name was changed to the University of Missouri-Rolla. UMR was the technology flagship of the four-campus University of Missouri System. Then, in 2008, the name officially became Missouri University of Science and Technology. As a technological research university, Missouri S&T is a member of a small but elite group of American institutions that distinguish themselves by having a mission-based commitment to improving the world through the study and application of advanced sciences and technology. There are 16 technological research universities in the nation, including MIT, Caltech, Missouri S&T, Rensselaer, Georgia Tech and the Colorado School of Mines. Many of these institutions complement their technological strengths by offering good programs in humanities, liberal arts and social sciences.

Social media platforms tend not to be that bothered by national boundaries. Users of what was once called Twitter span the globe, with its 600 millions-plus active accounts dotted across nearly every country. While many governments have sought to impose oversight mechanisms to address problems such as disinformation, online extremism and manipulation, these initiatives have been met with corporate resistance, political interference and legal challenges invoking free speech as a shield against regulation. And in this battle, U.S. platforms are increasingly leaning on American laws to challenge other nation’s regulations. It is, we believe as experts on digital law – one an executive director of a forum monitoring how countries implement democratic principles – a form of digital imperialism. The latest manifestation of this phenomenon occurred in February 2025, when new tensions emerged between Brazil’s judiciary and U.S.-based social media platforms. Trump Media & Technology Group and Rumble filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, challenging his orders to suspend accounts on the two platforms linked to disinformation campaigns in Brazil. The case follows earlier unsuccessful efforts by Elon Musk’s X to resist similar Brazilian rulings. Together, the cases exemplify a growing trend in which U.S. political and corporate actors attempt to undermine foreign regulatory authority by pressing the case that domestic U.S. law and corporate protections should take precedence over sovereign policies globally. Brazil’s extradition requests have gone unanswered due to claims by U.S. authorities that the case involves issues of free speech rather than criminal offenses. First, it seeks to frame Brazil’s judicial actions as censorship rather than oversight. And second, it seeks to portray the Brazilian court action as territorial overreach. In late February, a Florida-based judge ruled that Rumble and Trump Media need not comply with the Brazilian order. The case signals an important shift in the contest over platform accountability – a move from corporate lobbying and political pressure to direct legal intervention in foreign jurisdictions. U.S. courts are now being used to challenge overseas decisions regarding platform accountability. In Brazil, efforts to regulate social media platforms have long faced substantial opposition. Big Tech companies – including Google, Meta and X – have used their economic and political influence to lobby against tighter regulation, often framing such policies as a threat to free expression. Trump Media was 53% owned by the U.S. president before he moved his stake into a revocable trust in December 2024. Their ascent to power has coincided with the First Amendment being wielded as a shield against foreign regulations on digital platforms. This imbalance extends to corporate power, with decades of legal precedent expanding protections for private interests. The case law cemented corporate speech protections, a logic later extended to digital platforms. U.S. free speech advocates in Big Tech and the U.S. government are seemingly escalating this trend to an even more extreme interpretation: that American free speech arguments can be deployed to resist the regulation of other jurisdictions and challenge foreign legal frameworks. For instance, in response to the European Union’s Digital Services Act, U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, expressed concerns that the act could threaten American free speech principles. Such an argument may have been fine if the same interpretation of free speech – and its appropriate protections – were universally accepted. Sovereign countries using this approach recognize freedom of expression as a fundamental and preferential right. But they also acknowledge that certain restrictions are necessary to protect democratic institutions, marginalized communities, public health and the informational ecosystem from harms. While the U.S. imposes some limits on speech – such as defamation laws and protection against incitement to imminent lawless action – the First Amendment is generally far more expansive than in other democracies. Musk, the owner of X, has given support to far-right groups overseas.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

New research suggests there are about 100 trees per inhabitant in China. These numbers are considerable, given how densely populated China is, an expert told Live Science. China's Ninth National Forest Resources Inventory counted an average of 426 trees per acre (1,052 trees/hectare) across the country in 2019, which is much higher than the new study's estimate of 279 trees per acre (689 trees/hectare), Guo told Live Science in an email. The true number of trees could be somewhere in the middle, but more research is needed to figure out what it is, he said. An accurate estimate of China's tree population is crucial to evaluating forest ecosystem conditions and the amount of carbon that is being locked away in trees, Guo said. He and his colleagues also created a detailed map showing the distribution of China's trees, which they say will help the country hit its ecological and climate targets. Related: Massive sinkholes in China hold 'heavenly' forests with plants adapted for harsh life underground The technology is cutting-edge, but some features need ironing out, Guo said. For example, Lidar360 cannot detect trees growing below thick canopies. "In densely forested areas, overlapping canopies obstruct the accurate detection of mid-story and understory trees, leading to lower-than-actual tree counts," Guo said. Incorporating terrestrial lidar data and improving the software could provide more accurate tree counts, he added. China's tree population may soon increase, however, because the country is planting seedlings at a dizzying rate. Tree counts could skyrocket this spring as drones are deployed to seed the "Great Green Wall" — a huge belt of trees in the north of China that is being planted to prevent the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts from expanding. The Great Green Wall project — also known as the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program — started in 1978 and is due to be completed in 2050, by which point it could hold 100 billion trees . The wall is already the world's largest seeded forest with more than 66 million trees , but its success in staving off desertification is debated . The technology used for the study not only helps to count and map trees, but it could also optimize where China chooses to focus its tree-planting efforts.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Scientists in Japan have developed a new kind of "universal" computing memory that is much faster and less energy-hungry than modules used in the best laptops and PCs today. Universal memory is a storage format that combines the speed of existing RAM and the ability of storage to retain information without a power supply This new technology operates at faster speeds and with greater capacity than conventional RAM, but overcomes the problem of high power requirements for data writing — which has previously been a challenge for MRAM. MRAM devices consume little power in their standby state but need a large electric current to switch the direction of magnetization vector configurations of magnetic tunnel junctions, thereby using the direction of magnetization to represent the binary values in computers. That makes it infeasible for use in most computing systems and to achieve low-power data writing, a more efficient method for switching these vectors was needed. The prototype component they built was called a "multiferroic heterostructure" — a ferromagnetic material and piezoelectric material, but with an ultrathin vanadium between them — that can be magnetized by an electric field. This differs from other MRAM devices, which did not have the vanadium layer. Furthermore, the magnetic state was maintained after the electric charge was no longer present, allowing a stable binary state to be maintained without power. For example, a common complaint with rechargeable household batteries is that they can only be charged a certain number of times (approximately 500) before their capacity degrades. That's because the new switching technique requires far less power than previous solutions, has a greater resilience than current RAM technologies and does not require moving parts.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Amsterdam, the birds have been constructing nests out of plastic food wrappers, masks and other waste for at least 30 years, researchers report in the February Ecology. “It’s ironic to think that many of these plastic single-use items have just been used for minutes by people, yet these coots have used them for decades,” says Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands. Hiemstra has been studying nesting materials used by city birds for years. He’s documented coots adding face masks to their nests during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — a building material that coots and other birds still use — and found rebellious magpies and crows that built their homes out of antibird spikes. Many birds these days use human trash as nest-building material, Hiemstra says. In Amsterdam, common coots like this one build their nests out of plastic waste and other human-made materials. In 2021, Hiemstra and colleagues excavated a common coot (Fulica atra) nest built on a wooden beam poking out of Rokin canal in Amsterdam. The nest had multiple layers of plastic waste, especially food packages. Expiration dates on wrappers helped researchers date nest layers and uncover how long the birds have been using plastic to build their nests. Using expiration dates to understand nest history can be imprecise. Since plastic lasts so long, old pieces of it can find their way into recent nest layers. “Weirdly enough, the wrapper is in pristine condition, as if it were littered yesterday,” Hiemstra says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But one of the most evocative — and neuroscientifically descriptive — invokes Lego bricks. It’s built from the ground up, then broken down, put away in bins and rebuilt in a slightly different form each time it’s taken out. This metaphor is beautifully articulated by psychologists Ciara Greene and Gillian Murphy in their new book, Memory Lane. Perhaps the comparison speaks to me because I have watched my kids create elaborate villages of Lego bricks, only to be dismantled, put away (after much nagging) and reconstructed, always with a similar overall structure but with minor and occasionally major changes. These villages’ blueprints are largely stable, but also fluid and flexible, subject to the material whims of the builders at any point in time. Imagine your own memory lane as a series of buildings, modified in ways both small and big each time you call them to mind. “As we walk down Memory Lane, the buildings we pass — our memories of individual events — are under constant reconstruction,” Greene and Murphy write. Readers may find it interesting (or perhaps upsetting) to learn how bad we all are at remembering why we did something, from trivial choices, like buying an album, to consequential ones, such as a yes or no vote on an abortion referendum. Modern dilemmas also come up, such as whether fake news and deepfake videos have particular sway over our memories or even create false ones. “We don’t need to generate technophobic fears of a digital future where our memories will be distorted — our memories can already be distorted very effectively by nondigital means.” The sentiment is alarming, but also strangely comforting. These imperfections are a product of a flexible memory system that allows us to learn from the past, plan for the future and respond to unexpected events. Forgetting may make our brains more efficient by jettisoning extraneous fluff so we can focus on the important memories.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It's a cosmic giant whose light has travelled over 12 billion years to reach us. We've dubbed it the Big Wheel, with our findings published March 17 in Nature Astronomy . Picture a galaxy like our own Milky Way : a flat, rotating structure made up of stars, gas and dust, often surrounded by an extensive halo of unseen dark matter . Disk galaxies typically have clear spiral arms extending outward from a dense central region. Our Milky Way itself is a disk galaxy, characterized by beautiful spiral arms that wrap around its center. Studying disk galaxies, like the Milky Way and the newly discovered Big Wheel, helps us uncover how galaxies form , grow and evolve across billions of years. Related: 'The early universe is nothing like we expected': James Webb telescope reveals 'new understanding' of how galaxies formed at cosmic dawn We previously thought galaxy disks form gradually over a long period: either through gas smoothly flowing into galaxies from surrounding space, or by merging with smaller galaxies. Usually, rapid mergers between galaxies would disrupt the delicate spiral structures, turning them into more chaotic shapes. This challenges long-held ideas about the growth of giant galaxies. It is three times as big in size as comparable galaxies at that epoch and is one of the most massive galaxies observed in the early cosmos. In fact, its rotation speed places it among galaxies at the high end of what's called the Tully-Fisher relation , a well-known link between a galaxy's stellar mass and how fast it spins. This dense environment likely provided ideal conditions for the galaxy to grow quickly. It probably experienced mergers that were gentle enough to let the galaxy maintain its spiral disk shape. Formation of a single massive galaxy through time in the TNG50 cosmic simulation - YouTube Watch On Discovering a galaxy like the Big Wheel was incredibly unlikely. So, our finding was fortunate, probably because we observed it within an exceptionally dense region, quite different from typical cosmic environments. Given the dense environment, future mergers might significantly alter its structure, potentially transforming it into a galaxy comparable in mass to the largest ones observed in nearby clusters, such as Virgo.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-vaccine-mrna-pancreas-nih'>An mRNA cancer vaccine may offer long-term protection</a></h2><b>Source:</b> sciencenews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 09:00:00 <p>
A new mRNA vaccine could prevent pancreatic cancer from returning — potentially for the long haul. That is “pretty remarkable,” says Aaron Sasson, who directs the Pancreatic Cancer Center at Stony Brook Medicine in New York and was not involved with the work. The new research, which is still in the proof-of-concept stage, suggests that a cancer vaccine strategy could one day offer patients a long-lasting treatment option. The results come amid recent news that officials at the National Institutes of Health are telling scientists to avoid mentioning mRNA vaccine technology in grant applications. It’s a move that could significantly hamper the advancement of mRNA vaccines in cancer research and patient care, Sasson says. Unlike a traditional vaccine — such as the annual flu shot — which helps our bodies ready defenses for future viral encounters, this type of cancer vaccine acts therapeutically, after someone has already developed cancer. It works by teaching patients’ immune cells what pancreatic cancer looks like. He hopes the work could offer a blueprint for developing effective vaccines against even more types of cancer. Science News spoke with Balachandran and Sasson to understand how cancer vaccines work, the future of the field and why some researchers are focusing on pancreatic cancer. Doctors already have a set of therapies for treating pancreatic cancer. The problem is, they just don’t work very well, Sasson says. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer can be tricky; it kills more than 450,000 people globally every year, so patients often learn they have the disease at an advanced stage. Current treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and drugs that attack cancer cells. Nevertheless, the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is around 13 percent, meaning that five years after diagnosis, 87 out of 100 patients will have died. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved dozens of such immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, which rev up the immune system; therapeutic antibodies, which help the immune system spot cancer; and T-cell transfer therapy, which involves supercharging a patient’s own immune cells. Cancer vaccines like the one Balachandran’s team is testing, which was jointly developed by the biotechnology companies BioNTech and Genentech, take a different approach. The cancer vaccine works similarly to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but instead contains instructions for building cancer proteins rather than coronavirus proteins and is given after the disease develops, rather than before. There’s another major difference: The cancer vaccine is personalized for every patient. “Each individual tumor has a unique combination of genetic mutations,” Balachandran says. To create the vaccine, doctors first surgically remove a patient’s tumor and analyze its DNA for genetic errors. Some of these errors produce mutant tumor proteins, which the immune system can recognize like red flags warning danger. Patients receive a personalized vaccine containing RNA sequences that encode those red flags, Balachandran says. This process teaches patients’ immune systems to be on the lookout; when immune cells see the red flags, they know it’s time to strike. Many scientists thought pancreatic cancer did not create enough red flags to alert the immune system. “Not only do you need to make the cells, but the cells need to last and retain function long-term.” His team followed the 16 patients for up to about four years; all had undergone surgery and subsequently received an immune checkpoint inhibitor, their personalized vaccine and a standard chemotherapy regimen. In contrast, seven of the eight who did not respond saw their cancer return after about a year. “It’s a big deal,” Sasson says, because it suggests the vaccine can generate immune cells that patrol the body like guard dogs even several years later.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/desinformacao-gerada-por-ia-ja-e-uma-inimiga-da-democracia-na-era-digital-252153'>AI -generated misinformation is already an enemy of democracy in the digital age</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 08:44:02 <p>
In the Global Risks reports of 2024 and 2025 of the World Economic Forum, misinformation was pointed out as a great risk to humanity and a reason for great concern in the short and medium term. Such conduct may impact transparency, as in authoritarian regimes. It is noteworthy that contemporary democracy as a whole is experiencing crises that put their liberal principles and their set of rights, duties and freedoms guaranteed by the Republican State at stake. This scenario indicates that liberal democratic regimes may not be fulfilling their promises of inclusion and equality, which may be leading populations from many historically democratic countries to disappointment in relation to this type of regime. And these new configurations of political power, combined with moments of disappointment with democracy, have been aggravated by the growing influence of social networks and, more recently, artificial intelligence, political narratives that misrepresent facts and relativize the truth for extremist ideals. When we relate fake news campaigns using disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, you must keep in mind that there is no more amateurism in this sector. To exemplify what we are investigating in terms of misinformation and their interconnections with other phenomena, it is worth mentioning the use of AI tools in electoral communication used in the 2024 claims. These assemblies were taken to public squares during election rallies, to interfere with public opinion and direct votes. According to the same report, Mexico - which has around 100 million voters and 24% of the population without internet access - also underwent assemblies with deepfakes that circulated at great speed. During last year's election campaign, current President Claudia Sheinbaum was presented on her main opponent's media as a “communist”. Similar practices are reported in researching the media and democracy report in countries such as South Africa and even elections for the European Parliament. Given these unusual scenarios that exclude truth and reality, can you question how such uses can cause systemic risks and impact democracies? The Economist Intelligence index is based on 60 indicators grouped into five categories, namely: civil freedoms; Government operation; Political participation; Political culture and, finally, electoral process and pluralism. However, as regards the world, the report points out that unlike 2011, when 11% of the population lived in full democracies, currently only 7.8% reside in qualified countries in this way. On the other hand, and according to the V-Dem-Variesties of Democracy 2024 report, which focused on elections held in 60 countries last year, 42 countries would be in the process of self-catualization. And only 18 would be in the process of democratization. Among these Brazil, whose population encompasses half of all that are resuming democratic directions. Also according to the V-Dem Institte report, the level of democracy enjoyed by people globally in 2023 fell to 1985 levels. As a result, about 5.7 billion people are living today in autocracies, and with the results of the 2024 elections this number has increased. And it questions, in its conclusions, if democracy is being defeated globally. Participation, transparency, accountability, public debate, equality and freedom could be made possible through instruments, structures, processes and the digital ease of establishing communication, immanent public communication to democracies. The different configurations of democracies (direct, representative, participatory and deliberative) benefited from so many mechanisms capable of bringing state, society and media closer. At the same time, the fascination and facilitation of the uses of this technology also arbitrarily expanded any speeches - without ethical shame - and created an uncontrollable global industrial hub. An industry that violates the constitution of countries with technology as innovative as dystopian, as it changes realities, disregards the truth, imposes doubt on people and concepts, unbalances the educational process, influences new types of behavior and creates doubts about knowledge and the future.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In a surprisingly emphatic result, 41-year-old Kirsty Coventry, Zimbabwe’s Sport Minister, was selected as the new president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at its 144th session in Greece. So how did she rise to this position, and what should sports in Australia and globally expect? Coventry comes well-credentialed as a five-time Olympic swimmer, representing Zimbabwe from 2000 to 2016 and winning seven medals, two of them gold. She has taken on various IOC roles, including most recently on the Coordination Committee for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Having obtained the required 50% majority, no further rounds were held. So begins a new dawn for the IOC’s now extremely powerful inaugural woman leader, who will face several challenges. Foremost, Coventry had longstanding president Thomas Bach’s informal endorsement and support. Bach no doubt had a huge sway over the voting members, many of whom were elected to the IOC during his 12-year reign. Bach’s appointment as Honorary President for Life from June this year means he will still have a powerful role and be able to mentor and influence Coventry. A lack of transparent voting for the position means we cannot know who voted for whom. Some will presume the new president garnered the majority of votes from women and African delegates, but such an observation can only be speculative. With women comprising 43% of IOC members, it is a reasonable assumption this cohort provided a strong support base. Several candidates proposed quite significant (and in some cases radical) changes, suggesting a vote for Coventry was a nod to keeping the status quo. Or was it just time to break the hold of male presidents? The IOC membership has also changed over the past few decades, with growing representation of women. Coventry triumphed despite previous doubts about her domestic political ties, and a limited change agenda that seemed to be mainly a legacy choice for Bach. In this context, Bach might continue to exert his influence. As Olympic Agenda 2020+5 draws to its end, the new president will have the opportunity to set a future-focused strategy. There are plenty of areas she will need to consider in taking the reins. Environmental, sustainability and global warming issues, such as lack of snow for the winter games, venue rationale, spending on mega events, and lack of bidders for future games. Sponsorship changes – longtime sponsors Toyota and Panasonic have dropped out but others have come in, with some from China. Relations with Russia and the United States Addition of new sports and culling or dropping existing less popular ones. Coventry comes from an impressive swimming background, and this could work to Australia’s advantage. Although she will step down from her role on the Coordination Committee for the Brisbane Olympics and Paralympics to handle other pressing presidential duties, she will no doubt retain a close link to the third Australian Olympic host city. The Australian Olympic Commission was quick to congratulate her on her ascension to the IOC presidency. Coventry knows AOC President Ian Chesterman, a fellow IOC member, so we can expect a close, friendly working relationship between them.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Great hammerhead sharks are known for their long migrations, but scientists have now discovered that some individuals in the Bahamas instead spend all year snacking without leaving their plentiful and protected home waters. Why would some individuals take off if others are happy to stay put? Great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) have been recorded making 3,000-kilometer journeys between Bimini, the Bahamas and offshore Virginia. But tracking tags and tissue samples from hammerheads in Andros, Bahamas, reveal that the country, designated as a shark sanctuary in 2011, could be more than just a part-time haven. “Resource availability is a key driver,” says shark ecologist Tristan Guttridge, founder of the marine nonprofit Saving the Blue, which does most of its research in Andros. “But why don’t all of them stay if food is so abundant?” Food choices could influence hammerheads’ travel habits, in the same way that you can be surrounded by pizza joints but still drive across town because all you’re craving is a poke bowl. “We found evidence of individual variation in their diets, so deciding whether to stay or go might depend on what they feed on,” Guttridge says. As these critically endangered animals migrate across immense distances, they can travel into waters where they’re at risk of being harmed or killed by industrial fisheries. “Although some individuals reside year-round in protected waters, others do not, emphasizing the need for international collaboration on conservation efforts for these mobile species,” Guttridge says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“Those chemical modifications that decorate [histones] and modify gene expression — they’re metabolites, full stop,” said Finley, the cancer biologist. Fifteen years ago, when Kathryn Wellen was a postdoc studying cancer cells, she discovered that the epigenetic marks on histones change in response to the presence of nutrients. There, enzymes break down the metabolites into epigenetic marks known as acetyl groups and place them on histones to activate one set of genes. Some of those acetyl groups are turned back into acetyl-CoA and consumed for energy, while others are recycled to activate a different set of genes. Clearly there’s a lot of metabolic activity occurring in the nucleus. Wellen wondered whether the nucleus had its own unique metabolism and could therefore be considered a “metabolic compartment.” Working with Nate Snyder, a biochemist at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Wellen and other researchers developed new methods to measure metabolites in different parts of the cell and saw that metabolic activity in the nucleus is not identical to activity occurring elsewhere. This idea of the nucleus as a metabolic compartment was foundational to understanding how metabolism impacts embryonic development. In early embryonic cells, as developmental decisions are made that direct cells to become ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, all of the epigenetic marks on the histones get repositioned. These enzymes make molecules, which then activate other enzymes that remove epigenetic marks and lay down new ones as cells grow, divide and take on different fates. Early in human development, the embryo is a ball of cells. Alpha-ketoglutarate not only controls differentiation in stem cells; it does the same in cancer cells, Finley’s team and other groups found a few years ago. Their study, published in Nature, found that p53 caused alpha-ketoglutarate to accumulate; this alpha-ketoglutarate altered the fate of the cancer cells so that they were less likely to form tumors. This was striking and unexpected because researchers had assumed that p53 has an anticancer effect by directly regulating the activity of genes. “This is particularly exciting because if changing metabolism can change cell fate in a meaningful way, there is the possibility that you might be able to manipulate that therapeutically, where aberrant decisions of differentiation are causal for the disease — like in many forms of cancer,” said Rutter, who was not involved in the study. In some ways, this interplay between metabolism and genes is obvious: We know that life is influenced by both its genes and its environment. This new, exciting field of research shows at a molecular level how the materials available to our cells influence their fates, and ours.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://undark.org/2025/03/21/book-review-power-of-nuclear/'>Book Review: Casting a Brighter Light on Nuclear Energy</a></h2><b>Source:</b> undark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 00:00:00 <p>
Years later, Marco Visscher stumbled across this article while doing research for his recent book “The Power of Nuclear,” which makes a provocative case in favor of nuclear power. BOOK REVIEW — “The Power of Nuclear,” by Marco Visscher ( Bloomsbury Sigma, 320 pages). Back in 2000, Visscher writes, he “wanted nothing to do with anything nuclear.” He gradually moderated his stance over time, but it wasn’t until Dutch politicians started talking seriously about nuclear energy in his own country that he conducted the research that caused him to do a full 180. “Throughout society nuclear power is met with deep-rooted suspicion,” he writes. To show skeptics it does belong, his account systematically lays out reasons why widespread fears and hesitations about atomic energy are misguided, illogical, and propelled by unscientific thinking. “Throughout society nuclear power is met with deep-rooted suspicion,” he writes. It was only after these brutal weapons were created that calmer uses of radioactivity entered society, spurred on by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. That connection shows up, Visscher points out, in the language of anti-nuclear protests, which he details early in the book and where “No Nukes” meant both bombs and power plants when energy opposition took off in the 1970s and ’80s. “In the nuclear reactor, neutrons split atoms; outside, they split society,” he writes, in one of many pithy distillations that sometimes make his point seem like a propaganda pamphlet — territory the book’s goal of advocacy and its strident language can veer into. “They showed their emotions and appealed to those of others,” he writes of the opposition, “while nuclear advocates came across as detached accountants.” If that accountant’s call didn’t bring people and their emotions to favor of nuclear power before, it’s unlikely to work in this book.

Each week for four weeks, you’ll receive a hand-picked excerpt from our archive related to your subject area of interest. But Visscher makes a valiant attempt, in part by looking backward. Visscher narrates these accidents with personal and colorful details, describing, for instance, a propaganda sign at Chernobyl that read, “Let the atom be a worker, not a soldier!” After the initial reaction explosion, he notes, “some thought: the Americans have come.” Similarly, he points out that no one died from the reactor meltdown in Fukushima — though thousands of people did die during the evacuation, and suffered psychological trauma afterward. After all, Visscher points out, we encounter plenty of it naturally in small doses. But most people are bad at assessing raw risk, he notes. Similar arguments, later in the book, apply to nuclear weapons themselves. “Compared to the destruction caused by regular air raids the effects of the atomic bomb were not that special,” he writes “Would it really have been less bad if Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been hit by hundreds of regular bombs?” But such arguments aren’t likely to win over many readers. Nevertheless, in following chapters, Visscher develops similar lines of thought, looking at the medical protocols around radioactivity, which are based on the idea that any radiation is harmful and all radiation exposure should be minimized, ideas he claims aren’t very scientific. Similarly, he writes, nuclear waste — which has inspired some of the most vocal opposition to atomic energy — isn’t as dangerous as it’s treated. “Between 2000 and 2023, a total of 117 nuclear reactors were connected to the grid. However, in the same years, 121 have been permanently shut down.” And Visscher does find himself in increasingly popular company, as other thinkers and doers — including the likes of Bill Gates — bring nuclear back to the climate-solution table, and as startups get big money to try to make fusion energy happen. That’s one innovation, but nuclear power researchers have also been focusing on so-called advanced reactors — a general term for many new nuclear technologies, which includes smaller reactors that use thorium instead of uranium. “Why is there so much focus on innovation, really?” he writes. That may be true, but what’s between the ears is important, even if its gears sometimes turn illogically. Revamping nuclear power’s reputation may take more than just informing readers that they’re wrong.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
