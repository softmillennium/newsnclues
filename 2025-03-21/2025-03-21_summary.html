Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar amid mass protests against the move and Israel's resumption of hostilities in Gaza. JERUSALEM — As Israeli forces carried out more strikes in a renewed Gaza offensive, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed forward on the home front to oust two senior officials in a development that roiled Israeli politics. “After many long months of stage-setting, a constitutional crisis could be fast upon Israel.” Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.</p>

Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians. It also said Netanyahu used the ceasefire negotiations “to stall and buy time without any genuine intention of reaching tangible outcomes.” The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

PM says government will decide who heads domestic spy agency as protests against Ronen Bar dismissal continue In a letter made public late on Thursday, Bar said his dismissal was motivated by Netanyahu's “personal interests”. Baharav-Miara previously warned Netanyahu he could not fire Bar before her office had reviewed his motives for doing so. “It is prohibited to appoint a new head of Shin Bet, and interviews for the position should not be held.” Netanyahu is facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial.</p>

Hinting that Elon Musk's role in the US government will have limits, President Donald Trump on Friday said war plans should not be shared with his adviser and closest ally, Elon Musk, because of his business interests in rival countries. However, on Friday, Donald Trump hinted there would be limits to Musk's involvement in strategic affairs. Trump made the comments during an Oval Office meeting on developing a new fighter jet, and he rejected reports that Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China, reported AP. Donald Trump said since Elon Musk has businesses in China, he could be susceptible to the country's influence. Trump had previously brushed off questions about Musk's potential conflicts of interest, simply saying that he would steer clear when necessary.</p>

A Minnesota veteran who found work at the Veterans Benefits Administration after suffering two traumatic brain injuries on overseas deployments stood in front of hundreds of people and five Democratic state attorneys general on Thursday night and recalled the moment she learned she lost her job. The story was one of many shared by former federal workers and others impacted by the Trump administration's policies during a town hall in St Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday, part of a national tour that has offered an avenue for grievances against Donald Trump's first two months, but also a way to gather evidence for ongoing lawsuits, totaling about 10 so far, that Democratic attorneys general have filed against the Trump administration. Another veteran who worked at the Veterans Benefit Administration was fired via email by Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency”, she said. “The Trump administration has impacted me deeply during these past two months alone, but more than ever, we have to come together organized because I'll be damned if they keep hurting my family,” she said. Suzanne Kelly, the CEO of the Minnesota Council of Churches, said her organization, which helps resettle refugees, is losing $4m in federal funds that would go directly to their clients, an amount that can't be replaced with local dollars.</p>

The Next Generation Air Dominance program will replace Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor with a crewed aircraft built to enter combat alongside drones. The plane's design remains a closely held secret, but would probably include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines. It is a major boost for its St Louis, Missouri, fighter jet production business. Boeing's commercial operations have struggled as it attempts to get its bestselling 737 Max jet production back up to full speed, while its defense operation has been weighed down by underperforming contracts for mid-air refueling tankers, drones and training jets. Cost overruns at the KC-46 mid-air refueling tanker program have surpassed $7bn in recent years, while another fixed-price contract to upgrade two Air Force One planes has created a $2bn loss for the top-five US defense contractor.</p>

But Bar has found himself on the frontline of Israel's bitter internal political, social and cultural conflicts. Bar became a target himself when he warned of the threat posed by “Jewish terrorism” – a reference to violence perpetrated by parts of the far-right settler movement – and warned the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, that police action in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem was creating a feeling of collective punishment among Palestinian residents. A Shin Bet report into the 2023 attack released earlier this month attacked Netanyahu indirectly, saying that Israel had followed for years a “policy of quiet [which] had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup”.</p>

"There is no way that Heathrow should be taken out completely because of a failure in one power substation." Since the Heathrow closure was announced, a Friday morning flight from Halifax to London was cancelled, as were six more that had been scheduled for later in the day, which were departing from Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Vancouver. Heathrow is such a vital piece of British infrastructure that it should have failsafe systems," Charles told Reuters. Heathrow normally opens for flights daily at 6 a.m. local time due to nighttime flying restrictions. Prices at hotels around Heathrow jumped, with booking sites offering rooms for 500 pounds ($925 Cdn), roughly five times the normal price levels.</p>

US President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing has been awarded a major contract for the Air Force's high-tech next-generation F-47 fighter plane. The NGAD effort was paused in 2024 over cost concerns -- a major focus of the Trump administration, which has tasked billionaire donor Elon Musk with slashing government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). "What this study told us is we tried a whole bunch of different options and there is no more viable option than NGAD to achieve air superiority in this highly contested environment," Major General Joseph Kunkel told a symposium in Colorado. The F-22 features stealth technology, a high degree of maneuverability and the ability to supercruise, or maintain supersonic flight without afterburners.

On its sand dunes 3½ years later, in winds that reached 27 mph, the Wright Flyer I rolled down a 60-foot rail and lifted off, carrying his brother Orville 120 feet. Presented with these claims, Jakab, who has written or edited three books on the Wright brothers, could barely contain his exasperation. Navy jets, he noted, still use a catapult system when lifting off from short runways on aircraft carriers — and no one says they're not real planes.

Imamoglu was questioned by police for four hours over corruption accusations, during which he denied all the charges, Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported. His arrest has sparked the largest protests since 2013, when Turkey was rocked by mass anti-government demonstrations that left eight people dead. Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a “trustee mayor,” if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.

Emma Fish, 53, from Atherstone, explains that lockdown provided the opportunity to consider seeking a formal diagnosis of autism for her son. Others have told us about the lighter moments they looked for at a time when many were struggling with fear and uncertainty. As we've been reporting, people had varying experiences during lockdown - some which were impacted by their access to space and facilities. Earlier, we brought you stories from those who continue to suffer with symptoms of long Covid after having contracted the virus. Meanwhile, Suzanne Wilson, 62 from Lancaster, describes cancelled visits due to an outbreak at the care home where her mother, who had Alzheimer's, was staying.</p>

Tensions escalated this month when Tigray's interim president, Getachew Reda, tried to fire three senior military commanders, having previously accused his forces of attempting a coup. Last week, a rival TPLF faction, led by the party chair Debretsion Gebremichael, installed its officials in provincial government offices. He has repeatedly said sea access was “existential” for Ethiopia, which with 130 million people is the world's most populous landlocked country. Eritrea has ordered a nationwide mobilisation and is trying to undermine Abiy by aiding rebels fighting Ethiopia's military in the Amhara region bordering Tigray. Last week, Gen Tsadkan Gebretensae, Tigray's vice-president, warned that war could erupt “at any moment” and the region risked “becoming a battlefield” again.</p>

It added that Holmen has “never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen”. Holmen's complaint alleged that ChatGPT's “defamatory” response violated accuracy provisions within the GDPR European data law. Noyb said that since Holmen's interaction with ChatGPT took place, OpenAI had released a new model incorporating web searches – which has made a repeat of the Holmen error “less likely”.

Russia has insisted that it will not tolerate troops from NATO countries in Ukraine, regardless of how such a mission is branded by the US-led military bloc. Additionally, Starmer has reportedly acknowledged that the US will not provide a military “backstop” for any mission in Ukraine, as was publicly stated by the administration of President Donald Trump. Trump aims to transfer responsibility for Ukrainian security to European NATO members after negotiating a truce with Russia, asserting that the US and NATO should play no role in future arrangements. Meanwhile, the EU faces challenges in replacing US military assistance for Kiev. Member states failed to reach an agreement on Thursday concerning €40 billion ($43 billion) in additional military aid for Ukraine, a proposal pushed by the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas.</p>

According to Alfaro, silencing discussion of vulnerable groups will deter trafficking victims from reporting the crimes committed against them. These challenges make them prime targets for traffickers, who exploit financial instability and lack of familial support. Additionally, anti-trafficking non-profits have also been informed by federal workers responsible for grant allocations that conservative Christian organizations that have guidelines more closely aligned with the executive orders will receive preference over federal grants for supporting survivors, according to one source with direct knowledge of the new grant funding mandates. Omitting information about crime victims' sexuality or race from reports can hamper investigations and victim identification, the prosecutor said. “You can't really take a victim-centered approach if we're not allowed to categorically approach the victim for who they are as a person, like if we can't acknowledge that they are trans,” said the prosecutor.</p>

Donald Trump said on Friday that plans for possible war with China should not be shared with Elon Musk because of his business interests, a rare admission that the billionaire faces conflicts of interests in his role as a senior adviser to the US president. Trump had previously brushed off questions about Musk's potential conflicts of interest, simply saying that he would steer clear when necessary. Musk's involvement in any US plans or dealings with China would raise not only security concerns but questions over a significant conflict of interest, as he has considerable economic interests in China as the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, which also has contracts with the US air force. In a Friday meeting at the White House to announce new air force fighter planes, Trump and Hegseth both firmly rejected reports that Musk was shown any Pentagon plans regarding a potential conflict with China during his visit earlier that day. According to a New York Times report, the meeting was set to take place not in Hegseth's office, where informal meetings about innovation would normally take place, but in a secure conference room known as “the Tank”, which is typically used for higher-level meetings.</p>

Aleksandar Radić, a Belgrade-based military analyst, told AFP that the equipment resembled an American-made long-range acoustic device capable of delivering high-frequency sound waves over significant distances.

An insurgency led by Assad loyalists had already been brewing, and its attacks against government forces prompted a large deployment of soldiers to crush the rebellion. And in Alawite mountain villages, locals complained of kidnappings or, in the case of Fahil, extrajudicial killings during operations led by Syria's new security forces, though it remains unclear exactly who was responsible for the deaths. When Sharaa's militant group, Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham, came to power in December, he promised amnesty for those aligned with the Assad regime without “blood on their hands.” Reconciliation centers opened, and former regime soldiers and supporters, like Zaydu's husband, could hand over their weapons and be investigated to ascertain whether they had been directly involved in Assad's killing machine.

Palestinians pray during a funeral for victims of Israeli army strikes in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Thursday, March 20, 2025. Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians. It also said Netanyahu used the ceasefire negotiations “to stall and buy time without any genuine intention of reaching tangible outcomes.” The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Ukrainian officials reported multiple regions came under Russian attack overnight — including the Black Sea port city of Odesa. Over 70 people and 20 fire engines were involved in extinguishing what the emergency services called "massive fires." Three drone attacks also struck Sumy, in northeastern Ukraine, causing fires to erupt but without reports of injuries. The facility lies in Sudzha, a part of Kursk that Russia claimed to have retaken from Ukrainian troops last week.</p>

Videos on social media, apparently shot inside Heathrow's terminals, showed shuttered shops and deserted corridors, lit only by emergency lighting. London Fire Brigade deputy commissioner Jonathan Smith told reporters firefighters worked "tirelessly in challenging and very hazardous conditions" to bring the flames under control. Five major airports serve the British capital and towns nearby, but capacity is stretched, especially at Heathrow, whose two runways each measure almost four kilometres (2.5 miles) in length. Situated 25 kilometres west of central London, Heathrow's main flight destinations last year were Dublin, Los Angeles, Madrid and New York.

At least 91 people were killed yesterday and many more injured in a third day of Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to medical officials in the Palestinian territory who said a high proportion of the dead were women and children. Among those pulled alive from rubble on Thursday was a month-old girl, whose parents and brother were killed.

The ESRI said nearly all tariff scenarios would have a “significant negative impact” on the Irish economy, with a knock-on effect causing job losses and potential loss of US multinationals. Experts in Ireland have said that the threat of a tightened tax regime were more likely to incentivise pharmaceutical companies to book their profits in the US, rather than endure tariffs. A shrinking economy could also trigger inflation, with higher import prices on goods affected by retaliatory tariffs.</p>

Waves of Russian drones pounded the Ukrainian port city of Odesa overnight, setting it ablaze in an attack that underscored Moscow's intent to continue aerial assaults despite agreeing to a temporary pause in strikes on energy infrastructure. While much of Europe has cut its reliance on Russian gas, countries sympathetic to Moscow – including Hungary and Slovakia – still buy it, with all supplies flowing through the town of Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region. After a meeting with western military planners near London on Thursday, Keir Starmer appeared to step back from his pledge to put boots on the ground in Ukraine, saying instead that allied forces would be deployed by sea and air in support of Kyiv's own forces. In an interview on Thursday, Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, suggested the US might advocate for troops from Saudi Arabia or India – two countries with relatively warm ties to Moscow – to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential security arrangement. “With all due respect, the UN will not protect us from occupation or Putin's desire to come again.</p>

Everett, who was born to Polish parents and originally from Derby, had known his killer for more than a decade. They had their own bedrooms in the house, which Polish-born Majerkiewicz moved into after splitting with his ex-partner.

By late January, about 11,000 donors contributing roughly $30 each had helped the Mangione defense fund eclipse its initial goal of $300,000.</p>

The two nations were ideological adversaries with no diplomatic ties, and any contact between their citizens was unthinkable. Shortly after, American and Chinese table tennis teams exchanged visits, breaking a decades-long silence between the two nations. The NHL has long accepted Russian stars, with players like Alexander Ovechkin becoming household names in North America. Ovechkin, a close friend of Putin, is celebrated in the US as he chases Wayne Gretzky's all-time goal-scoring record. But if history has taught us anything, it's that a simple game can sometimes change the course of world politics.</p>

You know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that, but it was such a fake story. Donald Trump spent much of this week touting his efforts to secure a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine. It is unclear if Musk, who leads Donald Trump's department of government efficiency initiative and has business interests in China, was briefed on the military's plan for a potential war with Beijing. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. That declaration has now arrived, from Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general, who confirmed his “direct involvement in ongoing Cabinet-level discussions regarding invocation of the state-secrets privilege.”</p>

Unlike Security Council resolutions, though, those passed by the General Assembly are nonbinding. Britain's deputy ambassador James Kariuki called Sharabi's suffering "beyond the imagination" and said "Hamas must be held accountable for their despicable actions." Britain calls for the rapid resurgence of aid to Gaza, an investigation into allegations of sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinian detainees by Israeli forces, and an urgent return to the ceasefire deal, he said.

Similar claims often get tossed out over first amendment concerns or because many states prevent so-called Slapp suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation). He has made a mission of going after pipeline opponents, including Greenpeace, filing several lawsuits to that end. “Billionaire oligarchs like Elon Musk and Energy Transfer's Kelcy Warren now pose one of the most significant risks to free speech globally,” Kadidal said.

The authorities in Kiev are desperately attempting to lure young citizens into the military with promises of McDonald's cheeseburgers because they have run out of experienced soldiers in the conflict with Russia, former Ukrainian diplomat and parliamentary adviser Andrey Telizhenko has told RT. They are throwing low quality burgers or sandwiches into the crowd and saying: ‘Eat it,'” he insisted. Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov said late last year that Kiev's losses during the conflict had amounted to over 1 million, which includes both killed and severely wounded. Anyone who would fall for the promise of 15,625 cheeseburgers is not going to receive that money anyway, Telizhenko insisted. Zelensky claims that just over 45,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the fighting so far because “only those people were paid out – out of a million dead,” Telizhenko stated.</p>

Since then, at least 28,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan has shown no sign of engaging in serious peace talks. Burhan also has spoken of setting up a transitional government, raising the potential for two rival administrations jockeying for support as their forces battle — entrenching Sudan's effective partition. The RSF's 16-page charter calls for “a secular, democratic and decentralized state,” maintaining what it called Sudan's “voluntary integrity of its territory and peoples” — a nod to Sudan's many communities demanding autonomy from Khartoum. The RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, mobilized two decades ago by then-president Omar al-Bashir against populations that identify as Central or East African in Darfur.</p>

Extraordinary scenes of jubilant soldiers waving flags at Khartoum's presidential palace have suggested this could be a turning point in Sudan's bitter two-year civil war. It is not clear if these were taken before or after an RSF drone strike, which the paramilitary force said claimed dozens of lives. As conflicts rage from Gaza to Ukraine, the devastating human cost of Sudan's war is being overlooked, aid agencies warn.

Parties call for intervention after ACCC report found Australian grocers among most profitable in world amid cost-of-living crisis But it did not recommend divestiture powers, laws that could force Coles or Woolworths to sell off stores as punishment for price gouging. “Without laws to force more competition and make price gouging illegal, the supermarket duopoly will keep driving up grocery prices while raking in billions of dollars in profits,” he said. But Chalmers said divestiture was not the answer, arguing, as an example, that if one chain was forced to sell a store it might just be bought by another big player. In the statement, Woolworths said it had “already taken action” on many of the ACCC's interim recommendations such as having “simplified” promotional programs and making specials clearer through improved ticketing.</p>

US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to begin dismantling the Department of Education, putting Secretary Linda McMahon's job at risk. Speaking at the White House, Trump declared, "We're going to shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good." He called it a step toward eliminating federal oversight in education. Ms McMahon, appointed earlier this year, has been tasked with the final mission of overseeing the department's dissolution but its complete closure still requires Congressional approval.</p>

Instead of referring to male students as "Magistri' (master), the proposed text will use the term "vos" which is a neutral term for "you".

Russian President Vladimir Putin has given another ultimatum to Ukrainians living in the country by ordering them to legalise their immigration status or leave by September 10, Moscow Times reported quoting a presidential decree published on Thursday. The decree stated that Ukrainians without "legal grounds to stay or reside in Russia" must leave Russia or obtain citizenship within the next six months and 10 days. Meanwhile, the efforts to reach an agreement on the ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine continue with US President Donald Trump announcing on Wednesday that he had a "very good" one-hour phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I thought we accomplished quite a bit, and in the second meeting, we actually really narrowed the issues, certainly from the Russian standpoint, we were immediately in discussions on tangible, granular ways to move forward towards a ceasefire that included what you've heard about today, which is the ceasefire with regard to energy infrastructure from both sides, something they've been trying to put together for quite some time."

The construction is almost entirely dependent on a vast army of low-wage migrant workers, who largely come from south Asia.

And last October, it found the wreck of a US Navy ship that had been underwater for 78 years. It was identified in collaboration with experts based on refined analysis of information received after the aircraft disappeared. For this search, Ocean Infinity will be using a new 78 metre offshore support vessel, the Armada 7806. Finally, sub-bottom profiling sonar operates at lower frequencies and penetrates the seabed to reveal underlying geological structures. Underwater vehicles will have to contend with complex conditions on the seafloor, including steep slopes and rough terrain.</p>

The parents of missing Indian student Sudiksha Konanki want their daughter declared dead to "seek closure", authorities told CNN. Ms Konanki's body has not been found since she vanished on March 6 from Punta Cana beach in the Dominican Republic. Sheriff Mike Chapman said that while investigators believe Ms Konanki drowned, her death has not been officially confirmed, and the case remains open. Personal injury and criminal defence attorney Phillip DiLucente explained that the family's request is likely driven by a need for closure. A legal declaration of death would also allow the family to settle financial matters, such as college savings plans and insurance policies.</p>

Australia first had to weather a storm that started brewing when a sea of red in the stands at Sydney Football Stadium belted out the Indonesia national anthem, then turned into an onslaught of intense pressing and all-out attack as the visitors set out to impress in their first game under coach Patrick Kluivert. Indonesia had six starters return from the previous meeting even amid their own aggressive naturalisation program. Craig Goodwin was relegated to starting among the substitutes with Velupillay handed a first international start up front alongside Adam Taggart and Martin Boyle, but with all four players – as well as player-of-the-match Irvine and Lewis Miller – having a hand in the goal rush there are signs that Popovic's grand plans are working. The Socceroos remain one point ahead of third-placed Saudi Arabia, who beat China 1-0, as their resounding win over Indonesia has perhaps most crucially lifted them to a seven-goal buffer over their nearest challengers with three matches to play. But there is little margin for error with a pair of crunch clashes against the latter two sides still to come in June.</p>

President Donald Trump has expressed full support for the renewed offensive and suggested last month that Gaza's 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. The Biden administration voiced doubt about those aims, saying months ago that Hamas was no longer able to carry out such an attack. Palestinians say they don't want to leave their homeland, and Arab countries roundly rejected the proposal. Netanyahu has also fired or forced out several top officials who had appeared more open to a hostage deal. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have resumed long-range missile fire against Israel, which has rarely caused casualties or serious damage.</p>

Mass deportation has proved harder and slower than expected, so the White House needed a quick win to signal toughness. We have also said that the time to be really alarmed is when he ignores a court order. Mr Trump attacked the judge as a “Radical Left Lunatic”, implied he was crooked and called for his impeachment. However, when a president says things like “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law” and his minions declare they “don't care what judges think”, the threat to America—a place where the law has long tempered executive impulses—is clear.</p>

At least seven international flights from Indonesia's resort island Bali have been cancelled, an airport official said on Friday, after a volcano in the archipelago nation's east erupted, shooting dark ash 8km into the sky. As of 9:45am on Friday, “seven international flights had been cancelled, six of them are Jetstar flights bound to Australia and one Air Asia flight to Kuala Lumpur,” Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport spokesperson, Andadina Dyah, said in a statement. “The ash column was observed grey to black with thick intensity,” Indonesia's volcanology agency said in a statement about the eruption, which began around 11pm on Thursday. There were no reports of damages to nearby villages, but the agency warned residents of the potential for volcanic mudflow due to heavy rainfall. Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p>

President Donald Trump on Thursday refuted a New York Times report claiming that his adviser and DOGE chief Elon Musk will be briefed by the Pentagon on the US military's plan for a potential war against China. This comes after Defense chief Pete Hegseth confirmed that officials will discuss ‘innovation, efficiencies and smarter production' with the tech billionaire on Friday. "China will not even be mentioned or discussed," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. But the fake news delivers again — this is NOT a meeting about “top secret China war plans.” It's an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production. How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies.</p>

The organisation said Suri was being held at an immigration detention center in Louisiana.

Suri was arrested by federal agents on Monday night outside his home in Virginia. He has been accused of ‘spreading Hamas propaganda' and ‘close ties with a suspected terrorist'.</p>

However, the researchers at Aalto University in Finland found that rural population figures in these estimates could have been undercounted anywhere between 53 per cent to 84 per cent over the study period between 1975 and 2010. "The results are remarkable, as these datasets have been used in thousands of studies and extensively support decision-making, yet their accuracy has not been systematically evaluated," he added. It highlighted that there were "fundamental limitations" with the national population census while gauging rural populations. With the same basic practices in place, it's unlikely that slightly improved input data could correct for this level of bias." The undercounting of the population could have serious ramifications as governments, international bodies and researchers rely on global population data for resource allocation, infrastructure planning disease epidemiology and disaster risk management.</p>

At the same time, we will continue to reform national defense.” Lai's comments were the latest reassurance to U.S. and domestic critics who say Taiwan is not spending enough on its own defense.

Negotiators from Moscow and the U.S. will meet Monday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Sergei Ushakov told Russian news agencies. Despite the negotiations, hundreds of drone attacks were launched overnight by both sides, injuring several people and damaging buildings. In its latest estimate, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russian troops suffered 900,000 casualties — including up to 250,000 killed — since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said European plans for raising military spending conflicted with Putin and Trump's efforts to reach a peace deal.</p>

Trump made the comments at a White House event after signing an order to increase U.S. production of critical minerals.

Canada on Thursday “strongly condemned” China's execution this year of four Canadians over drug offenses, underlining its objection to China's use of the death penalty against its citizens, which was publicly confirmed the day before. A spokesperson for China's embassy in Canada said in an emailed statement Thursday that China always imposes “severe” penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a “‘zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem.” It said the evidence against the Canadian nationals is “solid and sufficient.” After news of the executions was reported Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters in Ottawa that she had been following the issue closely for months and that both she and then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had personally asked China for leniency. Joly said she could not go into further detail because the families asked for privacy, but she confirmed that the Canadians who were executed were all facing “charges linked to criminal activities, according to China, linked to drugs.” She also said all four were dual citizens, though China does not recognize dual citizenship. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning did not confirm the executions directly but when asked about them at a news briefing Thursday said: “Combating drug-related crimes is the responsibility of all countries.</p>

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — During a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, the U.S. leader apparently suggested Volodymyr Zelenskyy consider transferring ownership of Ukraine's power plants to the U.S. for long-term security, according to a U.S. statement. Located in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces occupied it shortly after Moscow's February 2022 invasion. While Russia declared the region annexed in fall 2022, its largest city, Zaporizhzhia, remains under Ukrainian control. During their call on Wednesday, Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should consider giving the U.S. ownership of Ukraine's power plants to ensure their long-term security, according to a White House statement from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. While the plant no longer produces electricity, it still holds large amounts of nuclear fuel, requiring constant cooling.</p>

This frame grab taken from an undated video released by the Orbetello Fishermen's Cooperative on Thursday, March 20, 2025, shows a swarm of midges in the lagoon area near Orbetello, central Italy. Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. A permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to “protect citizens and economic activities in the area,” Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. Local residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition “Save the Orbetello Lagoon” had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday.</p>

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Beijing on Thursday demanded protections for Chinese students in the U.S. after a congressional panel asked six American universities to hand over a large amount of detailed information on their Chinese students, citing national security concerns. “This is in the interest of both parties,” Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. Her remarks came a day after John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to six colleges requesting information on Chinese students enrolled in advanced science and technology programs. If left unaddressed, this trend will continue to displace American talent, compromise research integrity, and fuel China's technological ambitions at our expense.” Most Chinese students enrolled in U.S. undergraduate programs pay full tuition, making them an important source of funding for many universities.</p>

President Donald Trump waves from the stairs of Air Force One upon his arrival at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Monday, March 17, 2025. CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The United States Embassy in South Africa said Thursday it received a list of more than 67,000 people interested in refugee status in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's plan to relocate members of a white minority group he claims are victims of racial discrimination by their Black-led government. Trump issued an executive order on Feb. 7 cutting U.S. funding to South Africa and citing “government actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.” The executive order also criticized South Africa's foreign policy, specifically its decision to accuse Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in a case at the United Nations' top court. He told the Newzroom Afrika television channel that his organization had been inundated with requests for more information since Trump's order and had contacted the State Department and the embassy in Pretoria “to indicate that we would like them to make a channel available for South Africans that would like to get more information and register for refugee status.”</p>

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at eliminating the US Education Department, which he had termed as a “big con job” last month. Donald Trump reportedly proposed shuttering it in his first term as president, but Congress did not act. While Trump has derided the Education Department as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology, completing its dismantling is most likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979. Donald Trump had previously suggested he would seek to close the department through an executive order, though he recognised that achieving this goal would require support from Congress and teachers' unions. The closure of Education Department comes with consequences, potentially disrupting billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools and college tuition assistance programmes, according to the report.</p>

The massive brush fire that has been burning in southern Miami-Dade County this week has now grown bigger than the Palisades Fire of California that captured national headlines earlier this year. The wildfire sparked national news as a "life-threatening" Santa Ana windstorm produced 100 mph gusts throughout Southern California that hampered firefighting efforts for weeks, causing insurmountable damage and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes. At this time, there haven't been any reports of major damage to homes or businesses nearby, but the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said that Comcast has had patchy service due to the fires affecting some of their infrastructure. Vulnerable groups, including young children, the elderly and those with respiratory issues, should take extra precautions. It involved thousands of separate woodland and mixed-urban rural wildfires that burned over 500,000 acres, destroying over 300 homes and costing $300 million of lost timber value.</p>

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended Thursday 68 bridges across 19 states be evaluated with a "vulnerability assessment" to determine their risk of collapse if involved in a vessel collision in the wake of last year's deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. The 68 bridges were divided into two categories, "critical/essential" and "typical." Those that are not deemed critical/essential fall under the typical designation. Nearly a year ago, on March 26, 2024, a large cargo ship lost electrical power and crashed into the Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, and knocking eight roadworkers, six of whom died, into the Patapsco River. "Had the Key Bridge's owner, the Maryland Transportation Authority, or MDTA, conducted a vulnerability assessment based on recent vessel traffic as recommended by AASHTO, MDTA would have been aware that the Key Bridge was above the acceptable risk and would have had information to proactively reduce the bridge's risk of a collapse and loss of lives associated with a vessel collision with the bridge," NTSB said in a statement Thursday.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could cause "a little bit more chop" to markets ahead of the duties coming into effect on April 2, Bilton said, adding that he expected more positive news to come on fiscal boosts and deregulation, which could provide a "boost" in the second half of 2025.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico. For inflation, the range wisbetween about 2-1/2 and 3 percent, noting that any of those are possible. Though he also stressed, “measures of policy uncertainty have increased sharply in recent months.” Williams also addressed short-term inflation expectations, which have risen considerably in the wake of President Trump's proposed tariffs. Elsewhere, this week the Fed announced it will slow the rate with which it lets Treasury securities roll off its balance sheet to $5 billion, down from $25 billion starting next month.</p>

The company last month joined a growing list of businesses that have removed or altered diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives after President Trump issued two executive orders aimed at undoing federal DEI programs within the US government.

“We're losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,” Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said. Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. It would also prohibit the practice of “spread pricing” where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses. Jones said it is important to protect neighborhood pharmacies because they play a vital role in communities.</p>

Despite that jump, the Rays' season-ticket base is larger than it was last season, and 45% of those fans are new this year, Walsh says. For one thing, it is planning to hand out items that could be useful outdoors, such as hats and sunglasses. In September, the Rays announced an agreement with St. Petersburg and Pinellas County for a public contribution of roughly $600 million toward a $1.3 billion ballpark to replace Tropicana Field, which is now among MLB's oldest stadiums and widely considered one of the worst major pro sports venues in North America.

Humble Pie Productions, which trades as Studio Ramsay, has posted a turnover of £60.6m for the 12 months to 30 June, 2024, while it reported a pre-tax profit of £7.1m. The new results, which have been filed with Companies House, come after Gordon Ramsay's business reported a turnover of £7m and pre-tax profit of £226,459 in the 2021 calendar year. After a joint venture was signed with Fox in September 2021, the business has been commissioned to produce shows including Trailblazers for the BBC, Gordon's Food Stars of Fox and Next Level Chef for both ITV and Fox. In May 2024, City AM reported that Gordon Ramsay's restaurant empire made a turnover of £95.6m for the year to August 27, 2023, up from £78.9m. In July 2024, City AM also reported that Gordon Ramsay had teamed up with Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp to invest $100m (£77m) in HexClad, a maker of nonstick cookware.</p>

Conor McGregor deserves to fade into obscurity following his criminal acts, instead he's being paraded by Donald Trump as the face of Ireland on St Patrick's Day, says Maria Ward-Brennan Unfortunately for us, that name was everywhere on Monday, thanks to his visit with Donald Trump. Yet instead of being punished for his appalling behaviour, McGregor is paraded around the White House on St Patrick's Day. This was significant because St Patrick's Day is about much more than watching parades and wearing green. Ministers and State representatives are sent to 90 cities across 40 countries as part of a robust diplomatic push.</p>

So the economy has been weak, but inflation really does look as if it's pretty much under control. And then people might like to put their money in a very stable area called the Eurozone.

The decision follows “the Administration's review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments”. “Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “Securing the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors is essential to establishing U.S. leadership and ensuring that the American people can benefit from financial innovation and inclusion.” Back then, the Treasury estimated that Tornado Cash had been used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019.

Cryptocurrency trading has been banned in Pakistan for some time, with authorities cautioning risks regarding use of virtual currencies. “Virtual currencies/coins/tokens provide a high degree of anonymity and potentially can be used for facilitating illegal activities. “Regulating crypto could unlock Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) opportunities and create new revenue streams for the economy,” said economist Shahbaz Rana.</p>

The US Treasury Department said it is removing sanctions on cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash imposed in 2022 after the service was used by North Korean hackers to launder stolen tokens. 

The removal comes after an appeals court ruled last year that the Treasury overstepped its authority with the sanctions. A crypto token associated with Tornado Cash, known as TORN, jumped 72% following the announcement, according to prices on CoinMarketCap. </p>

However, many other countries, including major US trade partners, are just not ready to take on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, begging the question of who the US is competing against to become a “Bitcoin superpower.” On March 1, Swiss National Bank President Martin Schlegel said Bitcoin wasn't suitable as a reserve asset, citing stability, liquidity concerns and security risks. Germany's central bank chief, Joachim Nagel, has also dismissed the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has previously criticized Bitcoin as being a poor form of money. Governments can also create them to stabilize the price of goods that are in high demand. Furthermore, the US Bitcoin reserve allows the Treasury to purchase Bitcoin so long as it can do so in a budget-neutral manner that doesn't come at a cost to taxpayers.</p>

“These developments indicate potential capital rotation, as investors shift funds from Bitcoin to Ether and other altcoins in anticipation of better performance,” CEX.io analysts said. XRP volume leapt more than three-fold on Wednesday, the biggest trading spike for any major cryptocurrency this week. Analysts at B2BINPay, a crypto business payment provider, told DL News that investor enthusiasm for XRP will depend on “future events.” “If the SEC drops its appeal against Ripple and an XRP ETF is approved, prices may revisit previous highs or even reach new levels,” Bari said earlier this week.

Triple witching is a day that happens on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. This quarter's triple witching event is happening as concerns about Donald Trump's tariffs have remained. These patterns point to further Bitcoin price downside, with the immediate target being at $76,890, its March low.

Aaron Peak, personal finance expert at credit reference company CredAbility, said: "Bitcoin is notoriously volatile: prices can surge or crash unpredictably, so investors should always be cautious. Crypto miners use high-end computing rigs to perform calculations and are rewarded with bitcoin but after each halving, the reward decreases. Aaron Peak, personal finance expert at credit reference company CredAbility said: “Right now, miners – who verify bitcoin transactions – earn 6.25 bitcoins for each new block they add to the blockchain." The next bitcoin halving event is expected to happen in 2028, but it all depends on how quickly miners create new blocks, Peak explained. Peak said: "It will happen after another 210,000 blocks have been added to the blockchain, which usually takes around four years.</p>

These initiatives aim to ensure that the US government retains and strategically manages Bitcoin holdings rather than liquidating them at low market prices. Trump also urged Congress to pass new laws regulating stablecoins, which he believes could strengthen the US dollar's global dominance. “With the right legal framework, institutions large and small will be liberated to invest, innovate, and take part in one of the most exciting technological revolutions in modern history.” Trump's stance represents a stark contrast to past regulatory uncertainty, positioning his administration as the most Bitcoin-friendly in US history. Since taking office, Trump has signed several executive orders related to cryptocurrency, including:</p>

Testing this area as support has led to sharp price rebounds in March. According to analyst CryptOpus, Bitcoin remains tightly correlated with traditional equity markets, particularly the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq 100 (NDX), both of which are displaying bear flag patterns on the charts. A bear flag forms when the price consolidates higher inside an ascending parallel channel. BTC is following a similar bear flag structure, with $84,000 acting as the lower trendline support. Moreover, Bitcoin's correlation with equities has grown due to a broader decline in risk-on sentiment, led by the US President Donald Trump's global trade war.</p>

Accepting Bitcoin directly for online orders is less common unless the merchants partner with a delivery service that supports crypto. Other than El Salvador, in places like Lugano, Switzerland and Mossel Bay, South Africa, many merchants, mostly small retailers, accept Bitcoin as a legitimate method of payment.

Global trade tensions and fluctuating market dynamics are making investors reconsider their strategies, the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding: “This trend isn't solely rooted in fear, it also reflects a more pragmatic approach to investing,” explained Lee. “This means fewer fresh coins in circulation, reduced liquidity, and lower market participation,” added the analyst.

Amid global economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin has emerged as a preferred store of value for investors seeking protection against currency devaluation. With central banks adopting expansionary monetary policies, Bitcoin's scarcity and decentralized nature make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets. These developments have significantly lowered entry barriers for institutional and retail investors, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset. While market uncertainties persist, factors such as institutional adoption, supply constraints, and regulatory advancements suggest that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 or even $200,000 in the future. Readers are strongly encouraged to conduct their own research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.</p>

Crypto has been on a wild ride since President Donald Trump's presidential election win in November. Last year, Saylor made a bold call, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $13 million by 2045, which implies 15,810% upside from current prices (as of March 18). At $13 million, Bitcoin would make up 7% of global wealth, which he views as a plausible scenario. In late February, he wrote on X, "Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin." Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 838% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 164% for the S&P 500.</p>

Interoperability efforts will aim to create seamless connections between different blockchain networks, enabling the transfer of assets and data across platforms. In conclusion, cryptocurrency development is essential for blockchain applications as it underpins their core functionalities and value propositions. By integrating cryptocurrencies, blockchain applications can achieve greater transparency, immutability, and decentralisation, key characteristics that set them apart from traditional systems.

It is worth noting that these products have now seen five consecutive days of inflows. This signals that institutional demand is coming back after an excruciating streak of disastrous outflows. As reported by U.Today, Bitcoin ETFs had hemorrhaged more than $6 billion in less than two months due to investors souring on risk assets amid global trade tensions and recession fears. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has accounted for virtually all of the recent inflows, adding $172 million. Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.</p>

Last month, Lazarus Group struck crypto exchange Bybit, draining $1.4 billion in ether (ETH) from the platform. Recently, some of the stolen funds have been converted into bitcoin, with 12,836 BTC distributed across 9,117 unique wallets, as Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou confirmed. Tesla acquired its bitcoin stash four years ago and has been HODLing ever since, making it the world's fourth-largest publicly listed company in terms of BTC holdings.

Bitcoiners waiting for retail to show up might be missing the obvious — it's already here, a crypto executive says. “Retail is likely entering through ETFs — the paper Bitcoin layer — which doesn't show up onchain,” Ju said. “This keeps the realized cap lower than if the funds were flowing directly to exchange deposit wallets,” he added, noting that 80% of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows come from retail investors — a trend that Binance analysts already once observed in October last year. Sorry to change my view, but it now looks pretty clear that we're entering a bear market,” he said. Ju explained that certain indicators are showing a lack of new liquidity, which is likely being driven by macro factors.</p>

Additionally, cryptocurrencies' low correlation with traditional assets—such as stocks, bonds, and gold— makes them a valuable diversification tool for reducing portfolio risk. For nations or corporations facing international sanctions, cryptocurrencies can act as a hedge, helping to ensure the free flow of funds. While the impact on investors is largely positive, potential downsides include excessive speculation leading to market bubbles and fewer opportunities for short-term traders. For countries facing foreign exchange shortages or economic sanctions—such as Russia and Iran—cryptocurrency reserves could offer a crucial tool to circumvent traditional financial systems. As the cryptocurrency market matures, investors may increasingly seek diversified asset allocations, expanding beyond Bitcoin into altcoins, stablecoins, and emerging digital currencies.</p>

If someone is still unsure whether they've either been vaccinated or had the disease, there's a test that checks for measles-specific antibodies in your blood. If someone has had two doses of the measles vaccine in their lifetime, there is likely no need for a booster shot. Many people who received the old vaccine lost their immunity within a few years, leaving them vulnerable to measles later in life. Individuals traveling to areas experiencing measles outbreaks, including within the U.S., can also consider getting another dose even if they're fully vaccinated, Chin-Hong said. Additionally, people with weakened immune systems — due to medical conditions or medications — might not maintain full protection, even if they're fully vaccinated.</p>

The Odysseus spacecraft made a rough landing on the moon last year, toppling over and rendering much of its equipment unusable, but an onboard NASA radio telescope called ROLSES-1  was able to make some observations

The first successful use of a radio telescope on the moon has kicked off a new era of astronomy that could shed light on the cosmic dark ages – despite a bumpy landing.

NASA's ROLSES-1 (Radio wave Observations at the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath) telescope was mounted on the Odysseus lander, an Intuitive Machines spacecraft that made the first ever private lunar landing last year. While Odysseus was the first such spacecraft to survive a landing, it tipped on its side, rendering most of the equipment on…

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-vaccine-mrna-pancreas-nih'>An mRNA cancer vaccine may offer long-term protection</a></h2><b>Source:</b> Science News Magazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 13:00:00 <p>
It's a move that could significantly hamper the advancement of mRNA vaccines in cancer research and patient care, Sasson says. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer can be tricky; it kills more than 450,000 people globally every year, so patients often learn they have the disease at an advanced stage. Nevertheless, the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is around 13 percent, meaning that five years after diagnosis, 87 out of 100 patients will have died. Some of these errors produce mutant tumor proteins, which the immune system can recognize like red flags warning danger.

China's Ninth National Forest Resources Inventory counted an average of 426 trees per acre (1,052 trees/hectare) across the country in 2019, which is much higher than the new study's estimate of 279 trees per acre (689 trees/hectare), Guo told Live Science in an email. "In densely forested areas, overlapping canopies obstruct the accurate detection of mid-story and understory trees, leading to lower-than-actual tree counts," Guo said. Incorporating terrestrial lidar data and improving the software could provide more accurate tree counts, he added. China's tree population may soon increase, however, because the country is planting seedlings at a dizzying rate.

Heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen, appeared later — they were created through nuclear fusion reactions in the first stars. These water molecules were highly concentrated in cloud cores, dense clumps of gas that are thought to be where stars and planets first formed. Scientists figure out how different factors, like temperature, density, and pressure, relate to each other in the matter inside neutron stars. New high-resolution X-ray data reveal that turbulent gas motion, not just black hole activity, prevents star formation in cluster cores. New observations suggest elongated gas filaments that stretch into space may be feeding supermassive black holes.</p>

Regent has been actively expanding its tech news site portfolio, with its recent acquisition of Foundry, the parent company of leading publications such as PCWorld, Macworld, InfoWorld, CIO, and TechAdvisor. "We believe this next chapter under Regent can help maintain TechCrunch's influence and support its continued growth," Yahoo said in a statement. Sign in to access your portfolio</p>

The escalated spending and promise of further increases aligns with similar large-scale AI investments by China's other tech giants.

Judge Robert Sutherland could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the woman had been reckless in hitting her son or if it was an accident. Judge Sutherland said later the boy was taken by police to make a statement, which led to the court action against his mother. Judge Sutherland questioned if the presence of boy's step-grandmother may have had an impact on his account. Judge Sutherland said he had to weigh up if the woman had been reckless in hitting her son, or if it was simply an accident.

Restlessness at night: Persistent poor sleep leads to significant fatigue, impaired balance and slower cognitive responses, dramatically increasing the likelihood of falls. Social withdrawal or mood changes: Isolation can lead to mental health concerns and a decreased quality of life. This has not only improved resident safety but also eased the workload for our staff by enabling more proactive care,” said Liesen Clemons, general manager of Park Senior Villas – La Cañada. The technology is gaining traction across senior living communities, offering a privacy-first approach that prioritizes dignity and safety.

Spooked by generative AI's sudden advance, governments initially scrambled to develop guardrails, as major tech companies rapidly integrated the technology into their products. But, faced with America's new direction, European officials are now pivoting their messaging toward investment and innovation rather than safety. "Without fair use access to copyrighted material...America loses, as does the success of democratic AI," OpenAI said. Like its peers, Google also opposes state-by-state regulations in the US that it claims would undermine America's technological leadership. Despite the push for minimal oversight, industry observers caution that generative AI carries inherent risks, with or without government regulation.</p>

The silver lining, if there is such a thing with an Achilles, is that Woods has plenty of experience working his way back from an injury and knows the physical and mental demands it will require to regain a personally acceptable level of form. According to friend and peer Fred Couples, Tiger is doing quite well less than two weeks removed from surgery. Couples offered an update on his buddy during a Champions Tour stop in Newport Beach on Friday, explaining that Woods was in "great spirits" when they recently spoke. As soon as it happened, he got back to me, and I texted him on a couple other things -- about TGL, his daughter just won that state soccer thing," Couples said.

At long last, it appears that Aaron Rodgers might be close to finalizing his plans for the 2025 season. Rodgers' time in Pittsburgh revolved around meeting with coaches as the 41-year-old continues to sort through his options. It's safe to assume that Rodgers spent time with Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, whose background includes successful partnerships with Ryan Tannehill and Justin Fields. The Minnesota Vikings, who had also been linked with Rodgers, have reportedly decided to instead move forward with 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy, who missed his entire rookie season season due to injury. The Steelers have a contingency plan in place if they don't sign Rodgers after re-signing Mason Rudolph, who went 8-4-1 as a starter during his first go-around with the Steelers.</p>

SMU is hiring Maryland athletic director Damon Evans to serve in the same position, sources told CBS Sports. Evans will replace Rick Hart, who helped guide SMU into the ACC last year. Hartzell is believed to have made a run at Texas athletics director Chris Del Conte, who brushed away those rumors in February. The timing of SMU hiring Evans is particularly interesting for Maryland as speculation continues to swirl around Villanova's interest in Terrapins basketball coach Kevin Willard. Villanova fired Kyle Neptune after three seasons in which the Wildcats did not make an NCAA Tournament berth.</p>

Noteboom allowed a pressure rate per dropback of 10.1% in his games, but he also wasn't fully healthy, either. Noteboom can play both guard and tackle, but may be better inside at this stage in his career. Andrews should garner interest since he is still a reliable starter, especially with his experience in the league. Not only did Smith finish with a 15.9% pressure rate but that number went up to 17.8% in Detroit after the Lions acquired him. Fotu was a solid rotational player in Arizona before signing with the New York Jets and playing just two games.</p>

Chase has $1 million ($58,823.53 for each game active with a 17-game regular season) in every year of his contract. In addition to strong contract guarantees, Burrow got an extremely player-friendly structure from the Bengals. A substantial fifth day of the league year roster bonus in 2027 would also be required. Chase would be vulnerable to being released until the option was exercised since his 2026 base salary isn't guaranteed. Cincinnati's feet could have been held to fire with established team precedents for four-year deals until there were the right circumstances.</p>

For example, last year's women's Final Four had 4 million more viewers than the men's, in large part because of Indiana Fever player Caitlin Clark. The inspiration for the pub came from an online article Hallum said she saw a few years back, where someone opened a women's sports bar in Portland, Oregon. Soon after, Hallum and du Plessis decided Austin should have one too. Hallum said the pub will be partnering with local teams such as Austin Rise FC, a soccer team founded and led by a group of women.</p>

Having it here in spring training this year was tantamount to a test with big-league players. If you've seen this ABS challenge system in reality, though, the time suck is very minimal. It's certainly worthwhile to fix missed calls, too, so those aren't considered a waste of time. We measure it and give catchers credit in defensive discussions for their ability to change balls into strikes. There are discussions on "framing metrics" that have even bled into the Hall of Fame with candidates this past year like Brian McCann and Russell Martin that we'll continue to have with Yadier Molina and into the foreseeable future.</p>

McCasland remembers one year at North Texas that he thought his team had a pretty good offense. Not surprisingly, his name has been linked to just about every coaching vacancy in the game.</p>

If there was an early NFL offseason loser, it may be the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers' defensive line will also look very different, as Javon Hargrave, Maliek Collins and Leonard Floyd are no longer on roster. General manager John Lynch says the team has a plan, and "some big things coming our way." Ultimately, this 49ers roster was due for a reset after "doubling down" last year following San Francisco's overtime Super Bowl loss. So guys like Leonard Floyd and Maliek — believe me, their impact was felt.</p>

Think of Miami QB Cam Ward as a player who is in Minecraft creative mode on the hardest mods. However, he's shown flashes of some big boy quarterbacking from inside the pocket and process that you can at least work with. Ward has a tendency to drift in the pocket and his base will become compromised because every throw is off platform. Ward's small hands might play into his lack of accuracy outside the numbers, but I think it's more just wonky lower body mechanics. You can see how Ward's body sort of jams up when he throws the ball, and it leads to sailed passes like this one.</p>

Some senators voiced their opposition to the bill — Sen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, said that more Montanans hunt than rodeo, and Sen. Susan Webber, D-Browning, objected to the bill not specifically including Native American components. “I just had hoped that they would have included the Indian Relay, which is a few centuries old here as part of this bill,” Webber said.

According to former Steelers running back Najee Harris, who signed with the Los Angeles Chargers in free agency, Pittsburgh's offensive woes weren't necessarily an accident. I really didn't have nobody to almost learn from on the offensive side. I think the veteran guy on that team was a two-, three-year vet. And I feel like [in L.A.], like we've got a lot of veterans that I can learn even more stuff from, even at the quarterback position, and the O-line position. So it was an interesting year there, I'll just say that.</p>

Boise State got that far last year behind star running back and Heisman Trophy finalist Ashton Jeanty, who's now off to the NFL as an expected first-round pick in April's draft. While Jeanty leaves a gaping hole on Boise State's roster, he's not the only important loss. New coach Bob Chesney, Cignetti's replacement, maintained the momentum by going 9-4 in his first year at James Madison. James Madison, which did struggle a bit once Sun Belt play began, is looking for even more in 2025. He's never won fewer than nine games as a head coach, and competing in the AAC gives his Green Wave plenty of visibility.</p>

Germany went behind to Sandro Tonali's early opener, but turned the game around after the break following a few tactical adjustments by coach Julian Nagelsmann. Speaking after the win in Italy, Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann was quick to point out that it's only half time in the tie. He also hinted at making a few changes to his starting eleven for the return leg. Tim Kleindienst, who scored straight after coming on as a substitute at half-time for Jonathan Burkardt, could be handed a start on Sunday. So could Nico Schlotterbeck, who replaced David Raum at left-back after an unimpressive first half from the Leipzig man.</p>

At 6'2, Prince is a bucket-getter who has been very efficient in Israel this winter. She's also averaged 8.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1 block while shooting 36.9% from three. The Mercury will be centered around their new trio of Alyssa Thomas, Kahleah Copper, and Satou Sabally next season. All three players can score at a high level and, at their best, should be able to form a formidable lineup that can compete with the best of them. Prince, who began her pro career nearly a decade ago in Phoenix, will hope to show she has what it takes.</p>

On February 5, President Trump signed the “Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports” executive order. The order maintains that American laws require educational institutions to guarantee biological women “an equal opportunity to participate in sports” under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. The order recognizes only two sexes, male and female, and defines sex as “individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female,” which, the order states, is not changeable. The order is also facing legal challenges for discriminating against transgender people. ‘Legal rights do not automatically translate into liberation in an unequal society'—An Interview with Historian Vijay Prashad on Caste Politics, War, and Economic Justice: Part 1</p>

Even as a freshman last season, Guerra led the Cougars in batting average with his .357 showing. Guerro was the lone returnee who showed much power, even though both Sager and Williams each hit a home run in 2024. Even in seasons where it doesn't reach the big-school state tournament, Jefferson rolls out a group of pitchers that don't allow many walks, base runners or lengthy times in between pitches. Last year's edition had a 25-13 record, leaving longtime coach John Lowery, Sr. with an overall lifetime record of 1,442 and 382 in his coaching career at Harpers Ferry High School and Jefferson High School.</p>

An overtime win on Friday night against North Iowa last weekend clinched a Robertson Cup Playoff Berth for Minot securing a return to the playoffs for the reigning Central Cup champions. Also heating up in the goal-scoring department this past weekend was Tauros' forward Noah Gibbs. Gibbs was able to find the back of the net twice on Friday night, which was good for his second and third goals in a Tauros uniform since being acquired by Minot. Additionally the Tauros posted an unblemished 5-0 record that March against eventual playoff teams. Additionally, Minot has continued to hold teams under an average of two goals per game.</p>

11-seed Iowa State women's basketball team is expecting a lot different from its First Four victory over Princeton when the Cyclones face No. Michigan (22-10) brings its five-guard offense to Notre Dame's home court when it faces Iowa State (23-11) in a 10:30 a.m. game that will be televised on ESPN2. Iowa State will face a dramatically different pace than it did when the Cyclones beat Princeton in Wednesday's First Four game. Unlike Michigan, Iowa State has a strong post player in 6-foot-3 center Audi Crooks, who averages 23.3 points and 7.5 assists. Olson and Swords are the only freshman teammates who average at least 15 points per game this season.</p>

Iowa State (24-9) is adapting to the absence of Gilbert, who had a team-high 4.1 assists per game. The Cyclones are one of only 31 Division I teams — and 11 in this tournament — to have four players scoring at least 10 points per game. “On any good team, when you have adversity and challenges it's important, the next-man-up mentality” Otzelberger said. “Obviously you want everyone to be at full strength, but that's just not the case right now,” Heise said. Lipscomb coach Lennie Acuff didn't expect Iowa State's injuries to play a major role in Friday's game.</p>

That's kind of what we have to do, is just continue to grind and compete,” said McCollum, who won four D-II national titles at Northwest Missouri State before taking the Drake job last April. “It's loser goes home, and we didn't do enough to come away with a win.” At one point, the Tigers ripped off 10 consecutive points, closing within 52-51 on Mark Mitchell's free throw with 4:28 remaining. Drake went 12 of 24 from the foul line but survived to snap a four-game losing streak in first-round NCAA Tournament games. The Bulldogs will play Saturday for a spot in their first Sweet 16 since 1971.</p>

Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry exited Thursday night's 117-114 win over the Toronto Raptors and was quickly ruled out with a pelvic contusion after a hard fall in the third quarter. Things went wrong when Curry hit the ground, seemingly landing hard on his backside and immediately feeling quite a bit of pain. He was ruled out a short time later, finishing the night with 17 points in 25 minutes. After the game, Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters that Curry was undergoing an MRI on his "pelvic/tailbone area." Hopefully it's not bad," Kerr said via Anthony Slater of The Athletic.</p>

“That matchup, we will be going up against an amazing player in (Eli Sancomb), who clinched player of the year earlier today,” said Williamstown's Parker Schramm, who scored 17 of his game-high 20 points the second half as his team left Wyoming East in its rear-view mirror after erasing a 26-24 halftime deficit. Wyoming East, which entered the semifinal game winners of 10 straight, gave Williamstown all it could handle for two-plus quarters. Williamstown's Cruz Isaly (24) signals to teammates during Thursday's Class AA state semifinal game against Wyoming East at the Charleston Coliseum and Convention Center. “We ran into a really good basketball team today,” Wyoming East head coach Kent McBride said after his club ended the season at 19-4. “We gave it a heck of an effort and I thought there were points in the game where our youth really showed,” McBride said.</p>

On Thursday, things hit a new low when they embarrassingly lost 115-98 to the lowly Charlotte Hornets, their second consecutive loss. Fortunately, it seems as though Brunson is on track to return during the regular season. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed Thursday that Brunson is out of his walking boot and doing some light shooting, an important step as he works to recover from the sprained ankle he suffered against the Los Angeles Lakers earlier this month. Bridges, Josh Hart and OG Anunoby are all role players who need a star to orbit around. The Knicks can't have a limited Brunson if they hope to make any playoff noise.</p>

Even when it comes to World Cup preparation, they'll get to face either Mexico or Canada in the Nations League third-place game making it a much bigger affair than the average third-place game. With both of them on the pitch, this is a completely different side. Chopping and changing things constantly isn't sustainable for a team of the USMNT's level. Most teams would struggle with their third-choice left back and striker in a match but the knock-on effect from both at the same time makes balancing a squad tough. On one hand, it's under 500 days until the World Cup, and that can be a moment to panic.</p>

It marked not only Columbia's first-ever win in the NCAA Tournament, but also its first victory over a Big Ten squad. You'll see staffers holding up different signs, some covered with internet memes or stills from movie scenes. One day, she took the plan to Griffith and said, what if we did that?

It's a substitute Cecilio Waterman who cuts through the counter catching Joe Scally out and putting an excellent finish past Matt Turner. He received treatment after going up for a header and will be replaced by Mark McKenzie. It's quite an important role especially when some of those are coming via mistakes in possession. They will definitely be happy about the fact that Panama didn't manage a single shot on target but with just one shot on target (from Josh Sargent 19 minutes in, who was unlucky not to score at some point this half), there's definitely room for improvmeent htere. That's in comparison to Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte both logging over 3,500 minutes each for their clubs.</p>

The lowest any player got Thursday was Keith Mitchell, who pushed his score to 6under going into No. Both Velo and Theegala had it to 4 under on Thursday before backing up late in their first rounds. Tommy Fleetwood had an oddly dreadful ball-striking round (120th in strokes gained approach) and missed a few short putts on Thursday; he's just inside the cut line at 1 over going to Friday. Schauffele, as mentioned, doesn't look comfortable with his swing at the moment, but the fact he was able to grind out a 70 without anything close to his A-game means if things click soon he could make a quick move up this leaderboard. Theegala at 28-1 has some value given he was tied for the lead before a couple rough closing holes.</p>

In ultrasound, AI-driven automation could help alleviate the physical strain on sonographers and improve imaging consistency. NVIDIA's cuDSS library is already enhancing large-scale engineering simulations, such as electromagnetic modeling and computational drug design, by making efficient use of shared CPU-GPU memory. This technology, integrated into platforms like Ansys HFSS and Altair OptiStruct, allows researchers to run more complex simulations faster. Isomorphic Labs, a Google DeepMind-founded company focused on AI-driven drug discovery, has built a drug design engine on Google Cloud using NVIDIA GPUs, aiming to scale and refine AI models that could significantly improve therapeutic development. In addition to drug research, the partnership will enhance Google Cloud's AI infrastructure, making NVIDIA's Blackwell-based GPUs available for computational workloads across biotech and medical imaging.</p>

What would you say is the most important thing hospitals and health systems should know about digital transformation efforts that perhaps they don't quite have a firm grasp on to begin with? Larger enterprises will likely have one or more additional positions as part of the broader transformational leadership team. In all cases, it is crucial to have senior business leaders who are co-leading and/or sponsoring or co-sponsoring, at the executive level, any transformational initiative. Getting outside perspectives from management consultants, advisors, peers, customers, patients and other stakeholders can inform your planning. After serving as board advisor for a digital transformation initiative at SE Health, I became their CDO and senior vice president earlier this year.</p>

Commentary from Aveanna Healthcare and Enhabit executives provided reason for optimism on this front, as both companies shared some encouraging news related to their payer strategies – notably, their comments suggest how strong payer relationships not only create positive financial trends but can lead to improvements in staffing and clinical capacity. Enhabit has shown a willingness to walk away from high-profile contracts when they no longer serve the company. “This, combined with continued staffing and cost disciplines, should allow us to expand home health margins as we exit 2025 despite CMS rate reimbursement increases not keeping pace with our overall market inflation,” Ryan Solomon, CFO of Enhabit, said during the Q4 earnings call earlier this month. This earnings season, I was particularly interested in the comments about how BrightSpring and Pennant are planning to grow.

The massive PBM is pivoting to a cost-based reimbursement model, which it says will reduce variation in how pharmacies are paid. Under such models, pharmacies are generally paid the drug's acquisition cost, plus a defined markup and occasionally an additional dispensing fee. When asked for more details, a spokesperson said Optum Rx's approach “incorporates multiple market indices and data to inform how drugs will be reimbursed.” “We have seen announcements like this in the past by PBMs that claim they want to work with independent pharmacies. Optum Rx, for example, announced the pharmacy reimbursement change one day after it released plans to lower prior authorization requirements on dozens of drugs.</p>

While the city agenda item brought up the specter of a possible acquisition of the hospital by a for-profit or nonprofit entity in line with industry trends, TMH officials said there are "no current plans to transition to a different ownership or operational model." "In fact, one goal of our relationship with FSU is to preserve our independence and avoid acquisition by a large for-profit hospital system," Derzypolski said in an emailed statement. The hospital serves 21 counties across North Florida and Georgia, according to agenda materials. Goad said the city will have to fully look at the ramifications and conduct a legal analysis before any decision is made, but he said he wouldn't assume that TMH is looking to pull away from city ownership: "I don't think that'll happen." Goad clarified that assets include everything but vehicles, yet the city has no financial obligation if something needs to be repaired or replaced, meaning there's no impact to the city's budget.</p>

A vulnerability in ChatGPT that was identified last year is being used by would-be cyberattackers to target security flaws in artificial intelligence systems, with the healthcare industry one of the top targets, according to a report from Veriti. This vulnerability, despite being classified as medium severity, has already been weaponized in real-world attacks, the report found. The investigation found that in one week, multiple parties attempted more than 10,000 cyberattack attempts. "This could allow an attacker to steal sensitive data or impact the availability of the AI tool," Scott Gee, AHA deputy national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, said in a statement. Ransomware attacks have dominated, accounting for over 70% of successful cyberattacks on healthcare organizations in the past two years.</p>

AI is already transforming health care delivery at every level, including easing appointment scheduling and discharge, augmenting diagnostic decisions and streamlining resource allocation, just to name a few. A recent Market Insights report from the AHA Center for Health Innovation, “Building and Implementing an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan for Health Care,” provides health care leaders with an important starting point, a playbook for allocating resources and a road map for hospital and health care executives looking to expand their adoption of AI's capabilities. And while individual hospitals and health systems will proceed at their own pace, weaving AI-assisted methods and procedures into their care delivery in ways that work best for their organization and the patients they serve, this report provides the foundational building blocks for many institutions who want to create an effective AI action plan.

A PPP is based on contractual collaboration between different actors in the public sector (universities, hospitals, research institutes, etc. These collaborative initiatives, like those of the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) program, help break down traditional barriers by providing a cooperative space that is conducive to innovation. These large-scale projects make it possible to deal with health challenges that are too ambitious for a single actor to tackle alone – such as rare diseases and the integration of health data – transforming competitors into collaborators. Our contributions take various forms, such as providing our in-house expertise, robust data, new technologies and/or funding, each with a unique objective: to solve a common public health problem that would be impossible to achieve alone.

Oklahoma's insurance commissioner is warning that people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace could see sizeable increases in their health insurance premiums if federal enhanced Advanced Premium Tax Credits are not extended by Dec. 31. Commissioner Glen Mulready said the permanent extension of $338 billion of federal health insurance subsidies looks more unlikely, which could lead to a significant spike in health insurance premiums in 2026. "While there might be other potential solutions considered by Congress this year, Oklahoma's leaders and citizens need to be prepared for the consequences of these subsidies ending with significant changes in health insurance costs anticipated," the Republican commissioner said in a news release. "This is why it's so important that the Legislature pass bills (like these), so we're not overwhelming our premium payers in Oklahoma with additional costs that may not make sense." Lower- and middle-income individuals or families who depend on credits to pay for insurance coverage will be most affected.</p>

The segment has witnessed major technological upheavals that should have a long-standing impact. Moreover, these stocks are considered defensive, meaning they tend to remain stable regardless of the prevalent market conditions. Mutual funds, in general, reduce transaction costs and diversify portfolios without an array of commission charges that are mostly associated with stock purchases (read more: Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money). We have thus selected three such healthcare mutual funds that boast a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), have positive three-year and five-year annualized returns, minimum initial investments within $5000, and carry a low expense ratio.

With a market capitalization of $31.9 billion, the company operates in over 30 countries and employs more than 48,000 professionals worldwide. Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as "large-cap stocks," Cardinal Health fits this bill perfectly.

Cardinal Health climbed over 1% on March 18, defying the broader market downturn as investors sought refuge in defensive healthcare stocks.

Stable or even recurring revenues can be earned through insurance premiums, patient care contracts, and testing services agreements. Looking forward, this sector is poised to benefit from tailwinds such as the aging population, which means rising prevalence of chronic diseases. Advances in telehealth, data analytics, and personalized medicine are likely to create new revenue opportunities for companies that can successfully digitize. As a group, revenues beat analysts' consensus estimates by 1.6% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line. "We delivered strong second quarter financial results while taking significant strategic and operational actions to position us for future growth," said Jason Hollar, CEO of Cardinal Health.</p>

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), a division within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tasked with conducting research to improve health care quality, is reportedly at risk of experiencing widespread layoffs. Concerns have emerged that the Trump administration may target the small government agency for significant staffing reductions. AHRQ plays a key role in analyzing health care systems and practices to enhance patient outcomes and efficiency. The potential layoffs could impact its ability to fulfill its mandate, which includes producing evidence-based research on topics such as patient safety, medical errors, and cost-effective treatments. While no official announcement has been made regarding the scale or timing of these layoffs, fears about their likelihood have sparked discussions among stakeholders in the health care sector.</p>

In general, humans cannot recall events from the first three years of life – a phenomenon known as infantile amnesia. One theory suggests this occurs because the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for episodic memory, is not fully developed during infancy. These insights align with recent studies in rodents, which demonstrate that memories created during infancy can persist into adulthood but remain inaccessible for retrieval without direct stimulation of hippocampal engrams or reminder cues, the authors note.

Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo were seemingly still in love when they filmed Southern Charm season 10 — but after breaking up, not all their onscreen interactions have aged well.

He detailed Paige's inner thoughts, explaining, “One day she'll text me and say, ‘Let's build a f—ing farmhouse in the middle of nowhere.'

"Ms. Lively's recent motion to dismiss herself from the self-concocted disaster she initiated is one of the most abhorrent examples of abusing our legal system," Freedman said in a statement provided to JustJared.com. As we said yesterday in response to Mr. Reynolds' same cowardly measures, we will continue to hold Ms. Lively accountable for her actions of pure malice which include falsely accusing my clients of harassment and retaliation. Her fantastical claims will be swiftly debunked as discovery moves forward, easily disproved with actual, evidentiary proof." Ryan Reynolds‘ legal team also just filed paperwork to dismiss the Justin Baldoni complaint against him.

Ben Foster and Laura Prepon are in the middle of a messy divorce and they both have allegations about the other in newly-filed court documents. Now, Ben has filed an amended divorce petition in which he accuses Laura of "inappropriate marital conduct." In the court documents, which were obtained by In Touch, Ben says the "irreconcilable differences" have made him and Laura “unable to live together successfully as husband and wife.” “[Laura] asserts the affirmative defense to any allegations brought against her that the ill conduct of [Ben] was a justifiable cause for any conduct complained of against her and [Laura] therefore requests that this court dismiss [Ben's] cause of action for divorce," her lawyer said.
