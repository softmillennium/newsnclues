Five members of Venezuela's opposition have sought refuge inside the Argentinian embassy, fearing arrest and repression. At Sayeda Zeinab, neighbours join forces during Ramadan to serve meals, fostering community and compassion in Cairo. Even as the war rages on, Ukrainians are reassured that the US president did not bend to Russia's ceasefire demands. Sympathy towards wartime Russia has deep historical roots, back to the Cold War era and earlier. Despite setbacks, young leaders and local initiatives inspire hope for a peaceful future in the world's youngest nation.</p>

He had previously been appointed to a local Washington DC court by George W Bush, Obama's Republican predecessor. Boasberg issued a 14-day block on any such deportations, finding that the Alien Enemies Act did not provide a basis for Trump's assertion that Tren de Aragua's presence in the United States amounted to an act of war. Lindsay Toczylowski, a California-based lawyer for the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, accused Trump of waging “sickening” psychological warfare against asylum seekers and migrants. Despite Trump calling the Venezuelan migrants “heinous monsters”, relatives of Francisco Javier García Casique, 24, say he is innocent after they spotted him in a recent video showing numerous detained Venezuelans being transported to an El Salvador prison. However, in Cobb county, Georgia, on Thursday, authorities announced the arrest of another purported Tren de Aragua member, identified as Ricardo Gonzales.</p>

Heathrow said its backup power supply designed for emergencies worked as expected, but it wasn't enough to run the whole airport. Heathrow originally said it expected to reopen just before midnight Friday, though with “significant disruption over the coming days.” “I was like, you're joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York. At Heathrow, a family of five traveling to Dallas showed up in the hopes their flight home — still listed as delayed — would take off. But when Andrea Sri brought her brother, sister-in-law and their three children to the airport, they were told by police that there would be no flight.</p>

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar amid mass protests against the move and Israel's resumption of hostilities in Gaza. JERUSALEM — As Israeli forces carried out more strikes in a renewed Gaza offensive, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed forward on the home front to oust two senior officials in a development that roiled Israeli politics. “After many long months of stage-setting, a constitutional crisis could be fast upon Israel.” Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.</p>

His arrest has sparked the largest protests since 2013, when Turkey was rocked by mass anti-government demonstrations that left eight people dead. Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned. Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a “trustee mayor,” if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. The Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement that “the necessary investigation is being carried out meticulously by our security units” and “those responsible will be brought to justice.” It said that measures had been taken to secure Iraqi diplomatic missions in Ankara, Istanbul and Gaziantep.</p>

Last week, Hemedti released a rare video, filmed in an undisclosed location, urging his fighters not to abandon the palace. Both sides have faced allegations of massive human rights abuses, including arbitrary detentions, torture and killings, which they deny.

He has argued that the legal entry parole programs launched under his Democratic predecessor overstepped the boundaries of federal law and called for their termination in a 20 January executive order. Biden launched a parole entry program for Venezuelans in 2022 and expanded it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those nationalities.

Boat carrying 13 people capsizes in rough seas while travelling to island of Nusa Penida A snorkelling boat carrying 13 people, including 11 Australian tourists, capsized in rough seas off Indonesia's resort island of Bali on Friday, killing a woman and injuring two others, police said. The Sea Dragon boat was on its way from a port in Bali to Nusa Penida, a popular tiny island near Bali, when it was overwhelmed by high waves, local police spokesperson Agus Widiono said. The group was looking at underwater scenery when their boat was hit by a large wave that threw a 39-year-old woman, identified by police as Anna Maree, overboard. It was followed by a second wave that capsized the boat in Kelingking waters, Widiono said.</p>

The airport lifted its closure order just before sunset, restoring operations after a disruption that affected hundreds of thousands of passengers worldwide. Witnesses in west London reported hearing a massive explosion, followed by a fireball and plumes of smoke, as the blaze engulfed the electrical substation near Heathrow Airport. Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports for international travel, had its busiest January on record earlier this year, with over 6.3 million passengers, a more than 5 percent increase compared to last year. The cause of the fire remains unclear, but authorities have stated that there is no suggestion of foul play, according to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. The fire's widespread impact, which took seven hours to control, prompted criticism that Britain was ill-prepared for a disaster or potential attack, as a single blaze was able to shut down Europe's busiest airport.</p>

Explaining his motivation, Gordievsky said: “I hated the communist system, I wanted to fight against it,” in an archive recording, which featured in a BBC documentary Secrets and Spies: A Nuclear Game. “Gordievsky was once described to me by an MI6 guy as the only truly ideological Soviet spy he could think of,” wrote journalist Mark Urban on X after the news of his death. However as Richard Norton-Taylor notes in his Guardian obituary he was lonely without his family “and suffered the withdrawal symptoms that spies so often experience once the excitement of their secret life and defection has died down”. They had two daughters, Maria and Anna, who are believed to still live in the UK.</p>

Turkey, which helped build and fund the hospital, said Israeli troops at one point used it as a base. Hospitals can lose their protected status under international law if they are used for military purposes, but any operations against them must be proportional. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Friday that his country would carry out operations in Gaza “with increasing intensity” until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive. Displaced Palestinians fled northern Gaza along a coastal road Friday carrying their belongings, firewood and other items on horse-drawn carts.

"There is no way that Heathrow should be taken out completely because of a failure in one power substation." Since the Heathrow closure was announced, a Friday morning flight from Halifax to London was cancelled, as were six more that had been scheduled for later in the day, which were departing from Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Vancouver. Heathrow is such a vital piece of British infrastructure that it should have failsafe systems," Charles told Reuters. Prices at hotels around Heathrow jumped, with booking sites offering rooms for 500 pounds ($925 Cdn), roughly five times the normal price levels. British Airways has warned in the past that Heathrow is so overstretched that recovering from disruption can cause even more chaos, as planes and staff must be properly repositioned even as the facility runs at full capacity.</p>

The Israeli military announced on Friday that it had killed Osama Tabash, the head of Hamas' military intelligence in southern Gaza, during an airstrike on Thursday, Reuters reported. The IDF also said that his killing was a major setback to Hamas's intelligence-gathering efforts and its ability to target Israeli forces in the region. Israel's military offensive in Gaza has entered its fourth day, with ground forces expanding operations in both northern and southern parts of the enclave. Meanwhile, Israeli defence minister Israel Katz has warned of further escalation. Katz said on Friday that Israeli forces would “intensify” their campaign against Hamas and apply “all military and civilian pressure, including evacuation of the Gaza population south and implementing United States President Donald Trump's voluntary migration plan for Gaza residents.”</p>

The impact on short-haul flights was delayed until Friday morning because flight operations at Heathrow are severely limited between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. every day to minimize overnight noise in surrounding communities. About 4,000 tons of cargo have also been stranded by the closure, according to Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and leadership consultant.

The first plane landed at Heathrow Airport late Friday, about 18 hours after an inferno at an electrical substation caused a power outage that shuttered Europe's busiest air travel hub.

The British Airways jet touched down just before sunset after Heathrow lifted its closure order that disrupted global travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers.

At least 1,350 flights to and from Heathrow were affected, flight tracking service FlightRadar 24 said, and the impact was likely to last several days as passengers try to reschedule their travel and airlines work to reposition aircraft and crews.

Clarke, 49, who is suing the Guardian over publications from 2021-22 accusing him of sexual misconduct, has denied taking nude images without the consent of Ivy, with whom he had a two-month relationship, adding that “any photographs taken in an intimate setting were taken with consent and kept privately”. Clarke's barrister, Philip Williams, said there was no evidence that any photographs had been shared or shown by the actor. “He did it in a way that the actors wouldn't have noticed,” Fairbanks claimed. Earlier in the proceedings on Friday, evidence was heard from Leanne Coldwell, also a witness for GNM. She claimed Clarke had told students that he wanted to challenge them during an acting course for novices and amateurs at the London School of Dramatic Art (LSDA) and that he had “suggested undressing or being naked” during a scene.</p>

Germany's upper house of parliament on Friday gave the final seal of approval to a massive spending package to build up the military and overhaul infrastructure. The plan exempts defence spending above one per cent of GDP from Germany's constitutionally enshrined debt brake and sets up a 500-billion-euro ($545-billion) fund for infrastructure over 12 years. Soeder said Germany would undertake long-neglected upgrades of roads, bridges and rail lines, arguing that letting them fall into disrepair was a greater disservice to the next generation than building up state debt. Boris Rhein, CDU leader of the central state of Hessen -- home to many US army bases -- said that geopolitical turmoil spelt "a brutal paradigm shift" for Germany which had learnt that "we cannot rely on military help from the United States".

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/baltimore-bridge-collapse-risk-assessment'>Baltimore bridge was 30 times above acceptable risk of collapse, officials say</a></h2><b>Source:</b> The Guardian US&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 18:18:00 <p>
The top US transportation safety agency said this week that the deadly Baltimore bridge collapse last March, after a cargo ship hit a support pillar, had been 30 times above the acceptable risk of breaking up if a vessel struck it and there was “no excuse” for a vital safety check having been missed years before. Such examinations are meant to determine how vulnerable the bridges are to collapse after a ship strike, especially given the vastness of some modern container ships. The NTSB notes that while the list does not mean the bridges are certain to collapse in the event of a collision, it is recommending that state transportation agencies conduct an assessment and develop a risk reduction plan should a bridge be shown to be at higher riskof collapse. In 2009, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation officials, which published risk guidance, reiterated recommendations to conduct assessment for older bridges. Had Maryland's transportation authority conducted such a risk assessment, they “would have been able to proactively identify strategies to reduce the risk of collapse and loss of lives associated with a vessel collision”, said Jennifer Homendy, NTSB chair, in a media briefing on Thursday.</p>

Days after Mark Carney replaced Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister of Canada, India, on Friday, recalled "the downturn in India-Canada relations". Justin Trudeau's ouster was complete last week when Canada's ruling Liberal Party replaced him with a new prime minister. He was later declared a "persona non grata" by Trudeau's government, after which New Delhi recalled the then incumbent high commissioner over Canada "going too far". For months, India had repeatedly urged Ottawa to "stop providing criminal and secessionist elements a safe haven" in Canada. Blaming Justin Trudeau for catering to a vote bank, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said last year that "By allowing political space to 'Khalistani' separatist elements, the Canadian government (led by Justin Trudeau) is repeatedly showing that its vote bank is more powerful than its rule of law."</p>

Hinting that Elon Musk's role in the US government will have limits, President Donald Trump on Friday said war plans should not be shared with his adviser and closest ally, Elon Musk, because of his business interests in rival countries. However, on Friday, Donald Trump hinted there would be limits to Musk's involvement in strategic affairs. Trump made the comments during an Oval Office meeting on developing a new fighter jet, and he rejected reports that Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China, reported AP. Donald Trump said since Elon Musk has businesses in China, he could be susceptible to the country's influence. Trump had previously brushed off questions about Musk's potential conflicts of interest, simply saying that he would steer clear when necessary.</p>

The story was one of many shared by former federal workers and others impacted by the Trump administration's policies during a town hall in St Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday, part of a national tour that has offered an avenue for grievances against Donald Trump's first two months, but also a way to gather evidence for ongoing lawsuits, totaling about 10 so far, that Democratic attorneys general have filed against the Trump administration. Another veteran who worked at the Veterans Benefit Administration was fired via email by Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency”, she said. “The Trump administration has impacted me deeply during these past two months alone, but more than ever, we have to come together organized because I'll be damned if they keep hurting my family,” she said.

US President Donald Trump is prepared to take military action against Iran and could go as far as threatening Tehran if diplomatic efforts to renew dialogue on the country's nuclear program do not succeed, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. During his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal, meant to facilitate dialogue on Iran's nuclear program, and imposed sanctions against Tehran. Earlier this month, Trump confirmed that he had sent a letter to Iran's leadership proposing new talks. According to media reports, the letter was delivered through United Arab Emirates President Mohammed Bin Zayed and is currently being reviewed in Tehran. Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected the idea of renewed negotiations, dismissing the US proposal as an effort to “exert their dominance and impose what they want” instead of “solving issues.” He also rebuffed Trump's threat to use force.</p>

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A top Russian security official met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang on Friday and thanked him for the country's support of Moscow's war efforts in Ukraine, according to Russian state media. The meeting came after South Korea's spy agency said in late February that North Korea appeared to have sent additional troops to Russia after its soldiers fighting in the Russian-Ukraine war suffered heavy casualties. It cited Kim as calling the missiles “another major defense weapons system” for North Korea. North Korea often responds to major U.S.-South Korean military drills with its own weapons tests and fiery rhetoric. Hours after this year's Freedom Shield training began on March 10, North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea.</p>

Serbia's interior minister, Ivica Dačić, on Wednesday denied the equipment had been used against protesters. Aleksandar Radić, a Belgrade-based military analyst, told AFP that the equipment resembled an American-made long-range acoustic device capable of delivering high-frequency sound waves over significant distances. It could be used for “crowd control, repelling attacks on critical infrastructure, or even in anti-piracy operations”, he added.

Tensions escalated this month when Tigray's interim president, Getachew Reda, tried to fire three senior military commanders, having previously accused his forces of attempting a coup. Last week, a rival TPLF faction, led by the party chair Debretsion Gebremichael, installed its officials in provincial government offices. He has repeatedly said sea access was “existential” for Ethiopia, which with 130 million people is the world's most populous landlocked country. Eritrea has ordered a nationwide mobilisation and is trying to undermine Abiy by aiding rebels fighting Ethiopia's military in the Amhara region bordering Tigray. Last week, Gen Tsadkan Gebretensae, Tigray's vice-president, warned that war could erupt “at any moment” and the region risked “becoming a battlefield” again.</p>

“Poland must pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told his country's parliament earlier this month. Both of Europe's nuclear-armed powers, the UK and France, have big decisions to make about their nuclear futures. His comments come after Poland said it would like US nuclear warheads to be deployed on Polish soil. Were Poland or another European state to start developing its own nuclear weapons, it would be abandoning a norm that has held sway in the West for three decades. In the mid-20th century, Apartheid South Africa began testing nuclear devices, ultimately producing six warheads that could theoretically be fitted to intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>

Politicians and teachers unions condemn president's effort to axe department, which can only be done by Congress Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said: “Trump is telling America's public school kids that their futures don't matter.” On Friday, Margaret Spellings, education secretary under George W Bush, who expanded the department's role, told the Associated Press that Republicans in Congress traditionally voiced support for elimination while voting against it, mindful of how federal funds reach schools in their districts. It also upholds civil rights protections such as Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination. After Trump signed his order, Linda McMahon, the wrestling impresario turned education secretary charged with wrecking her own department, hailed what she called a “history-making action” and said: “We are sending education back to the states where it so rightly belongs.”</p>

The Next Generation Air Dominance program will replace Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor with a crewed aircraft built to enter combat alongside drones. The plane's design remains a closely held secret, but would probably include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines. It is a major boost for its St Louis, Missouri, fighter jet production business. Boeing's commercial operations have struggled as it attempts to get its bestselling 737 Max jet production back up to full speed, while its defense operation has been weighed down by underperforming contracts for mid-air refueling tankers, drones and training jets. Cost overruns at the KC-46 mid-air refueling tanker program have surpassed $7bn in recent years, while another fixed-price contract to upgrade two Air Force One planes has created a $2bn loss for the top-five US defense contractor.</p>

Since then, at least 28,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan has shown no sign of engaging in serious peace talks. Burhan also has spoken of setting up a transitional government, raising the potential for two rival administrations jockeying for support as their forces battle — entrenching Sudan's effective partition. The RSF's 16-page charter calls for “a secular, democratic and decentralized state,” maintaining what it called Sudan's “voluntary integrity of its territory and peoples” — a nod to Sudan's many communities demanding autonomy from Khartoum. The RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, mobilized two decades ago by then-president Omar al-Bashir against populations that identify as Central or East African in Darfur.</p>

US President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing has been awarded a major contract for the Air Force's high-tech next-generation F-47 fighter plane. The NGAD effort was paused in 2024 over cost concerns -- a major focus of the Trump administration, which has tasked billionaire donor Elon Musk with slashing government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). "What this study told us is we tried a whole bunch of different options and there is no more viable option than NGAD to achieve air superiority in this highly contested environment," Major General Joseph Kunkel told a symposium in Colorado. The F-22 features stealth technology, a high degree of maneuverability and the ability to supercruise, or maintain supersonic flight without afterburners.

But that was reportedly denied by the Pakistani establishment. After days of protest over "enforced disappearances" of Balochis and for not being allowed to visit morgues as bodies piled up, protesters and local residents reportedly barged into the Civil Hospital in Balochistan's capital city Quetta. As per local reports, several corpses were taken away by them. The BLA had taken an entire train - Jaffar Express - hostage earlier this month, before reportedly releasing women, children, and Baloch passengers, keeping mostly personnel of the Pakistani security forces hostage. To get back the corpses, Pakistan's security agencies launched a search operation.</p>

Defence minister issues threat as IDF intensifies offensive with ‘non-stop' overnight attacks across territory The permanent establishment of wide buffer zones in Gaza, particularly along its northern perimeter, has long been thought by observers to be an objective of many in the Israeli security establishment and government. Everything is very uncertain and then there are these threats that Israel will expand its operations. Hamas said on Friday it was still debating Witkoff's proposal and other proposals made by intermediaries, including Egypt.

Tuinman rejected mandatory military service, adding that the ministry focusing on voluntary recruitment and the recently introduced “service year” program, which allows young people to work in defense roles for a year. However, some experts have argued that voluntary recruitment alone may not be sufficient to meet such ambitious targets. Jean Debie, chair of the Union for Civil and Military Defense Personnel, said that compulsory service might eventually become necessary. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denied any intention of attacking NATO countries, dismissing the speculation as “complete nonsense.”</p>

Russia has insisted that it will not tolerate troops from NATO countries in Ukraine, regardless of how such a mission is branded by the US-led military bloc. Additionally, Starmer has reportedly acknowledged that the US will not provide a military “backstop” for any mission in Ukraine, as was publicly stated by the administration of President Donald Trump. Trump aims to transfer responsibility for Ukrainian security to European NATO members after negotiating a truce with Russia, asserting that the US and NATO should play no role in future arrangements. Meanwhile, the EU faces challenges in replacing US military assistance for Kiev. Member states failed to reach an agreement on Thursday concerning €40 billion ($43 billion) in additional military aid for Ukraine, a proposal pushed by the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas.</p>

Donald Trump said on Friday that plans for possible war with China should not be shared with Elon Musk because of his business interests, a rare admission that the billionaire faces conflicts of interests in his role as a senior adviser to the US president. Trump had previously brushed off questions about Musk's potential conflicts of interest, simply saying that he would steer clear when necessary. Musk's involvement in any US plans or dealings with China would raise not only security concerns but questions over a significant conflict of interest, as he has considerable economic interests in China as the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, which also has contracts with the US air force. In a Friday meeting at the White House to announce new air force fighter planes, Trump and Hegseth both firmly rejected reports that Musk was shown any Pentagon plans regarding a potential conflict with China during his visit earlier that day. According to a New York Times report, the meeting was set to take place not in Hegseth's office, where informal meetings about innovation would normally take place, but in a secure conference room known as “the Tank”, which is typically used for higher-level meetings.</p>

Lee is the founder of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on supporting Chinese startups in AI and technology, as well as establishing an AI institute which focuses on integrating new technology into traditional industries and developing AI-driven startups. He previously served as founding director of Microsoft Research Asia before working at Google and Apple. “So with that kind of formidable competitor, I think Sam Altman is probably not sleeping well,” he said, referring to the OpenAI CEO. The venture investor and founder of 01.AI projected that only three AI models – DeepSeek, Alibaba Group Holding, and ByteDance – would survive China's domestic shakeup triggered by the onset of DeepSeek. He emphasized that pioneer models such as ChatGPT have been commoditized, making the business model of the US developer vulnerable to cheaper economics presented by open-source AI such as DeepSeek.</p>

An insurgency led by Assad loyalists had already been brewing, and its attacks against government forces prompted a large deployment of soldiers to crush the rebellion. And in Alawite mountain villages, locals complained of kidnappings or, in the case of Fahil, extrajudicial killings during operations led by Syria's new security forces, though it remains unclear exactly who was responsible for the deaths. When Sharaa's militant group, Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham, came to power in December, he promised amnesty for those aligned with the Assad regime without “blood on their hands.” Reconciliation centers opened, and former regime soldiers and supporters, like Zaydu's husband, could hand over their weapons and be investigated to ascertain whether they had been directly involved in Assad's killing machine. He had never served in the military, having been exempted as an only son. Privately, some expressed their fears that Alawites don't have a place in Sharaa's new Syria.</p>

London Fire Brigade deputy commissioner Jonathan Smith told reporters firefighters worked "tirelessly in challenging and very hazardous conditions" to bring the flames under control. Five major airports serve the British capital and towns nearby, but capacity is stretched, especially at Heathrow, whose two runways each measure almost four kilometres (2.5 miles) in length.

Russian drones pummeled the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, injuring three people and sparking massive fires, officials said Friday, an attack that underlined Moscow's intention to pursue aerial strikes even as it agreed to temporarily halt strikes on energy facilities. Over 70 people and 20 fire engines were involved in extinguishing what the emergency services called “massive fires.” Zelenskyy told reporters after Wednesday's call with Trump that “technical” talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected from attack under the agreement. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized Friday that the agreement reached between Trump and Putin referred only to energy facilities, adding that the Russian military is fulfilling Putin's order to halt such attacks for 30 days. Regional head Ivan Fedorov published photos showing firefighters extinguishing flames at multiple damaged residential buildings.</p>

The ESRI said nearly all tariff scenarios would have a “significant negative impact” on the Irish economy, with a knock-on effect causing job losses and potential loss of US multinationals. Experts in Ireland have said that the threat of a tightened tax regime were more likely to incentivise pharmaceutical companies to book their profits in the US, rather than endure tariffs. A shrinking economy could also trigger inflation, with higher import prices on goods affected by retaliatory tariffs.</p>

Waves of Russian drones pounded the Ukrainian port city of Odesa overnight, setting it ablaze in an attack that underscored Moscow's intent to continue aerial assaults despite agreeing to a temporary pause in strikes on energy infrastructure. While much of Europe has cut its reliance on Russian gas, countries sympathetic to Moscow – including Hungary and Slovakia – still buy it, with all supplies flowing through the town of Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region. After a meeting with western military planners near London on Thursday, Keir Starmer appeared to step back from his pledge to put boots on the ground in Ukraine, saying instead that allied forces would be deployed by sea and air in support of Kyiv's own forces. In an interview on Thursday, Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, suggested the US might advocate for troops from Saudi Arabia or India – two countries with relatively warm ties to Moscow – to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential security arrangement. “With all due respect, the UN will not protect us from occupation or Putin's desire to come again.</p>

Nonetheless, NBC reports that Joe and Jill Biden have offered their services to the Democratic party, should they need them:</p>

When he was released on Feb. 8, Sharabi said he weighed 44 kilos (about 97 pounds) - less than the weight of his youngest daughter, who was killed along with his wife and older daughter in Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, along with about 1,200 others. Unlike Security Council resolutions, though, those passed by the General Assembly are nonbinding. Britain's deputy ambassador James Kariuki called Sharabi's suffering "beyond the imagination" and said "Hamas must be held accountable for their despicable actions." Britain calls for the rapid resurgence of aid to Gaza, an investigation into allegations of sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinian detainees by Israeli forces, and an urgent return to the ceasefire deal, he said.

“They can think twice now about doing it again,” he said of Greenpeace and other environmental groups who protested against the Dakota Access pipeline. Similar claims often get tossed out over first amendment concerns or because many states prevent so-called Slapp suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation). He has made a mission of going after pipeline opponents, including Greenpeace, filing several lawsuits to that end. “Billionaire oligarchs like Elon Musk and Energy Transfer's Kelcy Warren now pose one of the most significant risks to free speech globally,” Kadidal said. These proposals include “extreme” penalties for protest-related offenses like trespassing near a pipeline, the center notes in its analysis.</p>

Just because there's no obvious replacement doesn't mean that England are going to win anything by persevering with a striker who's *way* past his best. It's worth remembering that Tuchel likes height - see the call up of Dan Burn, who could make his debut next to Ezri Konsa tonight. Ultimately, I criticise myself more than anyone could do on the outside but … always use it as fuel to prove people wrong. Declan Rice hosting Myles Lewis-Skelly and Dan Burn, for an episode of “England Generations” on the official channels, is actually excellent content: While Premier League and Championship clubs are not in action this weekend, with some EFL games also postponed, there is a full programme of fixtures down the pyramid.</p>

The authorities in Kiev are desperately attempting to lure young citizens into the military with promises of McDonald's cheeseburgers because they have run out of experienced soldiers in the conflict with Russia, former Ukrainian diplomat and parliamentary adviser Andrey Telizhenko has told RT. They are throwing low quality burgers or sandwiches into the crowd and saying: ‘Eat it,'” he insisted. Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov said late last year that Kiev's losses during the conflict had amounted to over 1 million, which includes both killed and severely wounded. Anyone who would fall for the promise of 15,625 cheeseburgers is not going to receive that money anyway, Telizhenko insisted. Zelensky claims that just over 45,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the fighting so far because “only those people were paid out – out of a million dead,” Telizhenko stated.</p>

February's personal consumption expenditures price index, a closely watched measure of inflation, is due on March 28. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled the U.S. central bank will wait for more clarity on Trump administration policies as it assesses when to resume rate cuts.

Tokyo inflation is due on Friday, as the Bank of Japan continues to monitor mounting domestic price pressures that could warrant further monetary tightening.</p>

Vinícius scored the winner nine minutes into added time to rescue a much-needed win for Brazil who appeared destined for a third consecutive 1-1 draw after Luis Díaz cancelled out Raphinha's early opener for the hosts in capital Brasília. But Brazil hit a wall after that and other than an angled strike from Rodrygo that sailed wide of the post in the 13th minute, they couldn't create any real scoring opportunities. They were also exposed to regular counterattacks with Colombia constantly threatening goalkeeper Alisson's box. Brazil came back livelier after the break and Vinícius Júnior forced a fine save from Camilo Vargas with an early strike for inside the box. Brazil will now travel to face old rivals Argentina on Tuesday in a game where they will be without Arsenal defender Gabriel Magalhães and Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimarães, both suspended after receiving yellow cards against Colombia.</p>

"The changes involve stripping a Latin message of congratulations of words that are grammatically gendered masculine or feminine," the report highlighted, adding that a gazette had been issued to alert faculties about the planned changes. Instead of referring to male students as "Magistri' (master), the proposed text will use the term "vos" which is a neutral term for "you". The word "doctores" (doctors), which is also masculine, could be changed. "Similar changes have been proposed for the specific wording used in degree ceremonies for awards in arts, music, medicine, law, philosophy and other specialisms."

Russian President Vladimir Putin has given another ultimatum to Ukrainians living in the country by ordering them to legalise their immigration status or leave by September 10, Moscow Times reported quoting a presidential decree published on Thursday. The decree stated that Ukrainians without "legal grounds to stay or reside in Russia" must leave Russia or obtain citizenship within the next six months and 10 days. Meanwhile, the efforts to reach an agreement on the ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine continue with US President Donald Trump announcing on Wednesday that he had a "very good" one-hour phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I thought we accomplished quite a bit, and in the second meeting, we actually really narrowed the issues, certainly from the Russian standpoint, we were immediately in discussions on tangible, granular ways to move forward towards a ceasefire that included what you've heard about today, which is the ceasefire with regard to energy infrastructure from both sides, something they've been trying to put together for quite some time."

At least seven international flights from Indonesia's resort island Bali have been cancelled, an airport official said on Friday, after a volcano in the archipelago nation's east erupted, shooting dark ash 8km into the sky. As of 9:45am on Friday, “seven international flights had been cancelled, six of them are Jetstar flights bound to Australia and one Air Asia flight to Kuala Lumpur,” Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport spokesperson, Andadina Dyah, said in a statement. “The ash column was observed grey to black with thick intensity,” Indonesia's volcanology agency said in a statement about the eruption, which began around 11pm on Thursday. There were no reports of damages to nearby villages, but the agency warned residents of the potential for volcanic mudflow due to heavy rainfall. Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p>

The alleged assaults occurred while Depardieu was under formal investigation over accusations of raping a young actress in 2018. A lawyer for one of the women told Reuters her client was scared to come forward against Depardieu. Then, last month, a French court found film director Christophe Ruggia guilty of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was underage. French director and actress Judith Godreche, who like Haenel has become a major voice in France's #MeToo movement, said these trials showed some progress.

But Chalmers said divestiture was not the answer, arguing, as an example, that if one chain was forced to sell a store it might just be bought by another big player. In the statement, Woolworths said it had “already taken action” on many of the ACCC's interim recommendations such as having “simplified” promotional programs and making specials clearer through improved ticketing.</p>

The parents of missing Indian student Sudiksha Konanki want their daughter declared dead to "seek closure", authorities told CNN. Ms Konanki's body has not been found since she vanished on March 6 from Punta Cana beach in the Dominican Republic. Sheriff Mike Chapman said that while investigators believe Ms Konanki drowned, her death has not been officially confirmed, and the case remains open. Personal injury and criminal defence attorney Phillip DiLucente explained that the family's request is likely driven by a need for closure. A legal declaration of death would also allow the family to settle financial matters, such as college savings plans and insurance policies.</p>

Australia first had to weather a storm that started brewing when a sea of red in the stands at Sydney Football Stadium belted out the Indonesia national anthem, then turned into an onslaught of intense pressing and all-out attack as the visitors set out to impress in their first game under coach Patrick Kluivert. Indonesia had six starters return from the previous meeting even amid their own aggressive naturalisation program. Craig Goodwin was relegated to starting among the substitutes with Velupillay handed a first international start up front alongside Adam Taggart and Martin Boyle, but with all four players – as well as player-of-the-match Irvine and Lewis Miller – having a hand in the goal rush there are signs that Popovic's grand plans are working. The Socceroos remain one point ahead of third-placed Saudi Arabia, who beat China 1-0, as their resounding win over Indonesia has perhaps most crucially lifted them to a seven-goal buffer over their nearest challengers with three matches to play.

President Donald Trump has expressed full support for the renewed offensive and suggested last month that Gaza's 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. The Biden administration voiced doubt about those aims, saying months ago that Hamas was no longer able to carry out such an attack. Palestinians say they don't want to leave their homeland, and Arab countries roundly rejected the proposal. Netanyahu has also fired or forced out several top officials who had appeared more open to a hostage deal. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have resumed long-range missile fire against Israel, which has rarely caused casualties or serious damage.</p>

US President Donald Trump has called out the New York Times for allegedly spreading fake news. Another official didn't provide many details but said that the briefing would be China-focused, it reported. Hours after the news was published, President Trump called it “fake” and a “lie”. If he is provided information on the US' plan for any potential war with China, it would be a "dramatic expansion of his already extensive role", NYT reported. He was invited by Secretary Hegseth and is just visiting," Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to CNN.</p>

Mass deportation has proved harder and slower than expected, so the White House needed a quick win to signal toughness. We have also said that the time to be really alarmed is when he ignores a court order. America is not at war with Venezuela, to the dismay of many Trump-supporting Venezuelan émigrés. Mr Trump attacked the judge as a “Radical Left Lunatic”, implied he was crooked and called for his impeachment. However, when a president says things like “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law” and his minions declare they “don't care what judges think”, the threat to America—a place where the law has long tempered executive impulses—is clear.</p>

The organisation said Suri was being held at an immigration detention center in Louisiana. On Wednesday, the French government condemned the expulsion of a French space scientist meant to attend a conference in Houston, after officials searched his smartphone and found what they called "hateful" messages against US policy. Suri was arrested by federal agents on Monday night outside his home in Virginia. He has been accused of ‘spreading Hamas propaganda' and ‘close ties with a suspected terrorist'.</p>

However, the researchers at Aalto University in Finland found that rural population figures in these estimates could have been undercounted anywhere between 53 per cent to 84 per cent over the study period between 1975 and 2010. "The results are remarkable, as these datasets have been used in thousands of studies and extensively support decision-making, yet their accuracy has not been systematically evaluated," he added. It highlighted that there were "fundamental limitations" with the national population census while gauging rural populations. With the same basic practices in place, it's unlikely that slightly improved input data could correct for this level of bias." The undercounting of the population could have serious ramifications as governments, international bodies and researchers rely on global population data for resource allocation, infrastructure planning disease epidemiology and disaster risk management.</p>

Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te said he will increase the island's military spending from 2.5% to over 3% of its gross domestic product amid China threats. At the same time, we will continue to reform national defense.” Lai's comments were the latest reassurance to U.S. and domestic critics who say Taiwan is not spending enough on its own defense. U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that Taiwan increase defense spending as high as 10% of GDP, a proportion well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend, in order to deter China. Leaders in Australia and New Zealand have said China should have given them more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live fire exercises in the seas between the two countries last month, forcing flights to divert on short notice.</p>

Canada on Thursday “strongly condemned” China's execution this year of four Canadians over drug offenses, underlining its objection to China's use of the death penalty against its citizens, which was publicly confirmed the day before. A spokesperson for China's embassy in Canada said in an emailed statement Thursday that China always imposes “severe” penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a “‘zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem.” It said the evidence against the Canadian nationals is “solid and sufficient.” After news of the executions was reported Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters in Ottawa that she had been following the issue closely for months and that both she and then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had personally asked China for leniency. Joly said she could not go into further detail because the families asked for privacy, but she confirmed that the Canadians who were executed were all facing “charges linked to criminal activities, according to China, linked to drugs.” She also said all four were dual citizens, though China does not recognize dual citizenship. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning did not confirm the executions directly but when asked about them at a news briefing Thursday said: “Combating drug-related crimes is the responsibility of all countries.</p>

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — During a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, the U.S. leader apparently suggested Volodymyr Zelenskyy consider transferring ownership of Ukraine's power plants to the U.S. for long-term security, according to a U.S. statement. Located in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces occupied it shortly after Moscow's February 2022 invasion. While Russia declared the region annexed in fall 2022, its largest city, Zaporizhzhia, remains under Ukrainian control. During their call on Wednesday, Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should consider giving the U.S. ownership of Ukraine's power plants to ensure their long-term security, according to a White House statement from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. While the plant no longer produces electricity, it still holds large amounts of nuclear fuel, requiring constant cooling.</p>

This frame grab taken from an undated video released by the Orbetello Fishermen's Cooperative on Thursday, March 20, 2025, shows a swarm of midges in the lagoon area near Orbetello, central Italy. Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. A permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to “protect citizens and economic activities in the area,” Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. Local residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition “Save the Orbetello Lagoon” had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday.</p>

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Beijing on Thursday demanded protections for Chinese students in the U.S. after a congressional panel asked six American universities to hand over a large amount of detailed information on their Chinese students, citing national security concerns. “This is in the interest of both parties,” Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. Her remarks came a day after John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to six colleges requesting information on Chinese students enrolled in advanced science and technology programs. If left unaddressed, this trend will continue to displace American talent, compromise research integrity, and fuel China's technological ambitions at our expense.” Most Chinese students enrolled in U.S. undergraduate programs pay full tuition, making them an important source of funding for many universities.</p>

President Donald Trump waves from the stairs of Air Force One upon his arrival at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Monday, March 17, 2025. CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The United States Embassy in South Africa said Thursday it received a list of more than 67,000 people interested in refugee status in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's plan to relocate members of a white minority group he claims are victims of racial discrimination by their Black-led government. Trump issued an executive order on Feb. 7 cutting U.S. funding to South Africa and citing “government actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.” The executive order also criticized South Africa's foreign policy, specifically its decision to accuse Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in a case at the United Nations' top court. He told the Newzroom Afrika television channel that his organization had been inundated with requests for more information since Trump's order and had contacted the State Department and the embassy in Pretoria “to indicate that we would like them to make a channel available for South Africans that would like to get more information and register for refugee status.”</p>

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at eliminating the US Education Department, which he had termed as a “big con job” last month. Donald Trump reportedly proposed shuttering it in his first term as president, but Congress did not act. While Trump has derided the Education Department as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology, completing its dismantling is most likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979. Donald Trump had previously suggested he would seek to close the department through an executive order, though he recognised that achieving this goal would require support from Congress and teachers' unions. The closure of Education Department comes with consequences, potentially disrupting billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools and college tuition assistance programmes, according to the report.</p>

Fighter jets also often get nicknames – think raptor or mustang – which are unofficial but typically widely used. Trump suggested ally countries would be able to buy “toned down versions” of the new aircraft. “We like to tone them down about 10%, which probably makes sense, because someday maybe they're not our allies, right?” Trump said.</p>

The massive brush fire that has been burning in southern Miami-Dade County this week has now grown bigger than the Palisades Fire of California that captured national headlines earlier this year. The wildfire sparked national news as a "life-threatening" Santa Ana windstorm produced 100 mph gusts throughout Southern California that hampered firefighting efforts for weeks, causing insurmountable damage and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes. At this time, there haven't been any reports of major damage to homes or businesses nearby, but the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said that Comcast has had patchy service due to the fires affecting some of their infrastructure. Vulnerable groups, including young children, the elderly and those with respiratory issues, should take extra precautions. It involved thousands of separate woodland and mixed-urban rural wildfires that burned over 500,000 acres, destroying over 300 homes and costing $300 million of lost timber value.</p>

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended Thursday 68 bridges across 19 states be evaluated with a "vulnerability assessment" to determine their risk of collapse if involved in a vessel collision in the wake of last year's deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. The 68 bridges were divided into two categories, "critical/essential" and "typical." Those that are not deemed critical/essential fall under the typical designation. Nearly a year ago, on March 26, 2024, a large cargo ship lost electrical power and crashed into the Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, and knocking eight roadworkers, six of whom died, into the Patapsco River. "Had the Key Bridge's owner, the Maryland Transportation Authority, or MDTA, conducted a vulnerability assessment based on recent vessel traffic as recommended by AASHTO, MDTA would have been aware that the Key Bridge was above the acceptable risk and would have had information to proactively reduce the bridge's risk of a collapse and loss of lives associated with a vessel collision with the bridge," NTSB said in a statement Thursday.</p>

The DHS spokesperson said that Venezuelan people who ICE arrested this week could face possible deportation to El Salvador if they are ordered deported by an immigration judge.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico. "Tariff direct effects might be short-lived, but we have to be looking at more at what's happening in the economy ... and kind of adjusting our view on the path of policy based on what we're learning along the way," Williams told Yahoo Finance during a media availability on Friday. For inflation, the range is between about 2.5% and 3%, noting that any of those are possible. Though he also stressed that "measures of policy uncertainty have increased sharply in recent months." Williams also addressed short-term inflation expectations, which have risen considerably in the wake of President Trump's proposed tariffs.</p>

Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk held an impromptu company all-hands Thursday night, giving an update on the progress of a number of products while also attempting to assuage fears that the CEO is ignoring his post. Though the changeover to the new Model Y SUV has been seen as a drag on sales, Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe has seen Musk — and Tesla's brand — suffer. "Challenges clearly remain for Musk and Tesla to navigate this volatile period but last night was the first step in doing this for employees, shareholders, and partners,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note Friday morning. Ives had called for Musk to address some of these issues earlier this week. Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks</p>

Disney became the fourth such case this year where investors pushed back against anti-DEI proposals at prominent companies. Other anti-DEI proposals were voted down at Apple (AAPL), Costco (COST), and John Deere (DE). The company last month joined a growing list of businesses that have removed or altered diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives after President Trump issued two executive orders aimed at undoing federal DEI programs within the US government. This year's early surge in anti-DEI measures could be a signal that opposition proposals are on the rise, Bieber said. In fact, Bieber said, support levels among S&P 500 companies dropped for both pro- and anti-DEI proposals over the last couple of proxy seasons.</p>

Those five days will be an around-the-clock rush by 50 workers from five companies as well as more than 80 team staff members to mount more than 3,000 signs and other marketing assets—not just corporate logos but also Rays-themed “see something, say something” and “watch for foul ball” placards. Despite that jump, the Rays' season-ticket base is larger than it was last season, and 45% of those fans are new this year, Walsh says. For one thing, it is planning to hand out items that could be useful outdoors, such as hats and sunglasses. In September, the Rays announced an agreement with St. Petersburg and Pinellas County for a public contribution of roughly $600 million toward a $1.3 billion ballpark to replace Tropicana Field, which is now among MLB's oldest stadiums and widely considered one of the worst major pro sports venues in North America.

It is a noteworthy, tangible outcome of the USGA's 15-year, $30 million investment to help golf courses reduce their overall water usage. Its practical approach gives operators insight to better inform decision-making at every level, while maintaining the best possible playing conditions. Continuing to advance water conservation in golf will require collaboration between superintendents, researchers, regulators, golfers and communities. They include research on topics such as precision irrigation, drought-resilient grassing, reducing irrigated acreage, mitigating water quality challenges and subsurface drip innovation. Meldrum House, the historic country hotel & golf course in Aberdeenshire, has appointed Neil McLean as its new Membership Manager.</p>

Conor McGregor deserves to fade into obscurity following his criminal acts, instead he's being paraded by Donald Trump as the face of Ireland on St Patrick's Day, says Maria Ward-Brennan Unfortunately for us, that name was everywhere on Monday, thanks to his visit with Donald Trump. Yet instead of being punished for his appalling behaviour, McGregor is paraded around the White House on St Patrick's Day. This was significant because St Patrick's Day is about much more than watching parades and wearing green. Ministers and State representatives are sent to 90 cities across 40 countries as part of a robust diplomatic push.</p>

This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘UK races to avoid Trump tariffs' The idea is to strike an agreement that prevents US President Donald Trump from imposing tariffs on UK imports. So the economy has been weak, but inflation really does look as if it's pretty much under control. And then people might like to put their money in a very stable area called the Eurozone.

Acquiring Deribit — the world's largest venue for trading Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) options — would bolster Coinbase's existing derivatives platform, which currently focuses on futures. Coinbase and Deribit have reportedly alerted regulators in Dubai to the deal talks.

A study found that usage of Tornado Cash continued to climb despite its placement on the blacklist. And last year, a federal appeals court ruled that the Treasury overstepped its legal authority by sanctioning the protocol—an outcome that was arrived at because the blacklist is designed to punish foreign entities, and Tornado Cash, which runs autonomously via self-executing smart contracts, is not owned or operated by a foreign national. But there's a world in which it doesn't really matter either way—tools for tracing on-chain activity, even those that go through efforts to hide the details, are becoming more sophisticated and some experts believe transactions on Tornado Cash are already traceable with enough effort. Stephen Gardner is leaving to ensure Amtrak has "the full faith and confidence of this administration." Looks like banking on billionaires to solve climate change isn't gonna do the trick.</p>

Mitchnik was referring to BUIDL, a tokenised treasuries product on Ethereum that topped $1 billion in assets under management last week.

The US Treasury Department said it is removing sanctions on cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash imposed in 2022 after the service was used by North Korean hackers to launder stolen tokens. 

The removal comes after an appeals court ruled last year that the Treasury overstepped its authority with the sanctions. A crypto token associated with Tornado Cash, known as TORN, jumped 72% following the announcement, according to prices on CoinMarketCap. </p>

However, many other countries, including major US trade partners, are just not ready to take on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, begging the question of who the US is competing against to become a “Bitcoin superpower.” On March 1, Swiss National Bank President Martin Schlegel said Bitcoin wasn't suitable as a reserve asset, citing stability, liquidity concerns and security risks. Germany's central bank chief, Joachim Nagel, has also dismissed the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has previously criticized Bitcoin as being a poor form of money. Governments can also create them to stabilize the price of goods that are in high demand. Furthermore, the US Bitcoin reserve allows the Treasury to purchase Bitcoin so long as it can do so in a budget-neutral manner that doesn't come at a cost to taxpayers.</p>

XRP volume leapt more than three-fold on Wednesday, the biggest trading spike for any major cryptocurrency this week. Analysts at B2BINPay, a crypto business payment provider, told DL News that investor enthusiasm for XRP will depend on “future events.” “If the SEC drops its appeal against Ripple and an XRP ETF is approved, prices may revisit previous highs or even reach new levels,” Bari said earlier this week.

Aaron Peak, personal finance expert at credit reference company CredAbility, said: "Bitcoin is notoriously volatile: prices can surge or crash unpredictably, so investors should always be cautious. Crypto miners use high-end computing rigs to perform calculations and are rewarded with bitcoin but after each halving, the reward decreases. Aaron Peak, personal finance expert at credit reference company CredAbility said: “Right now, miners – who verify bitcoin transactions – earn 6.25 bitcoins for each new block they add to the blockchain." The next bitcoin halving event is expected to happen in 2028, but it all depends on how quickly miners create new blocks, Peak explained. Peak said: "It will happen after another 210,000 blocks have been added to the blockchain, which usually takes around four years.</p>

Amid global economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin has emerged as a preferred store of value for investors seeking protection against currency devaluation. With central banks adopting expansionary monetary policies, Bitcoin's scarcity and decentralized nature make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets. These developments have significantly lowered entry barriers for institutional and retail investors, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset. While market uncertainties persist, factors such as institutional adoption, supply constraints, and regulatory advancements suggest that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 or even $200,000 in the future.

Crypto has been on a wild ride since President Donald Trump's presidential election win in November.

At $13 million, Bitcoin would make up 7% of global wealth, which he views as a plausible scenario. In late February, he wrote on X, "Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin."

Bitcoiners waiting for retail to show up might be missing the obvious — it's already here, a crypto executive says. “Retail is likely entering through ETFs — the paper Bitcoin layer — which doesn't show up onchain,” Ju said. “This keeps the realized cap lower than if the funds were flowing directly to exchange deposit wallets,” he added, noting that 80% of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows come from retail investors — a trend that Binance analysts already once observed in October last year. Sorry to change my view, but it now looks pretty clear that we're entering a bear market,” he said. Ju explained that certain indicators are showing a lack of new liquidity, which is likely being driven by macro factors.</p>

Additionally, cryptocurrencies' low correlation with traditional assets—such as stocks, bonds, and gold— makes them a valuable diversification tool for reducing portfolio risk. For nations or corporations facing international sanctions, cryptocurrencies can act as a hedge, helping to ensure the free flow of funds. While the impact on investors is largely positive, potential downsides include excessive speculation leading to market bubbles and fewer opportunities for short-term traders. For countries facing foreign exchange shortages or economic sanctions—such as Russia and Iran—cryptocurrency reserves could offer a crucial tool to circumvent traditional financial systems. As the cryptocurrency market matures, investors may increasingly seek diversified asset allocations, expanding beyond Bitcoin into altcoins, stablecoins, and emerging digital currencies.</p>

City birds have been making their nests out of plastic waste for decades, the team's research shows. “It's ironic to think that many of these plastic single-use items have just been used for minutes by people, yet these coots have used them for decades,” says Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands. Since plastic lasts so long, old pieces of it can find their way into recent nest layers. “Weirdly enough, the wrapper is in pristine condition, as if it were littered yesterday,” Hiemstra says.

If someone is still unsure whether they've either been vaccinated or had the disease, there's a test that checks for measles-specific antibodies in your blood. If someone has had two doses of the measles vaccine in their lifetime, there is likely no need for a booster shot. Many people who received the old vaccine lost their immunity within a few years, leaving them vulnerable to measles later in life. Individuals traveling to areas experiencing measles outbreaks, including within the U.S., can also consider getting another dose even if they're fully vaccinated, Chin-Hong said. Additionally, people with weakened immune systems — due to medical conditions or medications — might not maintain full protection, even if they're fully vaccinated.</p>

The Odysseus spacecraft made a rough landing on the moon last year, toppling over and rendering much of its equipment unusable, but an onboard NASA radio telescope called ROLSES-1  was able to make some observations

The first successful use of a radio telescope on the moon has kicked off a new era of astronomy that could shed light on the cosmic dark ages – despite a bumpy landing.

NASA's ROLSES-1 (Radio wave Observations at the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath) telescope was mounted on the Odysseus lander, an Intuitive Machines spacecraft that made the first ever private lunar landing last year. While Odysseus was the first such spacecraft to survive a landing, it tipped on its side, rendering most of the equipment on…

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-vaccine-mrna-pancreas-nih'>An mRNA cancer vaccine may offer long-term protection</a></h2><b>Source:</b> Science News Magazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 13:00:00 <p>
It's a move that could significantly hamper the advancement of mRNA vaccines in cancer research and patient care, Sasson says. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer can be tricky; it kills more than 450,000 people globally every year, so patients often learn they have the disease at an advanced stage. Nevertheless, the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is around 13 percent, meaning that five years after diagnosis, 87 out of 100 patients will have died. Some of these errors produce mutant tumor proteins, which the immune system can recognize like red flags warning danger. It is published by the Society for Science, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) membership organization dedicated to public engagement in scientific research and education (EIN 53-0196483).</p>

China's Ninth National Forest Resources Inventory counted an average of 426 trees per acre (1,052 trees/hectare) across the country in 2019, which is much higher than the new study's estimate of 279 trees per acre (689 trees/hectare), Guo told Live Science in an email. "In densely forested areas, overlapping canopies obstruct the accurate detection of mid-story and understory trees, leading to lower-than-actual tree counts," Guo said. Incorporating terrestrial lidar data and improving the software could provide more accurate tree counts, he added. China's tree population may soon increase, however, because the country is planting seedlings at a dizzying rate.

Stone tools are considered the first form of technology devised by ancient humans – but they might not have been invented from scratch When ancient humans first invented stone tools, they may have been trying to emulate naturally formed sharp stones, meaning they would not have needed a huge leap of inspiration. “What our hypothesis does is, it really turns the origin of technology entirely on its head,” says Metin Eren at Kent State University in Ohio. Instead of imagining a sharp tool and then figuring out… We'll also keep you up to date with New Scientist events and special offers.</p>

Heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen, appeared later — they were created through nuclear fusion reactions in the first stars. These water molecules were highly concentrated in cloud cores, dense clumps of gas that are thought to be where stars and planets first formed. Scientists figure out how different factors, like temperature, density, and pressure, relate to each other in the matter inside neutron stars. New high-resolution X-ray data reveal that turbulent gas motion, not just black hole activity, prevents star formation in cluster cores. New observations suggest elongated gas filaments that stretch into space may be feeding supermassive black holes.</p>

(Reuters) - Yahoo has signed a deal to sell its 20-year-old technology news website, TechCrunch, to media investment firm Regent, the companies said on Friday. TechCrunch, a popular online platform providing news and analysis on global tech companies, startups and entrepreneurs, was among the media assets of Verizon Communications, including Yahoo. In 2021, private equity firm Apollo Global Management acquired the media assets for $5 billion, subsequently rebranding the combined assets under the Yahoo name. Regent has been actively expanding its tech news site portfolio, with its recent acquisition of Foundry, the parent company of leading publications such as PCWorld, Macworld, InfoWorld, CIO, and TechAdvisor. "We believe this next chapter under Regent can help maintain TechCrunch's influence and support its continued growth," Yahoo said in a statement.</p>

Social withdrawal or mood changes: Isolation can lead to mental health concerns and a decreased quality of life.

Families and caregivers should stay vigilant for signs that a loved one may need additional support beyond what technology can provide.</p>

But, faced with America's new direction, European officials are now pivoting their messaging toward investment and innovation rather than safety.

At a recent public hearing of the Senate Majority Policy Committee, lawmakers reviewed technological innovations that could expand access to quality healthcare in rural areas. It was also encouraging to hear solutions that provide our isolated rural residents with accessible face-to-face medical care options. Republican and Democratic chairs of the House Health Committee, Kathy Rapp, R-Warren, and Dan Frankel, D-Pittsburgh, sponsored House Bill 157, aimed at reducing healthcare disparities in rural areas by providing grants in medically underserved areas or rural counties toward practitioners' education debt. “Our rural healthcare providers are in crisis, facing persistent shortages that make it harder for Pennsylvanians to get the care they need,” Rapp said. None of the responses will be shared or used for any other purpose except to better serve our community.</p>

As a reason for pursuing the CON approval, Mission cited an influx of emergency department patients, both nationally and locally, who are facing longer wait times. Mission's initial application was approved in 2022 by the State Health Planning Agency. It will treat stroke, severe chest pain, traumatic injuries, and accept EMS patients. The facility will also offer advanced life support, complex radiology and lab services. While it's unclear why Mission had to defend its ER application, it's common for Certificate of Need applications to encounter disputes, often from competing healthcare providers concerned about market competition and resource allocation.</p>

Both regulations were finalized in January, just before President Donald Trump assumed office for his second term. Alongside the buprenorphine and VA final rules, the agency proposed a long-awaited regulation that would create a process for prescribing controlled substances via telehealth, as well as add some restrictions to how many Schedule II prescriptions they could offer. However, some telehealth advocates and providers said the proposal could be onerous for clinicians to implement. The reprieve, which followed another short-term extension enacted in December, creates unpredictability and uncertainty for providers, telehealth groups say. Regulators' assessment of customer support centers has spurred recent lawsuits from insurers.</p>

"Carey has capitalized on the success of her infringing work," Stone's complaint alleged.

Traditionally, MS treatment has followed a stepwise approach, starting with low- to moderate-efficacy DMTs, which are generally safer, but less effective at controlling the disease. Tysabri is a high-efficacy antibody-based therapy that works by preventing immune cells from getting into the brain and spinal cord where they can cause damage. For most assessments, however, these reductions were more pronounced in those who received it as first-line therapy.

Researchers aimed to study the unique characteristics, causes and implications of medical hallucinations, with a special emphasis on how these errors manifest themselves in real-world clinical scenarios. "Our results reveal that inference techniques such as chain-of-thought and search augmented generation can effectively reduce hallucination rates. However, despite these improvements, non-trivial levels of hallucination persist," the study's authors wrote.

Under state statute, Vermont health care institutions are required to get a certificate of need — effectively, a legal permission slip — anytime they want to build, renovate or buy facilities or obtain medical equipment that are more expensive than certain threshold amounts. Certificate of need regulations, which exist in most states, are intended to reduce unnecessary health care spending and avoid duplicative medical services. In Vermont, certificates of need are required when a hospital or health care facility seeks to build a new facility, renovate an existing one, or purchase an expensive piece of equipment. As it currently exists, “I would wager that the CON process would delay our start of this consolidation of two units by at least a year, if not longer,” Reynolds, the hospital vice president, said last month. But if signed into law, he said, H. 96 “gives us the breathing room to perform these types of projects.”</p>

What would you say is the most important thing hospitals and health systems should know about digital transformation efforts that perhaps they don't quite have a firm grasp on to begin with? Larger enterprises will likely have one or more additional positions as part of the broader transformational leadership team. In all cases, it is crucial to have senior business leaders who are co-leading and/or sponsoring or co-sponsoring, at the executive level, any transformational initiative. Getting outside perspectives from management consultants, advisors, peers, customers, patients and other stakeholders can inform your planning. After serving as board advisor for a digital transformation initiative at SE Health, I became their CDO and senior vice president earlier this year.</p>

Commentary from Aveanna Healthcare and Enhabit executives provided reason for optimism on this front, as both companies shared some encouraging news related to their payer strategies – notably, their comments suggest how strong payer relationships not only create positive financial trends but can lead to improvements in staffing and clinical capacity. Enhabit has shown a willingness to walk away from high-profile contracts when they no longer serve the company. “This, combined with continued staffing and cost disciplines, should allow us to expand home health margins as we exit 2025 despite CMS rate reimbursement increases not keeping pace with our overall market inflation,” Ryan Solomon, CFO of Enhabit, said during the Q4 earnings call earlier this month. This earnings season, I was particularly interested in the comments about how BrightSpring and Pennant are planning to grow.

The massive PBM is pivoting to a cost-based reimbursement model, which it says will reduce variation in how pharmacies are paid. Under such models, pharmacies are generally paid the drug's acquisition cost, plus a defined markup and occasionally an additional dispensing fee. When asked for more details, a spokesperson said Optum Rx's approach “incorporates multiple market indices and data to inform how drugs will be reimbursed.” “We have seen announcements like this in the past by PBMs that claim they want to work with independent pharmacies. Optum Rx, for example, announced the pharmacy reimbursement change one day after it released plans to lower prior authorization requirements on dozens of drugs.</p>

While the city agenda item brought up the specter of a possible acquisition of the hospital by a for-profit or nonprofit entity in line with industry trends, TMH officials said there are "no current plans to transition to a different ownership or operational model." "In fact, one goal of our relationship with FSU is to preserve our independence and avoid acquisition by a large for-profit hospital system," Derzypolski said in an emailed statement. The hospital serves 21 counties across North Florida and Georgia, according to agenda materials. Goad said the city will have to fully look at the ramifications and conduct a legal analysis before any decision is made, but he said he wouldn't assume that TMH is looking to pull away from city ownership: "I don't think that'll happen." Goad clarified that assets include everything but vehicles, yet the city has no financial obligation if something needs to be repaired or replaced, meaning there's no impact to the city's budget.</p>

According to the post, ISIS-K would use Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs) followed by armed assaults and hostage scenarios. It is common practice for individuals contemplating targeted acts of violence to conduct pre-attack surveillance and reconnaissance, the bulletin said. Security teams should review emergency management plans and spread awareness of the potential threat internally." In addition, staff and security teams should remain vigilant for any suspicious activity, as well as people or vehicles on organizational premises or in the vicinity of health sector facilities, the bulletin said.</p>

A vulnerability in ChatGPT that was identified last year is being used by would-be cyberattackers to target security flaws in artificial intelligence systems, with the healthcare industry one of the top targets, according to a report from Veriti. This vulnerability, despite being classified as medium severity, has already been weaponized in real-world attacks, the report found. The investigation found that in one week, multiple parties attempted more than 10,000 cyberattack attempts. "This could allow an attacker to steal sensitive data or impact the availability of the AI tool," Scott Gee, AHA deputy national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, said in a statement. Ransomware attacks have dominated, accounting for over 70% of successful cyberattacks on healthcare organizations in the past two years.</p>

AI is already transforming health care delivery at every level, including easing appointment scheduling and discharge, augmenting diagnostic decisions and streamlining resource allocation, just to name a few. A recent Market Insights report from the AHA Center for Health Innovation, “Building and Implementing an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan for Health Care,” provides health care leaders with an important starting point, a playbook for allocating resources and a road map for hospital and health care executives looking to expand their adoption of AI's capabilities. And while individual hospitals and health systems will proceed at their own pace, weaving AI-assisted methods and procedures into their care delivery in ways that work best for their organization and the patients they serve, this report provides the foundational building blocks for many institutions who want to create an effective AI action plan.

A PPP is based on contractual collaboration between different actors in the public sector (universities, hospitals, research institutes, etc. These collaborative initiatives, like those of the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) program, help break down traditional barriers by providing a cooperative space that is conducive to innovation. These large-scale projects make it possible to deal with health challenges that are too ambitious for a single actor to tackle alone – such as rare diseases and the integration of health data – transforming competitors into collaborators. Our contributions take various forms, such as providing our in-house expertise, robust data, new technologies and/or funding, each with a unique objective: to solve a common public health problem that would be impossible to achieve alone. Around 150 employees and 300 external partners contribute to the PPPs in which we are involved</p>

Stable or even recurring revenues can be earned through insurance premiums, patient care contracts, and testing services agreements. Looking forward, this sector is poised to benefit from tailwinds such as the aging population, which means rising prevalence of chronic diseases. Advances in telehealth, data analytics, and personalized medicine are likely to create new revenue opportunities for companies that can successfully digitize. As a group, revenues beat analysts' consensus estimates by 1.6% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line. "We delivered strong second quarter financial results while taking significant strategic and operational actions to position us for future growth," said Jason Hollar, CEO of Cardinal Health.</p>

Despite infancy being a period of rapid learning, memories from this time do not persist into later childhood or adulthood. In general, humans cannot recall events from the first three years of life – a phenomenon known as infantile amnesia. One theory suggests this occurs because the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for episodic memory, is not fully developed during infancy. These insights align with recent studies in rodents, which demonstrate that memories created during infancy can persist into adulthood but remain inaccessible for retrieval without direct stimulation of hippocampal engrams or reminder cues, the authors note. In this interview, News Medical speaks with Olivier Negre, Chief Scientific Officer at Smart Immune, about how immunotherapy is being revolutionized.</p>

“My focus in the larger picture of sports medicine is helping patients get back to their goal that's associated with movement,” says Marcus Fearing, MD. “It also means people who are trying to work out and stay healthy,” continues Dr. Fearing calls the clinic a “full team approach,” where nurses, athletic trainers, and doctors can quickly work together to come up with solutions for their patients. – Orthopedic surgery can help improve quality of life when nonsurgical options are not providing relief.

“I didn't expect to hear my name today,” Sanders said into the camera with a smile. Instead, his much-anticipated pro day throwing session is slated for April 4, when Colorado will stage its individual team event for the NFL, which head coach Deion Sanders expects to be attended by representatives of all 32 NFL franchises. “We always understood to block out the noise, even from Jackson State and Colorado,” Shedeur told NFL Network. The pre-draft “noise” has certainly lived up to its billing, with NFL teams waiting to see Shedeur go through a throwing workout while expressing mixed feelings about his game tape and their perceptions of his abundance of confidence. NFL Network's Bucky Brooks laughed and noted it wasn't the time to get “petty.”</p>

American women's rugby, as a result, is lagging behind its peers at the international level. It's been a whirlwind process, per WER president and co-founder Jessica Hammond-Graf, but the timing was intentional. Many WER players are also preparing for the 2025 Rugby World Cup, which will take place in England from August 22 through Sept. 27, and WER hopes to offer a dedicated training and competition space to help World Cup hopefuls prepare. WER is funded through private investors and venture capital firms, beginning with a pre-seeding funding round in April 2024 that raised $500,000. A men's professional league called PRO Rugby cropped up in 2015 and by 2017 had folded completely.</p>

The silver lining, if there is such a thing with an Achilles, is that Woods has plenty of experience working his way back from an injury and knows the physical and mental demands it will require to regain a personally acceptable level of form. According to friend and peer Fred Couples, Tiger is doing quite well less than two weeks removed from surgery. Couples offered an update on his buddy during a Champions Tour stop in Newport Beach on Friday, explaining that Woods was in "great spirits" when they recently spoke. As soon as it happened, he got back to me, and I texted him on a couple other things -- about TGL, his daughter just won that state soccer thing," Couples said. But he's my man, and texting him is a lot of fun."</p>

Leftwich interviewed for several jobs at the NFL level but is now tasked with developing a pivotal quarterback room in Boulder. Backup quarterback Ryan Staub is back, but Sanders also added major offseason additions Julian Lewis (freshman) and Kaidon Salter (Liberty) to man the position. Sanders hired fellow Hall of Famers running back Marshall Faulk and defensive lineman Warren Sapp to position coach roles. It's unclear at this point what formal role Leftwich will play on Sanders' staff, but he should have plenty of insight for the quarterbacks.

Chase has $1 million ($58,823.53 for each game active with a 17-game regular season) in every year of his contract. In addition to strong contract guarantees, Burrow got an extremely player-friendly structure from the Bengals. A substantial fifth day of the league year roster bonus in 2027 would also be required. Chase would be vulnerable to being released until the option was exercised since his 2026 base salary isn't guaranteed. Cincinnati's feet could have been held to fire with established team precedents for four-year deals until there were the right circumstances.</p>

Having it here in spring training this year was tantamount to a test with big-league players. If you've seen this ABS challenge system in reality, though, the time suck is very minimal. It's certainly worthwhile to fix missed calls, too, so those aren't considered a waste of time. We measure it and give catchers credit in defensive discussions for their ability to change balls into strikes. There are discussions on "framing metrics" that have even bled into the Hall of Fame with candidates this past year like Brian McCann and Russell Martin that we'll continue to have with Yadier Molina and into the foreseeable future.</p>

If there was an early NFL offseason loser, it may be the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers' defensive line will also look very different, as Javon Hargrave, Maliek Collins and Leonard Floyd are no longer on roster. General manager John Lynch says the team has a plan, and "some big things coming our way." Ultimately, this 49ers roster was due for a reset after "doubling down" last year following San Francisco's overtime Super Bowl loss. So guys like Leonard Floyd and Maliek — believe me, their impact was felt.</p>

Think of Miami QB Cam Ward as a player who is in Minecraft creative mode on the hardest mods. However, he's shown flashes of some big boy quarterbacking from inside the pocket and process that you can at least work with. Ward has a tendency to drift in the pocket and his base will become compromised because every throw is off platform. Ward's small hands might play into his lack of accuracy outside the numbers, but I think it's more just wonky lower body mechanics. You can see how Ward's body sort of jams up when he throws the ball, and it leads to sailed passes like this one.</p>

According to former Steelers running back Najee Harris, who signed with the Los Angeles Chargers in free agency, Pittsburgh's offensive woes weren't necessarily an accident. I really didn't have nobody to almost learn from on the offensive side. I think the veteran guy on that team was a two-, three-year vet. And I feel like [in L.A.], like we've got a lot of veterans that I can learn even more stuff from, even at the quarterback position, and the O-line position. So it was an interesting year there, I'll just say that.</p>

Boise State got that far last year behind star running back and Heisman Trophy finalist Ashton Jeanty, who's now off to the NFL as an expected first-round pick in April's draft. While Jeanty leaves a gaping hole on Boise State's roster, he's not the only important loss. New coach Bob Chesney, Cignetti's replacement, maintained the momentum by going 9-4 in his first year at James Madison. James Madison, which did struggle a bit once Sun Belt play began, is looking for even more in 2025. He's never won fewer than nine games as a head coach, and competing in the AAC gives his Green Wave plenty of visibility.</p>

On February 5, President Trump signed the “Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports” executive order. The order maintains that American laws require educational institutions to guarantee biological women “an equal opportunity to participate in sports” under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. The order recognizes only two sexes, male and female, and defines sex as “individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female,” which, the order states, is not changeable. The order is also facing legal challenges for discriminating against transgender people.

On Thursday, things hit a new low when they embarrassingly lost 115-98 to the lowly Charlotte Hornets, their second consecutive loss. Fortunately, it seems as though Brunson is on track to return during the regular season. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed Thursday that Brunson is out of his walking boot and doing some light shooting, an important step as he works to recover from the sprained ankle he suffered against the Los Angeles Lakers earlier this month. Bridges, Josh Hart and OG Anunoby are all role players who need a star to orbit around. The Knicks can't have a limited Brunson if they hope to make any playoff noise.</p>

Even when it comes to World Cup preparation, they'll get to face either Mexico or Canada in the Nations League third-place game making it a much bigger affair than the average third-place game. With both of them on the pitch, this is a completely different side. Chopping and changing things constantly isn't sustainable for a team of the USMNT's level. Most teams would struggle with their third-choice left back and striker in a match but the knock-on effect from both at the same time makes balancing a squad tough.

It marked not only Columbia's first-ever win in the NCAA Tournament, but also its first victory over a Big Ten squad. You'll see staffers holding up different signs, some covered with internet memes or stills from movie scenes. One day, she took the plan to Griffith and said, what if we did that?

It's a substitute Cecilio Waterman who cuts through the counter catching Joe Scally out and putting an excellent finish past Matt Turner. He received treatment after going up for a header and will be replaced by Mark McKenzie. It's quite an important role especially when some of those are coming via mistakes in possession. They will definitely be happy about the fact that Panama didn't manage a single shot on target but with just one shot on target (from Josh Sargent 19 minutes in, who was unlucky not to score at some point this half), there's definitely room for improvmeent htere. That's in comparison to Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte both logging over 3,500 minutes each for their clubs.</p>

Janet Mills over an executive order prohibiting trans athletes from competing in girls and women's sports. UMS, a network of eight public universities in Maine, claims it has been compliant with the NCAA's revised gender policy to keep trans athletes out of the women's category since the NCAA's revision was made on Feb. 6, and has always followed state and federal law. "After the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated a Title IX compliance review regarding federal funding, the University of Maine System (UMaine) has clearly communicated its compliance with Title IX's requirement to protect equal opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports, as articulated in President Donald J. Trump's Executive Order," the USDA said in its announcement. "The University of Maine System has always maintained its compliance with state and federal laws and with NCAA rules, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture also affirmed in a press release today," said Chancellor Malloy. Just hours after that interaction, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would investigate the state for allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls sports and for potential Title IX violations.</p>

Gilmore Girls has become a classic comfort watch over the years as devoted fans repeatedly tune in to rewatch the series each fall thanks to its cozy vibes and quirky New England small town charm. However, the amount that the actors get paid from residuals, even with an increase in popularity thanks to streaming services, may come as a surprise. Lauren Graham, who starred as eccentric mom Lorelai Gilmore opposite Alexis Bledel as brainy daughter Rory Gilmore, revealed during a March 19 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live that she doesn't receive a big paycheck from streaming giants like Netflix that house the show, per E! "And now it's trickled into younger people, older people, men whose kids or wives probably have forced them to watch it," she said, adding that she is often recognized in public. During an appearance on The Tonight Show in February, Graham told host Jimmy Fallon that the reception to the classic series and her role in particular has continued to be heartwarming, despite some strange comments she occasionally receives.</p>

In an emotional Instagram post, Amaal explained how his mental health has been deeply affected by the actions of "near and dear ones," including his parents, composer Daboo Malik and singer Jyoti Malik. He said that the situation had diminished his self-worth and left him emotionally drained. He also addressed the media, asking them not to sensationalize his vulnerability. His decision to distance himself from family ties, though difficult, was seen as a necessary step towards healing. The composer, known for his music in films such as Jai Ho, Khoobsurat, Roy, and MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, has always been open about his personal life, and this latest post further sheds light on the mental and emotional toll he has been grappling with.</p>

Joey Bada$$ is back on Power Book III: Raising Kanan, though his character, Unique, was nearly killed off in the show's third season. But it was also cool to see how people felt when they found out, 'Oh, s***, he's actually not gone,' too." Joey says it's different than the vengeance Unique's brother sought in season 3 because Ronnie had "more of, like, a social disorder." That showed up when Unique killed Raq's lawyer after secretly seeing the two and assuming they were together.
