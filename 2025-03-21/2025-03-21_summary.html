Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar amid mass protests against the move and Israel's resumption of hostilities in Gaza.

JERUSALEM — As Israeli forces carried out more strikes in a renewed Gaza offensive, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed forward on the home front to oust two senior officials in a development that roiled Israeli politics.

In a late-night Thursday cabinet session, Netanyahu's ministers voted unanimously to dismiss Ronen Bar, the director of the Shin Bet intelligence service who Netanyahu said no longer had his trust. Hours later, on Friday morning, the government scheduled another discussion for Sunday over firing Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who had advised Netanyahu not to fire the spy chief.

Netanyahu's moves to dismiss two of the most prominent and powerful dissenting voices in his government were criticized as unconstitutional by opposition leaders and sparked calls for further protests after large, occasionally chaotic demonstrations already took place this week in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Almost immediately, opposition parties petitioned the supreme court for an injunction on Bar's dismissal pending a judicial review — which was a granted by the court. The Business Forum, a group of 200 leading Israeli business leaders, threatened to “bring the Israeli economy to a halt” if the government did not obey the court order to temporarily freeze Bar's removal.

Netanyahu was unmoved as the outcry mounted Friday. “There will be no civil war!” he said in a post on X. "The State of Israel is a country governed by law, and according to the law, the Government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”

If the court ultimately sides with the government, Bar will leave his post sometime before April 10. But a ruling against the government might pit the supreme court in a direct battle with Netanyahu.

“What's taking shape is a more ominous clash between the government and the court, with mixed signals about whether the prime minister will — or will not — comply with its ruling,” said Shalom Lipner, a former Netanyahu aide who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “After many long months of stage-setting, a constitutional crisis could be fast upon Israel.”

Tensions have been building for months between Netanyahu and his internal security chief, with the two men and their supporters openly blaming each other for the policy and intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to carry out a devastating attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Bar has also been seen as one of the leading voices calling on Netanyahu to prioritize striking a deal with Hamas to recover all Israeli hostages, while Netanyahu and some of his allies, particularly on the political right-wing and the far-right, have stressed that the Gaza war must continue until Hamas is wholly eliminated.

Last month, Netanyahu removed Bar from the negotiating team with Hamas, and the prime minister has accused Bar of disobedience and leaking information about the hostage talks — allegations the Shin Bet director has denied.

Further fueling the feud, the Shin Bet, which is responsible for counterintelligence and protecting the integrity of Israeli democracy, opened a probe in February into allegations that three Netanyahu aides were on Qatar's payroll and maintained improper ties with a Gulf nation that is not seen as a friendly state. Baharav-Miara, who authorized the Qatar investigation, has warned Netanyahu against firing Bar, saying it would be a conflict of interest and would jeopardize the independence of the Shin Bet.

In an X post that was widely discussed in Israel this week, Netanyahu criticized the Shin Bet investigation as a conspiracy and likened himself to President Donald Trump. “In America and Israel, when a strong right-wing leader wins, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people's will," Netanyahu wrote in an X post that was shared by Elon Musk. “They won't win in either place!”

At the cabinet meeting late Thursday, Netanyahu accused Bar of disloyalty and leaking information about the hostage negotiations, according to Israeli media reports. Bar, in response, issued a letter to the cabinet saying it was the Shin Bet's duty to work “for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and not for the benefit of personal interests,” and criticized Netanyahu for blocking a probe into “serious incidents.”

“The urgent national need for such an investigation cannot be subordinated to the personal considerations of those involved in the matter,” Bar said in the letter, which was reviewed by The Post.

Bar's removal would likely represent a boost for hawkish voices within Netanyahu's government who have been calling for Israel to return to more intense fighting against Hamas. After Netanyahu announced his intention to fire Bar and resumed hostilities in Gaza this week, he brought Jewish Power party leader Itamar Ben Gvir back into his cabinet. In recent weeks, another far-right minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has urged Israel to cut off electricity and water to Gaza, return to fighting in the Strip, and gradually annex land if Hamas harms any hostages.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz appeared to echo Smotrich on Friday by warning that if Hamas did not release all hostages, the Israeli military will seize additional territory in Gaza.

“The more Hamas persists in its refusal, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed to Israel,” Katz said in a statement. He added that Israel will use “all measures to apply military and civilian pressure — including the evacuation of the Gazan population southward and the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump's voluntary relocation plan for Gaza residents.”

In Gaza on Friday, Israeli forces destroyed the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, according to footage posted on social media and the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed it struck “terrorists in a Hamas terrorist infrastructure site that previously had served as a hospital” and said the location has not been used as an active hospital for more than a year.

Last year, a Washington Post examination of satellite footage found that the IDF appeared to be using the hospital near the strategic Netzarim Corridor as a base of operations. The hospital previously served as an important cancer treatment center in Gaza before it was forced to close in the early days of the war due to nearby airstrikes and lack of fuel.

In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned Israel's destruction of the hospital, which was built by Turkey and run by local authorities, and called on the international community to “take concrete and deterrent measures against Israel's unlawful attacks.”

Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

Flights to and from London's Heathrow Airport were canceled Friday after a fire at a nearby substation knocked out power to Europe's busiest airport, disrupting travel plans for hundreds of thousands of people around the world.

At least 1,350 flights to and from Heathrow were affected already, including several from U.S. cities that were canceled, flight tracking service FlightRadar 24 said.

Britain's Heathrow Airport will be closed Friday after a fire at an electrical substation knocked out power to the airport and thousands of homes. About 150 people had to be evacuated after a transformer within an electrical substation caught fire in west London.

A large fire near London's Heathrow Airport knocked out power to Europe's busiest flight hub and forced it to shut all day. Travel expert Simon Calder explains how the incident is disrupting global travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers on Friday.

At least 1,350 flights have been disrupted at at Europe's busiest travel hub. Follow live updates. 



LONDON (AP) — The first plane landed at Heathrow Airport late Friday, about 18 hours after an inferno at an electrical substation caused a power outage that shuttered Europe's busiest air travel hub.



The British Airways jet touched down just before sunset after Heathrow lifted its closure order that disrupted global travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers.

At least 1,350 flights to and from Heathrow were affected, flight tracking service FlightRadar 24 said, and the impact was likely to last several days as passengers try to reschedule their travel and airlines work to reposition aircraft and crews.



Authorities do not know what caused the fire but so far found have no evidence it was suspicious.



Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion, followed by a fireball and clouds of smoke, when the blaze ripped through the electrical substation near the airport.



About 120 flights were in the air when the closure was announced, with some turned around and others diverted to Gatwick Airport outside London, Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris or Ireland's Shannon Airport, tracking services showed. 







Lawrence Hayes was most of the way to London from New York when Virgin Atlantic announced the plane was being diverted to Glasgow.



“It was a red-eye flight and I'd already had a full day, so I don't even know how long I've been up for,” Hayes told the BBC as he was getting off the plane in Scotland. “Luckily I managed to get hold of my wife and she's kindly booked me a train ticket to get back to Euston, but it's going to be an incredibly long day.”



Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports for international travel. It had its busiest January on record earlier this year, with more than 6.3 million passengers, up more than 5% from the same period last year.




AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on a big disruption in air travel through London.



Still, the disruption Friday fell short of the one caused by the 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and created trans-Atlantic air travel chaos for months.

It was too early to determine what sparked the huge blaze about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the airport, but there's “no suggestion” of foul play, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said.



The Metropolitan Police force said counterterrorism detectives were leading the investigation because of their ability to find the cause quickly and because of the location of the electrical substation fire and its impact on critical national infrastructure. 



Heathrow said its backup power supply designed for emergencies worked as expected, but it was not enough to run the whole airport. It said it had no choice but to close the airport for the day.



“We expect significant disruption over the coming days, and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” the airport said.

The widespread impact of the fire that took seven hours to control led to criticism that Britain was ill prepared for disaster or some type of attack if a single blaze could shut down Europe's busiest airport.



“The U.K.'s critical national infrastructure is not sufficiently hardened for anywhere near the level it would need to be at to give us confidence this won't happen again,” said Alan Mendoza, the executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, a security think tank. “If one fire can shut down Heathrow ... it tells you something's badly wrong with our system of management of such disasters.”



Tom Wells, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, acknowledged that authorities had questions to answer and said a rigorous investigation was needed to make sure “this scale of disruption does not happen again.”



Heathrow — where the U.K. government plans to build a third runway — was at the heart of a shorter disruption in 2023 when Britain's air traffic control system was hit by a breakdown that slowed takeoffs and landings across the U.K. on one of the busiest travel days of the year.

Heathrow had originally said it expected to reopen just before midnight, but anticipated “significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens.”



After Heathrow announced it would reopen, British Airways said it was cleared for eight long-haul flights to depart from Heathrow after 7 p.m. United Airlines said it expected to operate most of its Friday departures to London. 



Even after flights resume, it will take several days to mobilize planes, cargo carriers, and crews and rebook passengers, said aviation consultant Anita Mendiratta.



“It's not only about resuming with tomorrow's flights, it's the backlog and the implications that have taken place,” she said.

Mark Doherty and his wife were halfway across the Atlantic when the inflight map showed their flight from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport to Heathrow was turning around.



“I was like, you're joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York.



Doherty called the situation “typical England — got no back-up plan for something happens like this. There's no contingency plan.”



At Heathrow, a family of five traveling to Dallas showed up in the hopes their flight home — still listed as delayed — would take off.



But when Andrea Sri brought her brother, sister-in-law and their three children to the airport, they were told by police that there would be no flight.



“It was a waste of time. Very confusing,” said Sri, who lives in London. “We tried to get in touch with British Airways, but they don't open their telephone line until 8 a.m.”



Travelers who were diverted to other cities found themselves trying to book travel onward to London. Qantas airlines sent flights from Singapore and Perth, Australia, to Paris, where it said it would bus people to London, a process likely to also include a train shuttle beneath the English Channel.



Budget airline Ryanair, which doesn't operate out of Heathrow, said it added eight “rescue flights” between Dublin and Stansted, another London airport, to transport stranded passengers Friday and Saturday. 



National Rail canceled all trains to and from the airport.

Matthew Muirhead was working Thursday night near Heathrow when he stepped outside with a colleague and noticed smoke rising from an electrical substation and heard sirens.



“We saw a bright flash of white, and all the lights in town went out,” he said.



The London Fire Brigade sent 10 engines and around 70 firefighters to control the blaze and about 150 people were evacuated from their homes near the power station.



The blaze knocked out power to 67,000 customers, though most of it was restored by daybreak, the fire brigade said. 



Flights normally begin landing and taking off at Heathrow at 6 a.m. due to nighttime flying restrictions. But the skies were silent Friday morning.



“Living near Heathrow is noisy, there are planes every 90 seconds or so, plus the constant hum of traffic, but you get used to it, to the point of no longer noticing,” said James Henderson, who has lived next to the airport for more than 20 years. “Today is different, you can hear the birds singing.”

Senate Democrats have unveiled a novel whistleblower platform, inviting public and private sector workers to share insights on the alleged dismantling of federal agencies and programs by President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Axios reports. This initiative aims to expose what Democrats deem as illicit maneuvers by the White House to unilaterally slash federal agencies and programs.The whistleblower portal, spearheaded by Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), is slated to launch on Friday, with Merkley's staff on the Senate Budget Committee overseeing the tool. This move is part of a broader effort by Democrats to challenge Trump's efforts to downsize the federal government, despite holding minority positions in both the House and Senate.

Democrats are concerned that Trump's actions, including the recent signing of an order aimed at shuttering the Education Department, are an affront to Congressional authority. The Education Department has a substantial budget of $268 billion. Merkley emphasised, "The President is not a king, and we will make sure he is held accountable."

This whistleblower platform is not an isolated initiative. Earlier this year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) launched a similar portal for whistleblowers to report abuse of power under Trump. Furthermore, Democrats have highlighted whistleblower reports alleging that FBI Director Kash Patel orchestrated the purge of career officials at the bureau.

The launch of this whistleblower platform comes amidst growing concerns among voters, particularly younger ones, about DOGE's actions. Polling data indicates that voters are increasingly worried about the implications of these actions. By creating this platform, Democrats aim to harness these concerns and hold the Trump administration accountable for its actions.

PM says government will decide who heads domestic spy agency as protests against Ronen Bar dismissal continue



Benjamin Netanyahu is locked in a fierce battle with Israel's judicial system after the supreme court blocked his attempt to fire the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency.

Amid protests against ministers' vote to sack Ronen Bar, the top court on Friday froze the decision, with the order remaining in place until the court can hear petitions filed by the opposition and an NGO against the dismissal of the chief of the Shin Bet.

Netanyahu said in a post on X that “the government of Israel will decide” who headed the domestic security agency, writing: “The State of Israel is a state of law, and according to the law, the government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”

The Shin Bet has been investigating Netanyahu's close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media, and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.

In a letter made public late on Thursday, Bar said his dismissal was motivated by Netanyahu's “personal interests”. The security chief referred to the conclusions drawn by his agency's investigation into the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, which said “a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup”.

He added: “The dismissal of the head of the service at this time at the initiative of the prime minister sends a message to all those involved, a message that could put the optimal outcome of the investigation at risk. This is a direct danger to the security of the state of Israel.”

The court ruling said the freeze on Bar's dismissal would remain until the appeals were presented to the court before 8 April. According to the earlier government statement announcing his dismissal, Bar was supposed to leave his post when his successor was appointed, or by 10 April at the latest.

Bar, whose tenure was meant to end next year, was appointed by the previous Israeli government, which briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.

His relations with the prime minister had been strained even before the 7 October Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza, notably over a proposed judicial overhaul that had split the country. Relations worsened after the 4 March release of the internal Shin Bet report on the attack, which acknowledged the agency's own failures but also pointed to wider policy issues in the run-up.

In a statement on Friday, a Netanyahu spokesperson said: “The Israeli government, which is in charge of the Shin Bet, has lost all confidence in Ronen Bar, who continues to cling to his seat while cynically using the families of the kidnapped and politically incorrect use of his position to fabricate futile, unfounded investigations.

“Ronen had the opportunity to retire with honour after his searing failure on October 7 … But [he] preferred not to attend the government meeting dealing with his case.”

A series of high-ranking officials seen as responsible for mistakes and misjudgments in the period before the Hamas attack have resigned. Netanyahu himself has not accepted any responsibility for Israel's worst ever security disaster, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and has resisted calls for a powerful commission of inquiry.

After the government vote against Bar, Israel's opposition and an NGO said on Friday they had filed a petition against the decision. Their initiative was upheld by the supreme court, ruling as the high court of justice on state decisions, which subsequently issued a temporary injunction.

The Movement for Quality Government in Israel NGO had denounced “an unlawful decision … posing a real risk to the national security of the state of Israel”, while the opposition leader Yair Lapid's centre-right party denounced what it called “a decision based on flagrant conflict of interest”.

The communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, said in response to the ruling that the judges had no right to interfere in the government's decision to fire Bar. “Bar will end his tenure on April 10 or earlier, with the appointment of a permanent head of the Shin Bet,” he said. “You have no legal authority to interfere in this. This is the government's authority. Your order is void.”

A former head of the Shin Bet, Yoram Cohen, condemned Bar's sacking in an interview with Israel's Channel 12 on Friday, and alleged that the prime minister had compelled him to carry out acts of questionable legitimacy when he was in charge of the agency.

He has previously alleged that in 2011 Netanyahu asked him to wiretap the government's top defence officials to ensure “they were not leaking information from a particularly sensitive security meeting”, the Times of Israel reported.

In a separate move on Friday, Netanyahu's cabinet said it would debate on Sunday a motion of no confidence in the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, accusing her of acting “as the long arm of the government's opponents”.

Baharav-Miara previously warned Netanyahu he could not fire Bar before her office had reviewed his motives for doing so.

“According to the decision of the supreme court, it is prohibited to take any action that harms the position of the head of the Shin Bet, Ronen Bar,” Baharav-Miara said in a message to Netanyahu published by a spokesperson on Friday. “It is prohibited to appoint a new head of Shin Bet, and interviews for the position should not be held.”

Netanyahu is facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. The 75-year-old politician, who came to power for the first time in 1996 and has served 17 years as prime minister, is giving evidence twice weekly.

On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators protested for a fourth consecutive day against the move to sack Bar, joining protesters angry at the decision to resume fighting in Gaza while 59 Israeli hostages remain in the Palestinian territory.

Community impact hearings offer outlet for grievances and gather evidence for ongoing lawsuits, totaling 10 so far

A Minnesota veteran who found work at the Veterans Benefits Administration after suffering two traumatic brain injuries on overseas deployments stood in front of hundreds of people and five Democratic state attorneys general on Thursday night and recalled the moment she learned she lost her job.

“All I was given was a Post-it note,” Joy Marver said, inspiring gasps and boos from a raucous crowd. “The Post-it note contained just the HR email address and my supervisor's phone number. This came from an external source. Doge terminated me. No one in my chain of command knew I was being terminated. No one knew. It took two weeks to get my termination email sent to me.”

The firing was so demoralizing she said she considered driving her truck off a bridge but instead went into the VA for crisis care.

“Don't fuck with a veteran,” she concluded.

The story was one of many shared by former federal workers and others impacted by the Trump administration's policies during a town hall in St Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday, part of a national tour that has offered an avenue for grievances against Donald Trump's first two months, but also a way to gather evidence for ongoing lawsuits, totaling about 10 so far, that Democratic attorneys general have filed against the Trump administration.

“Everybody's putting in double duty. But the point is, we're absolutely up to it. We got four and a half years of gas in our tanks, and we're here to fight for the American people all the way through,” Ellison told reporters before the event began.

The community impact hearings, as they're calling them, kicked off in Arizona earlier this month and will continue in Oregon, Colorado, Vermont and New York, the attorneys general said. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Kris Mayes of Arizona, Letitia James of New York, Matthew Platkin of New Jersey and Kwame Raoul of Illinois attended the event in Minnesota on Thursday, where the crowd filled a high school auditorium and spilled into an overflow room.

Attendees were given the opportunity to take the mic and share their stories.

Another veteran who worked at the Veterans Benefit Administration was fired via email by Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency”, she said. She was part of the probationary employee purge, and her supervisors didn't know she was let go. She recalled that her boss' response to her firing was: “WTF”.

A probationary employee at an unnamed federal agency said she was also let go. She interviewed and did background checks for 11 months to secure her federal role. “Now we are forced to put our plans of starting a family, of owning a home on hold indefinitely, and I feel that this disruption of this dream will be felt for the rest of our lives,” she said.

A former employee of 18F, the federal government's digital services agency, said they were laid off in the middle of the night on a weekend. “I'm grieving. We didn't deserve this,” they said. A former USAID worker said she watched as Doge moved through the agency, accessing files and threatening employees if they spoke up, before she was fired.

After several probationary employees shared their stories, Arizona's Mayes cut in to ask whether the Trump administration or their agencies had reached out to rehire them. The Democratic attorneys general secured a win in a lawsuit over these firings, and a judge ruled they needed to be reinstated. If that wasn't happening, Mayes said, they needed to know.

“We can bring a motion to enforce,” Ellison explained. “We can bring, perhaps, a motion for contempt. There's a lot of things. But if we don't know that, we certainly can't do anything.”

Before the town hall began, the attorneys general said that they had secured temporary restraining orders halting or reversing Trump administration directives in nearly all of their cases so far. In several instances, they have had to file additional actions to get the administration to comply with the orders. In a case that ended a “pause” on federal grants, for example, the pause was ended – but some programs still were not restarted. James said they had to file a motion to enforce to get those programs running again.

Trans people shared how the Trump administration's disdain for their community was affecting them. A young trans athlete was kicked off her softball team, her mom shared. A trans veteran was worried about her access to life-saving healthcare. Doctors who treat trans youth said their patients are on edge.

Immigrants and people from mixed-status families talked about the specter of deportation and how the threat loomed over their day to day. One woman said her mother's partner was deported, as was her husband's uncle. She worries daily whether her mom is next. “The Trump administration has impacted me deeply during these past two months alone, but more than ever, we have to come together organized because I'll be damned if they keep hurting my family,” she said.

Suzanne Kelly, the CEO of the Minnesota Council of Churches, said her organization, which helps resettle refugees, is losing $4m in federal funds that would go directly to their clients, an amount that can't be replaced with local dollars. She has had to lay off 26 employees, most of whom are refugees or asylees themselves. Refugees they were expecting to help are now stranded overseas in refugee camps, she said. People already here will lose rental aid and other assistance.

“Whatever your faith tradition, please pray with us for those individuals, and pray with us for this country. We're better than this,” Kelly said.

After two hours of testimony a Minnesota activist stood up and shared their vision of the way forward: “The first step of that call to action is just to get fucking angry, man.”

It was as galling as it was predictable.Last Thursday, the UN Human Rights Council released a report accusing Israel – whose women were raped by invading Hamas marauders on Oct. 7 and as hostages in Gaza – of “the systematic use of sexual, reproductive, and other gender-based violence” against Palestinians. Nothing less.  It also accused Israel of “genocidal acts.” Yet again. This was not some keffiyeh-wearing, backpack-hauling protester at Columbia University making audacious claims. It was an officially sanctioned UN body lending its imprimatur to the accusations.Israel's response was equally predictable. AdvertisementHorrid antisemitism, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One of the worst blood libels the world has ever seen, said Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar.

(credit: Mike Segar/Reuters)But these statements likely had as much impact on global public opinion as the UN report had on Israeli opinion. A new approach is needed. Einat Wilf – prolific author on Israel and Zionism, articulate lecturer, and former MK in the Labor Party and Ehud Barak's short-lived Independence faction – has a suggestion: Stop focusing on the trees. Look at the forest.Each UN report, each Amnesty International document, is a tree. Stopping at each one means getting lost in the forest.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Last Thursday, the UN Human Rights Council released a report accusing Israel – whose women were raped by invading Hamas marauders on Oct. 7 and as hostages in Gaza – of “the systematic use of sexual, reproductive, and other gender-based violence” against Palestinians. Nothing less.  It also accused Israel of “genocidal acts.” Yet again. This was not some keffiyeh-wearing, backpack-hauling protester at Columbia University making audacious claims. It was an officially sanctioned UN body lending its imprimatur to the accusations.Israel's response was equally predictable. AdvertisementHorrid antisemitism, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.'

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <

(credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Einat Wilf – prolific author on Israel and Zionism, articulate lecturer, and former MK in the Labor Party and Ehud Barak's short-lived Independence faction – has a suggestion: Stop focusing on the trees. Look at the forest.Each UN report, each Amnesty International document, is a tree. Stopping at each one means getting lost in the forest.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on.

It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <

The bigger picture, Wilf contends, is far more dangerous: the relentless equation of Israel and Zionism with whatever evil is dominating the discourse at the time – imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, white supremacy, and genocide. This is part of a much broader and more pernicious campaign: instilling a global mindset that the world would be better off without the collective Jew. AdvertisementThis is, by no means, a new mindset – indeed, it is an ancient one, she said. It is the notion that “there is a better world out there – a world of salvation, a world of racial purity, a world of human rights, of cleanliness, and that the collective Jew stands between this world and utopia.”She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



She argued that the same animating idea is at work today, but few articulate it in these terms. Israel's reaction to the UN report, therefore, should not have been localized or limited to condemning it as libel, she maintained, but rather placing it in this much broader context.Wilf, a Jerusalem native with a BA in government and fine arts from Harvard and a PhD in political science from Cambridge, has lectured and written extensively about what she calls the Palestinian “placard strategy.”  The term refers to the slogans that appear on placards at anti-Israel demonstrations, which, she said, “Is the repetitive, nursery rhyme equation of Israel, Zionism, and the Star of David to a litany of words that are all accepted as evil.”Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935.

These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced.

A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on.

(credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake.

We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Wilf speaks flawless, accentless English, leading many who hear her to assume that she was born in the US or has American parents. Neither is true. Rather, when she was in fourth grade, her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, for two years while her father completed a post-doc at the National Institutes of Health. “It's a good age for a kid – not too early, not too late – to get the accent right,” she said. ‘THE PROTOCOLS of the Elders of Zion,' c. 1935. (credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Prestige suspends judgment: How anti-Israel accusations are perceived as credibleTHE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends.

This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



THE WORDS on the placards themselves – “colonialism,” “racism,” “apartheid” – matter less than their endless repetition, she argued. These words appear repeatedly in protests, the media, social media, and, crucially, institutions with global prestige, like the UN, giving them a veneer of legitimacy.Wilf recalled a former KGB officer's observation that “prestige suspends judgment.” If a prestigious institution – a UN body, a university, a human rights organization – endorses an idea, it gains automatic respectability.That is why, she explained, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was so effective: 120 years ago, a book carried prestige, even if it was a fabrication.Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself.

She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Today, the same laundering process takes place. The formula – “Israel, Zionism, Star of David = evil” – gets reinforced through institutions that still command authority, however misplaced. Human rights organizations, academia, and the UN serve as conduits for these libels. Wilf noted that one can even earn a PhD by arguing that Zionism is colonialism. A tenure-track career can be built on the claim that Israel is an apartheid state.The letters “UN” are still “incredibly powerful,” she said. “So we need to understand what's going on. We need to understand how dangerous it is, and that's what we need to convey.” US politician Bernie Sanders at the launch of his book ''It's Okay to Be Angry at Capitalism'' at the House of World Cultures in Berlin, Oct. 12, 2023. (credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images)How some Jews give legitimacy to anti-Israel accusationsIRONICALLY, WHAT also gives these ideas prestige and legitimacy is when some Jews, like US Senator Bernie Sanders or American journalist Peter Beinart, voice them.Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it.

It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Asked how best to respond to them, Wilf replied that here, too, she would show the “big picture.” And that picture is that Jews, as a minority, have always faced immense pressures and temptations to betray their own people, with greater rewards for those who are more articulate and educated.“There will always be the Jews who succumb to the pressures – that's the price of being a minority in a world that still fundamentally feels uneasy with our continued existence,” she said, adding that these people are “useful” to the other side but never respected.“This is the attitude to take: We understand it's hard to be Jewish; there are rewards for selling us out. Some will fall to that pressure. There's not much we can do about that. This is our cross to bear.”More than a PR battle: Israel wages war on a genocidal global mindsetCONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



CONTRARY TO popular belief, Wilf argued, Israel is not simply engaged in a PR battle. The issue is more profound: A global mindset is being shaped – one that sees the world's problems as solvable if only Israel ceased to exist. And as was chanted repeatedly after Oct. 7, this can be achieved “by any means necessary.”Why are all means legitimate? Because if the collective Jew is perceived as the last barrier to utopia, then any means of erasing it are justified. Wilf cited a chilling example: A placard after Oct. 7 showing an Israeli flag in a dustpan with the caption, “Keep the world clean.”“It is not a coincidence that all the evil words are on the side of Israel, Zionism, Star of David,” she said, “and that all the good words – justice, equality, freedom, and rights – are on the side of its negation, what I have come to call ‘Palestinianism,' which is ultimately an ideology that is built on the negation of the collective Jew.”This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave.

And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



This is the bigger picture, she said, and one that needs to be conveyed.Once we do this, she continued, “We need to let people understand that this is the kind of ideology that brings down societies and that you do not have any moment in history where societies become obsessed with the notion that the collective Jew stands between them and utopia, and somehow it ends well.”Rather than merely refuting each new libelous UN report, Israel must expose the deeper pattern at play. This “virus,” she warned, has been inserted into the Western world – into the US, France, and Britain. She also said that the Jewish people historically have had a “timing problem.”“By the time the world wakes up to how destructive these ideologies are, we often suffer the brunt of the damage,” she argued. “So we need to first of all focus on ensuring that we suffer as little damage as possible as this ideology works itself through the world, but we have allies, and we have friends. We need to help them understand what's going on.”How can Israel fight the 'virus' of Palestinianism?HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself.

And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



HOW SHOULD Israel go about doing that?First, she said, it must start conveying this broader message – something its leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downward, has failed to do.Netanyahu, Wilf contended, does not take Palestinianism seriously. She defined it as an ideology that unites Arabs from Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and their supporters around a singular obsessive objective: the erasure of the Jewish state.Palestinianism has certain core tenets, she said, among them: From the river to the sea, there will be no Jewish state; Palestinians are perpetual refugees until “return is achieved”; return is not some “soft nostalgia” for a great-grandparent's home – Oct. 7 is return: The erasure of Israel and Zionism is the only acceptable outcome.Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said. Einat Wilf is seen with Ehud Barak, then-defense minister, as he leads a meeting of his short-lived Independence faction, in the Knesset, 2012. (credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state.

But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Paradoxically, since he was no friend of the Jews, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin encapsulated the essence of this “Palestinianism” in a speech he gave to Parliament in 1947 explaining why Britain was returning its mandate over Palestine to the UN.Wilf often cites this speech: “His Majesty's Government have thus been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles. For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.”That, she maintains, is the essence of the conflict – having nothing to do with occupation, settlements, displacement, or even the policies of this or that Israeli government.Wilf sees Palestinianism as an ideology of erasure. “It does not seek self-determination. It does not seek statehood. It does not seek independence. It seeks only to prevent to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of the land,” she said.

(credit: FLASH90)The career and achievements of Einat WilfARRIVING AT that conclusion wasn't the usual trajectory for someone who still considers herself on the Israeli Left. Wilf served as a foreign policy adviser to Shimon Peres from 2002 to 2006 and served in the Knesset from 2010 to 2013, first in Labor and then as part of Barak's faction.She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership.

In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



She hasn't ruled out a return to politics and plans to take an “exploratory tour of Israel” to see if her ideas resonate and if “something clicks.” She'll “make something political out of it if it does.” If not, she'll “go home and write an essay about my failed journey.”“One thing I've learned in politics is that people often say they want things – they want everyone gone, they want new faces, they want this, they want that – but when the time comes for decisions, they actually don't want those things,” she said.Over time, a series of pivotal moments reshaped Wilf's understanding of the conflict.One of those moments came from witnessing firsthand Palestinian leaders reject statehood. It wasn't just learning about the Arab world's refusal to accept partition in 1947. It was watching both Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas walk away from offers of independence made by two prime ministers, Barak and Ehud Olmert.“I'm seeing with my own eyes Palestinians walking away again and again from an opportunity to have a state,” she said. “And it just doesn't make sense.”She searched for historical parallels and found none. “I checked it. You don't have an example of a movement that claims to want independence, liberation, and self-determination repeatedly saying ‘no,'” she said. “At one point, you have to say it is not a movement for independence, liberation, and self-determination – they want something else.”Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything.

Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <
            



Another turning point was living through the massacres of the Second Intifada. “I began to ask a simple question: What is going on?” She said that rejecting statehood and then going on a terrorist assault is not the way a people who genuinely want independence behave. DURING THAT period, as a member of the Left, she was invited to meetings with moderate Palestinians – people educated at top universities in the US and the UK. She was stunned by what she heard. “They were saying things like, ‘The Jews are a religion, not a people, and only a people, not a religion, has the right to self-determination,' and that the connection you claim to the land is made up so you can steal it.” These, she stressed, were the voices of the moderates.When people describe her shift in thinking as a journey from Left to Right, she rejects that framing. “I say that I remain an Israeli lefty in every kind of issue that matters. And I also say this is not a journey. I compare it to a scientific process of finding out empirical reality.”She sees it as a case of hypothesis testing. “Like I tell people, compare it to a scientist. We had a hypothesis in the 1980s and ‘90s that came out of the First Intifada – the mood of the ‘90s that says that what separates us from peace is a Palestinian state and Palestinian control of territory.”That hypothesis, she said, was tested “multiple times because we are good scientists.” Two Israeli prime ministers, Barak and Olmert, tested it with two different Palestinian leaders, Arafat and Abbas. In between, Ariel Sharon tried another approach through unilateral disengagement.“We tested the hypothesis that what stands between us and peace is Palestinian control of territory, a Palestinian state. And it failed,” she said.A good scientist, she continued, must then ask: What is the alternative hypothesis? And that led her back to Bevin's formulation: “The Jews want a state; the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state.”For Wilf, that simple formulation explains everything. GIVEN HER views, one might expect Wilf to have at least a grudging respect for Netanyahu. She does not. In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership.

In her view, he has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the conflict.“At one point,” she said, “I thought it was his ego – his sense of self just doesn't allow him to take Palestinianism seriously. He wants to focus on Iran.” But by fixating on Iran as the primary threat, she argued, the prime minister has ignored a more immediate danger. “It's like the man has no understanding of where the dangers lie or who our enemies are.”She believes one of his biggest missteps came in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, when US president Joe Biden visited Israel and delivered a deeply moving speech. “You could see how shaken he was by the evil that was unleashed that day,” she recalled. But then Biden added a crucial line: “Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.”The significance of that sentence, she said, was clear to her the moment she heard it. “I remember thinking, ‘We are going to pay dearly for this.' And what did Israel – official Israel, under Netanyahu – do? It caved.” According to Wilf, military spokespeople were directed to reinforce the narrative that Israel was at war only with Hamas, not with the Palestinians.For Wilf, this was a critical failure of leadership. Instead of going along with Biden's framing, she argued, Netanyahu should have responded with measured but firm disagreement: “Thank you, Mr. Biden, for everything you're doing for us – the aircraft carriers, the Iron Dome support. But unfortunately, all the evidence points to the fact that Hamas does represent the Palestinians.”She pointed to the Palestinian celebrations on Oct. 7, the vast tunnel networks, the stockpiling of weapons, and the transformation of Gaza into what she called an “integrated, weaponized landscape.” In her view, pretending that Hamas and the Palestinian people are separate entities is a dangerous illusion.“I am not going to send soldiers into battle based on a lie,” she said, imagining what Netanyahu should have said.The failure to acknowledge reality, she argued, has led Netanyahu to incorrectly define the enemy. “It's as if the US president in December 1941 [after Pearl Harbor] would have declared war only against Japanese pilots – saying, ‘other than that, we're good.'”Instead, she believes Israel must confront the broader ideological war it faces. “The correct war is, at a minimum, against Gaza and, more truly, against Palestinianism itself. This war will continue until the ideology of Palestinianism dies – so that Jews and Arabs can finally live in peace.”For Wilf, the prime minister's refusal to see the whole picture has had severe consequences. “If you don't understand who your real enemy is, you will keep making mistake after mistake. And in that, I think Netanyahu bears responsibility for so much of what has gone wrong.“He is fighting the wrong war.”           <

Fire at substation leaves Heathrow airport closed — and travellers scrambling

London's Heathrow Airport said on Friday it was resuming flights after a fire at a substation knocked out its power, and it expected to run a full operation on Saturday, though experts questioned how such crucial infrastructure could fail.

The fire, which was reported just after 11 p.m. local time on Thursday, forced planes to divert to airports across Britain and Europe, while many long-haul flights simply returned to their point of departure.

Huge orange flames and plumes of black smoke could be seen shooting into the sky from a power station roughly three kilometres from the airport. It took about 70 firefighters and seven hours to get the blaze under control, the London Fire Brigade said. By early morning the roads around Britain's biggest airport were largely deserted.

Police said that while there was no indication of a criminal cause to the blaze, they retained an open mind and counter-terrorism officers would lead the inquiries, given their capabilities and the critical nature of the infrastructure.

Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the "catastrophic" fire had prevented the power back-up system from working and that engineers were working to deploy a third back-up mechanism. 

Philip Ingram, a former intelligence officer in the British military, said Heathrow's inability to keep operating exposed vulnerability in Britain's critical national infrastructure.

"It is a wake-up call," he told Reuters. "There is no way that Heathrow should be taken out completely because of a failure in one power substation."

Airline experts said the last time European airports experienced disruption on such a large scale was the 2010 Icelandic ash cloud, which grounded some 100,000 flights.

Heathrow said its expectation was "to operate our normal schedule starting with [Friday] evening's departures," but that "customers should check the status of their flight before going to the airport."

Air Canada said six flights that were in the air had to return to their departure points, while a seventh was cancelled just before departing. That list included flights from Calgary, Toronto and Montreal.

"We have been able to reroute some customers to other European gateways, but our available space for doing so is limited," Air Canada said in a statement. "As well, we have put in place a policy for customers travelling to London to change their travel plans."

"Once we are told by Heathrow how many flights we will be permitted to operate we will finalize tonight's schedule and notify customers and, as the situation normalizes, we will look to add extra capacity if needed to move delayed customers," the airline added.

Since the Heathrow closure was announced, a Friday morning flight from Halifax to London was cancelled, as were six more that had been scheduled for later in the day, which were departing from Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Vancouver.

Greater Toronto Airports Authority advised travellers heading to Toronto's Pearson Airport to check the status of their departures with their airline and that Pearson's social media accounts would provide regular updates.

"Currently all arriving flights are cancelled," the GTAA told CBC.

A representative from Montreal-Trudeau International Airport told CBC that three flights that were to depart late Thursday were affected and that two departures to Heathrow were cancelled Friday.

Vancouver International Airport said one Air Canada flight late Thursday was forced to return after taking off, while a British Airways flight was cancelled beforehand. The airport said a late Friday afternoon Air Canada flight to Heathrow and a British Airways departure scheduled for Friday night are scheduled to operate on time, but that travellers are advised to check ahead given the fluid situation.

The fire brigade said that 25,000 litres of cooling oil in the substation's transformer had caught fire. By the morning, the transformer could be seen smouldering, doused in white firefighting foam.

The cost of the impact could total around 20 million pounds ($37 million Cdn) a day, said Paul Charles, a travel consultant.

"A backup should be failsafe in the event of the core system being affected. Heathrow is such a vital piece of British infrastructure that it should have failsafe systems," Charles told Reuters.

Heathrow had said the airport, which was due to handle 1,351 flights during the day, flying up to 291,000 passengers, would stay closed until midnight, until amending the timeline late Friday afternoon local time.

Heathrow normally opens for flights daily at 6 a.m. local time due to nighttime flying restrictions.

Some 120 flights were in the air when the closure was announced, with some turned around and others diverted to Gatwick Airport outside London, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris or Ireland's Shannon Airport, tracking services showed.

British Airways itself had 341 flights scheduled to land at Heathrow on Friday.

"It's pretty stressful," said Robyn Autry, 39, a professor who had been due to fly home to New York. "I'm worried about how much is it going to cost me to fix this."

Prices at hotels around Heathrow jumped, with booking sites offering rooms for 500 pounds ($925 Cdn), roughly five times the normal price levels.

Heathrow, and London's other major airports, have been hit by outages in the past in recent years, most recently by an automated gate failure and an air traffic system meltdown, both in 2023.

Heathrow had its busiest January on record earlier this year, with more than 6.3 million passengers, up more than five per cent from the same period last year. January also was the 11th month in a row that it averaged over 200,000 passengers a day, with the airport citing trans-Atlantic travel as a key contributor.

"If the government decides to lead Israel with open eyes into a constitutional crisis, we will shut down the companies and launch a public struggle together with all the strength of Israeli society," the Israeli High-Tech Headquarters, which includes dozens of the largest high-tech companies and leading venture capital funds, said in a statement Friday afternoon."We call on [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to stop a moment before falling into the abyss."A violation of a High Court order or any court ruling is a red line from which there is no return. Such a breach would turn Israel into a third-world country, driving away foreign investors," the statement added.  Histadrut Chief Arnon Bar David warned on Friday of "anarchy under government auspices," says refusal to comply with High Court ruling is a "red line," and vows that he will not "sit quietly while the State of Israel is being dismantled."Protesters gather in Jerusalem near the High Court of Justice.

Patton Kizzire's 2025 season has been difficult; he finished T40 at The Sentry to start the season and hasn't made an appearance in any of his six subsequent tournaments. This includes the 2025 Valspar Championship, where he lost his first round due to frustrations from a difficult year.

After missing a short putt, the three-time PGA Tour winner lost his temper and kicked his putter over the green. Kizzire had to take a spare club out of his bag to complete the hole because the first one was dented when it landed, as reported by CBS Sports.

Kizzire was one over on his sixth hole (having started on the tenth) after missing a five-footer for par, dropping him to world No. 128 after six consecutive missed cuts.

Kizzire, who was undoubtedly still furious after missing a three-footer for birdie a few holes before, lost his temper and abruptly changed from Ben Hogan to Barry John. He let go of his putter and kicked it on the fly; it must have gone 20 yards before landing in a striking area with a clubface that looked terrible and a bent shaft, as reported by The Telegraph.

 

 

Kizzire got his money's worth from this little meltdown, as his putter soared a good 20 yards with a bent shaft. It's not often that you see a full-on putter punt. After finishing the hole with a wedge, he left the event shortly after, claiming to have had a back ailment.

Whether the back injury is a chronic problem or if it was altered by booting his putter across the green (or possibly at another point in the round) is unclear.

After defeating Rickie Fowler in the 2017 World Technology Championship, Kizzire removed his maiden tag and won three tournaments on the US circuit. However, his volatility has made him notorious.

He gave the expression "going through the bag" a new meaning four years ago when he broke a driver over his knee and the week after, he did the same furious thing to his putter. Following this performance, which was more of an up-and-down than an up-and-under, the fines accumulated and will do so once more.

Last September, Kizzire won the Procore Championship at Silverado Resort in Napa, California, shooting 20-under to record his third career victory. The next week in the Sanderson Farms, he backed that up with a T11, but he was unable to maintain that good form, missing eight cuts in his final ten appearances.

Amid a spike in abductions and enforced disappearances of Baloch nationals, morgues have been kept out of bounds for local residents who live in fear and uncertainty of their loved ones who are missing.

As bodies lined up over the past week, locals were demanding security agencies to allow them to visit morgues to identify if their missing family members were among those dead. But that was reportedly denied by the Pakistani establishment.

The Baloch Yakjehti Committee, a human rights organisation, has been protesting the gross violation of human rights by Pakistan's military in the war-ravaged region. But they too are facing a crackdown.

After days of protest over "enforced disappearances" of Balochis and for not being allowed to visit morgues as bodies piled up, protesters and local residents reportedly barged into the Civil Hospital in Balochistan's capital city Quetta. As per local reports, several corpses were taken away by them.

It is not yet known, if these bodies were taken away after identification or not.

The Pakistan Army says the bodies at the morgue were of members of the militant organisation Baloch Liberation Army, which has been carrying out an armed rebellion against Pakistan for its "illegal occupation" of Balochistan.

The BLA had taken an entire train - Jaffar Express - hostage earlier this month, before reportedly releasing women, children, and Baloch passengers, keeping mostly personnel of the Pakistani security forces hostage. Pakistan's Army had launched a military offensive against them.

To get back the corpses, Pakistan's security agencies launched a search operation. Raids have been carried out in Sariab Road and Secretariat Chowk areas in Quetta. Three bodies have reportedly been recovered and several people have been arrested.

"Corpses that were taken away were the unidentified bodies of militants who were killed in the military operation following the attack on the Jaffar Express," said a government official.

Activists of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee also confirmed the incident, saying some of the protesters, which included family members of missing persons, had taken away a number of bodies. "We had been trying to gain access to the morgue for two days to satisfy the missing persons' family members that the bodies kept there were not of their loved ones," said a BYC member.

The Baloch Yakjehti Committee, led by rights activist Mahrang Baloch, is now under Pak spy agency ISI's scanner.

The Heathrow airport in London (LHR), one of the busiest in the world and an important international hub for Indian passengers, was forced shut due to a fire at a power substation near the airport, leading to massive flight disruptions for the day. 

“Heathrow is experiencing a significant power outage across the airport due to a large fire at a nearby electrical substation. Whilst fire crews are responding to the incident, we do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored. To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, we have no choice but to close Heathrow until 23h59 on 21 March 2025,” the airport, which serves as a major gateway for travel between India and the UK, and also as a transit point for those travelling to other parts of Europe or the US, said in a statement. 

According to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, 37 (two-way) flights were to be operated between India and LHR on Friday. Air India had six flights to LHR on Friday with 1,843 seats. As per its website, 1,186 flights are scheduled to operate between LHR and India in March. 

“We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” the airport further said. 

Air India, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic operate direct flights between India and LHR. 

British Airways has eight daily flights to LHR and Virgin Atlantic has five daily non- stop flights to LHR from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. 

“Our operations to and from LHR have been disrupted following the temporary suspension of operations at the airport until 23h59 London time of 21 March… Consequently, Heathrow-bound AI129 from Mumbai is returning to Mumbai; AI161 from Delhi is getting diverted to Frankfurt. All our remaining flights to and from London Heathrow, including AI111 this morning, have been cancelled for 21 March... Flights to London's Gatwick aircraft remain unaffected,” Air India said in a statement. 

Cirium, in an email, stated that 699 flights were scheduled to depart from LHR airport on Friday. “Roughly upwards of 1,45,000 passengers could be impacted. This is an estimate based on the daily total scheduled seats and flights, which will not be full, and noting the various departure times around the world that could arrive at LHR on Friday. On the LHR departures front, upwards of 145,000 total seats are scheduled to fly on March 21. There are 669 flights scheduled to depart March 21, 2025,” it stated. 

A British Airways spokesperson said that as a result of the power outage, customers due to travel from Heathrow on Friday were advised not to travel to the airport until further notice. 

“This will clearly have a significant impact on our operation and our customers and we're working as quickly as possible to update them on their travel options for the next 24 hours and beyond,” a statement from the spokesperson read. 

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said, “Unfortunately, this has had a significant impact on our flying programme, both to and from Heathrow and all Virgin Atlantic arriving and departing flights are cancelled until 21:30 on 21 March…” 

Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International (CSMI) airport also issued an advisory for passengers travelling to the Heathrow airport and requested them to connect with their airlines for information on their scheduled flight. 

Debasish Chakraverty, a Mumbai resident said, “I was aboard the Virgin Atlantic flight VS359 from Mumbai to London on my way to Tampa, Florida on Friday morning. About five-and-a-half hours into the journey, the pilot announced that we would have to turned back and are returning to Mumbai due to the situation at London Heathrow airport. As an Indian American who has lived through the aftermath of 9/11, my first thoughts were that this might be something of a similar magnitude. However, I had opted for Wi-Fi onboard because of which l could learn the actual reason.” 

Chakraverty, however, alleged that the situation had led to chaos at the Mumbai airport as the airport was not prepared to handle the situation. 

However, passengers of the Air India flight that took off from Delhi and had to be diverted to Frankfurt due to the closure, remained stranded in the foreign country. “The passengers were given accommodation, but the status of the flight will be updated once a communication from LHR is received,” an airline official said. 

According to Cirium, marginally fewer flights and seats are scheduled to be flown on Saturday. 

“There are 615 flights scheduled to depart from LHR tomorrow, (with 136,951 seats) and 604 flights scheduled to land in LHR with 134,726 seats,” it said. 

“The impact of this incident can cascade over several days, as aircraft, crew, and passengers are out of place, with limited spare aircraft and seats available to recover passengers,” it concluded.

        A strike on Odesa came shortly before a visit by President of the Czech Republic, Peter Pavel, who committed further aid to Ukraine's war-torn regions.
    

Ukrainian officials reported multiple regions came under Russian attack overnight — including the Black Sea port city of Odesa. 

Three people were injured and a residential high-rise building and shopping centre were damaged as Russian drones pummelled the city. Regional governor Oleh Kiper said the attack caused emergency power outages.

"This is another reminder to the whole world: the war continues and Ukraine continues to fight," the head of the Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, said in a statement.

He said blazes erupted at at least three locations after the attack late Thursday. "Civilian infrastructure, commercial facilities are on fire, cars damaged," Kiper detailed.

Over 70 people and 20 fire engines were involved in extinguishing what the emergency services called "massive fires."

The attack came shortly before Czech Republic's President Petr Pavel visited the region to hold meetings with the city's leaders and officials from nearby regions.

Deputy Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine Oleksiy Kuleba wrote on Telegram that "the Russian Federation launched three groups of Shaheds into the city" during his meeting with Pavel.

A separate Russian attack near the city of Zaporizhzhia injured six people, including a 4-year-old boy, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. 

It added that the attack caused a large fire, affecting several cars and residential buildings. Three houses were destroyed and several others damaged.

Three drone attacks also struck Sumy, in northeastern Ukraine, causing fires to erupt but without reports of injuries. 

In total, the Ukrainian air force said that Russia fired 214 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks. It said 114 of them were intercepted and another 81 were jammed.

Separately on Friday, Russia accused Ukraine of attacking a gas metering station in Russia's Kursk region — an allegation that Kyiv denied.

The facility lies in Sudzha, a part of Kursk that Russia claimed to have retaken from Ukrainian troops last week. 

Ukraine confirmed its retreat from the Sudzha area, but refuted claims made by US President Donald Trump as well as his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Ukrainian troops were encircled by Russian forces in the region.

Moscow accused Ukraine of deliberately attacking the Sudzha gas metering station in an "act of terrorism."

In a post on Facebook, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine the "station was repeatedly shelled by the Russians themselves," calling the attack a "provocation" from Moscow as part of a "discrediting campaign against Ukraine."

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after US President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remained to be seen what possible targets would be off limits to attack.

After a roughly hourlong call with Trump on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that “technical” talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected from attack under the agreement.

The three sides appeared to hold starkly different views about what the deal covered. While the White House said "energy and infrastructure" would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to "energy infrastructure."

Zelenskyy said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the agreement reached between Trump and Putin referred only to energy facilities, adding that the Russian military is fulfilling Putin's order to halt such attacks for 30 days.

"The Russian military are currently refraining from strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in accordance with the agreement reached between Russia and the United States," Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.

Russian drones pummeled the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, injuring three people and sparking massive fires, officials said Friday, an attack that underlined Moscow's intention to pursue aerial strikes even as it agreed to temporarily halt strikes on energy facilities.

The head of the Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, said the city suffered “local emergency power outages” in three of its districts, an indication that the energy infrastructure of the city could have been damaged.

Reacting to the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that "joint pressure on Russia, strengthening sanctions and defense support for our state ... is the way to stop such terror and Russia's prolongation of the war."

“We expect real pressure on Russia from the US, Europe and all our partners,” Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram “And this is what will allow diplomacy to work.”

Russia, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of blowing up a gas facility in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have launched an incursion, in violation of the ceasefire deal. Ukraine denies the accusations.

The strike came shortly before Czech Republic President Peter Pavel visited Odesa early Friday morning and held meetings with the city's leaders and officials from other southern regions.

“This is another reminder to the whole world: the war continues and Ukraine continues to fight,” Kiper said in a statement.

He reported blazes at at least three locations after the attack late Thursday. “Civilian infrastructure, commercial facilities are on fire, cars damaged,” Kiper said.

Over 70 people and 20 fire engines were involved in extinguishing what the emergency services called “massive fires.”

Russia's Defense Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of blowing up a gas metering station near the town of Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region, in what it described as a “deliberate provocation by the Kyiv regime, which is part of a series of recent strikes on Russia's energy infrastructure in order to discredit the U.S. president's peaceful initiatives.”

Ukraine's military General Staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the Sudzha gas metering station as part of Russia's “discrediting campaign.”

The gas metering station serves a major pipeline that had pumped Russia's natural gas to Europe until supplies were halted last year.

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remained to be seen what possible targets would be off limits to attack.

The three sides appeared to hold starkly different views about what the deal covered. While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Zelenskyy said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.

Zelenskyy told reporters after Wednesday's call with Trump that “technical” talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected from attack under the agreement.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized Friday that the agreement reached between Trump and Putin referred only to energy facilities, adding that the Russian military is fulfilling Putin's order to halt such attacks for 30 days.

“The Russian military is currently refraining from strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in accordance with the agreement reached between Russia and the United States,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.

In another attack, Russian glide bombs injured at least six people, including a child, in the Zaporizhzhia region overnight Thursday to Friday. Regional head Ivan Fedorov published photos showing firefighters extinguishing flames at multiple damaged residential buildings.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia fired 214 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks. It said 114 of them were intercepted and another 81 were jammed.

Russia's Defense Ministry said air defenses shot down 43 Ukrainian drones, 34 of them over the Volgograd region and others over Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions. The authorities didn't report any casualties or significant damage.

Meanwhile, a massive blaze at an oil depot in the Krasnodar region has continued to rage since it was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack late Wednesday.

Loughborough University, in partnership with Mission 89 and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK Branch of the British Parliament, has released the first-ever comprehensive global thematic report on sport trafficking.

The report presents a rigorous academic and policy-oriented analysis of human trafficking in the global sports ecosystem. It details a comprehensive literature review, interdisciplinary expert consultations, forensic analysis of documented trafficking incidents, comparative international policy assessment, and contributions from global experts. 

While highlighting the economic benefits of the sports industry, which is estimated to be between $471 billion and $1.4 trillion annually, the report sheds light on how this lucrative industry has become a magnet for traffickers exploiting vulnerable individuals, particularly young athletes from the Global South.

According to industry stakeholders, the absence of a specific definition for ‘sport trafficking' has presented significant challenges in distinguishing the phenomenon from migrant smuggling, irregular migration, and other forms of human trafficking, thereby preventing targeted Interventions. The report delivers a precise definition of sport trafficking, referred to as a process of recruiting and exploiting individuals within the sporting domain. 

 This is characterised by coercive mechanisms that compromise individuals and fundamental human rights. It not only involves the direct exploitation of athletes but also extends to the many ways the industry can serve as a conduit for labour and sexual exploitation, especially during mega sporting events which attract increased demand for informal labour and entertainment services. 

The report also identifies a range of different areas for improvement in efforts to combat sport trafficking and more effectively protect vulnerable athletes and aspiring athletes. Recommendations are revealed in the study for policymakers, law enforcement, prosecutors, the judiciary, service providers, and sport organisations.

Dr Serhat Yilmaz, the lead researcher behind the report and Senior Lecturer at Loughborough University, underlines the importance of the definition of sport trafficking provided within the report. 

“Without a precise, sport-specific definition of trafficking, we are dealing with inadequate legal protections, ineffective policy development, challenges in identifying and supporting victims, limited prevention strategies and blurred legal distinctions that allow perpetrators to escape accountability. Therefore, our objective behind this work  is to bring sport trafficking out of the shadows and into focused, actionable legal and social frameworks”, he explained.

The report also presents a typology of sport trafficking supported by case studies that are identified and developed through the research. This typology of sport trafficking, as another novel aspect of the document, provides an overview of the different types of trafficking evident in, through, and around sports involving different actors and forms of exploitative purpose. In each case, the existence of the type of trafficking is determined by the presence of the necessary constituent elements of the trafficking crime as per the definition of the UN TIP Protocol, also known as Palermo Protocol.

"Our research constitutes not merely a scholarly contribution; it represents a crucial advancement in comprehending and addressing vulnerabilities related to trafficking across many continents. By aligning our efforts with the United Nations SDG 8.7 and 16.2, we can foster a safer environment for every athlete, with particular emphasis on the issue of sports trafficking," stated Lerina Bright, Executive Director of Mission 89, the foremost independent non-governmental organisation committed to fighting the exploitation of young athletes through its 3 pillars of research, education and advocacy.

“With a clear and specialised definition, we can provide clearer legal frameworks, guide more effective policymaking, improve victim support mechanisms, enable more targeted educational efforts and help the judiciary better recognize and address these specific trafficking cases.”

The palace appeared to be partly in ruins, with soldiers' steps crunching broken tiles underneath their boots.

Sudan's military has said it has retaken the Republican Palace in the country's capital Khartoum after nearly two years of fighting.

The current conflict in Sudan erupted in April 2023 when a power struggle between the leaders of the military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) boiled over into open fighting in Khartoum and other cities.

Social media videos showed the military's soldiers inside on the 21st day of Ramadan, the holy Muslim fasting month.

A Sudanese military officer wearing a captain's epaulettes made the announcement in a video and confirmed the troops were inside the compound.

Soldiers carrying assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers chanted: "God is the greatest!"

Sudan's information minister said the military had retaken the palace in a post on X.

"Today the flag is raised, the palace is back and the journey continues until victory is complete," he wrote.

Its recapture by the military marks another gain for Sudan's military which has made steady advances in recent months.

The rival RSF has been mostly expelled from the capital of Khartoum after Sudan's war began in April 2023.

Africa correspondent

Sudan's military operations have pointed towards a specific target for several weeks: reclaim the Republican Palace from their entrenched enemy the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after close to two years of war.

After two days of intense battles in and around the palace complex, victory over the symbolic site has been declared by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) with soldiers sharing videos and photos from inside the palace.

"People will say it is photoshop but this is the Republican Palace. Inside the palace! Inside the palace!" yells an SAF Captain in a video filmed inside the building.

The Republican Palace is the country's seat of power and the official residence of its president.


Though the iconic building on the bank of the Blue Nile River decorates banknotes, it is rarely home to the military rulers who prefer to live in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) headquarters to the southeast of the palace complex.

The palace was unveiled in 2015 as a gift to former military dictator Omar Al-Bashir by China.

It stands behind the colonial governor-general's residence where decorated British General Charles Gordon was killed by Sudanese fighters 140 years ago.

The symbolism of the old palace and the political significance of the Chinese rebuild often draws history to its steps.

Gunfire was heard in the capital overnight on Friday, although whether this was from fighting or celebrations is unclear.

The RSF hasn't acknowledged the loss of the presidential palace but the group still holds territory elsewhere in Sudan so fighting is likely to continue.

The war has killed more than 28,000 people, according to UN figures, and forced millions to flee their homes.

By Alexey Dospekhov, Kommersant's special correspondent 

The power of sport to bring bitter enemies together is often debated, but history offers compelling examples. When Vladimir Putin, an avid hockey fan, suggested to Donald Trump (who in February was notable for his fierce support of his national team at the Four Nations Tournament) that Russia and the US organize a series of friendly matches between NHL and KHL players, the two leaders were likely drawing on past instances of sports diplomacy. 

The idea may seem ambitious given the current geopolitical climate, but history has shown that sport can open doors where traditional diplomacy fails. Two key examples from a similarly tense era—the 1970s—stand out.

In the early 1970s, relations between the US and China were virtually nonexistent. The two nations were ideological adversaries with no diplomatic ties, and any contact between their citizens was unthinkable. Yet, a single, accidental interaction on a bus in Nagoya, Japan, changed everything.

At the 1971 World Table Tennis Championships, American player Glenn Cowan missed his team's bus and, by chance, boarded a Chinese team bus instead. The athletes had been strictly instructed not to engage with Americans—not even to make eye contact. But one of them, the renowned Zhuang Zedong, broke protocol, handing Cowan an embroidered silk picture of the Huangshan Mountains.

The moment was captured by photographers and quickly made headlines. Cowan, now an unwitting ambassador, expressed a desire to visit China—a place completely off-limits to Americans at the time. Zhuang Zedong, meanwhile, returned home with a simple but profound message: Americans were not the enemy. 

The result? Shortly after, American and Chinese table tennis teams exchanged visits, breaking a decades-long silence between the two nations. Just a year later, in 1972, President Richard Nixon became the first U.S. leader to visit China, meeting with Mao Zedong in what became one of the most significant diplomatic breakthroughs of the Cold War. The episode became known as ping-pong diplomacy, a symbol of how sport can dissolve even the most entrenched hostilities.

While Glenn Cowan was boarding the wrong bus, another unprecedented sporting event was taking shape: a hockey showdown between the USSR and Canada.

At the time, the two nations had never faced each other with their true best teams. Canada's NHL stars, who dominated world hockey, looked down on the Soviet players, dismissing them as mere amateurs who racked up international titles against weaker competition. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union, boasting its own hockey legends—Valery Kharlamov, Alexander Yakushev, Vladislav Tretiak—was eager to prove itself against the so-called elite of the sport.

The 1972 Summit Series was far more than just a game. It was a Cold War battleground on ice, a contest between two rival superpowers, each determined to assert its supremacy. Divided into two halves—four games in Canada, four in Moscow—the series was expected to be a lopsided victory for the Canadians.

It wasn't. The Soviets stunned their opponents with a shocking win in Game 1, leaving Canadian fans and players in disbelief. The battle intensified as the series progressed, culminating in a nail-biting finale, where Paul Henderson's last-minute goal secured victory for Canada.

But beyond the scoreline, something remarkable happened: respect. Canadian players, initially dismissive of their Soviet counterparts, left in awe of their skill and discipline. The Soviet audience, after witnessing the brilliance of NHL stars like Phil Esposito and Henderson, found themselves cheering for individual Canadian players despite their Cold War rivalries. The message was clear—these athletes were not enemies but peers, each pushing the other to new heights. 

In the years that followed, Soviet and Canadian teams continued to compete, laying the foundation for decades of cross-cultural exchange in hockey. The geopolitical tension remained, but the sport had built a bridge where governments had struggled.

Fast forward to today, and hockey diplomacy may not have the same novelty it did in the 1970s. The NHL has long accepted Russian stars, with players like Alexander Ovechkin becoming household names in North America. Ovechkin, a close friend of Putin, is celebrated in the US as he chases Wayne Gretzky's all-time goal-scoring record. His presence in Washington has made him a familiar figure, welcomed even at the White House.

Unlike the past, where Soviet and Western players were virtual strangers, today's NHL and KHL stars already share locker rooms, friendships, and rivalries. But in an era where political tensions between Russia and the US have once again escalated, a series of friendly matches could serve as a much-needed reminder of common ground.

Whether Putin and Trump's idea materializes remains to be seen. But if history has taught us anything, it's that a simple game can sometimes change the course of world politics.

Sudan's army announces its fighters have entered the presidential palace in the centre of Khartoum

In recent weeks the army has stepped up its campaign against the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the city, which it lost at the start of the war in 2023

Reclaiming Khartoum would be a huge victory for the army and a pivotal moment in the conflict

But the RSF says it is fighting back and claims to have launched an attack on the palace

The RSF also still controls large parts of the country – including much of the west

The two-year civil war has caused the world's largest humanitarian crisis, according to the UN

New to this story? Here's a summary of the background

Sudanese troops film themselves in presidential palace

We're now pausing our live coverage of events in the Sudanese capital. But you can read an account of what happened on Friday here.

We'll also be publishing more analysis of what's been taking place on the BBC News website.

Extraordinary scenes of jubilant soldiers waving flags at Khartoum's presidential palace have suggested this could be a turning point in Sudan's bitter two-year civil war. But RSF militia are fighting back and the future remains unpredictable.

Here is a reminder of why this matters and where this could all lead:

Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as "Hemedti", shakes hands with Kenya's President William Ruto

To much fanfare last month, RSF leaders and their allies announced plans to form a parallel government to rule Sudan.

The fact they held their summit in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and were welcomed with open arms by President William Ruto outraged Sudanese officials, who retaliated by halting imports on all Kenyan goods including tea.

No rival government yet exists as such - at present it is merely a charter outlining what that eventual government could look like.

But the timing was no accident.

The RSF suffered some of its most humiliating defeats in Khartoum in the weeks before the Nairobi announcement, and multiple peace talks have failed in recent months.

Beyond the capital, the army had also won near total control of the crucial state of Gezira.

In other words the momentum has shifted, however temporarily, in favour of the army.

As news comes of the army latest success in clawing back the presidential palace, the RSF has been quick to say it's fighting back and claims to have launched a counter-attack.

The war has left many people in desperate need of assistance

A UN official has said it is too "early" to tell if this latest development will make it easier for aid agencies to get access to people who need the most help, in what has been described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

The conflict has prevented a lot of help from getting through.

"We are watching the evolution of the situation and we hope the outcome will be positive for the people," said UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Sala. 

Aid agencies have struggled to provide the food and basic necessities that many need they need throughout this war. 

"We have been in this conflict for two years, and it's been unpredictable in nature," Ms Nkweta-Sala told the BBC's World At One radio programme.

She called for the opposing sides to respect international humanitarian law. 

A photographer for the AFP news agency, Ebrahim Hamid, was taking pictures on Thursday in Omdurman, which is just over the Nile form Khartoum.

He was capturing some of the destruction that has been caused over the past months of fighting. 

A hospital director showed the photographer the damage wrought by bullets and shelling on her institution:

And Hamid saw how buildings have been reduced to rubble: 

Many people fled Khartoum and Omdurman when the fighting broke out nearly two years' ago. At some point they may return to find much of what they knew has gone.

Alarabiya television has broadcast pictures from inside the presidential palace, showing more images of celebrating soldiers.

It is not clear if these were taken before or after an RSF drone strike, which the paramilitary force said claimed dozens of lives. 

As conflicts rage from Gaza to Ukraine, the devastating human cost of Sudan's war is being overlooked, aid agencies warn. Here are some key facts:



More images have been coming through from earlier today of troops celebrating at the presidential palace. The soldiers have been sharing them on social media:

In the lead up to the assault on the palace, the BBC has access to the soldiers preparing for the battle:

Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Port Sudan

Army spokesman Lt Col Hassan Ibrahim, pictured here last week, is one of those who have died

A military spokesman has been killed in an RSF drone attack on the presidential palace, the army says.

Lt Col Hassan Ibrahim was killed alongside Capt Emad Eldein Hassan, a junior colleague, the army told the BBC. Capt Hassan was once of the military's well-known social media influencers.

Three crew members of Sudan TV were also killed while reporting about the soldiers' advance to the palace. They were a programme editor, a cameraman and a driver. 

The drone attack targeted army troops celebrating inside the Republican Palace, hours after the military recaptured the symbolic building from the RSF.

The RSF spokesperson has said the battle for the palace is far from over.  

"Our valiant forces are still present in the vicinity of the area," reads the statement that was issued on Telegram. 

The paramilitary force says it has carried out a "lightning military operation" inside the palace , killing at least 89 "enemy elements". 

The RSF also says they destroyed various military vehicles and asserts that they will "continue to fight".

Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Port Sudan

This is one of the most significant advances the Sudanese Armed Forces have made in the civil war so far. 

It is a symbolic victory, allowing them to reclaim the seat of power in central Khartoum, symbolised by the presidential complex. 

It is also a strategic victory. 

After clearing outer districts of Greater Khartoum, the army has now retaken key locations in the city centre, pushing the RSF fighters further away from sites like government buildings and the military's headquarters. 

This means the RSF has in effect lost its control of the capital, even though its fighters are still present in the city. 

It is not clear though how far the frontline has moved. 

This has changed the direction and dynamics of the war. 

Bloody fighting is expected to continue as the army tries to corner remaining fighters, who still occupy swathes of territory to the south of the palace. 

They also control parts of the nearby airport.

People in the capital are still reeling from what they faced under the RSF soldiers.

But, residents feel relieved and safe now that the territory has been taken back by the army. 

With some saying they would finally be able to sleep at night. 

Millions have been forced from their homes during the civil war and parts of the country are facing famine conditions

Sudan, a predominantly Muslim nation in north-east Africa, collapsed
into civil war nearly two years ago when the military and a paramilitary group
known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fell out.

The
two had been allies, coming to power in a coup six months earlier, but disagreed
over an internationally backed plan to move
towards civilian rule.

The crux of their disagreement was to do with the integration
of the paramilitary group into the army, which is when RSF fighters went on the
offensive capturing much of the capital - and going on to control much of the
western region of Darfur.

The RSF became a powerful player in Sudan under the leadership
of Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted as president in 2019. It had grown out of the "Janjaweed" militias linked to genocide in Darfur two decades ago.

The military's capture of the presidential palace may be significant,
but it is by no means the end of the brutal
power struggle that has brought so much suffering to the people of Sudan.

Both sides have been condemned
for war crimes, famine has been declared in several areas and more than 12
million people have been forced from their homes.

In an X post, external, Sudan's diplomats in Tokyo described the presidential palace as a "living symbol of Sudanese sovereignty and a source of national pride". 

The picture they shared (above) of an intact palace taken before the conflict began in 2023, contrasts sharply with the images of a ruined building that we're seeing from the soldiers' social media videos.

Peter MwaiBBC Verify

BBC Verify has checked video
and images appearing on social media showing Sudanese army forces around the presidential palace in Khartoum.

We've matched the features of
the buildings and grounds to images available on Google and visible on satellite
imagery and checked that these videos have not appeared before. They show
soldiers celebrating and announcing today's date. 

Celebratory gunfire can also
be heard. 

The footage also reveals
extensive damage to the outside of the palace, as well as destruction inside
one of the buildings.

The RSF paramilitary force has launched a drone attack on the presidential palace killing at least three people, reports say.

The three are crew members of the state-owned Sudan TV,  pan-Arab channels Saud Al Arabiya TV and its sister station Al Hadath reported.  

Sudan TV is yet to comment on the attack which happened a few hours after the army recaptured the palace from the RSF.

It is not clear if the army officers, who have been celebrating inside the palace, were caught up in  the drone attack.  

Many in Khartoum have been surviving on what charitable food kitchens can offer them

A Sudanese activist has told the BBC's Newsday programme that the army's recapture of the presidential palace is a "very important" and "emotional" moment for many people on the ground in the capital, Khartoum. 

"Everybody was waiting for the military to take over the palace," said Duaa Tariq. 

She said no food or basic necessities had been coming in or out of Khartoum for about four months while the opposing sides were fighting. 

And although there is excitement, there is still an underlying fear. 

"We are not sure what will happen next. We are just going to have to sit and wait," she said.

RSF still controls parts of the capital (file photo)

The army says it is pursuing fleeing RSF soldiers in parts of central Khartoum and also preparing to enter Tuti island in Khartoum. 

The island, which is located where the White Nile and Blue Nile rivers merge, is still under RSF control.

An army official told pan-Arab news channel Al Hadath that the RSF had a "limited period to surrender".

The RSF did not immediately comment on the retaking of the palace and the army's advances in Khartoum.

Elsewhere in Sudan, the paramilitary group said late on Thursday that it had seized a key base from the army in North Darfur, a region in the west of the country.

Some Sudanese have welcomed the recapturing of the palace by the army. 

Mohamed Ibrahim, a 55-year-old Khartoum resident, told the Reuters news agency that the "liberation of the palace is the best news I have heard since the start of the war". 

"It means the start of the army controlling the rest of Khartoum.

"We want to be safe again and live without fear or hunger," he added.

The two-year civil war has caused the world's largest humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. 

The taking of the presidential palace and - if it happens - the recapture of the entire capital by the army would be a significant moment, but it is not the end of the two-year conflict.

The RSF paramilitary force still controls large parts of the country, including much of the western Darfur region which has seen some of the deadliest violence over the past two years.

Many posts on social media are showing jubilant soldiers waving their guns in the air, cheering and kneeling to pray at the entrance to the presidential palace.

Here are some stills from footage that's been recorded:

Greece Extends by a Year Visas for Turkish Nationals to Visit Islands

Reuters

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece has extended by a year a visa scheme for Turkish nationals wishing to visit 12 islands in the Aegean Sea for up to a week, diplomatic sources said, continuing a programme that represented a slight thaw in often fractious ties between the neighbours.

The agreement for automatic visas allowing Turks and their families to visit some Greeks islands without having to apply for full access to the European Union's passport-free travel zone was signed in December 2023, when Greece and Turkey agreed to turn a page after years of tensions and drafted a roadmap to usher in a new era of closer ties.

Greece and Turkey, both NATO members but historic foes, have been at odds for decades over jurisdiction in their maritime zones in the Aegean Sea, airspace and the ethnically divided Cyprus.

Following an approval by the European Commission, the tourist visa scheme will be extended to April 2026, the sources said late on Thursday, adding that an original list of 10 islands would be expanded to include the islands of Patmos and Samothrace.

The Commission had welcomed the successful implementation of the scheme over the past year and recognised its positive contribution to promoting connections between the two peoples, the sources said.

Since the scheme was launched in March 2024, more than 100,000 visit visas have been issued for Turkish nationals for the islands of Rhodes, Kos, Samos, Lesbos, Chios, Leros, Symi, Lemnos, Kalymnos and Kastelorizo.

Athens and Ankara last year agreed to explore possible talks aimed at demarcating their maritime zones. A high-level cooperation council that the countries set up in 2010 to help address their long-standing differences is expected to meet later this year.

French Film Star Depardieu Faces Trial Over Sexual Assault Allegations

By Juliette Jabkhiro

PARIS (Reuters) - French actor Gerard Depardieu faces trial on Monday over alleged sexual assaults of two women on a film set, a case placing one of the world's best known movie stars at the heart of France's broader reckoning over sexual violence.

A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this would be the first case for which he would be standing trial.

Depardieu's lawyer, Jeremie Assous, said the case was based on "false accusations" against his client, adding that the movie star was expected to attend the two-day trial after an initial hearing was postponed due to his ill health.

Prosecutors say the assaults took place during the filming in 2021 of "Les Volets Verts" (The Green Shutters).

They accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women on the film set, pulling her towards him and trapping her with his legs before touching her waist, hips and breasts while saying obscene words. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say.

They say the second woman was groped by Depardieu on set and in the street.

The women's identities have not been revealed.

MORE:  

The alleged assaults occurred while Depardieu was under formal investigation over accusations of raping a young actress in 2018. A trial has been requested by prosecutors in the case.

A lawyer for one of the women told Reuters her client was scared to come forward against Depardieu.

'CINEMA GIANT'

"There's a fear, because he's a cinema giant," said Carine Durrieu-Diebolt. "It's a struggle between David and Goliath and they are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu."

The lawyer for the second plaintiff did not reply to Reuters requests for comment.

Depardieu's trial could be the highest-profile #MeToo case to come before the courts in France, a country where the protest movement over sexual violence has struggled to gain the same traction as in the United States.

Recently, however, there have been signs this might change.

Gisele Pelicot became a global feminist icon last year after she waived her rights to anonymity during the trial of her former husband, who was convicted of drugging her and inviting dozens of men over to their home to sexually abuse her.

Then, last month, a French court found film director Christophe Ruggia guilty of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was underage.

French director and actress Judith Godreche, who like Haenel has become a major voice in France's #MeToo movement, said these trials showed some progress.

"One of the great things that is happening is that women who are talking against very powerful men are mostly not considered crazy anymore," she told Reuters over the phone.

However, Godreche said it is still uncommon for men to speak up in the French cinema industry.

Last week, a parliamentary inquiry commission questioned several prominent actors, directors and producers on the topic of sexual violence in cinema. Most of the men, including famous actor Jean Dujardin, requested the hearings be held behind closed doors. (This story has been corrected to say French stars requested hearings be held behind closed doors, not anonymously, in paragraph 19)

“The Daily Show” host Jordan Klepper didn't hold back Thursday as he clowned President Donald Trump's administration for not being able to do a “classic DEI purge right.”

Klepper turned to an “ABC World News Tonight” report on the Pentagon's removal and swift restoration of a story on baseball icon Jackie Robinson's U.S. Army service. The move was part of the Trump administration's push to get rid of “diversity, equity and inclusion” in the federal government.

A senior U.S. military official told ABC News' Rachel Scott that the Pentagon uses digital software to scrub “DEI” content from its websites and the stories on the player that broke Major League Baseball's color barrier were “removed by mistake.”

Klepper didn't waste time mocking the Defense Department's explanation: “Oh, don't blame us. Blame our racist software. We should have never used ChatKKK. Classic mistake.”

He added that it wasn't the “most embarrassing anti-DEI flub,” however, before playing a clip noting photos the Pentagon flagged for removal because their file featured the word “gay,” which was reportedly the case with a snap of the Enola Gay aircraft — which dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II.

“That's how lazy they were with this, they just control f'd for gay-sounding keywords and deleted anything that showed up,” Klepper quipped.

“Now kids won't know about the Enola Gay, they won't know about transport planes, and they'll never hear about the heroic service of Captain Grindr McScissoring. Tragic. What's extra tragic is this could have all been avoided if they had just named the plane Enola Gay No Homo, you know?”

The massive brush fire that has been burning in southern Miami-Dade County this week has now grown bigger than the Palisades Fire of California that captured national headlines earlier this year.

The Palisades Fire, which first ignited on Jan. 7 in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, burned 23,707 acres before it was fully contained on Jan. 31, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The wildfire sparked national news as a "life-threatening" Santa Ana windstorm produced 100 mph gusts throughout Southern California that hampered firefighting efforts for weeks, causing insurmountable damage and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes.

But the Miami-Dade fire, which ignited just days ago, has now grown to 26,437 acres at 30% containment, according to Friday morning data from the Florida Forest Service, making it nearly 300 acres larger than the Southern California wildfire.

Miami-Dade Fire Rescue crews, alongside state and local agencies, have been attacking the fire from both the ground and the air, using helicopters to drop on the blaze.

Meanwhile, the flames have forced the closure of Card Sound Road, one of only two roadways to the Florida Keys. The other road U.S. 1's 18-Mile Stretch, has been sporadically shutting down and reopening over the last few days, and could face intermittent shutdowns in the coming days due to heavy smoke and firefighting operations.

At this time, there haven't been any reports of major damage to homes or businesses nearby, but the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said that Comcast has had patchy service due to the fires affecting some of their infrastructure. There also have not been any major evacuation orders issued, though a juvenile residential facility in the area was evacuated due to the conditions the fire presented.

Authorities are advising people to stay indoors if they smell smoke, keep doors and windows closed and set air conditioning units to recirculate.

Vulnerable groups, including young children, the elderly and those with respiratory issues, should take extra precautions.

Drivers in the affected regions are advised to keep vehicle windows rolled up and use air conditioning in recirculation mode to limit exposure to smoke, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue said.

Though the southern Miami-Dade fire is big and growing, it is not the largest wildfire in Florida history. That record belongs to the Florida wildfires of 1998.

Also known as the "1998 Florida Firestorm," the massive blaze —   like the Palisades and other Southern California fires of January —   was a series of wildfires that swept across the state during the summer of 1998. It involved thousands of separate woodland and mixed-urban rural wildfires that burned over 500,000 acres, destroying over 300 homes and costing $300 million of lost timber value.

In the aftermath of the 1998 wildfires, Florida lawmakers initiated stricter fire prevention regulations and emergency management protocols following the fires.

President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing will be awarded a contract to build the next generation of U.S. fighter jets. 

"The F-47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built," President Trump said. "An experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost five years, and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation."

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth joined Trump in the Oval Office for the announcement, describing the program as the Next Generation Air Dominance initiative.

Hegseth said the program signals to allies that the U.S. remains firmly committed to global security — and warns adversaries of America's unmatched ability to project power.

President Trump would not reveal a lot of details about the F-47, citing national security. However, a rendering shows a flat aircraft with a pointed nose. 

"This plane flies with drones, flies with many, many drones, as many as you want," President Trump said. "It is a technology that's new but it doesn't by itself. It flies with many drones — something no other plane can do."

The Associated Press reports that the initial contract with Boeing is worth an estimated $20 billion.

Constitutional law attorney Katie Cherkasky joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss President Donald Trump's DOJ moving to drop charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams and the Democrats praising the courts for pushing back against his agenda.

The Justice Department said Friday it is considering invoking the state secrets privilege in its ongoing court battle over the Trump administration's deportation flights to El Salvador, a tool that could allow them to withhold certain information for national security purposes.

In a declaration filed Friday morning, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg that he is aware of the Cabinet-level discussions invoking state secrets privilege. 

Invoking that privilege "is a serious matter that requires careful consideration of national security and foreign relations, and it cannot properly be taken in just 24 hours," Blanche said. 

The declaration came after Boasberg had issued a Thursday deadline for the court to file information about deportation flights that sent Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador over the weekend, around the same time he issued an emergency court order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from doing so. 

'WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT': US JUDGE REAMS TRUMP ADMIN FOR DAYS-LATE DEPORTATION INFO

Boasberg said in a blistering order Thursday evening that the Trump administration both failed to comply with the noon deadline for information – even after he gave the administration the option to file the information under seal – and noted that the court was instead sent only a six-paragraph declaration from a regional ICE officer in Texas, who said that the Trump administration is considering invoking the "state secrets privilege" in the case. 

Boasberg decried that declaration as "woefully insufficient," noting Thursday that regional ICE officers cannot be talked to inform the court of high-level Cabinet discussions and suggested someone higher up in the federal government should do so. 

Blanche's filing comes just hours before government attorneys are due in court Friday afternoon to testify before Boasberg in a hearing over their motion to vacate the case.

Boasberg noted in a blistering order Thursday that the government had "again evaded its obligations" in failing to submit materials he requested about the flights, even after he extended the deadline for them to do so and said they could file the materials under seal.

At issue is whether the government failed to comply with his emergency restraining order Saturday, which blocked the Trump administration from using a 1798 wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the gang Tren de Aragua, for a period of 14 days. Boasberg also ordered any flights in the air to return to U.S. soil immediately.

Hours later, however, a plane carrying hundreds of U.S. migrants, including Venezuelan nationals removed under the law in question, arrived in El Salvador. 

In the days since, government lawyers have refused to share information in court about the deportation flights, and whether the plane (or planes) of migrants knowingly departed U.S. soil after the judge ordered them not to do so, citing national security protections. 

Boasberg previously asked government lawyers to submit information on how many planes departed the U.S. on Saturday carrying people deported "solely on the basis" of that proclamation, how many individuals were on each plane, where the planes landed, what time each plane took off from the U.S. and from where.

He previously warned the Trump administration of consequences this week if it were to violate his order. The Trump administration, for its part, is challenging his order in appellate court Monday.

Still, at least one plane with deported migrants touched down later that evening in El Salvador. "Oopsie, too late," Salvador President Nayib Bukele said in a post on X.

“I don't really think they should be our 51st state. There. I said it,” commented Rogan during a recent episode of his show

One of America's leading podcasters, Joe Rogan, is clearly an advocate for peaceful U.S. coexistence with Canada.

While he has been cited as influential in getting Donald Trump re-elected as president of the United States again, he has made it clear that America needs to back off on increasing international tension with Canada.

“Why are we upset at Canada? This is stupid, this over tariffs,” Rogan said during the March 14 episode of his popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, while conversing with comedian Michael Kosta.

As the two men watch a clip from the Canada-U.S. final in the Four Nations Cup, Rogan continues: “100 per cent. (Canadians) booed us over tariffs.”

Kosta responds by relating a story of doing a stand up gig in Edmonton during the 2010 Olympic hockey gold medal game when Canada beat the U.S. He says a fan sent him a chart about Canada's water usage during the game. “It was like the whole f**king country went to the bathroom at the same time.”

Rogan laughed and then continued with his pro-Canadian sentiment.

“We gotta become friends with Canada again …This is so ridiculous. I can't believe there's anti-American, anti-Canadian sentiment going on. It's the dumbest.”

Kosta queried Rogan on whether there actually is anti-Canadian sentiment and Rogan responds in a voice mocking Americans critical of Canada: “Yeah, there's lots of idiots that, ‘Now they're our f**king enemy. Why are we subsidizing Canada? Well, how come they don't have their own military?'”

Rogan suggests, incorrectly, that Canada doesn't have an armed forces, but he is prepared to let that go: “Let's just deal with it, as it is.”

Both men were aware that Canada is about to launch into an election, though they admit to not understanding our electoral system.

Still, says Rogan, “I just want America and Canada to get along. I think (this) is ridiculous.”

He expressed pointed disagreement with Trump. “I don't really think they should be our 51st state. There. I said it.”

Instead, Rogan muses about Greenland becoming the 51st state. “It's more accessible. We could probably buy that … Plus if global warming is real because of all the digging and oil … it would be good to have a cold spot.”

The North American rift began back in December when Trump started referring to Canada as the 51st state of the United States. Then, fuelling the controversy further, Trump has initiated a tariff war on Canadian goods such as lumber, aluminum and steel.

The controversy boiled over into the sports world, where the U.S. national anthem has been booed heavily during sporting events in Canada. The national anthem for both countries is played before all NBA and NHL games played in Canada. Videos of the U.S. national anthem being booed before tipoff or puck drop have gone viral.

Aside from his Monday-Friday podcast, which reaches 14.5 million listeners on Spotify, Rogan is active in professional sports, particularly mixed martial arts, as an analyst and commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship franchise.

Obviously, many visitors to Yellowstone National Park gape in awe at the roaming bison or the colour of the Grand Prismatic Spring, but few know that the park is standing over a giant supervolcano. 

Volcanoes are known to have existed or may exist in regions where colossal volcanic eruptions, with at least 1,000 cubic kilometres of volcanic material being ejected, occurred. The Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field covers most of Yellowstone National Park and extends across parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

“While driving south from Mammoth Hot Springs towards Norris Geyser Basin early on Aug. 5 last summer, a park scientist noticed a billowing steam column through the trees and across a marshy expanse,” Yellowstone National Park geologists Jefferson Hungerford and Kiernan Folz-Donahue shared in a blog post.

While the last known lava flow in the area occurred over 70,000 years ago, Yellowstone remains one of the most geothermally active places on Earth. It is home to more than 10,000 hydrothermal features, including geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles.

“This hydrothermal activity persists through this day but is much less energetic than when it first formed,” Hungerford and Folz-Donahue noted.

However, on March 17, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) revealed that its geologists had identified a newly formed volcanic vent during the summer of 2024. 

This vent, which continuously emits steam, was found at the base of a lava flow. Scientists recorded its temperature as scorching 171 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius), and the vent has remained active for several months.

Upon closer examination, a team of geologists confirmed that this was indeed new. There is also speculation that it may be linked to previous geothermal activity detected in the same region in March 2003.

“One could run a line along the axis of the older active area and it would intersect the new feature. This line also follows the trend of faults that run from Norris Geyser Basin northward to Mammoth Hot Springs and beyond,” Hungerford and Folz-Donahue concluded.

Trowbridge's ‘cheese grater' benches have caused another stir in the town centre, after they were branded by mysterious and divisive stickers.

The new seats are part of the £16.3 million Future High Street Fund and have been installed along Castle Street and other parts of the town centre, sparking public debate and confusion among residents.

The street furniture, the benches in particular, has been hit with criticism and inspired bemused reactions, with some online likening the backless benches to ‘cheese graters'.

Public debate about the new street furniture launched them to the national media, and social media users frequently post photos of the benches with twists that show their creative side.

Now, photos of the benches in the town centre show a number of them have been branded with yellow, blue, and white stickers featuring a cheese grater, and the term ‘Trowvegas' emblazoned over the top of the graphic.

‘Cheese grater' and the mysterious term ‘Mexican Handbags' are also posted underneath.

The user commented: “There is no need to put derogatory stickers on the new town benches. The pigeons are leaving their mark. Isn't it enough that Trowbridge made the national news for the wrong reasons? It's just graffiti that will cost to have removed. Get a life. You want to complain about the cost of the benches? How much to troll the benches?”

The post sparked a number of different reactions, with people both supporting and criticising the unhappy reaction.

One commentor seconded the original poster's irritation, writing: “I do find it sad someone spent money on these stickers. Clearly a lot of time on their hands and thought it was a cool idea. I personally very much dislike our town being called Trowvegas.”

Another user wrote: “It's weird how people can actively hate a bench. They are designed to be sat on and they achieve that. The holes prevent water build up and allow them to dry quicker my only flaw is the colour of them.”

By way of explanation behind the stickers, another response to the post read: “How is this derogatory? Mexican Handbag refers to a wordplay game invented by Johnny Vaughan on his radio show. The person is riffing off the game.

"Johnny Vaughan, a radio presenter, and his team on Radio X often challenge listeners to think of alternative meanings for unusual terms or phrases, which they've dubbed ‘Mexican Handbags'.”

Another user believed that it was all part of some light-hearted fun, writing: “I think they're just having a laugh. I don't think it's that deep, it's just nice having something to smile at and have a natter about!”

According to the council, the total cost of the benches was £55,510, which includes the backless seats branded as looking like ‘cheese graters' at £22,510.

It also includes other furniture, complete with backs and arms, and the bins also installed at a total of £33,000.

After claims about civil rights leader and World War veteran Medgar Evers' name being removed from the Arlington National Cemetery website surfaced, a spokesperson clarified that it was only ‘moved to a different section'. Now, social media influencers say that Colin Powell's name was purged from the list of notable Americans buried in the cemetery.

This comes as the Arlington National Cemetery has reportedly removed several web pages that celebrated Black and women veterans. The HuffPost reported that the purging follows President Donald Trump's executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the federal government.

Talking Point Memo reported that an army webpage from 2008 that lauded President Harry Truman's 1948 integration order has disappeared. It was available as recently as last year, web archives show.

Responding to the TPM report, a spokesperson said: “As Secretary Hegseth has said, DEI is dead at the Defense Department. Efforts to divide the force — to put one group ahead of another through DEI programs — erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution,”

“We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms. In the rare cases that content is removed that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct components accordingly.”

Users on Elon Musk-led X fact-checked claims. “No individuals have been removed from the listings of Notable Graves on the Arlington Cemetery website. Colin Powell is listed in the section ‘Prominent Military Figures',” a community note read.

Colin Powell was a Black American general and statesman. He served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1989–1993), overseeing the Gulf War, and as Secretary of State (2001–2005) during the start of the Iraq war. Known for the "Powell Doctrine" and breaking racial barriers, he died of COVID-19 complications in 2021.

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended Thursday 68 bridges across 19 states be evaluated with a "vulnerability assessment" to determine their risk of collapse if involved in a vessel collision in the wake of last year's deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. 

Over the last year, the NTSB identified 68 bridges built before 1991 that don't have a "current vulnerability assessment." The recommendations were issued to 30 owners of the 68 different bridges across the country, NTSB officials announced Thursday. 

Some of the bridges include the Golden Gate Bridge in California, the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City and the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida. 

In response to the recommendation from the NTSB, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District said Thursday that the Golden Gate Bridge is "in full compliance with all state and federal regulations" and that the district hired a consultant this year to "conduct an assessment of the South Tower fender system's structural capacity for ship collisions."

The NTSB noted that their recommendation does not suggest that the 68 bridges are certain to collapse, but rather those bridge owners evaluate whether the bridges are above the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' acceptable level of risk. 

The 68 bridges were divided into two categories, "critical/essential" and "typical." Those deemed critical/essential are those that serve as "important links." The Key Bridge had this classification. Those that are not deemed critical/essential fall under the typical designation. 

The recommendation comes as NTSB officials released new information in the Key Bridge collapse investigation Thursday. Nearly a year ago, on March 26, 2024, a large cargo ship lost electrical power and crashed into the Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, and knocking eight roadworkers, six of whom died, into the Patapsco River.

"Had the Key Bridge's owner, the Maryland Transportation Authority, or MDTA, conducted a vulnerability assessment based on recent vessel traffic as recommended by AASHTO, MDTA would have been aware that the Key Bridge was above the acceptable risk and would have had information to proactively reduce the bridge's risk of a collapse and loss of lives associated with a vessel collision with the bridge," NTSB said in a statement Thursday.

The NTSB found that the Key Bridge was almost 30 times greater than the acceptable risk threshold for critical or essential bridges.

NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the final report of the Baltimore incident will be released in the fall.

The Trump administration is stepping up its review of federal agencies' contracts with consulting companies, warning in a letter to the top 10 highest-paid consulting firms doing government work that they must submit scorecards justifying their contracts without using consulting “jargon or gobbledygook,” according to a letter obtained by NBC News.

The letter — sent by Josh Gruenbaum, who leads cost-cutting efforts at the GSA — requests new information on the companies' billions of dollars worth of government contracts, broken out by agency.

Each firm that received this letter must detail their pricing structure and look for cuts that can be made using “simple layman terms (a 15 year old should be able to understand what service you provide and why it is important)” Gruenbaum wrote.

The letter — which came with an attached scorecard template — pits the firms against each other, saying their responses will be compared against both the government-wide review and what is submitted by other consulting firms.

 The consulting companies have been asked to detail the kind of work they have been doing and disclose how much the companies were paid by government agencies between 2019 and 2024 — and must submit this information by March 31st. 

GSA has canceled 1,700 consulting contracts since Trump took office, according to internal data the agency provided to NBC News.

The U.S. denied allegations that a French scientist was turned away at the border over his political beliefs.

Philippe Baptiste, the French minister of higher education and research, said the unidentified researcher was denied entry to the U.S. earlier this month while traveling to a conference near Houston.

U.S. authorities found his phone “contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration's research policies,” Baptiste said in a statement.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said that was “not true.”

“The French researcher in question was in possession of confidential information on his electronic device from Los Alamos National Laboratory,” in violation of a nondisclosure agreement, she wrote on X last night, “something he admitted to taking without permission and attempted to conceal.”

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., are demanding information from the Defense Department about Elon Musk's meeting this morning at the Pentagon. 

"Did the Pentagon today provide Mr. Musk with a top-secret briefing today on U.S. war plans for China?" Warren and Duckworth asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a letter obtained exclusively by NBC News. 

They sought additional details about the briefing, including whether the Pentagon changed its original plans for the meeting after initial public reports came out about it. The two senators also asked what clearance processes were in place for Musk to receive the information that he did. 

"Mr. Musk arrived at the Pentagon earlier today. But it remains unclear exactly what information he received, and whether you or other Pentagon officials modified plans for him to receive top-secret information “on the U.S. military's plan for any war that might break out with China," they wrote in the letter, quoting an article by The New York Times, which was first to report on Musk's briefing. 

The Times reported last night that Musk was set to receive a briefing today on U.S. plans for any war with China. Three defense officials told NBC News that the briefing would include a discussion about China, but could not confirm it would delve into any war plans. Two of the officials said the briefing would be be unclassified. 

Trump and Hegseth both denied the reports, saying Musk came to the Pentagon to discuss his efforts to cut government costs under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency initiative. They said this morning that the meeting did not include information about any war plans for China.

The complaint filed by a bipartisan coalition alleging that a political group affiliated with Elon Musk violated state campaign finance laws as part of its spending efforts in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race will move forward.

Following a preliminary review, the Wisconsin Ethics Commission found that the complaint was “sufficient to proceed to consideration by the Commission,” according to an email from the commission obtained by NBC News.

According to Wisconsin statutes, that effectively means that the commission found the complaint to contain “sufficient allegations to establish that a violation” of certain Wisconsin campaign finance laws “has potentially occurred.”

The complaint was filed earlier this week by longtime Wisconsin Republican activist Tracy Mangold with the support of a Democratic strategist-led group that's focused on supporting the party's legal efforts around election protection. It alleged that Building America's Future violated campaign finance laws in failing to properly disclose various expenditures and disbursements related to the “Progress 2028” campaign.

In response to questions about the development, Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Building America's Future, referred to a post he wrote on X on Tuesday, calling the complaint “laughable” and that it was “unsurprising that Democrats are throwing a hissy fit” about the group “simply telling voters what Susan Crawford's positions are.”

“We're not the slightest bit concerned and don't plan on relenting,” Romeo wrote in the post.

The complaint is related to a series of digital ads put out by a group identifying itself as Progress 2028 that have tied Crawford, a liberal candidate in the technically nonpartisan race to a variety of liberal policy ideas. Some ads, for example, call Crawford a “progressive champion,” while others contend she will “stand up for immigrants” and give convicted criminals “second chances.”

The Associated Press and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel have reported that the ads, which appear largely on Facebook and other social media sites, were funded by Building America's Future, a Musk-aligned group. (Building America's Future isn't required to disclose its donations, but Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have reported that Musk helped fund it in the past.) The group is one of two associated with Musk — the other is Musk's America PAC — that have together spent millions to boost the conservative candidate in the race, Brad Schimel.

The complaint specifically alleged that Building America's Future hasn't properly disclosed the disbursements to fund the campaign — known as express advocacy disbursements — as would be required under Wisconsin campaign finance law.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone, who has long called for the federal government to open up more documents about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, refrained from immediately weighing in on the tranche of files released this week by the Trump administration.

"Oliver is holding off on commenting on anything regarding the JFK files until he's able to familiarize himself with the new materials," a representative for Stone said in an email to NBC News this week.

Stone directed the 1991 film "JFK," a dizzying exploration of the conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's killing. The movie focuses on former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) who distrusted the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

The director has said the movie was intended to serve as a "counter-myth" and a deep dive into the country's "untold history." It surveys a sprawling cast of potential culprits, including the CIA, the Mafia, Cuban freedom fighters and the military-industrial complex amid the war in Vietnam.

The batch of Kennedy files released this week did not immediately appear to contain any narrative-shifting bombshells about Kennedy's killing, though some of the files reveal the 35th president's skepticism of the CIA.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to call a snap federal election on Sunday that is expected to be held on April 28, The Globe and Mail reported, with the campaign likely to be dominated by anger over Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports and calls to make Canada the 51st state.

Carney has not yet made a final decision on April 28 as the election date, the newspaper reported yesterday, citing two sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss campaign plans and strategy. His office has not responded to an NBC News request for comment.

Carney, the newly elected leader of Canada's governing Liberal Party, became prime minister last Friday after his predecessor and fellow Liberal, the highly unpopular Justin Trudeau, stepped down after almost a decade in power amid criticism over his response to 25% tariffs that Trump has imposed on Canadian imports.

The center-left Liberals are now in a tight race with the Conservative Party, after Trump's actions and rhetoric prompted a surge in Canadian nationalism and support for the Liberals that erased the Conservatives' double-digit lead in the polls in a matter of weeks.

Trump said this afternoon that people who were deported to El Salvador by his administration went through a rigorous vetting process.

"I was told that they went through a very strong vetting process, and that that will also be continuing in El Salvador, and if there's anything like that we would certainly want to find out," Trump said in response to a reporter asking about reports that some who were deported weren't criminals.

"These were a bad group. This was a bad group, and they were in bad areas, and they were with a lot of other people that were absolutely killers, murderers, and people that were really bad with the worst records you've ever seen," Trump added. "And, but we will continue that process, absolutely we don't want to make that kind of a mistake."

Families of the Venezuelan immigrants who were recently deported say they were shocked to see their loved ones sent to a megaprison in El Salvador and deny that they have links to the Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua, NBC News reported this week.

Trump criticized Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who ran as Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket last year, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office this afternoon.

“He lost an election. He played a part. You know, usually a vice president doesn't play a part, they say. I think Tim played a part. I think he was so bad that he hurt her, but she hurt herself,” Trump said.

Trump's comments come as Walz has re-emerged on the national stage this week. The Minnesota governor returned to Wisconsin for the first time since the 2024 campaign to rally support for the Democratic candidate in the state's highly contested Supreme Court race.

During the Wisconsin event and in an interview on California Gov. Gavin Newsom's podcast, Walz urged Democratic governors to stand up to what he called Trump's "unconstitutional mandates."

Trump also blamed Harris' loss in part on Joe Biden. "Joe hurt them both. They didn't have a great group. I would probably put him at the bottom of the group," Trump said.

In his Oval Office remarks, a reporter asked Trump about NBC News' reporting that Biden is eager to help the Democratic Party get back on its feet by fundraising, campaigning or whatever else is needed. 

Trump said he'd welcome it. 

"I hope so," Trump said. 

Trump still uses his former opponent as a frequent foil. He has invoked Biden in some form more than 400 times since his Jan. 20 inauguration, according to an NBC News analysis.

Following his executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, Trump said Friday that the Small Business Association will “immediately” begin overseeing student loan servicing. He also said the Department of Health and Human Services will handle nutrition programs and programs for children with disabilities.

Yesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said those areas would remain under the Education Department.

Completely eliminating the department would require the approval of Congress, and Trump has said he hopes Democrats will vote in favor.

America PAC, the super PAC founded by billionaire Elon Musk ahead of the 2024 election, is reviving its controversial petition-gathering program to promise Wisconsin registered voters $100 if they sign its conservative-leaning petition ahead of next month's state Supreme Court race. 

The new petition says signers are "rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role," language that mirrors Musk and other Trump allies (as well as the president himself) who have lambasted judges they believe are stymying Trump's agenda. A post on X from the group says voters can also receive $100 for each signature that comes from their referral. 

America PAC ran a similar petition drive in swing states ahead of the presidential election, but that drive was coupled with an entry into a $1 million raffle for signers. Philadelphia's district attorney sued Musk and the group over the sweepstakes, but was unsuccessful. 

It's the latest attempt by Musk to use his virtually unlimited personal wealth to further his political aims. However, like last year's petition, the $100 only goes to people who sign the petition and is not explicitly linked to any promise to vote or to back a certain candidate or political party.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will continue to deport immigrants to a megaprison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador if the individuals have a final order of deportation, a Homeland Security spokesperson told NBC News.

The order by Judge James Boasberg only blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants subject to Trump's presidential proclamation from the U.S. to El Salvador without final orders of removal. 

The DHS spokesperson said that Venezuelan people who ICE arrested this week could face possible deportation to El Salvador if they are ordered deported by an immigration judge. 

The DHS spokesperson did not say when future deportations to El Salvador may occur. 

Sending deported immigrants to a prison in a foreign country that is not their own is unprecedented. The recent use of Guantanamo Bay was as a detention center rather than a deportation site, and immigrants there remained in the custody of the U.S.

When immigration judges order an immigrant to be deported, they do so with the expectation they will be humanely sent back to their home country.

U.S. ally South Korea is struggling to remove its Department of Energy designation as a “sensitive country” after being added to the list in January.

The designation, which takes effect April 15, puts South Korea on the lowest tier of the watch list along with countries such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. Countries may appear on the list for national security, nuclear nonproliferation or terrorism support reasons, and they are subject to additional review before their nationals are granted access to DOE facilities, according to the department's website.

“We will negotiate toward removing South Korea from the list as much as possible, but if that doesn't work, we will create a constructive alternative,” Ahn Duk-geun, the South Korean trade minister, told reporters yesterday upon arriving in Washington.

“We plan to find the best possible solution so that this does not become an obstacle to scientific and industrial cooperation between South Korea and the U.S.,” he said.

Joseph Yun, the acting U.S. ambassador in Seoul, said Tuesday that South Korea was added to the list because visitors to the DOE's labs mishandled sensitive information, according to Reuters. He did not elaborate on the details but said it was “not a big deal” and did not have broader implications for U.S.-South Korea cooperation.

Protesters gathered outside a VA medical center in Saginaw, Michigan, on Thursday to oppose the Trump administration's sprawling cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The protesters held signs reading “Keep your promise” and “Hands off our Veterans,” waving and cheering as cars passed to draw attention to the thousands of VA employees who have been fired from the agency, which provides health care and other critical services to millions of veterans.

Carly Rose Hammond, a member of the Saginaw City Council, told NBC 25 that now is the time for the nation to stand up for the veterans who fought for its freedoms.

“They're coming after nurses, they're coming after Medicaid, they're coming after Social Security offices. Those are people that need those services every single day — that's what we as voters voted for,” Hammond said.

An internal memo obtained by NBC News earlier this month detailed plans to slash 80,000 jobs from the agency by August in order to “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.”

Critics and concerned veterans warn the cuts could be detrimental for veterans who rely on the agency for health care and other critical services.

The Trump administration has appealed more than 15 decisions by federal judges to circuit courts since Jan. 20.

That includes one appeal filed overnight by Elon Musk and DOGE, appealing Judge Theodore Chuang's order to reinstate USAID systems and access, to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The administration has also appealed, for example, a ruling to reinstate National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, a Democrat, as well as another ruling to reinstate Cathy Harris, who was fired as a Democratic member of the Merit Systems Protection Board. 

The government also appealed a ruling last weekend that blocked deportations using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Planes carrying deportees, however, didn't turn around and instead landed in El Salvador, appearing to defy the judge's decision. The White House has denied that if defied the judge. 

Trump has been railing against federal judges who have blocked actions by his administration. This morning, he wrote on Truth Social, "No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., met a friendly crowd at a town hall last night in a Trump-won county. 

The congressman received a standing ovation when he arrived, and many of the attendees appeared to agree with his comments. 

But one constituent was booed by the crowd after he said he was a "little disappointed" that the congressman voted against the House Republican spending bill that was approved last week. 

The congressman was able to get them to stop booing, saying he appreciates the constituent's perspective, then explained why he voted against the bill.

“It was the worst CR I've ever seen in recent history, because it basically let the administration take money and move it around however they'd like, and spend it however they'd like, right?” he said.

Speaking to reporters afterward, Subramanyam dodged on whether he thinks it's time for new Democratic leadership. When pressed by NBC News, he said that the future of Senate Minority Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is up to the Senate.

“It truly is. ... I don't think we're in disarray. I think right now, we look like we're in disarray, but we certainly have a unifying message,” said Subramanyam.

Beijing said it welcomed a visit by Sen. Steve Daines, a strong Trump supporter, but did not say whether he would meet with senior Chinese officials as the world's two biggest economies take turns imposing tariffs on each other.

China welcomes Americans “from all walks of life, including members of the Congress, to visit China,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing today, adding that China believes both the U.S. and China benefit from the “steady, sound and sustainable” development of their relationship.

Daines, a Montana Republican, is the first member of Congress to visit Beijing since Trump returned to the White House in January. He arrived in the Chinese capital yesterday after meeting with top leaders in Vietnam and said he would be talking with Chinese officials about curbing the international flow of fentanyl, the U.S. trade deficit with China and fair market access for American farmers and ranchers.

His office said earlier that Daines would be coordinating closely with the White House and would be “carrying President Trump's America First agenda,” The Associated Press reported.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in the presidential race has given rise, again, to whispered worries in the Democratic Party about female candidates and electability — resurrecting a fraught conversation that bubbled for years after Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton.

The whisper campaign has started to some extent in New Jersey, where this year's governor's race will be one of Democrats' first big electoral tests since Trump won his second term.

Former President Joe Biden has told some Democratic leaders he'll raise funds, campaign and do anything else necessary for Democrats to recover lost ground as the Trump administration rolls back programs the party helped design, according to people close to him.

Biden privately met last month with the new Democratic National Committee chairman, Ken Martin, and offered to help as the party struggles to regain its viability amid polling that shows its popularity has been sinking, the people said.

NEW DELHI — India's IT ministry has unlawfully expanded censorship powers to allow the easier removal of online content and empowered “countless” government officials to execute such orders, Elon Musk's X has alleged in a new lawsuit against New Delhi.

The lawsuit and the allegations mark an escalation in an ongoing legal dispute between X and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over how New Delhi orders content to be taken down. It also comes as Musk is getting closer to launching his other key ventures Starlink and Tesla in India.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, is seeking information from the Securities and Exchange Commission over its decision to relax federal regulations around meme coins weeks after Trump and first lady Melania Trump released their own versions.

The SEC defines a meme coin as a type of crypto asset inspired by internet memes, characters, current events, or trends. In a staff statement last month, the agency said because of its view that meme coins are typically purchased for entertainment and social interaction rather than financial value, owners of the asset do not have to abide by federal regulations.

“Persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933,” a February statement from the agency reads. “Accordingly, neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws.”

In a letter to acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda, Warren highlighted the financial benefits the Trumps incurred through the coins and wrote the rule change “conveniently presents a legal interpretation that could shield the President and First Lady's coins from regulatory scrutiny.” 

“By the afternoon of January 20th, the coins were reportedly worth a combined $9.5 billion and attracted large numbers of first-time crypto investors,” the senator added. “Though the $TRUMP coin lost roughly two-thirds of its value within a few weeks of launch, President Trump's companies earned nearly $100 million in fees; small retail investors, meanwhile, lost money.”

Warren in the letter characterizes meme coins as “direct threats to consumers” that could benefit from more, not less, oversight.

The information the senator is requesting from the SEC includes “all communications” between the agency and the White House,” and more specifically, whether the agency has taken directives from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, a board formed by Trump in January that includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

“It is essential that the Commission issue policy proposals designed to benefit the American public—not the President's bottom line,” her letter reads.

Trump denied a New York Times report that his adviser Elon Musk is set to be briefed by the Pentagon today on the U.S. military's plan for any potential war with China.

“China will not even be mentioned or discussed,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform late last night.

Musk, who is leading the Trump administration's effort to slash the size of the federal government, is scheduled to visit the Pentagon today for a meeting and briefing, three defense officials told NBC News. Two of the officials said Musk was expected to be briefed on China but that the briefing would be unclassified. None of the officials could confirm the Times report, which cited two U.S. officials. 

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also denied the report, saying in a post on X that it would be “an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.”

Japan said there had been “no change” in plans to enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the U.S.-Japan alliance, despite news reports that the Pentagon is considering canceling a planned expansion of U.S. forces stationed in Japan.

The move to cancel the expansion, as outlined in draft documents seen by NBC and CNN, would save about $1.18 billion, part of larger cuts to defense spending that could include restructuring the U.S. military's combatant commands and headquarters and giving up U.S. command of NATO military operations for the first time in almost 75 years.  

The Japanese government's top spokesperson, Yoshimasa Hayashi, told reporters in Tokyo today that Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the expansion plan during Ishiba's visit to Washington last month.

The U.S. and its longtime ally Japan, which hosts more than 50,000 U.S. service members, have been intensifying military cooperation in recent years in an effort to address growing security threats from China and North Korea.

China called on the U.S. to protect Chinese nationals studying in the U.S. after a member of Congress requested several universities to disclose detailed information about their Chinese students, citing potential national security risks.

In a letter to six universities, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., accused China's ruling Communist Party of establishing a “well-documented, systematic pipeline” to embed researchers in leading U.S. institutions for “sensitive” technologies. The universities are Carnegie Mellon, Purdue University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland and the University of Southern California.

“America's student visa system has become a Trojan horse for Beijing,” Moolenaar said in a statement, in what he called a “direct threat” to American national security.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that educational cooperation is “in the interests of both parties.”

“We urge the U.S. to stop generalizing national security and to genuinely protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students, and not to take discriminatory or restrictive measures against them,” spokesperson Mao Ning said yesterday at a regular briefing in Beijing.

China is the second-biggest source of international students in the U.S. after India, accounting for about a quarter of the total in the 2023-24 academic year, according to the State Department.

LAS VEGAS — At the first stop of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour out West, two of the Democratic Party's most unabashed progressive lawmakers had plenty to say about President Donald Trump. But they also had some strong words for their own party.

“This isn't just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. told the fired-up crowd gathered at the Craig Ranch Amphitheater to see her and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.”

While Ocasio-Cortez did not mention any Democratic leaders by name, the crowd broke out into multiple “Primary Chuck” chants — a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who backed down from a funding fight with Trump last week.

Tech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk is scheduled to visit the Pentagon today for a briefing that will include a discussion on China, according to two defense officials. 

The briefing will be unclassified, the officials said.

The New York Times reported last night that Musk would be briefed on the U.S. military's plans for any potential war with China, citing two U.S. officials. One official also confirmed that the briefing would be focused on China, and another only confirmed that Musk would be at the Pentagon today, according to the Times' report.

Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks at the Oval Office at 11 a.m. ET with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The White House did not specify the focus of their remarks.

In the evening, Trump is slated to head to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets provisionally closed lower on Friday, led by declines in the travel sector which was down 1.6% after the closure of Heathrow airport.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 and French CAC 40 were both about 0.6% lower by 4.40 p.m. London time, while the the German DAX shed 0.5%. London's FTSE 100 was about 0.6% lower.

The travel and leisure sector lost about 1.6% after London's Heathrow Airport closed on Friday following a fire at a nearby electrical substation. British Airways-owner International Airlines Group was trading around 1.9% lower.

Basic resources — including stocks such as ArcelorMittal and wood pulp processor Stora Enso — were down about 2.3%.

European investors digested monetary policy updates that came from multiple central banks in the region, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve, this week.

The Bank of Russia held its key rates at 21% on Friday, citing high inflationary pressures. On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank trimmed interest rates by 25 basis points, while the Bank of England held rates steady in the U.K. and Sweden's Riksbank also opted not to alter interest rates.

"Since [our] previous meeting, global trade policy uncertainty has intensified, and the United States has made a range of tariff announcements, to which some governments have responded," the Bank of England said on Thursday. "Other geopolitical uncertainties have also increased and indicators of financial market volatility have risen globally."

It came after the Fed also kept its key interest rate steady on Wednesday. Although the central bank said it still sees two rate cuts happening this year, officials cut their 2025 economic growth forecast for the U.S. and noted that uncertainty had increased, with tariffs poised to add inflationary pressure.

— CNBC's Sophie Kiderlin and Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Fabrizio Palermo, CEO of Italian utilities company ACEA, said the world is not prepared for the water consumption demands of running artificial intelligence.

"Estimates by year 2030 are saying that basically, the water consumption linked to AI can reach a level as high as the full consumption of the US," Palermo told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe. "This is significant, and clearly the world is not ready for that."

"The situation is critical. We are going towards what can be called the new water era ... we need to be prepared for this new water transition," he added.

Palermo also said that AI can help with water management, such as predicting future water availability. He added that  awareness of the demand for water was "rising," with the European Commission's appointment of a commissioner for water resilience.

JPMorgan's Head of Global Multi-Asset Strategy John Bilton said markets will likely be in a "better place" next year.

"If we take a step back and think: 'Where are we going to be a year from now?' chances are we're probably still going to be in a better place, and that starts to inform how you think about taking risk in these markets," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday.

Bilton referred to moves from Germany to reform borrowing rules and "reasonable" corporate profit expectations as more positive data points.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could cause "a little bit more chop" to markets ahead of the duties coming into effect on April 2, Bilton said, adding that he expected more positive news to come on fiscal boosts and deregulation, which could provide a "boost" in the second half of 2025.

Aviation expert Anita Mendiratta said the implications of the fire and power outage causing the closure of London's Heathrow Airport on Friday were "very wide."

"The growth of the [aviation] industry is happening faster than the growth of infrastructure," said Mendiratta, founder of consultancy AM&A, speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday. "All of this is a very dramatic learning curve," she said.

Mendiratta described the growth of aviation globally as "massive."

"It is extreme in terms of how it has grown far beyond even 2019 rates," she said. This raises questions over the industry's resilience to unplanned weather or geopolitical events and whether the surrounding infrastructure can support it.

The three major averages traded lower in the U.S. Friday morning.

Just after the opening bell, the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 321 points, or about 0.8%.

In a note to clients after German lawmakers passed public borrowing reforms that will pave the way for higher national defense spending, economists at Deutsche Bank declared it "time to bake this fiscal regime shift into macro forecasts."

The analysts now expect Germany's GDP growth to accelerate to 1.5% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027.

"That said, it will take time for the fiscal impulse to kick in, and we slightly lower our growth forecast for 2025 to 0.3% in light of stronger global cross-currents than we had previously expected," they said.

The German lender had previously forecast German economic growth of 0.5% for 2025 and 1% for 2026.

The Bank of Russia held its key rate unchanged at 21% on Friday, citing high inflationary pressures.

"The Bank of Russia estimates that the achieved tightness of monetary conditions creates the necessary prerequisites for returning inflation to the target in 2026," it said in a statement on Friday. "Achieving the inflation target will require a long period of maintaining tight monetary conditions in the economy."

The central bank's board of directors noted that maintaining a long period of "tight monetary conditions in the economy," will allow inflation to return to target in 2026.

"If disinflation dynamics do not ensure achieving the inflation target, the Bank of Russia will consider raising the key rate," it said.

The central bank said Russia's annual inflation was 10.2% as of March 17 and could slim down to 7-8% in 2025, before returning to 4% in 2026 and staying at this target further onward.

"According to the baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia expects that inflationary pressures will continue to decline in the coming months. This will be supported by a cooldown in lending and high saving activity," it added.

Russia's economy has been battling high inflation and economic constrictions as a result of Western sanctions, which have particularly curtailed Moscow's key energy exports.

British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca on Friday said that it will invest $2.5 billion in a research and development center in Chinese capital Beijing.

The new hub is expected to take AstraZeneca's Beijing workforce to around 1,700 employees.

The investment in Beijing comes as part of a partnership with the city's Municipal Government and the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area Administrative Office, AstraZeneca said.

Under the deal, AstraZeneca will enter research and development collaborations with biotech firms Harbour BioMed and Syneron Bio and will launch a joint venture with BioKangtai to develop, produce, and market vaccines for respiratory and other infectious diseases.

Anita Mendiratta, founder of consultancy Anita Mendiratta and Associates, discusses the consequences of the fire at London Heathrow Airport.

Citi issued a note on Friday over the potential impact of the Heathrow airport closure on IAG, the owner of British Airways:

"1) the 2017 IT outage cost ~£80m, including £30m in lost revenue; however, we believe much of the cost was compensation - today's fire would appear to be outside of the airline's control, so compensation may not be payable (although they will need to provide food and water and possibly hotel accommodation)," Citi said in the note.

"2) it would appear to be one-off in nature, so we'd argue deserves a one times multiple (£80m is about 0.5% of market cap post tax; 3) if the airport does not open overnight, the costs would increase proportionally."

A fire at a nearby electrical substation caused the closure of Heathrow Airport on Friday, affecting hundreds of flights in and out of the London transport hub. Here are some of the biggest movers as of 8:45 a.m. London time:

London's Heathrow Airport closed on Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage, airport officials said.

"Heathrow is experiencing a significant power outage across the airport due to a large fire at a nearby electrical substation. Whilst fire crews are responding to the incident, we do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored," a Heathrow spokesperson said.

"We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens," the spokesperson said.

The airport will remain closed until at least 11:59 p.m. local time on Friday.

"We know this will be disappointing for passengers and we want to reassure that we are working as hard as possible to resolve the situation," a Heathrow spokesperson said.

Oops, something went wrong

New York Federal Reserve president John Williams on Friday stressed the uncertainty of the US economic outlook, saying he expects lower growth this year amid a lot of unknowns about the impact of new trade, fiscal and immigration policies.

"It's hard to know with any precision how the economy will evolve," Williams said in a speech at the Macroeconometric Caribbean Conference in the Bahamas.

"Uncertainty is high, and there are many scenarios that could play out, depending on fiscal and trade policies and geopolitical and other developments.”

The comments came after the Fed held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Powell raised eyebrows on Wednesday when he said his "base case" is that any higher inflation from tariffs will prove transitory, reviving memories of the Fed's slow response to inflation coming out of the pandemic and sparking questions of whether the Fed could repeat the same mistake.

But Williams said Friday it's unclear about whether the effects prove to be transitory this time around, noting that it really depends on the different circumstances and the details.

"Tariff direct effects might be short-lived, but we have to be looking at more at what's happening in the economy...and kind of adjusting our view on the path of policy based on what we're learning along the way," Williams told Yahoo Finance during a media availability Friday.

To bolster his point about the uncertainty ahead for the economy, Williams on Friday noted that the range of Fed officials' new estimates for GDP growth are between about 1-1/2 and 2 percent. For inflation, the range wisbetween about 2-1/2 and 3 percent, noting that any of those are possible.

Williams anticipates lower immigration will constrain the increase of workers in the job market, putting a damper on growth. And while inflation has continued on a "bumpy path" toward the Fed's 2% goal, he noted the future is highly uncertain.

The New York Fed president characterized the current level on the Fed's benchmark interest rate as “modestly restrictive,” noting that the current range of 4.25%-4.5% is “entirely appropriate” given the “solid” labor market and inflation still running “somewhat” above their 2% goal.

Though he also stressed, “measures of policy uncertainty have increased sharply in recent months.”

Williams also addressed short-term inflation expectations, which have risen considerably in the wake of President Trump's proposed tariffs.

Williams acknowledged the increase in expectations, but noted “there are no signs of inflation expectations becoming unmoored relative to the pre-pandemic period.”

Elsewhere, this week the Fed announced it will slow the rate with which it lets Treasury securities roll off its balance sheet to $5 billion, down from $25 billion starting next month. Williams emphasized that the decision to slow the runoff “is a natural next step to smooth the transition from abundant reserves to a level that is somewhat above ample."

He added, “this action has no implications for our intended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the medium term.”

The yield on the 10-year Treasury has dropped since the Fed's balance sheet announcement. Retaining more Treasuries, means more demand, pushing down yields.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Thursday walked back comments he made in January, when he cast doubt on whether useful quantum computers would hit the market in the next 15 years.

At Nvidia's “Quantum Day” event, part of the company's annual GTC Conference, Huang admitted that his comments came out wrong.

“This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” Huang said.

In January, Huang sent quantum computing stocks reeling when he said 15 years was “on the early side” in considering how long it would be before the technology would be useful. He said at the time that 20 years was a timeframe that “a whole bunch of us would believe.”

In his opening comments on Thursday, Huang drew comparisons between pre-revenue quantum companies and Nvidia's early days. He said it took over 20 years for Nvidia to build out its software and hardware business.

He also expressed surprise that his comments were able to move markets, and joked he didn't know that certain quantum computing companies were publicly traded.

“How could a quantum computer company be public?” Huang said.

The event included panels with representatives from 12 quantum companies and startups. It represents a truce of sorts between Nvidia, which makes more traditional computers, and the quantum computing industry. Several quantum execs fired back at Nvidia after Huang's earlier comments.

A third panel included representatives from Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, which are also investing in quantum technology and are among Nvidia's most important customers.

Nvidia has another reason to embrace quantum. As quantum computers are being built, much of the research on them is done through simulators on powerful computers, like those that Nvidia sells.

It's also possible that a quantum computer would require a traditional computer to operate it. Nvidia is working to provide the technology and software to integrate graphics processing units (GPUs) and quantum chips.

“Of course, quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” Huang said on Thursday. “But the technology is insanely complicated.”

Nvidia said this week that it will build a research center in Boston to allow quantum companies to collaborate with researchers at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The center will include several racks of the company's Blackwell AI servers.

Quantum computing has been a dream of physicists and mathematicians since the 1980s, when California Institute of Technology professor Richard Feynman first proposed the idea behind a quantum computer.

While classical computers use bits that are either 0 or 1, the bits inside a quantum computer — qubits — end up being on or off based on probability. Experts predict that the technology will be able to solve problems with massive amounts of possible solutions, such as deciphering codes, routing deliveries or simulating chemistry or weather.

No quantum computer has yet beat a computer at solving a real, useful problem. But Google claimed late last year that it discovered a way to do error correction.

One question at the panel centered around whether quantum computing might one day threaten companies like Nvidia that make computers based on transistors.

“A long time ago, somebody asked me, ‘So what's accelerated computing good for?'” Huang said at the panel. Accelerated computing is a phrase he uses to refer to the kind of GPU computers that Nvidia makes.

“I said, a long time ago, because I was wrong, this is going to replace computers,” he said. “This is going to be the way computing is done, and and everything, everything is going to be better. And it turned out I was wrong.”

Washington — The Small Business Administration on Friday said it is cutting more than 40% of its staff as part of the Trump administration's wider effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy.

Roughly 6,500 people, or less than half-a-percent of the entire federal workforce, are employed at the SBA, according to the most recent data available. The agency said in a statement that it will "reduce its workforce by 43%" and said the cuts would save more than $435 million a year by next fiscal year.

"The strategic reorganization will begin a turnaround for the agency by restoring the efficiency of the first Trump Administration, as well as its focus on promoting small businesses," the agency said. "Core services to the public, including the agency's loan guarantee and disaster assistance programs, as well as its field and veteran operations, will not be impacted."

The Senate voted to confirm former Sen. Kelly Loeffler to as the agency's administrator in February. In a video posted to X on Friday, Loeffler said it's time to "rightsize the agency."

"Since the pandemic, the SBA has doubled its workforce, expanding in size, scope and spending with miserable results," Loeffler said in the video. "That's why change is coming to the SBA. ... This agency is done wasting millions of tax dollars to fund a progressive pandemic-era bureaucracy. We will not allow fiscal mismanagement to threaten our loan programs or criminals to get away with fraud. But we will evaluate every program and expenditure and we will rightsize the agency to transform the SBA into a high-efficiency engine for America's entrepreneurs and taxpayers." 

Staff is spread out in district offices across the country. Texas has more SBA employees than any state, including the District of Columbia, where the agency is headquartered. 

Speaking at the White House on Friday morning, President Trump announced that SBA will be responsible for handling federal student loan programs, one day after signing an order to begin winding down the Department of Education, which currently manages the programs. Experts warned that the order could throw student loans into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers. Administration officials have previously said that student loan programs would eventually be transferred to an agency like the SBA or the Treasury or Commerce Departments.

The SBA was established by an act of Congress in 1953 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president to "aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns." 

It provides loans to businesses that fall victim to natural disasters and offers support on international trade issues. The agency's federally backed loans and grants were a lifeline to small businesses and nonprofit groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        The results are in for a test Google carried out in eight European countries.
    

Google has said that news is unprofitable for its adverting business following the results of an experiment it ran in eight European countries. 

The tech giant removed news from search results for 1 per cent of users for 2.5 months and on Friday announced the results of the test. 

“The study showed that when we removed this content, there was no change to Search ad revenue and a <1% (0.8%) drop in usage,” Google said. 

Paul Liu, Google's director of economics, said in a statement that they have "seen a number of inaccurate reports that vastly overestimate the value of news content to Google".

The company added in the report that the actual ad revenue impact “could not be statistically‬‭ distinguished from zero, either overall or by country”.

The experiment was carried out in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.

The test was also intended for France, but a French court blocked the move and warned Google would be fined for breaking an agreement with the antitrust authority. 

Google said the test was being carried out as part of the company's compliance with the European Copyright Directive (EUCD), one of the European Union's legal frameworks, and its licensing programme for EU news publishers.

The European law states that Google and similar bodies must pay news publishers for using parts of their content. However, the question of how much that content is worth could be an argument Google uses in negotiations.

France's competition watchdog fined Google €250 million last year for breaches linked to intellectual property rules for news media publishers. 

There were also concerns over Google's AI service using news publisher content to train its AI models for free.

SPECIAL REPORT: Which Funds Beat Benchmarks Over 1, 3, 5 And 10 Years?



Shares in government contractors Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), Gartner (IT), CACI International (CACI) and Science Applications International (SAIC) tumbled on Thursday after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon was canceling $580 million in contracts, including deals with Gartner and consultancy McKinsey. While Booz Allen stock fell, shares in rival Palantir Technologies (PLTR) rose.

The DOD posted Hegseth's announcement on Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter.

On the stock market today, Booz Allen stock retreated 8.1% to close at 103.58. Gartner stock 6.8% to 418.77. CACI stock was down 4.5% at 369.66. SAIC dipped 6% to 105.98. But Palantir stock rose 1.5% to 87.39.

Further, Hegseth credited the Trump administration's DOGE initiative, led by Musk, for identifying DOD contracts that were no longer needed.

According to reports, Hegseth will be meeting with Musk at the Pentagon on Friday to discuss "innovation, efficiencies & smarter production." The defense agency is evaluating large civilian job cuts.

In a post on X, Hegseth said the meeting is not about China war plans as reported by the New York Times.

Further, Musk founded electric car maker Tesla (TSLA). Tesla stock has plunged 41% in 2025 amid Musk's DOGE activity. In  an all-hands company meeting late Thursday, Musk told employees to hold onto Tesla stock.

Worries over Accenture's federal government services business amid DOGE-led layoffs of federal employees also hit Accenture (ACN), after the IT services company reported fiscal second quarter earnings.

Accenture stock tumbled along with IBM (IBM) and ServiceNow (NOW). Accenture stock fell 7.3% to 300.91.

"The new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently," said Accenture Chief Executive Julie Sweet on the company's conference call with Wall Street analysts. "During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue."

In 2024, the U.S. federal government accounted for 8% of Accenture revenue.

"Shares of many defense tech service providers are down following Accenture's  commentary that DOGE is inducing a slower government procurement environment, which is impacting revenue for its Accenture federal business," said William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma in a report.

He added: "While some small contracts have been canceled for the main players, most cancellations have been for small vendors. There will likely be greater clarity over the next three months following the review of GSA and non-GSA DoD consulting contracts. Slower bookings have the potential to result in revenue deceleration over time."

While they are rivals, Palantir and Booz Allen announced in December that they would partner in some cases. The two companies said the partnership will focus on "driving transformational information infrastructure modernization and secure interoperability and rapidly accelerating integrated warfighting operations with coalition partners through data-centric systems that improve collaboration and combined mission planning with U.S. allies and partners."

Palantir stock has climbed 15% in 2025 but has dropped some 30% from its all-time high set in February.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk urged his company's staff to "hang onto your stock" during an all-hands meeting in which he admitted that "it feels like Armageddon" after seeing news coverage of his dealerships and vehicles being targeted with violence. 

Speaking at the company's Texas gigafactory on Thursday night, Musk reassured workers by saying "overall, it's good" for Tesla, touting recent sales figures for its Model Y and Cybertruck vehicles. However, he added, "If you read the news, it feels like Armageddon." 

"I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. You're like — what is going on?" Musk said. 

"Some people it's like, listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down — that's a bit unreasonable, you know. This is psycho," he continued, drawing laughs from the audience. "Stop being psycho, OK?"

Tesla's stock price has plummeted in recent months as Musk's presence has become more frequent in Washington, D.C., leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for the Trump administration. 

As of early Friday, Tesla shares were around $236 in pre-market trading, down from a peak of nearly $480 in mid-December. 

Musk suggested during the meeting that employees should stay patient. 

"Autonomous Teslas will be everywhere. In five years, probably, we will have regulatory approval, I think globally, so you will have autonomous Teslas on every continent taking people on trip,s and almost the entire fleet — which will pass 10 million vehicles next year – is capable of full autonomy," he said.

"It's very difficult for people in the stock market — especially those that look in the rearview mirror, which is most people — to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million-vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness," Musk continued. "But it will compute in the future... so what I'm saying is, hang onto your stock." 

The meeting took place Thursday after the Justice Department announced that three people were charged in federal cases involving attacks on Tesla properties in the U.S.

"People that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes the funders," President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social. "WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!"

The West Plains downtown community is inviting residents and visitors to participate in its spring “Small Business Passport” program, an initiative designed to encourage local shopping and engagement.

Participants can pick up a passport at various downtown locations or the Ozark Heritage Welcome Center. To complete the passport, individuals must visit and receive stamps from ten participating businesses. Once completed, the passport can be submitted for entry into a drawing for a gift basket.



This initiative aims to highlight and support local businesses while providing a fun and interactive way for the community to explore downtown West Plains. Full details are available on the passport, and no purchase is necessary to participate. The deadline for entries is April 30.

Lawsuit alleges US plane maker's treatment of John Barnett caused his death after he raised safety concerns

The family of a whistleblower at Boeing who killed himself last year is suing the US plane manufacturer, alleging the company's conduct caused his death.

Boeing pushed John Barnett to his death by harassing and intimidating him after he raised safety concerns about the company's plant building the 787 Dreamliner in Charleston, South Carolina, a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal court in the state alleges.

The world's second-largest aeroplane maker has faced significant scrutiny over its safety during a years-long crisis started by two fatal crashes of its bestselling 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019. Last year a door panel blew out of a Boeing plane in mid-air after engineers failed to replace crucial bolts, raising yet more concerns over the company's safety culture.

The crises have also raised questions over how Boeing treated people voicing concerns.

Barnett was a quality manager at Boeing for nearly three decades, starting at Everett, Washington state, before his move to South Carolina. He took early retirement in 2017, at which point he was experiencing symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, according to the claim.

He then shared concerns over Boeing's safety processes with journalists, becoming known publicly as a whistleblower. His allegations included finding metal shavings near critical control wires, and problems with onboard oxygen systems.

His family claim in their suit that Boeing responded by carrying out a “campaign of harassment, abuse and intimidation intended to discourage, discredit and humiliate him until he would either give up or be discredited”.

Barnett was found dead with a gunshot wound in his truck in a hotel car park on 9 March last year, days after giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.

In a statement this week, Boeing said: “We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family.” The company was approached for further comment.

However, Barnett's family alleged that “Boeing had threatened to break John, and break him it did”.

They said the aeroplane maker intentionally gave Barnett inaccurate, poor job reviews and less desirable shifts, and that the company publicly blamed him for delays that angered his co-workers and prevented him from transferring to another plant.

The lawsuit alleged: “Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to his death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that PTSD and John's unbearable depression, panic attacks, and anxiety … would in turn lead to an elevated risk of suicide.

“Boeing may not have pulled the trigger, but Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death.”

Watches In The Wild The Road Through America, Episode 1: A Model Of Mass Production

Plus, a look at the new watch servicing program.

Sotheby's has just announced a partnership with WatchCheck, a relatively new but intriguing company that launched last year. The partnership aims to provide an easier, seamless servicing process for over 38,000 models. WatchCheck gives customers access to servicing partners in the United States that were previously largely accessible only to commercial clients.

I had a chance to check out the process for WatchCheck last year, and it's quite intuitive and reduces many of the issues that often cause repairs to be a headache (especially if you don't live in a big city). The project was founded by Linden Lazarus (founder of vintage retailer Oliver and Clarke) and Will Haering. When you go to WatchCheck's site, you have to input a few bits of information about the make and model, upload some pictures of the watch, and describe the issue. After providing your address, you'll get an estimate from the company and receive a shipping kit. Inside the box is a pre-labeled external shipping box and a padded internal box with yet another foam insert where you place your watch. Slide it back inside and drop the watch off for shipping, and you're pretty much set.

While WatchCheck facilitates the service, Stoll & Co. in Dayton, OH, evaluates and services the watch. They offer various services, from simple repairs and battery replacements to grand complications and case refinishing (if that's your thing). Stoll & Co. is an authorized US repair center for several brands, but their expertise extends beyond the companies on their website.

Stoll & Co. is also a part of eBay's Authenticity program. A little search on Google shows you that the program hasn't been without its faults. However, with over 40 years of experience and 40 trained watchmakers, they're one of the most experienced companies of their kind in the United States.

After receiving the watch and making an inspection, WatchCheck will update you with a final price for service, which you can approve or decline. When the watch is returned to you, it comes in the internal box you shipped it with, which will also contain your receipt and warranty information.

While a lot of us (including many at Hodinkee) think of auction houses like Sotheby's as the place you go looking for the most untouched example of rare vintage watches, the fact of the matter is that modern and neo-vintage pieces make up a large portion of the volume Sotheby's sells. They also have a lot of customers who might not be enthusiasts who enjoy watches that look worn, nor do they have the contacts with watchmakers to service the watches they've picked up at auction (or through Sotheby's pre-owned selection). A service like this will make a lot of sense for those kinds of customers.

Trailblazing American golfer and Honorary University of St Andrews graduate Dr Renee Powell returned to the Home of Golf this week.

During her visit, Renee took part in the University's prestigious Andrew Carnegie Lecture Series, where she spoke to University Principal Professor Dame Sally Mapstone about her life, her inspirational career and her long association with St Andrews. Alongside the Principal, she also unveiled a new plaque installed in her honour at Powell Hall, the eponymous student residence at the town's North Haugh.

Described as ‘golf's greatest living ambassador', Renee took on racial adversity and segregation, to excel against the odds. In 1967, she became the second African-American woman to compete on the LPGA Tour. In 1971, she was part of a USO tour to Vietnam, in support of American troops, and would expand upon that rare experience throughout a career to support both men and women in military service. 

In 1979, while a member of the PGA of Great Britain & Ireland, she was named the first woman head professional of a private golf club in the UK, Silvermere in Surrey. In 1996 she became the first black woman member of the PGA of America.

Following her LPGA Tour career, Renee dedicated her life to diversifying the game of golf and extending the mission of her father Bill to make the sport welcoming to all. She became an International Goodwill Ambassador travelling to Africa on more than 25 trips to host golf clinics.

Having begun her love affair with golf aged just three and playing competitively since she was 12, Renee, now aged 78, remains a passionate advocate for expanding golf to more youth, women, seniors, minorities, and military veterans.

In 2011, she launched Clearview HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) a free, year-round therapeutic and recreational golf programme specifically for women veterans at the Clearview Golf Club in Ohio built by her father, that she now runs.

In 2008, Renee became the third American, and the only woman golfer, to ever receive an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of St Andrews. In 2015, she became one of two American women initially given honorary membership into the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. And in 2018, the University made Renee the first American to have a student hall of residence dedicated in her name.

Commenting on the visit, Principal Sally Mapstone said: “Renee Powell is a magnificent friend of the University, and a terrific role model for women in sport and for everyone who appreciates the value of fair mindedness, hard work, and hope.”

England Golf has been named one of six finalists in two categories at the FEVO Sport Industry Awards, with the national governing body nominated for Sport Organisation of the Year and the Wellness at Work award.

Pacesetter Technology, a leading innovator in mobile technology for private clubs, has announced a strategic partnership with 59club, the industry's customer service management specialist. 

An extended seeding programme with MM Seeds has helped transform course conditions at FulFord Heath Golf Club

Alabama lawmakers on Thursday advanced proposed regulations on pharmacy benefit managers

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Two blocks from the Alabama Statehouse, a black wreath hung on the door of Adams Drugs — a symbol to draw attention to the number of neighborhood pharmacies that have closed, or are in danger of closing, across the state.

Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.

“We're losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,” Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said. 

Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.

Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges. 

Pharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions. 

“The biggest issue is we're not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,” Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy. 

The Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of “spread pricing” where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies. 

Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.

Helena Duncan, president of the Business Council of Alabama, told a legislative committee on Wednesday that small businesses, which might already be struggling to provide insurance to their workers, will have to either absorb the increased cost or pass it along to employees through premium increases.

“Shifting the financial burdens from pharmacies to the Alabama employers is fundamentally unfair,” Duncan told a legislative committee on Wednesday. 

Republican Sen. Andrew Jones, a cosponsor of the bill, said Thursday said other states have seen drug prices go down. Jones said it is important to protect neighborhood pharmacies because they play a vital role in communities.

“You are not going to get a big box store to open in the middle of the night to get you the medication you need,” Jones said.

, Forbes Staff. 

When Hurricane Milton slammed into Florida in October, peeling the roof off Tropicana Field like a ripe orange, the Tampa Bay Rays were left to scramble to find a stadium for the 2025 season. It ultimately took them just five weeks to announce their new home: Tampa's George M. Steinbrenner Field, a minor league ballpark and the New York Yankees' spring training complex.

Then came the real race against the clock.

The Rays had four months to get ready for Opening Day—and that meant much more than shipping some bats and balls across the bridge from St. Petersburg or redecorating the players' clubhouse. The team's 300 or so employees, needing a new headquarters, moved to a temporary office space less than a mile from the Trop and got to work rebuilding their ticketing infrastructure and coordinating with Major League Baseball to get Steinbrenner Field ready for national television broadcasts.

The Rays would also have to rejigger sponsorships—which, at best, typically take three months to come together, and sometimes years—to fit their new inventory of signage space. They would have to adjust to a new concessions operator, speeding up a process that took them a year and a half the last time they switched vendors, and decide whether they needed trailers or additional cold storage space. They had to figure out how to ship merchandise from their warehouse at the Trop and start planning for kiosks on the stadium concourse to compensate for the smaller footprint of the team stores. And they had to connect with a different city police department and county sheriff's office, plus a new fire inspector.

“It was almost like standing up a new business, frankly, in the span of a few months,” says Bill Walsh, the Rays' chief business officer. “Whatever the baseball analogy of building the plane while you fly it is, I think, is fair to say.”

The sprint to the finish will be next week. The Rays are not permitted to move into Steinbrenner Field until the Yankees move out, leaving only around 120 hours between the end of New York's spring training game on March 23 and the start of Tampa Bay's regular-season opener against the Colorado Rockies on March 28 (a matchup that was pushed back a day to allow for a little extra time). Those five days will be an around-the-clock rush by 50 workers from five companies as well as more than 80 team staff members to mount more than 3,000 signs and other marketing assets—not just corporate logos but also Rays-themed “see something, say something” and “watch for foul ball” placards. The giant “YANKEES” lettering plastered on each side of the stadium will be covered up, the pinstriped merchandise in stores swapped for Tampa Bay blue, and the security screening process ironed out.

There will be no avoiding a revenue impact this season as the Rays move from Tropicana Field—which has been configured to hold roughly 25,000 fans since 2018, with 54 luxury suites, and can be expanded to around 42,000—to a 10,046-seat minor league ballpark with 13 suites. That's more bad news for a franchise that ranked 27th (out of 30) on Forbes' 2024 list of MLB's most valuable teams at $1.25 billion, with estimated revenue of $301 million. But the Rays are confident that their busy offseason will minimize the disruption—and even lead to some new money-making opportunities.

Home Away From Home: The Rays will spend the 2025 regular season at Steinbrenner Field, the Yankees' spring training complex in Tampa, about 20 miles from their usual headquarters in St. Petersburg.

This situation isn't entirely unprecedented for Tampa Bay, which had to shift its spring training home to Orlando in 2023 after its facility in Port Charlotte was damaged by Hurricane Ian. And other pro teams have had to make unexpected moves at the last minute. For instance, Covid-19 travel restrictions forced the Toronto Blue Jays to move for 2020 and parts of 2021 to Buffalo, New York, and Dunedin, Florida, where their minor league affiliates usually play. Fifteen years earlier, the NBA team then known as the New Orleans Hornets and the NFL's Saints temporarily relocated in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

But that history does little to mitigate the challenge facing the Rays, who learned relatively quickly that 35-year-old Tropicana Field could not be repaired before the end of the 2025 season. Wanting to stay in the region, they struck a deal with the Yankees, reportedly for $15 million, although insurance is believed to be covering at least some of that fee.

In a bit of lucky timing, Steinbrenner Field recently completed a two-year renovation, but even so, “it's not turnkey,” Walsh notes. For instance, more room had to be created to accommodate major league umpires and players' families, and the stadium's lighting had to be improved. Tampa Bay also had to cover the costs of upgrades to a practice field on the property that will now serve as the home of the Class A Tampa Tarpons, Steinbrenner Field's usual summer tenant.

In perhaps the most conspicuous change, MLB altered the Rays' schedule to prevent conflicts with the Tarpons and with the NFL's Buccaneers, who play down the street at Raymond James Stadium, and to avoid the rain that tends to drench the region in the summer months. Tampa Bay will play 19 of its first 22 games at home and be on the road for 69 of 103 to end the season.

But the Rays, who have played home games under a dome since they made their MLB debut in 1998, also see playing outdoors as a chance to experiment with their business. They expect to add fireworks to their game-day experience and can now sell sponsorship space on the tarp used during rain delays, as well as video-board spots that pass the time until the game can resume. Air conditioning will be a major draw for Steinbrenner Field's suites, and Orlando Health, which became the Rays' official healthcare partner coming out of the pandemic, will place branded sunscreen and hydration stations around the concourse to combat the summer sun.

That attitude of turning lemons into lemonade permeates the organization—and occasionally covers other kinds of fruit. “Our sponsors kind of understood, ‘Hey, I'm not going to get an apple, I'm going to get an orange, but I like oranges, too,'” says Walsh, acknowledging that Steinbrenner is a much smaller facility than the Trop to adorn with company logos. While some marquee ad placements—such as the outfield wall or behind home plate—are comparable, other relationships have required a different mix of signage or hospitality offerings, or an accommodation in the form of a deal extension or deferred payment.

The Rays have installed LED boards around Steinbrenner to carry more ads, and their sponsorship team also had an all-new perk to dangle thanks to the field's location: signage outside the stadium facing Dale Mabry Highway, one of Tampa's busiest streets.

“Those eyeballs on our brand and impressions are such an easy way for us to prove ROI,” says Orlando Health senior director of sports partnerships Ultima Espino, adding, “I think I was prepared to be more nimble than I really had to be.”

Orlando Health's investment in its sponsorship is roughly flat from last year, and that isn't uncommon across a Rays portfolio that has seen a retention rate perhaps even better than usual. “Very close to all folks have indicated a path forward to get everything transferred over, and some folks have even stepped up and done more,” Rays vice president of corporate partnerships Anthony Rioles says. “And for the very few handful of folks that for one reason or another made sense for us to take a slight break this year, it's not full stop—we're keeping the long-term relationship intact.”

Tampa Bay had to go through a similarly painstaking process to adapt its ticketing for the 2025 season, starting with reassembling its customer history within Tickets.com's management system. The Rays had already completed their season-ticket renewal process by early September, so they had to figure out how to transfer those fans to a new ballpark configuration.

“We sat down in a group of eight or 10 of us—for many, many hours each session—and literally manually moved dots on the map into what we felt would be the most comparable location,” Walsh says. “And then we invited those folks to view that location and either accept them or decline.”

The Rays ranked 28th in MLB with average home attendance of 16,515 last season, but even that relatively small step-down to Steinbrenner Field's capacity would translate to a revenue loss of more than $14 million over a full season, assuming the average ticket price held steady, according to Forbes estimates. The inevitable result of the scarcity: Tickets are more expensive this season. Walsh says it would be too difficult to come up with an average increase—“I think we have 25 or 30 different pricing codes,” he says, and single-game tickets went on sale only recently—but the Tampa Bay Times found one fan whose season package was rising 39%, to $26,325.

Despite that jump, the Rays' season-ticket base is larger than it was last season, and 45% of those fans are new this year, Walsh says. Tampa Bay also created new types of partial-season plans and even rethought its strategy around giveaways. For one thing, it is planning to hand out items that could be useful outdoors, such as hats and sunglasses. More importantly, the team is shifting its promotional calendar from a “peak on peak” model—trying to make attractive matchups even more desirable—to one that emphasizes games that might otherwise be more difficult to sell.

Quick Turnaround: During the Rays' first trip to Steinbrenner Field this year, for a spring training game against the Yankees, they were the visitors. Across five days next week, they'll move in as the home team.

“That was another area that was leave no stone unturned,” Walsh says. “I don't think we coasted on anything, really, in any aspect of the business.”

This massive effort may be for just this regular season—but it could be for longer. There has still been no decision made on where Tampa Bay would play postseason games this year, and while the front office is generally operating under the assumption that the Rays will be back at Tropicana Field next season, that future is somewhat uncertain as well.

An assessment in November found that the St. Petersburg City Council could repair the Trop for roughly $56 million in time for 2026's opening day, but the Rays, who have been seeking public funding for a new ballpark for years, have voiced complaints that the plan would cover “only the bare minimum” and indicated that the stadium has sustained additional damage in the months it has remained without a roof.

Longer term, the outlook is even murkier. In September, the Rays announced an agreement with St. Petersburg and Pinellas County for a public contribution of roughly $600 million toward a $1.3 billion ballpark to replace Tropicana Field, which is now among MLB's oldest stadiums and widely considered one of the worst major pro sports venues in North America.

But after an offseason of sniping between the team and city and county officials—much of it ostensibly over delays in the process and potential cost overruns—the Rays withdrew from the project on March 13. It called to mind an earlier deal for a new stadium in the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa, which met a similar end in 2018 when Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg abruptly said the plan was no longer viable. (A year later, he made a bizarre proposal to split the season between the Tampa Bay area and Montreal.) In recent days, the Rays have floated the idea of a more significant Tropicana renovation that could extend the ballpark's lifespan by 10 years, although it was immediately met with skepticism by Mayor Ken Welch of St. Petersburg.

A permanent solution is clearly a priority for MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, who has publicly expressed support for keeping the Rays in the region while saying the team's stadium situation must be solved before the league can fulfill its goal of adding expansion franchises. Last week, the Athletic reported that Manfred and other team owners were pressuring Sternberg to sell the Rays.

It's one more hurdle for Tampa Bay's business executives, but few front offices have had as much practice dealing with adversity.

“We have a culture here of embracing opportunity through disruption,” Walsh says. “That's part of our culture and part of our DNA. The [2025 season] is perhaps a different scale and a different timeline, but the muscle memory for many of us remains similar, and it's just about finding opportunities through the differences.”

Tesla notified employees of an all-hands shortly before the event, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.

The company sent employees a link to a Teams chat and an X livestream on Thursday night with the message "Join the Company All Hands to hear about Tesla's recent achievements and how we're making the impossible possible."

The event was set to kick off at 9:30 p.m. ET.

Some workers expressed confusion about the event and the short notice for the company meeting, according to Teams messages viewed by BI. Typically, Tesla hosts all-hands during regular work hours, and it is the first all-hands the carmaker has streamed publicly.

"It feels a bit hasty. No one was expecting this tonight and we're all just trying to catch up," a Tesla engineer told BI, adding that some employees heard about the event on social media first and were questioning whether it was real.

Another worker told BI the event felt like a "publicity stunt."

"This is for the investors, not the workers," the employee said.

Adding to the confusion, Tesla posted a livestream link before the event was set to kick off, only to end the livestream and delete it about 30 minutes later. During the livestream, a man's voice could be heard saying several seemingly random things, including "Dylan on stage" and "Stock parts. Joe. That's the best I can do."Some workers said they tried to access the livestream but the link on X didn't work, as Tesla sent a link to a livestream that had been deleted.

Tesla restarted a new livestream shortly before 9:30 p.m. ET, but the livestream remained silent for nearly 30 minutes.

Elon Musk tweeted a link to the event at 9:45 p.m. ET.

The event began streaming at 9:58 p.m. and ended at 11:00 p.m. ET. Musk's private jet arrived in Austin just two hours before he addressed workers in the Texas Gigafactory.

Musk spent the first half of the hour-long call providing updates on Tesla, touching on the company's safety record, delivery figures, and its progress in autonomous driving and robotics.

He then spent the rest of the session taking questions from his employees.

Tesla has been facing headwinds in recent months. The carmaker's stock is down more than 37% year-to-date and a series of protests have erupted across Tesla sales and service centers over the past few weeks.

"If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?" Musk said on Thursday night.

"Listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable," he continued.

Musk also talked about Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions during the meeting, saying that self-driving will unlock the company's true value.

"It's very difficult for people in the stock market — especially those that look in the rear-view mirror, which is most people — to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness," Musk told his workers.

"So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'" Musk added.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is holding its first crypto regulation roundtable, focusing on defining the security status of crypto assets.

The event marks the beginning of a series of discussions by the SEC's newly formed crypto task force, which could have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.

According to CNBC's Tanaya Macheel, the SEC's efforts aim to provide clearer guidelines on whether certain crypto assets should be classified as securities, an issue that has created tension between the SEC and the crypto industry.

“The former administration's SEC targeted many companies for their involvement with crypto, alleging most coins were unregistered securities but failing to give clear guidelines to follow to avoid being targeted,” Macheel said.

Today's roundtable could also have implications for Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds. While the SEC recently stated that meme coins are not considered securities, the agency has yet to clarify its stance on staking services linked to crypto ETFs, a factor that could affect future growth in the market.

“The appetite for ETH ETFs has been tepid compared to Bitcoin ETFs, and one of the big reasons is the inability to earn a staking yield on those funds,” Macheel said. “If the SEC can iron out some of the uncertainties about those services being potential unregistered securities, it could change the outlook for ETH ETFs.”

Despite the regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stable in recent weeks. Macheel noted that Bitcoin is trading around its 200-day moving average near $84,000, which traders see as a key technical support level.

“If it can hold the 200-day, that's great,” she said. “Longer term, Ethereum to me is more peculiar. It's just been left for dead. There are some big short positions with hedge funds, but Bitcoin has clearly outperformed.”

Ethereum's underperformance relative to Bitcoin has been a notable trend. While Bitcoin has held steady, Ethereum has struggled to gain momentum despite increasing institutional interest in ETH-based financial products.

Macheel also pointed out that the broader crypto market has seen relatively subdued activity compared to other asset classes like gold.

“Gold broke $3,000 this year while Bitcoin's been sitting in the low $80,000 range,” she said. “Sometimes the most boring assets are the biggest winners.”

Investors are watching closely to see if the SEC's roundtable will provide clarity on staking and the broader regulatory framework for crypto assets. A more defined regulatory environment could pave the way for increased adoption and new financial products tied to crypto assets.

Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency “mixer” designed to make it more difficult to track cryptocurrency transactions, was sanctioned by the Biden administration and made illegal due to its usage in facilitating some significant laundering schemes. But Donald Trump, the crypto president, has brought it back. The United States Treasury Department announced Friday that it will lift sanctions against Tornado Cash, allowing it to be used again to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions.

Here's the quick and dirty back story on Tornado Cash: The protocol was launched in 2019 as a way for cryptocurrency users to obscure ownership over currency. You take “tainted” money (i.e., coins that have been identified and associated with a person), run it through Tornado Cash where it gets split up, mixed into a larger pool, and moved around until it is effectively “clean” and unidentifiable. By 2022, it was taking heat from the Department of the Treasury because it was allegedly used by malicious actors to launder cryptocurrency stolen as part of a hack.

Once Biden's Treasury Department got around to issuing its sanctions in August 2022, it accused Tornado Cash of laundering more than $7 billion, including nearly $500 million that the agency claimed had been stolen by the North Korean-sponsored hacking collective the Lazarus Group. By sanctioning the protocol and its founder, the Biden administration basically made it illegal to use Tornado Cash in the United States.

It seems, though, that the sanctions may not have been all that effective (and, according to a federal court, not all that legal). A study found that usage of Tornado Cash continued to climb despite its placement on the blacklist. And last year, a federal appeals court ruled that the Treasury overstepped its legal authority by sanctioning the protocol—an outcome that was arrived at because the blacklist is designed to punish foreign entities, and Tornado Cash, which runs autonomously via self-executing smart contracts, is not owned or operated by a foreign national.

This brings us to today, when the Trump administration is officially lifting the restrictions on Tornado Cash, allowing it to once again function in the United States. Crypto people are certainly celebrating the move, calling it a win for “privacy.”  Others, like Democratic Congressman Sean Casten, called it “one of the most dangerous and irresponsible things coming out of the Trump White House.”

Casten might be going a little hard there; typically, additional privacy is a good thing even if it means that some people might use it maliciously, like encrypted messaging. Of course, there's an argument that the average person has use for encrypted messaging and a crypto tumbler is basically only useful for criminal activity. But there's a world in which it doesn't really matter either way—tools for tracing on-chain activity, even those that go through efforts to hide the details, are becoming more sophisticated and some experts believe transactions on Tornado Cash are already traceable with enough effort.

According to Balaji (@balajis), Tornado Cash has been declared legal, suggesting a significant development in privacy-focused cryptocurrency trading platforms. The legal status could potentially lead to increased usage and confidence in privacy-centric crypto transactions, impacting market dynamics. This decision may influence traders who prioritize anonymity and could lead to a reassessment of risk management strategies in crypto trading portfolios.

Robbie Mitchnick isn't buying all the scepticism around Ethereum. 

It's true: When the crypto market surged following the election of Donald Trump as president last November, Ether was the only major cryptocurrency not to hit an all-time high. 

But Mitchnik, BlackRock's head of digital assets, said concern surrounding the Ethereum blockchain has been “overdone.”

“There's a lot to be optimistic about,” Mitchnick said Thursday at Blockworks' Digital Asset Summit in New York.

“When you look at our experience, take BUIDL as an example, there was no question that the blockchain that we would start our tokenisation on would be Ethereum.”

Mitchnik was referring to BUIDL, a tokenised treasuries product on Ethereum that topped $1 billion in assets under management last week.

It was a quiet win for the second most valuable blockchain network. 

And to hear Mitchnik tell it, Ethereum could notch another win should US regulators approve staked exchange-traded-funds.

BlackRock's influence shouldn't be underestimated. 

As the world's largest investment firm with $10 trillion in assets, the New York-based firm changed crypto investing when it cannonballed into the pool last January. 

That month, BlackRock, launched an exchange traded funds, or ETFs, for Bitcoin. In July, it launched its Ethereum ETF, ETHA. 

The company's Bitcoin ETF, with more than $51 billion net assets, helped usher in a new era for crypto investing. 

And BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been an avid booster of tokenisation, putting securities like stocks and bonds onchain. 

Yet Ethereum has been struggling in recent months.

The blockchain has been roiled by discontent among investors who bought its Ether cryptocurrency.

It has plunged further than Bitcoin amid a broader market slump triggered by Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policies. Ether was recently trading under $2,000 for the first time since November 2023.

That has prompted soul-searching among prominent Ethereum developers and calls for restructuring at the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit run by the blockchain's most prominent co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.

‘There's a bit of a misconception out there that ETH ETFs have been meh.'

BlackRock began its crypto experiment in 2020 with a private, company-run blockchain, according to Mitchnick.

“One of the very clear takeaways from that work was that public blockchains were actually where the future would be in this space. So we made a pretty decisive pivot,” he said.

“That decision appears to have been the right one.”

He also defended Ethereum ETFs, which have disappointed some investors in light of the record-setting debut of Bitcoin ETFs.

As of Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs were on track to record their first weekly gains since the beginning of February, according to analysts at JPMorgan. 

Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, had shed $84 million since Monday.

“There's a bit of a misconception out there that ETH ETFs have been meh,” Mitchnick said.

He added that ETHA saw $6 billion in inflows in its first six months. 

“The number of ETFs historically who have had more than that is a very short list,” he continued.

“But when you compare it to IBIT and the Bitcoin ETF complex generally, it doesn't look that amazing. When you compare it to the actual ETF universe, it's actually been incredibly successful.” 

Nevertheless, Ether ETFs would benefit immensely from adding staking, Mitchnick said.

Staking is an Ethereum feature that allows users to lock up their tokens in return for a modest annual yield. 

With the Ether backing ETHA and other ETFs sitting dormant, it could be staked to drive additional value to investors — if only regulators would let them.

In February, NYSE Arca filed a proposed rule change to allow the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Mini Trust — ETHE and EZET respectively — to stake their Ether holdings.

Industry advocates have pushed for staking in ETFs. 

They argue that “including staking as a feature in certain ETPs will benefit investors, more accurately reflect the benefits of native network assets.

It would also permit issuers to support the security of the networks in which the assets operate, according to a memorandum submitted by Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital to the SEC Crypto Task Force.

“There's obviously a next phase in the potential evolution of this,” Mitchnick said.

“There's no question it's less perfect for ETH today without staking. Staking yield is a meaningful part of how you can generate investment return in this space.”

 “If it's budget neutral and doesn't cost the taxpayer a dime, we'll see whatever creative ideas we can come up with,” said Hines. 

The Trump administration appears poised to grow its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after the White House's crypto council head suggested budget-neutral ways for acquiring the digital asset. 

“There's been countless ideas” about how the government can acquire more Bitcoin (BTC), Bo Hines, executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said in an interview with the Crypto in America podcast.

Perhaps the best way of doing so would be to realize the gains on the government's gold certificates, which are priced far less than bullion is actually worth today. 

“I'll actually point you to Senator [Cynthia] Lummis' Bitcoin Act of 2025, in which she believes that we can identify the real true value of some of these gold certificates,” Hines said. 

“If we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin,” he said.

As the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis explains, all gold certificates held at Fed banks are “computed at a statutory price of $42.22 per troy ounce.” By comparison, spot gold is currently valued at more than $3,000 an ounce.

Senator Cynthia Lummis' proposed BITCOIN Act of 2025 lists “Federal Reserve System gold certificates” as one source of funding for Bitcoin purchases. 

The bill requires that Fed banks “tender all outstanding gold certificates in their custody to the Treasury Secretary” so that the secretary can issue new certificates “that reflect the fair market value price of the gold held against such certificates by the Treasury.”

Hines said he's open to any ideas about how to grow the reserve, so long as it “doesn't cost the taxpayer a dime.” That's the crux of budget-neutral strategies for acquiring Bitcoin laid out in President Donald Trump's March 6 executive order. 

The US government currently holds roughly 207,000 BTC seized in criminal and civil proceedings. By default, this makes America the largest known Bitcoin holder among nation-states.

During the interview, Hines reiterated Bitcoin's special status, suggesting that the White House crypto council was treating the strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile very differently. 

“The reason we structured the [Strategic Bitcoin Reserve] the way we did is because Bitcoin is different. It's unique; it's a commodity, not a security,” said Hines, adding:

The White House rushed to defend Bitcoin's special status shortly after President Trump announced plans for a digital asset stockpile, which included a smattering of large-cap altcoins. Even Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that Bitcoin would be treated differently from the rest of the altcoins listed.

In addition to its Bitcoin acquisition targets, the Trump administration is making significant headway on cryptocurrency legislation through bipartisan cooperation. 

According to Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, Congress should be able to pass a stablecoin bill and crypto market structure bill this year.

 Strategy is exploring more ways to raise debt and equity to continue stacking Bitcoin as part of its corporate BTC treasury plan. 

Strategy has announced the pricing of its latest round of perpetual preferred stock, which the company does before announcing more Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions.

According to Strategy, the latest round of preferred stock will be sold at $85 per share, with a 10% coupon, and will bring the company approximately $711 million in revenue.

Market analyst Jesse Myers said that the annual 11.8% dividend distributed to investors from the latest offering suggests that Strategy can now siphon investors from the bond market, which only offers 4.2% interest.

Strategy's most recent BTC purchase occurred on March 17, when the company acquired 130 BTC, valued at roughly $10.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 499,226 BTC, valued at $41.8 billion.

The March 17 acquisition was the company's smallest purchase on record and followed a three-week break in buying. However, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has signaled that the company will raise more debt and sell more equity to fuel its accumulation of Bitcoin.

On March 10, Strategy announced it would periodically sell shares of its 8% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock as part of its plan to raise an additional $21 billion to buy more Bitcoin.

The company followed through on March 18 by announcing a tranche of 5 million shares in Series A perpetual preferred stock to raise additional capital.

Data from SaylorTracker shows the company is still up approximately 26% all-time on its investment and is sitting on over $8.6 billion in unrealized gains despite the recent market downturn.

However, shares of Strategy declined by over 26% in early March since their highest point in January 2025 and plummeted by over 44% since the all-time high of roughly $543 reached on Nov. 21.

Shares of Strategy are currently trading at around $299, up by 29% from the recent low of $231 recorded on March 11.

The company's inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, a weighted stock index that tracks the top 100 companies by market capitalization on the tech-focused stock exchange, injected fresh capital flows into the company but also exposed it to broader downturns in the tech market.

Major cryptocurrency Bitcoin BTCUSD may be on the verge of a substantial price collapse, according to popular technical analysis indicator Bollinger Bands. 

Represented by the 20-day moving average and deviations out of it - one up and one down - the indicator forms a sort of price range in which investors can estimate what the current bias for the asset is, - if it is oversold or overbought. 

And for Bitcoin, the Bollinger Bands paint quite a grim picture.TradingView">

Following all the price perturbations of late, the price of the biggest cryptocurrency found itself under the middle band on the daily price chart. It is all simple now for BTC to be honest; if the daily candle closes there, then the possibility of the price falling to a lower band increases. 

This may mean an almost 7% downward movement from current levels, right below $78,000 for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin BTCUSD price scenarios

If the price of the leading cryptocurrency manages to pull above the 20-day moving average, it will be a powerful signal about the bullish intentions of traders regarding BTC and will change the bias for Bitcoin to reach the upper band. That one is currently at $92,150 - up almost 10%.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves because, as history often teaches, price movements rarely happen in isolation, and a single indicator never tells the full story. There are market sentiment, macroeconomic context and liquidity levels. 

Short squeezes, unexpected news catalysts or even a sudden surge in retail buying could push Bitcoin back above the middle band, invalidating the bearish outlook entirely.

And yet, if BTC does slide below that lower band, well, it would not be the first time the market witnessed an aggressive downturn that sent leveraged traders scrambling to cover their positions. A cascade of liquidations? Not out of the question.

Strategy's robust fundraising highlights investor attraction to yield, but its Bitcoin strategy challenges liquidity.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, revealed that it secured over $700 million from a recent preferred stock offering designed to purchase more Bitcoin.

On March 21, the firm confirmed the sale of 8.5 million shares of its Series A Perpetual STRF Preferred Stock. Each share was priced at $85 and offered a 10% annual dividend.

Strategy's STRF aimed initially to raise $500 million, but it surpassed the target by over 40% by raising $711 million.

This latest issue does not allow conversion into common shares, unlike the company's previous STRK offering, which came with an 8% yield and conversion rights.

Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, pointed out that investor appetite for STRF was driven by fixed income rather than exposure to Strategy's volatile stock.

He noted that the higher yield and improved pricing terms contributed to the stronger response, which contributed to STRF raising more funds than STRK.

While the capital raise boosts Strategy's buying power, concerns about the company's ability to manage long-term obligations are growing.

Strategy holds over 499,000 BTC—worth over $40 billion—and has built its corporate identity around aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. However, its decision to avoid selling holdings has left the company with limited liquidity.

Bitwise pointed out that this situation has led to a drop in liquidity ratios. Its cash ratio has fallen from 2.10 in 2019 to just 0.11 in 2024.

However, Bitwise maintains that bankruptcy risk remains low. Even under a severe scenario—Bitcoin dropping to $30,000 by September 2027—the company would only need to liquidate about 7.3% of its Bitcoin to meet a $1.1 billion bond obligation.

Nevertheless, Bitwise has suggested new strategies to strengthen the firm's cash flow. One recommendation involves lending half of its Bitcoin at a 4% annual return, which could generate enough income to cover interest payments and dividends.

Another approach includes covered call options, a method already adopted by firms like Japan's Metaplanet.

Bitwise concluded that the recent implementation of FASB would allow Strategy to report its BTC holdings at their fair market value, which would:

“Enable the company to reflect its Bitcoin holdings more accurately, leading to a higher reported book value and more transparent financials. As a result, Strategy's earnings volatility will decrease, better aligning its financial statements with its long-term Bitcoin strategy.”

Popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple have formed different risky patterns ahead of the closely-watched triple-witching event. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has slipped to $83,580 from the weekly high of $87,158, while Ethereum (ETH) has dropped below $2,000. Ripple (XRP) has fallen from this week's high of $2.59 to $2.35.

A likely reason for this price action is that market participants are waiting for the quarterly triple-witching event on Wall Street. Triple witching is a day that happens on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. On this day, stock options, stock index futures, and index options expire simultaneously.

The upcoming triple-witching event will see options and futures contracts worth over $4.5 trillion expire. Historically, stocks and cryptocurrency prices experience heightened volatility ahead of, during, and after the witching event.

For example, Bitcoin price opened at $97,777 on the last triple-witching event on Dec. 20. It then crashed to $92,200 and ended the day at $97,000.

This quarter's triple witching event is happening as concerns about Donald Trump's tariffs have remained. It also comes two days after the Federal Reserve delivered a muted interest rate decision. While officials warned of stagflation, Jerome Powell noted that inflation would be transitory. The Fed also hinted that it would soon scale down its quantitative tightening policies.

There is a risk that the BTC price will drop ahead of or after the triple-witching event. It has formed a rising wedge pattern, comprising two ascending and converging trendlines. This pattern is on top of the double-top at $108,150 and the death cross that formed on March 14. These patterns point to further Bitcoin price downside, with the immediate target being at $76,890, its March low.

Ether has formed a triple-top pattern at $4,005, with a neckline at $2,140. A triple-top often leads to a strong bearish breakout, and in this case, it has dropped below the neckline. It also moved below the 50-week and 200-week moving averages, pointing to further downside, potentially to the psychological point at $1,500.

Meanwhile, XRP price is at risk of a breakdown even after the SEC ended the Ripple case. The main reason for this is that the coin has formed a head and shoulders pattern whose neckline is at $1.93, with the shoulders at $3. It failed to invalidate this pattern this week by moving above the shoulders level. Therefore, a move below the neckline at $2 risks it dropping to $1.

US President Donald Trump delivered a video address at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on Thursday (March 20), reaffirming his commitment to making the United States the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower” and the “crypto capital of the world.”

The three-minute pre-recorded speech marked the first time a sitting U.S. president addressed a cryptocurrency conference.

Trump sharply criticised the previous administration's policies, vowing to end what he called the “regulatory war on crypto” and halt “lawless” government crackdowns.

“We're ending the last administration's regulatory war on crypto and Bitcoin, and that includes stopping the lawless Operation Choke Point,” Trump said.

Operation Choke Point, a controversial initiative that allegedly sought to cut off banking services to crypto businesses, was a major point of contention in the industry.

“Operation Choke Point went beyond regulation, and I mean far beyond. Frankly, it was a disgrace. But as of January 2025, all of that is over,” he added.

Trump touted his administration's efforts to integrate Bitcoin into national policy, highlighting the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile.

“That same week, I signed an order creating the brand-new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will allow the federal government to maximize the value of its holdings instead of foolishly selling them for a fraction of their long-term value, which is exactly what Biden did.”

These initiatives aim to ensure that the US government retains and strategically manages Bitcoin holdings rather than liquidating them at low market prices.

Trump also urged Congress to pass new laws regulating stablecoins, which he believes could strengthen the US dollar's global dominance.

“With the right legal framework, institutions large and small will be liberated to invest, innovate, and take part in one of the most exciting technological revolutions in modern history.”

He argued that properly regulated, US dollar-backed stablecoins could bolster the dollar's position as the world's leading reserve currency.

Trump's stance represents a stark contrast to past regulatory uncertainty, positioning his administration as the most Bitcoin-friendly in US history.

“Together, we will make America the undisputed Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world,” Trump declared. “And it's going to be right here in the USA, the good old USA.”

Since taking office, Trump has signed several executive orders related to cryptocurrency, including:

HINDHEAD, United Kingdom, March  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, experts from SNXCrypto, a professional cryptocurrency platform, analyze the key drivers behind this growth and explore whether Bitcoin could reach $150,000 or even $200,000 in the near future. While some market analysts remain cautious, Bitcoin's bullish momentum suggests it could continue its upward trajectory.

The platform's analysts emphasizes on factors supporting a surge to 150,000 – 200,000



In addition, SNXCrypto enlists various factors driving Bitcoin's price surge, including;

The influx of institutional investors has played a significant role in Bitcoin's meteoric rise. Major corporations such as Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, reinforcing its status as "digital gold." Meanwhile, leading financial institutions have introduced Bitcoin investment products, enhancing its accessibility for mainstream investors.

Amid global economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin has emerged as a preferred store of value for investors seeking protection against currency devaluation. With central banks adopting expansionary monetary policies, Bitcoin's scarcity and decentralized nature make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets.

The cryptocurrency market has witnessed improved regulatory clarity, particularly with the approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in key financial markets. These developments have significantly lowered entry barriers for institutional and retail investors, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset.

Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins and its quadrennial halving events have historically led to long-term price appreciation. The 2024 Bitcoin halving has already reduced the issuance of new Bitcoin, creating a supply shock that could drive prices higher within the next 12 to 18 months.

Consequently, Bitcoin's extraordinary rise from $20,000 to $100,000 underscores its resilience and increasing relevance in the financial world. While market uncertainties persist, factors such as institutional adoption, supply constraints, and regulatory advancements suggest that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 or even $200,000 in the future.

Investors are advised to consider both bullish and bearish scenarios while staying informed about market dynamics. Regardless of price movements, Bitcoin's role as a decentralized digital asset remains a cornerstone of the evolving financial landscape.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto has been on a wild ride since President Donald Trump's presidential election win in November. Prices surged as investors got excited about the Trump administration's friendly approach toward digital currency. However, weak economic data and an intense market sell-off during the past month has spilled into the cryptocurrency sector, sending prices way down from recent highs.

Crypto has really only been around for a little more than 15 years, so the investment community still has a lot to learn about digital assets. But the sector has often traded in a fashion similar to high-flying tech stocks, so it can't be a complete surprise to see it sell off with the broader market.

Still, the perennial bull Michael Saylor, who co-founded Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, in 1989, and is still its executive chairman, recommends investors buy one top cryptocurrency that he thinks can soar 15,810% over time.

If you know who Saylor is and have been following him during the past five years, then you know that the token he is referring to is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. In 2020, when Strategy, which used to primarily be a data intelligence company, was struggling, Saylor chose to take most of the company's remaining cash and start purchasing hoards of the crypto. It hasn't stopped since and has seen its stock surge, along with Bitcoin's price.

Interestingly, Strategy's stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. The big reason is that the company has been able to tap the capital markets to access funding that it can use to purchase the crypto, essentially making it a levered play on the coin. Strategy now owns about 2% of all bitcoins outstanding.

Last year, Saylor made a bold call, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $13 million by 2045, which implies 15,810% upside from current prices (as of March 18). He said: "My long-term forecast is 21 years, 29% ARR (annual rate of return). Right now we're 60% ARR, it will decelerate toward 20% ARR over the next 21 years, and the volatility will decelerate."

Another reason Saylor thinks that Bitcoin can explode is that it makes up such a small fraction of global wealth (0.1% when it traded at $65,000). However, he sees this share increasing. At $13 million, Bitcoin would make up 7% of global wealth, which he views as a plausible scenario.

Like many other Bitcoin bulls, Saylor also believes the Trump administration is a huge catalyst for the sector. So far, the administration has taken a much more pro-crypto approach than former President Joe Biden's administration. Trump has placed pro-crypto officials in his cabinet and has pro-crypto advisors. We've already seen the Securities and Exchange Commission put its lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance on hold and move to drop a lawsuit against Coinbase.

Trump also issued an executive order to create a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. Although most of the tokens that will go into these stockpiles will come from cryptocurrencies seized by the Treasury Department, the Bitcoin reserve will be able to buy additional coins, as long as the purchases are at no cost to the American taxpayers and are budget-neutral.

While Bitcoin has fallen from a peak of more than $109,000 this year into the low $80,000s as of this writing, Saylor has held firm. In late February, he wrote on X, "Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin." Strategy has also continued to buy more Bitcoin and is looking to raise more capital to buy still more.

Will it hit $13 million? It's impossible to know. Although Saylor has been right during the past five years and continued to buy Bitcoin as its price has soared, his thesis looks like napkin math at best. That's not to say that it won't continue to climb. I am bullish long term on the digital coin because of its potential to hedge inflation with its finite supply of 21 million tokens.

However, as I mentioned above, it's not only a fairly new asset but also extremely volatile, so while I think it's a good asset to have exposure to, I see no reason to be as aggressive as Saylor and Strategy.

Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes around $84,000 at the time of writing on Friday after recovering nearly 2% so far this week. The recent announcement by the United States (US) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining rewards are not securities could boost BTC investors' confidence. 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision to keep interest rates unchanged and maintain its rate cut forecast for the year, along with a net inflow of $661.20 million from the US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), have supported Bitcoin's mild recovery this week.

The US SEC announced on Thursday that the PoW mining rewards are not securities. The statement revealed that both solo mining and mining pools do not fall under US securities laws as they do not require the efforts of a central entity or entrepreneurial figure to generate profits.

This announcement provides Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with regulatory clarity, reduces legal risks, boosts investor and miner confidence, reinforces its commodity status, and could potentially drive price and market growth.

JUST IN:  SEC confirms Bitcoin & crypto mining does not violate securities laws.

This week, the institutional demand for Bitcoin showed signs of recovery. According to Coinglass data, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $661.20 million until Thursday, halting the sell-off seen over the past weeks. Bitcoin's price could recover further if this inflow continues and intensifies, indicating a reduction in sell-side pressure.

Bitcoin's price recovered nearly 5% on Wednesday, reaching a high of $87,000, bolstered by the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged and maintain its rate cut forecast for the year. 

However, Fed officials trimmed their growth forecast for the year amid the growing uncertainty over the impact of US President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies on economic activity. Since February, President Trump has imposed a flat 25% duty on steel and aluminum and threatened to impose reciprocal and sectoral tariffs taking effect on April 2, fueling worries about a global trade war. 

On the same day, Donald Trump posted on the Truth Social platform, calling on the Fed to lower interest rates as tariffs start to hurt the economy.

Trump posted: “ The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!”



In addition to supporting macroeconomic data this week, global uncertainty also eases slightly. Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in the Ukraine war. 

Moreover, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Trump agreed to work together to end the protracted Russia-Ukraine war, further boosting investors' confidence toward risky assets like Bitcoin.

However, traders should also keep an eye on the rising tension in Gaza. The Israeli military said that it launched a limited ground incursion into Gaza a day after an aerial bombardment of the Strip that shattered the two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas. Moreover, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of fierce war expansion, which could hinder investors' confidence and lead to a risk-off sentiment in the crypto market.

The Blockworks Digital Asset Summit on Thursday made history as the first sitting US President, Donald Trump, spoke at the event. During his speech, Trump called for US dollar dominance and vowed to make America a crypto superpower.

In an exclusive interview ahead of the summit, Bitfinex Analysts told FXStreet, “President Donald Trump's address at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City marks a significant milestone, as it will be the first time a sitting US president has spoken at a cryptocurrency conference.”

The analyst continued, “Historically, political endorsements have influenced Bitcoin's market dynamics. For instance, following President Trump's announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve, Bitcoin experienced a 7.2% surge intra-day. Similarly, his re-election in 2024, accompanied by pro-crypto sentiments, propelled Bitcoin to surpass the $100,000 mark.”

“Broader macroeconomic factors, such as trade policies and ongoing tariff negotiations, will play a far more significant role in shaping the long-term impact on digital asset markets. While Blockworks' involvement suggests a well-organized media event, the fundamental outlook for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remains unchanged,” Bitfinex Analysts told FXStreet.

Moreover, the US SEC's Crypto Task Force holds the first-ever roundtable on crypto asset regulation on Friday. This roundtable aims to discuss regulatory approaches for crypto assets, building on the SEC's efforts to foster innovation while protecting investors. The roundtable will also be open to the public.

Bitcoin's price broke and closed above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on Wednesday, reaching a high of $87,000 that day. However, it failed to find support and declined 3% on Thursday, closing below it. At the time of writing on Friday, it continues to edge lower, around $84,000.

If BTC continues its correction, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $78,258.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 45 after being rejected from its neutral level of 50 on Wednesday, indicating rising bearish momentum. If the RSI continues to slide, Bitcoin's price could fall sharply.

However, if BTC recovers, breaks, and finds support around the 200-day EMA at $85,508, it could extend the recovery to retest its key psychological level of $90,000.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Tokyo-listed Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has appointed Eric Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump, to its newly formed Strategic Board of Advisors.

Metaplanet announced Trump's appointment on March 21, confirming that he will join as the first official member of the new advisory board. The board aims to unite influential voices committed to advancing financial innovation and Bitcoin adoption.

The company stated that this move reflects its dedication to building a top-tier advisory team. Trump brings experience across multiple industries and has become increasingly vocal about Bitcoin and digital assets.

Metaplanet described him as a strong advocate for Bitcoin adoption and a valuable addition to its strategic direction. It added:

“Eric Trump brings a wealth of experience in real estate, finance, brand development, and strategic business growth and has become a leading voice and advocate of digital asset adoption worldwide.”

Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet's Director, expressed optimism about the appointment. He noted that Trump's global business insight and engagement with the Bitcoin community will help accelerate the company's vision of becoming a world-leading BTC treasury firm.

According to Google Finance, the news sparked investor interest, pushing Metaplanet's stock up by over 17% to ¥4,730.

Eric Trump's appointment appears to signal a deliberate step in Metaplanet's international growth strategy.

After listing its shares on the OTCQX in December, the firm has worked to expand global visibility and attract US investors.

Considering this, Trump's son's presence on Metaplanet's board could help boost the firm's appeal among American investors, especially as it positions itself as an emerging alternative to Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy).

Eric Trump has taken a more public role in the crypto space. He is connected to World Liberty Financial, a family-backed digital asset venture. Earlier this month, he endorsed his father's pro-crypto policy and expressed support for both Bitcoin and Ethereum on social platform X.

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Businesses can benefit from implementing cryptocurrency in their blockchain applications in several ways:

Overall, implementing cryptocurrency in blockchain applications can provide businesses with cost savings, efficiency improvements, security enhancements, and access to new markets, making it a valuable addition to their operations.

Cryptocurrency development faces several challenges and risks, primarily related to security, scalability, regulatory compliance, and community acceptance. Security is a major concern, as cryptocurrencies are often targeted by hackers due to the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions.

Ensuring the robustness of the underlying blockchain technology and implementing strong security measures is crucial to protect against theft and fraud. Scalability is another challenge, as blockchain networks must be able to handle a high volume of transactions to be viable for mainstream use. Developing solutions that can increase transaction throughput without compromising decentralisation or security is a significant technical challenge.

Additionally, navigating the complex regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies poses risks for developers, as regulatory changes can impact the legality and viability of their projects. Finally, gaining acceptance and adoption from the broader community is essential for the success of a cryptocurrency, and developers must work to build trust and confidence among users, investors, and regulators alike.

Future trends in cryptocurrency development are expected to focus on improving scalability, interoperability, and privacy while enhancing user experience and regulatory compliance. Scalability solutions, such as sharding, layer 2 protocols, and novel consensus mechanisms, will likely be further developed to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees.

Interoperability efforts will aim to create seamless connections between different blockchain networks, enabling the transfer of assets and data across platforms. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and protocols will continue to evolve to address concerns over data protection and anonymity.

User experience enhancements, including easier wallet management and intuitive interfaces, will be prioritised to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the general public. Additionally, regulatory compliance tools and standards will be developed to ensure that cryptocurrencies can coexist with existing financial systems and meet regulatory requirements.

Overall, future trends in cryptocurrency development are expected to drive innovation and adoption, making cryptocurrencies more efficient, secure, and user-friendly.

In conclusion, cryptocurrency development is essential for blockchain applications as it underpins their core functionalities and value propositions. Cryptocurrencies serve as the lifeblood of decentralised ecosystems, enabling secure and efficient peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. By integrating cryptocurrencies, blockchain applications can achieve greater transparency, immutability, and decentralisation, key characteristics that set them apart from traditional systems.

Additionally, cryptocurrency development company enables the creation of custom tokens, which can represent various assets, rights, or utilities within a blockchain network, opening up new possibilities for decentralised applications and smart contracts. Moreover, cryptocurrencies incentivise network participants, such as miners or validators, through rewards or transaction fees, ensuring the security and integrity of the network.

Overall, cryptocurrency development is not only essential for the technical functioning of blockchain applications but also for driving innovation, enabling new business models, and fostering the growth of decentralised ecosystems

Bitcoin (BTC) and other major tokens lost more than 3% as Thursday's rally was met with profit-taking during Asian morning hours Friday — in line with expectations.

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.2% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding from $86,000 to under $84,000, ether (ETH) dropping below $2,000 and Solana's SOL falling 5%.

XRP showed steady declines bringing Wednesday's 10% spike to a 4.8% gain over a weekly basis, while BNB Chain's BNB continued to edge higher, bringing weekly gains to over 8%. 

At press time, Tron's TRX and TON were the only major tokens in the green, rising 2% each. 

TRX was floated on Solana for the first time ever on late Thursday in an attempt to expand its user base. TON saw retail demand after the Toncoin Foundation said that venture capital firms now hold over $400 million worth of the asset after fresh investments.

Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting delivered a brief upside catalyst markets had been waiting for, propelling BTC past $85,000 as no rate cuts were announced. 

However, the Fed said it would scale back its “quantitative tightening” program starting in April which traders likely interpreted as an indirect rate cut, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Telegram broadcast. Options markets have started to position accordingly.

“The chance of BTC reaching above $100K by June 30 has increased from 20% to nearly 30% in the last 24 hours,” Dr. Sean Dawson, head of research at onchain options platform derive.xyz, told CoinDesk in an email. 

“While the probability of ETH remaining above $2000 by June 30 is now a coin flip – was 40% 24 hours ago. Nearly 60% of ETH options traded on Derive.xyz in the last 24 hours were calls bought, indicating a bullish sentiment. For BTC, 34% of all volume was bought, reflecting demand for downside protection,” Dawson added.

FxPro's Alex Kuptsikevich, who eyes the $80,000 support level as a critical area to watch for a break of support, maintained a cautious tone.

“It's important to note that the crypto market has yet to break above its 200-day moving average, currently sitting close to $2.9 trillion. A strong rally above this level could trigger an active buying phase, but there's also a risk of bears setting up a trap, as they've done several times before,” Kuptsikevich said in a Telegram message.

“For bitcoin to maintain momentum, staying above this key level is crucial. If it does, it could spark renewed interest in buying a variety of coins that have been in a correction phase for a while,” he added, referring to broader altcoin and memecoin markets.

Macro guru and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal is leaning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) as the flagship crypto asset hovers around 22% below the all-time high reached in January.

Pal tells his 219,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that the “next part of the year” will be “very strong” for Bitcoin.

According to the macro guru, Bitcoin's future price action is likely to mirror the bullish cycle that occurred after the second halving.

“2017, those of you who remember was an amazing year. And I think we'll see something very similar. Bitcoin priced in those financial conditions which were leading by three months. Bitcoin's already priced it all in. So it's the worst news is in. My guess, probably up only.”

On the timelines for a bullish reversal for Bitcoin, Pal says,

“Basically, we're turning the corner and we should start to see higher prices. And the higher prices will come quick. And the higher prices should take us all the way back to the highs pretty soon. Not soon like in a week or two, but soon like in a couple of months.

So I think what you've all had to go through is a boring sideways consolidation pattern, with a slight down-bias.

Your altcoins have been nuked, but nothing out of the ordinary. We saw this in 2017, we've seen it now and we are very very close to the turnaround.”

According to the macro guru, the crypto market's bullish cycle is still at an early stage.

“We've barely started the cycle. So I know we all say it's so early, nothing's really happened yet. It hasn't. We had phase one of the banana zone, which was the breakout of that consolidation range. This is the consolidation phase two, then we will get into the much more important banana zone phase two. It is all coming.”

A banana zone is a phase in the crypto markets where there are parabolic price moves that present opportunities for out-sized gains, according to Pal.

Bitcoin is trading at $85,201 at time of writing.

TradingKey - On March 2, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump fulfilled a campaign promise by announcing the inclusion of five cryptocurrencies in a "Cryptocurrency Strategic Reserve," aiming to make the U.S. the "World Crypto Capital." The announcement triggered a surge in the prices of the respective virtual currencies and quickly garnered global attention.

This article delves into the meaning, value, risks, and future trends of cryptocurrency strategic reserves, helping you better understand the potential impact and opportunities in this emerging field.

A cryptocurrency strategic reserve refers to the proactive accumulation and storage of cryptocurrencies by governments or corporations to achieve specific goals or respond to emergencies. Similar to oil reserves, gold reserves, and foreign exchange reserves, cryptocurrency reserves are a form of contingency funds, typically held long-term unless specific conditions are met.

Both governments and corporations prioritize Bitcoin (BTC) as the primary strategic reserve asset, followed by Ethereum (ETH) and other leading altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Ripple  (XRP), and Cardano (ADA).

With the rapid development of the cryptocurrency market, an increasing number of countries and corporations are considering integrating cryptocurrencies into their official reserve assets. The motivations for establishing a cryptocurrency strategic reserve are varied, encompassing financial security, technological innovation, and international competitiveness.

Enhancing International Competitiveness

In the digital economy era, establishing a cryptocurrency strategic reserve can provide a competitive advantage in the global financial transformation, enhancing a nation's international influence. Cryptocurrencies can also be used as tools for cross-border payments and settlements, improving efficiency and reducing transaction costs.  

Addressing Global Economic Uncertainty

During economic crises or financial market turbulence, cryptocurrencies may serve  as safe-haven assets, helping stabilize financial systems. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin was widely regarded as "digital gold" by investors to hedge against market volatility. Additionally, cryptocurrencies' low correlation with traditional assets—such as stocks, bonds, and gold— makes them a valuable diversification tool for reducing portfolio risk.  

Promoting Financial Security and Innovation

For nations or corporations facing international sanctions, cryptocurrencies can act as a hedge, helping to ensure the free flow of funds. Establishing cryptocurrency reserves can also stimulate the development and application of blockchain technology, support digital economy infrastructure, and improve the overall efficiency of financial systems.

While these reasons align with the strategic goals of many nations or corporations, the United States—as the world's largest economy—is taking a particularly aggressive stance in cryptocurrency reserves, aiming to consolidate the dominance of the U.S. dollar and establish itself as the global crypto hub.

While cryptocurrency strategic reserves offer numerous advantages, they also pose risks and challenges—primarily related to liquidity, security, and technology:

Risk Type

Description

Volatility

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, with prices capable of significant short-term fluctuations.

Security 

The security of crypto asset storage and transactions remains a major challenge. Hacks, scams, or system failures can lead to losses.

Technology

Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, which is still evolving. Technical flaws, consensus mechanism issues, or software vulnerabilities could impact asset security and effectiveness.

The United States and El Salvador are currently the most committed nations to establishing cryptocurrency strategic reserves.On November 17, 2022, El Salvador launched its "Daily Bitcoin Purchase" plan and has since accumulated 6,120 BTC. The U.S., although a latecomer, has made rapid progress. In July 2024, Trump proposed a Bitcoin strategic reserve during his campaign, and by March 2025, he announced the inclusion of BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, and SOL in the reserve, converting 207,000 confiscated Bitcoins into reserve assets.

Following the U.S. lead government officials and politicians in Japan, Russia, Brazil, and Poland have also proposed establishing Bitcoin or cryptocurrency reserves.At the corporate level,, institutions such as Strategy (MSTR), Tesla (TSLA), Block.one, and CoinShares have continued to hold or increase their Bitcoin positions.

Notably, although China has not officially declared a Bitcoin strategic reserve, it holds nearly 194,000 BTC, making it the second-largest national holder after the U.S.However, the Bank of China has stated that it is not yet appropriate to include cryptocurrencies in the country's official reserve assets.

While the primary actors in cryptocurrency strategic reserves are nations and corporations, their transactions take place within the broader crypto market—inevitably impacting market perception, liquidity, and prices, and in turn influencing investor decisions and potential returns.

Specific Impact

Recognition

Inclusion in strategic reserves enhances the legitimacy and recognition of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. 

Liquidity 

Large-scale purchases increase market liquidity.  

Volatility

Long-term holding characteristics may reduce short-term speculation, stabilizing the market. 

Price

Large-scale purchases can alter supply-demand dynamics, driving up cryptocurrency prices.

Competition 

Increased institutional participation may intensify market competition, driving innovation and application expansion.

While the impact on investors is largely positive, potential downsides include excessive speculation leading to market bubbles and fewer opportunities for short-term traders. Therefore, it is essential to objectively both the benefits and risks of cryptocurrency strategic reserves.

Prior to the U.S. initiative, cryptocurrency strategic reserves were often dismissed as a pipe dream or even a joke—with El Salvador frequently cited as an outlier. However, President Trump's proposal and gradual implementation of a national cryptocurrency strategic reserve have turned the concept into a global focal point. This is only the beginning, with far greater developments likely on the horizon.

Regulatory Framework Development

To ensure the legality and stability of cryptocurrency reserves, governments are expected to gradually establish standardized policies and regulations. The Trump administration has begun rolling back many of the restrictive measures from the Biden era, shifting toward more lenient and crypto-friendly policies. On March 20, 2025, Trump also called for Congress to pass stablecoin legislation.  

Technological and Security Upgrades

To mitigate risks of theft or loss, more secure digital wallets and reserve management systems will be essential—driving advancements in blockchain technology and cybersecurity. Future reserves are also expected to prioritize cross-chain interoperability, enabling seamless transactions between different blockchain networks. Multi-chain architectures may become the norm, allowing governments and institutions to diversify reserve assets across various platforms.  

Global Acceleration

As cryptocurrency applications expands, more nations and corporations may adopt incorporate digital assets into their strategic reserves to enhance financial flexibility and reduce reliance on traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro. For countries facing foreign exchange shortages or economic sanctions—such as Russia and Iran—cryptocurrency reserves could offer a crucial tool to circumvent traditional financial systems.  

Asset Diversification

 As the cryptocurrency market matures, investors may increasingly seek diversified asset allocations, expanding beyond Bitcoin into altcoins, stablecoins, and emerging digital currencies.

The rise of cryptocurrency strategic reserves marks a profound transformation in the global financial landscape. The United States' pioneering move to integrate cryptocurrencies into its national reserves reflects both a forward-looking embrace of emerging technologies and a strategic effort to reinforce its financial dominance amid potential shifts in the global monetary system. Other nations—motivated by concerns over U.S. dollar hegemony or recognition of cryptocurrency potential—may gradually follow suit.

Whether cryptocurrency strategic reserves become the norm will depend on market development, regulatory clarity, and the broader evolution of the international financial order. Regardless, this financial chapter has already begun, and its impact is poised to be both far-reaching and enduring.

Grand Prairie, Texas — Joseph Buentello, 80, was cruising through retirement when he received a call erroneously claiming his son was in jail.

"I was scared, I hit the panic button and I let my panic take control of my good judgment," Buentello, of Grand Prairie, Texas, told CBS News. 

The caller told Buentello that if he wanted to get his son out, he needed to rush to his local grocery store and send $5,000 through a bitcoin ATM. 

 Buentello said he never even thought about calling his son first.

 "They said there is nothing we can do about it," said Buentello the ATM operator told him after he was scammed. "That money has already been distributed. They said it was distributed the minute you got through putting your money in there."

That is why, Buentello learned, the cryptocurrency scammers wanted him to use that machine. Often found inside convenience stores, Bitcoin ATMs resemble regular ATMs and provide a legitimate and straightforward method to convert cash into cryptocurrency.  

According to data from the Federal Trade Commission, between 2020 to 2023, consumer losses in bitcoin ATM scams skyrocketed nearly tenfold, from $12 million annually in 2020 to $114 million annually in 2023. During that timeframe, consumers over the age of 60 were more than three times more likely than younger adults to lose money to bitcoin scams, the FTC found. 

And getting the money back has been tough.

When McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara first joined law enforcement back in 1970, he said the biggest thieves in the Texas county were bank robbers.

"Take a gun, go rob a bank, get the money, and we'd go after 'em," McNamara said. "But this is a totally different deal now."

A couple of years ago, after a caller scammed an 83-year-old woman in Waco, Texas, into depositing $15,000 into a bitcoin ATM, McNamara's deputies pulled the cash right out of the machine and returned it to her.

The bitcoin ATM operator then sued the county, claiming the seizure was unlawful, but the lawsuit was eventually dismissed and the woman was allowed to keep the money. 

 However, the lawsuit was dismissed only after the county admitted that the funds were seized "in error."

McNamara doesn't regret how the situation was handled. 

"I don't regret it at all," McNamara said. "We got the lady's money back. It should have gone back to her."

Bitcoin ATM operators told CBS News that they take extensive measures to protect users from fraud, including displaying up to six screens alerting customers to potential scams.

In recent years, a handful of states, including California, Vermont and Minnesota passed laws regulating Bitcoin ATMs. However, most of the country, including Texas, has no regulations.  

 "I feel like such a fool," Buentello said. 

Had there been any sort of refund policy in place when he made his transaction, Buentello believes could have saved his money and avoided the scam. 

According to the FTC, scammers will often offer an urgent reason for the victim to withdraw cash from their bank account and deposit it in a bitcoin ATM. They will provide a QR code that victims can scan, which deposits the money directly into the scammers' crypto account.

Some tips from the FTC to avoid being scammed include never clinking on unknown links or responding directly to unexpected calls or unknown text messages. Scammers will be trying to rush you, so you should slow down and consult with someone you trust. And never withdraw cash in response to an unexpected call or message.

A new artificial intelligence (AI)-driven weather prediction system could transform forecasting, researchers predict

The system, dubbed Aardvark Weather, generates forecasts tens of times faster than traditional forecasting systems using a fraction of the computing power, researchers reported Thursday (March 20) in the journal Nature.

"The weather forecasting systems we all rely on have been developed over decades, but in just 18 months, we've been able to build something that's competitive with the best of these systems, using just a tenth of the data on a desktop computer," Richard Turner, an engineer at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, said in a statement.

Current weather forecasts are generated by inputting data into complex physics models, a multi-stage process that requires several hours on a dedicated supercomputer.

Aardvark Weather circumvents this demanding process: the machine learning model uses raw data from satellites, weather stations, ships and weather balloons to make its predictions without relying on atmospheric models. Satellite data are particularly important for the model's predictions, the team noted.

This new approach could offer major advantages in terms of cost, speed and accuracy of weather forecasts, the researchers claimed. Instead of requiring a supercomputer and a dedicated team, Aardvark Weather can generate a forecast on a desktop computer in just a few minutes.

The team compared Aardvark's performance to existing forecasting systems that generate global predictions. Using just 8% of the observational data that traditional forecasting systems need, Aardvark outperformed the U.S. national Global Forecast System (GFS)system and was comparable to forecasts made by the United States Weather Service.

However, Aardvark's spatial resolution is somewhat lower than those of current forecasting systems, which could make its initial predictions less relevant for hyper-local weather forecasting. Aardvark Weather operates at 1.5-degree resolution, meaning each box in its grid covers 1.5 degrees of latitude and 1.5 degrees of longitude. For comparison, the GFS uses a 0.25-degree grid.

However, the researchers also said that because the AI learns from the data it is fed, it could be tailored to predict weather in specific arenas — such as temperatures for African agriculture or wind speeds for renewable energy in Europe. Aardvark can incorporate higher-resolution regional data, where they exist, to refine local forecasts.

"These results are just the beginning of what Aardvark can achieve," study coauthor Anna Allen, of the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. "This end-to-end learning approach can be easily applied to other weather forecasting problems, for example hurricanes, wildfires, and tornadoes. Beyond weather, its applications extend to broader Earth system forecasting, including air quality, ocean dynamics, and sea ice prediction."

Aardvark could also support forecasting centers in areas of the world that lack the resources to refine global forecasts into high-resolution regional predictions, the researchers said.

"Aardvark's breakthrough is not just about speed, it's about access," Scott Hosking, an AI researcher at The Alan Turing Institute in the U.K., said in the statement. "By shifting weather prediction from supercomputers to desktop computers, we can democratize forecasting, making these powerful technologies available to developing nations and data-sparse regions around the world."

	Common coot nests preserve layers of plastic dating back decades

Biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra excavates a common coot nest he and colleagues collected in Amsterdam. City birds have been making their nests out of plastic waste for decades, the team's research shows.

One man's trash is a common coot's treasure, at least when it comes to plastic.

In Amsterdam, the birds have been constructing nests out of plastic food wrappers, masks and other waste for at least 30 years, researchers report in the February Ecology. The revelation shows not only how much plastic now litters the environment but also the power of using human-made products to learn about the natural world.

“It's ironic to think that many of these plastic single-use items have just been used for minutes by people, yet these coots have used them for decades,” says Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands.

Hiemstra has been studying nesting materials used by city birds for years. He's documented coots adding face masks to their nests during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — a building material that coots and other birds still use — and found rebellious magpies and crows that built their homes out of antibird spikes. Many birds these days use human trash as nest-building material, Hiemstra says.

In 2021, Hiemstra and colleagues excavated a common coot (Fulica atra) nest built on a wooden beam poking out of Rokin canal in Amsterdam. The nest had multiple layers of plastic waste, especially food packages. By analyzing the expiration dates on the coots' collection, Hiemstra used the plastic the way an archaeologist would use fossils, to build a history of the nest layer by layer.

Coots typically build their nests out of plant material that quickly decays, so the birds can't reuse nests year after year. With the incorporation of plastics, however, the nests become much more stable, so the coots can return to old nests and build upon their solid foundations.

In total, Hiemstra's team found 15 nests that had plastic dating to multiple years, indicating the birds had been reusing them.

Using expiration dates to understand nest history can be imprecise. Since plastic lasts so long, old pieces of it can find their way into recent nest layers. For instance, Hiemstra found a bag of paprika chips from a 1970s brand toward the top of one nest. But when packages with similar expirations are bunched together, Hiemstra says, it builds confidence that that part of the nest was constructed around that time.

In the deepest part of the Rokin nest, he found several wrappers dating to the early 1990s, including a Mars Bar wrapper promoting the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

“Weirdly enough, the wrapper is in pristine condition, as if it were littered yesterday,” Hiemstra says. “Yet you know it is 30 years old. It really shows plastic is here to stay.”

There have been hundreds of measles cases reported in the U.S. since the beginning of the year. Here's what you need to know about measles immunity.

Hundreds of people have caught measles in the United States this year, with the majority of the cases tied to outbreaks of the disease. So far, Texas has been the hardest hit, with the highest number of reported illnesses.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 301 people in the U.S. have had confirmed measles infections this year, as of March 13. Additional, probable cases have been reported by various states, but they've yet to be independently confirmed by the CDC.

Kids under 5 years old account for 34% of the confirmed measles cases, with a further 42% affecting children and teens ages 5 to 19. In total, 17% of the cases have resulted in hospitalization.

There has been one confirmed death related to the outbreaks, and a second remains under investigation. The first fatal case was in an unvaccinated school-age child in Texas, marking the first death from measles in the U.S. since 2015. The second deadly case was reported in a New Mexico resident by local health authorities, but the CDC has yet to conclude its own investigation of the case, which would help confirm its connection to ongoing outbreaks.

The vast majority of the confirmed measles infections — 95% — have been in people who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most of the infections have been reported in Texas, with data from the Texas Department of State Health Services showing that 279 measles cases were identified between late January and March 18.

Experts say the Texas outbreak is likely related to low rates of vaccination in the state. For instance, data suggest that around 18% of school-age children in Gaines County have been exempted from at least one vaccine, and 191 measles cases have occurred in that county so far. Meanwhile, Gaines' neighboring counties of Dawson, Yoakum, Terry and Martin have reported 11, 11, 36 and 3 cases, respectively.

As measles continues to spread, here's what to know about the protection of the measles vaccine, how long it lasts, and how to know if you're immune to the disease.

Measles can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella; or the MMRV vaccine, which additionally protects against the chickenpox-causing varicella virus. The CDC recommends that children receive their first dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine between the ages of 12 and 15 months and their second dose between 4 and 6 years old.

(For measles protection, the MMR vaccine is generally recommended over the MMRV vaccine, because it's less likely to trigger fevers in children. For those who get the MMR shot, a separate vaccine is recommended to protect against chickenpox (varicella).)

Unvaccinated older children and adults are also advised to receive two doses of a measles vaccine, at least 28 days apart.

One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are 97% effective, according to the CDC. The MMRV vaccine offers the same level of measles protection.

"It's probably one of the best vaccines that we have," Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton in the U.K., told Live Science in an email.

"For example, the COVID-19 vaccines are very good at reducing mortality, but less good at preventing a mild COVID-19 infection," Head said. The measles vaccine is highly protective against measles infections of all severity levels.

Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 thanks to widespread vaccination against the disease. The CDC defines "elimination" as the "absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area." Measles is not yet "eradicated" worldwide, meaning it still spreads regularly in other countries and can be imported to the U.S.



The MMR vaccine provides long-lasting measles protection for most people, with immunity typically being lifelong after two doses, according to the CDC. However, one 2024 study published in the journal The Lancet Public Health reported that measles immunity does fade slightly over time.

"Like with COVID vaccines, antibody levels do reduce over time," Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science via email. Antibodies are protective immune proteins that appear in the days and weeks after a person receives a vaccine, but these proteins are expected to disappear over time.

"However there is likely continued immunity with memory immune cells that can be activated as needed (as we have seen in COVID vaccines)," Chin-Hong added. When exposed to the measles vaccine, the body generates "memory" cells in the immune system, which can quickly mount an immune response and make new antibodies if a person encounters the measles virus.

"In general, protection once immunized against measles, wanes very little," Chin-Hong said. The Lancet study suggested that, on average, measles immunity waned by about 0.039% per year after the age of 5.

Yes, if a person survives a bout of measles infection, they typically have lifelong immunity against the virus. However, even as the immune system mounts a powerful response against measles, its guard against other infections gets lowered.

Many studies find that measles infections induce a kind of "immune amnesia," in which memory cells tasked with remembering pathogens are lost and the body is unable to rev up its antibody responses, as it used to. This leaves a person at increased risk of other infections for years following their brush with measles.

Other complications of measles infection include a rare but deadly central nervous system condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which can develop seven to 10 years after the infection. Some people can also experience brain swelling (encephalitis) during a measles infection, which can cause convulsions, permanent hearing loss and intellectual disability.

The measles vaccine provides lifelong immunity against the virus without these dangerous complications associated with measles infection.

If you've received two doses of the MMR vaccine, you're considered immune for life in most cases. Additionally, if you've had a confirmed case of measles in the past, you're likely immune for life.

If someone is still unsure whether they've either been vaccinated or had the disease, there's a test that checks for measles-specific antibodies in your blood. The type of measles antibody it screens for belongs to a broad class called immunoglobulin G (IgG), which protects the body from infection by binding to pathogens.

If enough measles-specific IgG antibodies are present, compared to a standard threshold, a person has immunity.

"You can check an antibody level with the help of a health care provider," Chin-Hong said. The test will give you a number back that's called a "titer"; this is a measure of your antibody levels. However, the test will not pick up memory cells, Chin-Hong said, so it could miss that additional layer of evidence that you're immune to measles.



If a person is unsure about how protected they are against measles, they can get a booster shot of the vaccine to bolster their immunity.

"It is perfectly safe to have another dose," Head said. "The recommendation to get an extra dose will typically come from public health teams, and it's always best to see the advice of a healthcare worker if anyone is unsure."

If someone has had two doses of the measles vaccine in their lifetime, there is likely no need for a booster shot. The exception is a group of people who received the measles vaccine in the 1960s, who would need an additional MMR vaccine to ensure their protection.

That's because the measles vaccine used in the U.S. between 1963 and 1967 was less effective than modern measles vaccines. Unlike the current shots, which contain live-but-weakened viruses, the old shot contained an inactivated virus, so it was completely "killed." In response to the old vaccine, the immune system did not develop long-lasting memory cells, unlike the vaccines used today. Many people who received the old vaccine lost their immunity within a few years, leaving them vulnerable to measles later in life.

In addition to people who received only this old vaccine, anyone who has gotten only one dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine is recommended to get the recommended second dose.

The CDC started recommending two doses of the MMR shot in 1989, Chin-Hong noted, so those vaccinated before that time may need a second dose.

Individuals traveling to areas experiencing measles outbreaks, including within the U.S., can also consider getting another dose even if they're fully vaccinated, Chin-Hong said.

Additionally, health care workers, immunocompromised people and those who live with them, and college students should check their vaccination records to confirm they've received two MMR doses, and perhaps get an immunity test if they are unsure, Chin-Hong suggested. Individuals can speak with their health care provider about getting a booster shot, if they're interested in receiving one.

Fully vaccinated people may still catch measles, but only in rare circumstances.

About 3% of fully vaccinated people may still develop measles symptoms after an exposure to the virus, according to the CDC. However, people who have been fully vaccinated tend to experience milder symptoms than unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, and they are also less likely to spread the virus to others.

These "breakthrough" cases become more likely in the context of large outbreaks or high-exposure settings — when an individual has prolonged, close contact with an infected person. About 5% of total measles cases in the U.S. are breakthrough cases, according to the CDC.

Additionally, people with weakened immune systems — due to medical conditions or medications — might not maintain full protection, even if they're fully vaccinated. So they can be more prone to breakthrough cases.

In the current Texas outbreak, there were a "handful" of people who contracted measles after having only one shot," Chin-Hong noted. In a study that looked at measles cases in California between 2000 and 2015, most of those infected were unvaccinated, but 11% of the total cases were among people who had gotten two doses of measles vaccine. The fully vaccinated group did have milder disease, however.

Herd immunity refers to when a high percentage of a population is immune to a disease, making it difficult for the infection to spread. Reaching this collective level of immunity protects even those who can't be vaccinated, such as newborn babies, pregnant people or immunocompromised people.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, and because of that, at least 95% of a given population needs to be immune to prevent major outbreaks.

—Measles deaths jumped over 40% from 2021 to 2022, CDC reports

"Measles is so infectious, with very high levels of transmission. Typically, we refer to 95% coverage as the magic number of that 'herd immunity threshold,'" Head told Live Science. "At this level of coverage, there may still be individual case[s], but the majority of the population is protected, and the outbreaks will remain small and very localised."

MMR coverage among U.S. kindergartners has declined in recent years, according to the CDC. In the 2019-2020 school year, 95.2% of kindergartners had received two doses of the MMR vaccine, but in the 2023-2024 school year, that coverage dropped to 92.7%. That marked the "fourth consecutive year" that national coverage had been below the targeted 95%.

Several states — including Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia and Florida — had less than 90% coverage during the 2023-2024 school year.

Researchers have counted the number of trees in China and mapped their distribution across the country using a laser-based technique called lidar.

A new estimate suggests China is home to 142.6 billion trees, meaning the country has roughly 100 trees per inhabitant.

These numbers are considerable, given how densely populated China is, an expert told Live Science. Still, the total figure may be an underestimate due to the limitations of the technology used to count the trees, the authors of the new study said.

"The actual number could be higher," said Qinghua Guo, a professor in the Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System at Peking University and the lead author of the study. China's Ninth National Forest Resources Inventory counted an average of 426 trees per acre (1,052 trees/hectare) across the country in 2019, which is much higher than the new study's estimate of 279 trees per acre (689 trees/hectare), Guo told Live Science in an email.

The true number of trees could be somewhere in the middle, but more research is needed to figure out what it is, he said.

An accurate estimate of China's tree population is crucial to evaluating forest ecosystem conditions and the amount of carbon that is being locked away in trees, Guo said. He and his colleagues also created a detailed map showing the distribution of China's trees, which they say will help the country hit its ecological and climate targets.

"The study represents the first high-resolution mapping of tree density across China," Guo said. "Ultimately, this research contributes to China's approach to global sustainable ecosystem management and restoration."

To produce the estimate, the researchers used a laser-based mapping technique called lidar (light detection and ranging). The team has been collecting lidar data from drones since 2015, amounting to an area covering 540 square miles (1,400 square kilometers).

For the new study, the scientists counted the number of trees in this area using software called Lidar360 that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI). They then extrapolated the resulting tree density estimate to obtain a national figure, with the results published Feb. 6 in the journal Science Bulletin.



The technology is cutting-edge, but some features need ironing out, Guo said. For example, Lidar360 cannot detect trees growing below thick canopies. "In densely forested areas, overlapping canopies obstruct the accurate detection of mid-story and understory trees, leading to lower-than-actual tree counts," Guo said. Incorporating terrestrial lidar data and improving the software could provide more accurate tree counts, he added.

Despite certain limitations, the results broadly align with researchers' previous understanding of China's tree population, said Tom Crowther, an assistant professor in the department of environmental systems science at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. "Globally, there are closer to 400 trees per person, but in such a densely populated region, it makes sense that this number is lower," Crowther, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.

China's tree population may soon increase, however, because the country is planting seedlings at a dizzying rate. Tree counts could skyrocket this spring as drones are deployed to seed the "Great Green Wall" — a huge belt of trees in the north of China that is being planted to prevent the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts from expanding. The Great Green Wall project — also known as the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program — started in 1978 and is due to be completed in 2050, by which point it could hold 100 billion trees. The wall is already the world's largest seeded forest with more than 66 million trees, but its success in staving off desertification is debated.

The technology used for the study not only helps to count and map trees, but it could also optimize where China chooses to focus its tree-planting efforts.

"The fusion of high-precision data and intelligent models ensures that every tree can be planted in the most suitable location," Guo said.

MRAM can be energy-intensive, but a new generation of this technology will enable greater computing power and resilience, as well as much lower energy requirements.

Scientists in Japan have developed a new kind of "universal" computing memory that is much faster and less energy-hungry than modules used in the best laptops and PCs today.

Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is a type of universal memory device that can overcome some of the limitations of conventional RAM, which can slow down at peak demand due to a relatively low capacity. Universal memory is a storage format that combines the speed of existing RAM and the ability of storage to retain information without a power supply

Universal memory like MRAM is a better proposition than the components used in computers and smart devices today as it offers higher speeds and much greater capacity, as well as better endurance.

This new technology operates at faster speeds and with greater capacity than conventional RAM, but overcomes the problem of high power requirements for data writing — which has previously been a challenge for MRAM.

MRAM devices consume little power in their standby state but need a large electric current to switch the direction of magnetization vector configurations of magnetic tunnel junctions, thereby using the direction of magnetization to represent the binary values in computers. That makes it infeasible for use in most computing systems and to achieve low-power data writing, a more efficient method for switching these vectors was needed.

In a paper published Dec. 25 2024 in the journal Advanced Science, researchers reported developing a new component for controlling the electric field in MRAM devices. Their method requires far less energy to switch polarity, thereby lowering the power requirements and improving the speed at which processes are performed.

The prototype component they built was called a "multiferroic heterostructure" — a ferromagnetic material and piezoelectric material, but with an ultrathin vanadium between them — that can be magnetized by an electric field. This differs from other MRAM devices, which did not have the vanadium layer.

Structural fluctuations in the ferromagnetic layer meant that it was difficult for a stable direction of magnetization to be maintained in previous MRAM devices. In order to overcome this stability issue, the Vanadium wafer between the ferromagnetic and piezoelectric layers acts as a buffer between the two.

—'Crazy idea' memory device could slash AI energy consumption by up to 2,500 times

—Ultrafast laser-powered 'magnetic RAM' is on the horizon after new discovery

By passing an electric current through the materials, the scientists demonstrated that the magnetic state could switch direction. The materials could maintain their shape and form, which previous versions could not do. Furthermore, the magnetic state was maintained after the electric charge was no longer present, allowing a stable binary state to be maintained without power.

The study did not cover the degradation in the switching efficiency over time. This tends to be a common problem with a wide range of electrical devices. For example, a common complaint with rechargeable household batteries is that they can only be charged a certain number of times (approximately 500) before their capacity degrades.

Ultimately, the new MRAM technology could enable more powerful commercial computing while also offering a longer use life, the scientists said. That's because the new switching technique requires far less power than previous solutions, has a greater resilience than current RAM technologies and does not require moving parts.

The Neurosurgeon Who Advised Severance Breaks Down Its Science

A neurosurgeon who has acted as a consultant for Severance explains the science behind the show's brain-altering procedure—and whether it could ever become reality.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Naeem Amarsy & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Today we're talking about the science of Severance.

What if instead of struggling to find work-life balance, you could completely separate your professional identity from your personal one? That question kicks off the Apple TV+ show Severance, which just wrapped up its second season.

In the world of the show, a company called Lumon Industries requires certain employees to undergo its “severance” procedure, which its spokespeople say means you'll never have to take work home with you again. It also means you have to get a microchip implanted into your brain.

To help make the procedure and its effects as realistic as possible, the folks behind Severance brought on a real-life neurosurgeon to consult on the show. Vijay Agarwal is chief of the [Division] Skull-Base [and Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery] [and Director of Brain] Tumor Center at Montefiore Einstein [Medical Center]. We sat down with him to get the inside scoop on the science of severance.

Before we get into that chat, just a brief spoiler warning: we did our best to avoid any super-specific spoilers for recent episodes, but we'd recommend waiting until you've watched at least episode seven of season two before listening.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Vijay Agarwal: Yeah, my pleasure.

Feltman: So tell me how you got involved with the show Severance and what that's entailed.

Agarwal: You know, it's sort of hard for people to believe, but it really was just a call out of the blue. Just one day at work I got a call that they were looking for someone for a concept for a show that hadn't come out yet. That was pre-COVID, in a very different world ...

Feltman: Right.

Agarwal: Than we live in now. And it was just as simple as that. It was just a thought at that stage—you know, “We wanna develop a procedure that implants a chip that separates your work life from your social life, from your everyday life.” And we were off to the races.

Feltman: Yeah. What were your initial thoughts and reactions when you first heard that premise?

Agarwal: I thought it was a very cool concept, and I think I just directly went into how that could be a reality. You know, one of the things that Ben Stiller was really strict on was that he wanted this to be as believable as possible ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: As real as possible. There are some sort of creative allowances that happen as part of this process, but he really wanted the science to be real and to be believable, and I think that's part of the reason that people have really bonded with the show and in particular the science.

Feltman: Yeah, well, that's a great segue to my next question, which is: What are some of the, the real science concepts and, you know, factual medical procedures that you've baked into the concept of the severance procedure?

Agarwal: I made a statement a while ago that I don't think we're far off from things like this happening, and I really firmly believe that. And we're actually much closer than when I made that statement.

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: So if we had told somebody a few years ago that we would be implanting electrodes in the brain to stimulate the brain to treat people who are paralyzed and allow them to be able to walk again or treat their obsessive-compulsive disorder, their addiction, their severe suicidal depression, obesity, things like that, we would think people are crazy, but those things are actually happening currently in science. And almost every major academic center around the world is doing these sorts of procedures every day, in particular to help people with diseases like Parkinson's disease. And so it seems like a very science fiction-type concept, but it's part of our everyday life as neurosurgeons and neuroscientists.

Feltman: Well, and can you walk me through, you know, in creating the concept for the severance procedure, where did you sort of pepper in factual details, you know, for example, the placement of the chip?

Agarwal: I actually think that that scene is very, very realistic.

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: And so we—I borrowed from the science and the surgeries that we do today, even. So some of the navigation equipment that we use, I had that equipment shipped in. And so when I started, it really was just a concept: “How do we develop the severance procedure? How do we ‘sever' people?” Then we sort of developed the science, and I remember very—in the early days of the show sitting at a, you know, a big conference table with Ben and Dan [Erickson] and a lot of the producers, and we just had a whiteboard in it, and we would just spitball concepts ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Until we found one that was, you know, really believable and the one that people liked and the one that Ben thought would fit with his vision.

And so we really implant in an area that is able to process memories but, interestingly, associates those memories with emotion. It's the amygdala and hippocampus, so those sort of middle part of the structures, on the left side of the brain, which is the dominant side of the brain for most people. So what a great area to stimulate to really facilitate this ability to separate our “innies” from our “outies”: number one, the ability to process memories, but then, number two, the ability to, to associate those memories with emotion. So that was a perfect place to do it. And then, actually, the procedure was very realistic. So how we put the hole in the skull, the needle with which we use to implant the chip, those are things that we use every day in neurosurgery and neuroscience currently.

Feltman: And you actually appear on camera to do the procedure, is that right?

Agarwal: Season one, episode two—so when we implant the chip in Helly. So we really designed that set. So, you know, Ben had a very specific vision in mind, and then our goal was really to try to make that vision become a reality. And so everything was important on that set, from the scientific accuracy to the lighting to the cinematography. And so it was all specifically laid out to capture a purpose. And so that's the episode that I appeared in and very proud with the, the way it came out.

Feltman: Yeah. So just to really spell out the actual neuroscience here, which I think is so cool, in your mind—pardon the pun—what is that chip doing in there, in that part of the brain?

Agarwal: As I mentioned before there are se—multiple companies trying to do something on a different scale, which is trying to stimulate the brain to alter the way that it functions: so Elon Musk's Neuralink; a lot of my friends are working on this technology at different centers around the country; Synchron is another company based out of New York that's trying to do something similar in terms of being able to modify the function of the brain by inputting electrical stimulation.

And Elon, he gave a talk at one of our recent neurosurgery meetings, and he's compared the brain to a big circuit board. And then he likened the work that they're doing with Neuralink is really adjusting the electricity that's going into the circuit board to modify the way that it fires, to change the way that it fires and really dictate how that circuit board functions to make your computer run a certain way, your TV run a certain way. And I think that's really the best way to look at what we're doing in the severance procedure.

If you look at the brain as, as one big computer, if you change the way that you, instruct the computer to function by really changing the way you're putting electricity in, by firing all of these neurons across the brain, you can really affect the way that your brain processes or pulls memories from its memory bank—and then also to potentially modify what emotions are associated with those memories as well.

And that's what the amygdala and hippocampus does: so the amygdala is very famous for fear responses and things like that, very profound emotion. And if you followed season two, I think this concept of fear and these really dark emotions are really prevalent in this season. And so when—one of the recent episodes, where we follow Cobel going to where she grew up, it's a very kind of dark, fearful episode. And so that's exactly the type of brain and the emotions that we're trying to conjure, is the stimulation of this amygdala and hippocampus.

Feltman: Yeah, speaking of season two—I mean, back in season one, we were introduced to this concept of “reintegration,” where the severed consciousnesses kind of come back together, and we've seen a lot more of the messiness of that process in season two. Did you weigh in at all on what that might look like from a neuroscience perspective?

Agarwal: Yeah, so I was actually on set for a lot of that work in terms of the reintegration, just to make sure that work was being done well. I worked with Adam Scott, who plays Mark, on some of the things, such as, in one of the recent episodes ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Agarwal: He had a seizure, and I thought he did an absolutely brilliant job portraying that, and, you know, it really shows sort of the academic stint a lot of the actors and Ben take in the show; I think Adam Scott and Ben Stiller in particular really look at this as almost homework, to try to really understand it. And so I helped Adam, and I was, you know, send—texting with him after that episode because I was just so proud with how that seizure came out. It was, you know, it was very realistic, and that's a hard thing to capture.

So we worked on that, and then the reintegration procedure, I had a lot of input with how that would work—you know, what sort of science would go into something like a reintegration procedure—so I remember sending and reviewing ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Articles from the literature about being able to do things that would be likened to reintegration or to really enhance things like electrical stimulation. We were able to use almost like a transmagnetic stimulation-type device. We were able to really use very realistic scientific methods to incorporate into this reintegration.

Feltman: Yeah, and for listeners who don't know, could you talk a little bit about what TMS is and how it relates to what we saw in that reintegration episode?

Agarwal: Yeah, transmagnetic stimulation, it's an amazing technology, and it's basically putting these magnetic fields into the brain to alter the way that your brain fires. And there's very good data to show that people who have become paralyzed can regain some functionality—so some ability to move—in areas that are either weak or paralyzed.

And so there's a lot of different uses for transmagnetic stimulation, and it's delivered very similarly to the way that we saw in one of the earlier episodes, where Reghabi is reintegrating Mark in his basement. And so there's actually, today in society, transmagnetic stimulation medical spas ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: That you could go to to receive this very intense therapy. And so there's a lot of people who feel that this is really gonna be a major advance for us to use against things like paralysis and depression and things like that.

Feltman: Yeah, that's super interesting.

Speaking of reintegration we've seen some random acts of basement neurosurgery [laughs] in this season. From a neurological standpoint what kind of risks would someone like Mark be facing in that situation?

Agarwal: I think there was a bit of a red herring—so in one of the earlier episodes this season, where Reghabi was reintegrating Mark, you could see, as she was delivering this transmagnetic-type stimulation on the left side of the brain, his right hand start to shake ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Really the left side of the brain controlling the right side of the body. And so the same risks that we saw, namely seizure, which we saw him have a very sort of total body seizure, those sorts of things would be a big risk. So bleeding in the brain: the brain didn't—doesn't like anything sort of entering into the brain or disturbing the brain; it's about a 1 percent risk of what we say is hemorrhage. Infection: so there being a big infection in that area, that's also a possibility. But I think irritating the brain is one of the most common side effects of a procedure like that. And when the brain is irritated, oftentimes it'll manifest by seizing ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: Which means really firing electrons abnormally in the brain, which is what we saw.

Feltman: So we've talked about season two a little bit and about fear and, and emotion in memory. Obviously, in one of the kind of biggest and most impactful episodes of season two, we saw a character who seemed to be severed many times over and have this, like, very compartmentalized consciousness and was experiencing a lot of emotions that were then cut off when they emerged from, you know, that area of the floor they were on. How much more complicated do you think that would be than sort of a standard severance floor chip behavior we've seen so far?

Agarwal: You mean in real life?

Feltman: Yeah.

Agarwal: I think it would actually be less complicated ...

Feltman: Oh, yeah?

Agarwal: So currently, right now, there's these amazing videos—people who wanna go to YouTube and see this, they can—these very amazing videos of people with Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disease, and oftentimes one of the biggest symptoms they have is uncontrollable shaking. So we actually, as part of the standard of care of treating these patients, we'll put electrodes into very specific parts of the brain and deliver electricity, and when you turn it on they'll almost completely stop shaking. And when you turn it off, which is a flip of a switch externally, they start shaking uncontrollably, to the point that they can't care for themselves, they can't shower, they can't eat, they can't function in society—just from a flip of a switch externally.

So imagine you're able to do that from, like, your phone, anywhere in the world. But then it all—you know, it begs the question: “Who is the one flipping that switch? And ethically who should have the right to flip that switch?”

Feltman: Yeah. Last question: you know, Severance is one of those shows that inspires so many fan theories, more and more with every episode. I'm just curious, when friends and patients talk to you, how often do you get people trying to, you know, pull some secret Severance info out of you or get you to weigh in on their theories?

Agarwal: Yeah, you know, it's—I think people have strayed away from doing that. What I've noticed is that I actually rarely get asked, and that's good because my response is always, “Well, I guess you'll just have to see the rest of the season,” so I've been trained well.

But I actually have more people, even in the general community, just wanna talk about ...

Feltman: Mm.

Agarwal: The show, not specifically trying to figure out what happens in the later episodes; they're just so fascinated with the show and the concept and the way that it's written and the work that, you know, Ben, Dan and Mark have done—and the rest of the team as well. And it's really amazing to see the response to the show 'cause people just wanna talk about it.

It's like when people read a good book and they wanna talk to other people who have read the book and they just really delve into, you know, “What did this mean? What do you think this means?” And people just wanna talk about the show. And I absolutely love it 'cause I think it's brilliant, I love the show, I love watching the show, and I, you know, love talking about it. And so I actually don't get people really poking about what happens later on in the show. I get people who really genuinely enjoy it and actually just wanna talk about it, just wanna talk shop, and I enjoy that as well, and I think that really speaks to the response the show has had.

Feltman: Absolutely. Well, thank you so much for joining us to chat. As a Severance fan I have really loved this, so we really appreciate it.

Agarwal: Yeah, my pleasure, and I'm excited for you guys to see the rest of the season.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. If you're listening to this in our podcast feed, you can check out a version with video over on our YouTube channel. We'll be back on Monday with our usual science news roundup.

Leading global certification body DNV has validated that Flocean's desalination approach can achieve 30-50% energy savings compared to conventional systems once site-specific engineering is completed.

Conventional desalination capacity is set to double by 2032, addressing critical water shortages while risking a massive surge in carbon emissions.

Current plants already generate over 400 million tons of CO2 annually—a figure that could double as tens of billion in new projects come online within the next 10 years.

Energy is the critical cost driver in desalination, accounting for one-third to over half of total operational expenses. In Cyprus, where desalination supplies most freshwater, the process generates 2% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions and consumes 5% of its power.

To verify these results in real-world conditions, the Flocean Zero project launched in November 2024. Initial data analysis confirmed that the deep ocean environment provides optimal conditions for high-efficiency desalination while dramatically reducing energy requirements. 

Efficiency gains are achieved through two advantages, natural pressure utilization and superior water quality.

By placing reverse osmosis systems at 400-600 meters depth, Flocean harnesses natural hydrostatic pressure to drive filtration without energy-intensive pumping systems.

Deep ocean water contains significantly less life than surface water, dramatically reducing pre-treatment requirements and virtually eliminating biofouling—a persistent efficiency drain in conventional plants.

With freshwater demand projected to exceed supply by 40% by 2030, countries worldwide need solutions that address water security without compromising climate commitments.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Wang Xing, CEO of China's largest food delivery firm Meituan, said on Friday in a post-earnings call that the company is pouring "billions" into chips used to train AI models, with more investment planned this year.

The escalated spending and promise of further increases aligns with similar large-scale AI investments by China's other tech giants. E-commerce conglomerate Alibaba announced in February that it would allocated at least 380 billion yuan toward cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years.

Spermosens AB (publ) ("Spermosens" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that a peer-reviewed article, "JUNO-Checked - A Live Cell Electrochemical Biosensor for Sperm Function Diagnostics," has been published in the prestigious journal Sensors & Diagnostics by the Royal Society of Chemistry. This gold open-access journal is renowned for showcasing cutting-edge research on sensing technologies and diagnostic systems, with a particular focus on novel materials, innovative detection methods and advancements that enable in situ or real-world testing.

The article details the groundbreaking capabilities of the JUNO-Checked biosensor, which quantifies sperm binding to a JUNO-functionalized surface by generating a metric, the JUNOScore. Since the ability of a sperm cell to bind to the egg's JUNO protein is a crucial factor for fertilization, this innovative technology provides critical insights into sperm function, insights that traditional microscopic semen analysis cannot attain. By directly assessing this fundamental biological interaction, the research highlights the significant potential of the JUNO-Checked technology to enhance clinical diagnostics and optimize personalized assisted reproductive treatments, positioning it as a transformative tool in reproductive health.

The publication is the result of a productive collaboration with Reproductive Medicines Center (RMC) in Malmö and FlexMedical Solutions in the UK, which has been instrumental in developing the technology.

Spermosens is currently conducting a clinical study with the Reproductive Medicine Center (RMC) in Malmö to validate the JUNO-Checked biosensor's potential in fertility diagnostics. Additionally, the company recently secured a strategic investment, strengthening its financial position to accelerate technical and clinical development, paving the way for partnerships and license agreements.

Tore Duvold, CEO of Spermosens, comments: "I am very pleased with the publication of our scientific results, which highlights the diagnostic relevance and clinical potential of our JUNO-Checked technology. This peer-reviewed study validates the quality of our research and its contribution to reproductive medicine, strengthening our commitment to advancing fertility diagnostics and enabling personalized treatment strategies."

Feedback

Nvidia is making bold strides into the quantum computing realm with plans to establish a dedicated research lab in Boston, where it will collaborate with top scientists from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The announcement was made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the company's annual software developer conference held in San Jose, California on Thursday.

The planned research lab signifies Nvidia's growing interest in quantum computing, an area where the company sees potential for dramatic advancements in computational power. The Boston lab will focus on developing new quantum algorithms and enhancing quantum hardware to further accelerate research in this evolving field.

The announcement comes less than a year after Huang made comments suggesting that useful quantum computers were at least 20 years away. However, during Thursday's event, he sought to revise that timeline, acknowledging the rapid progress being made by various quantum firms.

“This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” Huang joked, acknowledging the accelerated pace of development in quantum technology.

The conference also featured discussions with executives from leading quantum computing companies, underscoring Nvidia's intention to position itself as a pivotal player in the quantum computing landscape.

By teaming up with Harvard and MIT, Nvidia aims to leverage the cutting-edge research capabilities of these prestigious institutions. The collaboration will focus on creating practical applications for quantum computing, as well as integrating classical computing technologies with quantum systems.

Nvidia's commitment to the research lab reflects its belief that quantum computing, while still in its infancy, could soon transform industries ranging from pharmaceuticals and cryptography to material science and artificial intelligence.

The company has already made headlines with its AI advancements, but quantum computing could represent the next frontier of technological innovation. Nvidia's new lab will work on building scalable quantum hardware, optimising software tools, and developing algorithms capable of harnessing quantum systems for real-world applications.

The Queanbeyan District Court was told the incident occurred during an argument between the woman and her son about a technology ban. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)

A woman previously charged for hitting her 13-year-old son while chastising him for disobeying a technology ban has successfully appealed her conviction.

The NSW District Court heard the boy texted his father after the incident, who called the police on his ex-partner, leading to the charge against her.

Judge Robert Sutherland could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the woman had been reckless in hitting her son or if it was an accident.

A New South Wales woman who hit her teenage son during an argument over a technology ban has won her appeal against her conviction over the incident.

If you need help immediately call emergency services on triple-0

The Queanbeyan District Court heard the two had been arguing about the issue when the family sat down for dinner when she continued to chastise her son for disobeying a technology ban.

Judge Robert Sutherland said things escalated and the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to hit the boy on the shoulder but he ducked.

He said when she hit him again he moved and she landed on the back of his neck.

The court was told the boy lived between his mother's home and his father's after an acrimonious break-up some years before.

At some point during the argument the boy sent a text to his father asking to be picked up because he didn't want to be at his mother's house.

Judge Sutherland said the phone was eventually confiscated and hidden, so that when the boy's father rang him back he didn't answer.

The father then rang police, prompting a visit by two officers who came to the house for a welfare check.

Judge Sutherland said later the boy was taken by police to make a statement, which led to the court action against his mother.

His step-grandmother stayed with him during his interview.

Judge Sutherland questioned if the presence of boy's step-grandmother may have had an impact on his account.

"I have found this case troubling," Judge Sutherland said.

"The circumstances of the welfare check [by police] … is concerning."

He said that was especially so when the officers spoke to the boy, but provided no evidence about what was said in the exchange.

"There's little doubt there was a parental exchange … between a mother and a 13-year-old adolescent," Judge Sutherland said.

Judge Sutherland said he had to weigh up if the woman had been reckless in hitting her son, or if it was simply an accident.

In the end he dismissed the charge, saying he couldn't find beyond reasonable doubt that the woman had been reckless.

Helpany's AI-powered radar device named Paul has helped caregivers reduce falls by 67% in three consecutive months. 

AI technology is changing senior care, boasting a significant reduction in falls at Park Senior Villas – La Cañada. Helpany's AI-powered radar device Paul has helped caregivers to reduce falls by 67% in three consecutive months.

Park Senior Villas implemented the Paul devices to identify at-risk residents by analyzing their motion patterns and providing real-time preventive notifications to caregivers. This cutting-edge technology empowers caregivers to detect changes in residents' conditions early, helping them prevent potential falls. 

As a result, more than 180 proactive care interventions recorded during 90 days.

“The safety and well-being of our residents is our top priority,” said Christina Ryan, chief executive officer of Park Senior Villas. “Implementing Helpany's Paul device has been a game-changer, enabling us to provide proactive, around-the-clock care without compromising privacy.”

Sandro Cilurzo, Helpany's chief executive officer, said he strives to be proactive inside of reactive.

“With the right technology, we can achieve that,” Cilurzo said. “By identifying risks early, caregivers can provide timely assistance, enhancing resident outcomes while easing the burden on staff.

“While the success of Helpany is undeniable, experts emphasize that caregivers play the primary role in keeping seniors safe. Effective fall prevention requires a holistic approach, including attentive care, environmental modifications and proactive health monitoring.”

“The safety and well-being of our clients is our top priority,” says Christina Ryan, chief executive officer for Park Senior Villas - La Cañada, in regards to the implementation of Paul in their facilities, resulting in a 67% deficit in falls. 

Red flags that indicate a senior may need more care include:

Unexplained weight loss: This could indicate underlying health concerns such as malnutrition or illness.

Difficulty standing or walking: Despite AI monitoring, mobility issues can increase the risk of falls and require physical therapy or assistive devices.

Restlessness at night: Persistent poor sleep leads to significant fatigue, impaired balance and slower cognitive responses, dramatically increasing the likelihood of falls.

Inactivity: Prolonged sedentary behavior and minimal activity are putting seniors at a much higher risk of falls, reducing the overall strength, balance and mobility.

Declining gait speed: A slow gait or reduced walking distance may signal an increased risk of falling.

Social withdrawal or mood changes: Isolation can lead to mental health concerns and a decreased quality of life.

“Since implementing Helpany, our caregivers have been able to respond faster and more effectively to residents' needs. This has not only improved resident safety but also eased the workload for our staff by enabling more proactive care,” said Liesen Clemons, general manager of Park Senior Villas – La Cañada. 

Helpany's AI system is proving successful in Tucson and seeing impressive results at Fellowship Square Mesa, where falls have dropped by 70% in just two months. The technology is gaining traction across senior living communities, offering a privacy-first approach that prioritizes dignity and safety.

One of the unique advantages of Paul is its ability to provide continuous, non-intrusive monitoring, giving caregivers real-time insights into residents' movements. This allows them to proactively address potential risks, respond swiftly to changes in mobility, and implement additional measures to enhance overall safety and well-being.

“The goal of AI-based technology is to enhance, not replace, the personal attention that caregivers provide,” Cilurzo said. “Paul is like a virtual caregiver supporting better decision-making and improving overall care quality.”

As AI-driven solutions evolve, the balance between technology and hands-on care will remain crucial. While Paul is helping revolutionize fall prevention, it is not a substitute for comprehensive senior care. Families and caregivers should stay vigilant for signs that a loved one may need additional support beyond what technology can provide.

As the United States recalibrates its trade policies to combat what the Trump administration sees as “unfair” treatment by other countries, two significant industries have complained to US regulators about their treatment in Australia.

The tech industry – particularly Big Tech platforms such as Google and Meta – says it is being “coerced” into handing cash to Australian media companies. And the pharmaceutical industry is upset about low prices and delays in getting new treatments into the Australian market. 

Why are we hearing about these complaints now? And what will they mean for Australia?

In February, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) invited comments from the public to help it review and identify any unfair trade practices by other countries. The call was made “pursuant to the America First Trade Policy Presidential Memorandum and the Presidential Memorandum on Reciprocal Trade and Tariffs”.

The aim was to use this consultation to investigate potential harm to the US from any non-reciprocal trade arrangements. The consultation was designed to help the USTR recommend appropriate actions to remedy any such practices.

Essentially, it was an invitation to complain about any and all countries, including Australia. All the relevant industry associations have taken up this opportunity with a high degree of enthusiasm. 

There have been 766 submissions.

A tech industry group called the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) made a submission raising concerns about the digital policies of several countries, including Australia.

The submission emphasised policies with what it calls “extractionary and redistributive characteristics” that force one set of market participants to subsidise the economic activities of another.

The association's Australian concern focuses on the News Media Bargaining Code. This requires tech companies to pay for news that appears on their platforms.

The CCIA characterises the News Bargaining Code as:

a coercive and discriminatory tax that requires US technology companies to subsidise Australian media companies.

The CCIA argued that the financial burden imposed by the code is substantial. It said that two companies (Google and Meta, although the CCIA does not name them) pay A$250 million annually in deals “coerced through the threat of this law”. It also mentioned the planned “news bargaining incentive”, which aims to encourage platforms to do deals with media companies.

The CCIA is also concerned about changes in competition law that will lead to platforms being regulated by default. That is, like telecommunications and electricity companies, designated platforms will be assumed to have a substantial degree of market power. (This was a finding made by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in 2019.)

The industry group argued that Australia's regulatory regime is modelled on the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA). In fact, Australia is likely to look closely at both the EU and UK regimes. 

The CCIA says this default regulation would target specified US companies with discriminatory obligations. 

However, any business that is “designated” – regardless of its host country – would have these obligations. The proposed approach does not target or discriminate against US businesses. 

It is true the proposed approach will have heavy penalties for breach, and the CCIA complains about these “significant fines”. The CCIA correctly identifies that the regulations would empower the government to impose restrictions on how platforms use customers' data, and whether they can preference their own products. 

The CCIA says it is concerned that these measures, like similar ones in other jurisdictions, disproportionately target US companies. It says they would also impose significant compliance costs, and may serve as a backdoor for industrial policy designed to advantage local competitors. They argue that such rules can require changes to operating procedures and services, and that non-compliance can result in hefty fines.

The submission also addresses Australia's proposed requirements for US online video providers, such as Netflix, to fund the development and production of Australian content, which could require these providers to allocate 10–20% of their local expenditure to Australian content. It does not note that the same is true for Australian streaming platforms.

Big Pharma, via the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) industry association, has also complained about various countries. Gripes about Australia include low prices under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and delays to approval of new treatments.

Medicines Australia – a local organisation that represents pharmaceutical companies –  agrees about the delays, citing a PBS review published last year. 

The critical submissions should come as no surprise. Any industry group that passes up such a golden opportunity to complain on behalf of its members is arguably not doing its job.

In the case of both Big Tech and Big Pharma, Australia was only one of the targets.  Yet the potential impacts are high. 

The USTR is looking at treating any regulatory barriers faced by US companies as if they were tariffs. At least one Australian industry association is joining the pile-on.

How will the USTR respond? Given the White House's current approach to trade, there is a significant risk it will recommend retaliatory tariffs on yet more Australian products.

US President Trump gestures as CEO of Open AI Sam Altman speaks at the White House in January

Major tech firms are pushing the administration of President Donald Trump to loosen rules on building artificial intelligence, arguing it is the only way to maintain a US edge and compete with China. 

Spooked by generative AI's sudden advance, governments initially scrambled to develop guardrails, as major tech companies rapidly integrated the technology into their products.

Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has shifted focus toward accelerating AI development at all costs, pushing aside concerns about the models suffering hallucinations, producing deepfakes, or destroying human jobs.

"The AI future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about safety," Vice President JD Vance told world leaders at a recent AI summit in Paris.

This message unsettled international partners, particularly Europe, which had proudly established the EU AI Act as a new standard for keeping the technology in check.

But, faced with America's new direction, European officials are now pivoting their messaging toward investment and innovation rather than safety.

"We're going to see a significant pullback in terms of the regulatory efforts... worldwide," explained David Danks, professor of data science and philosophy at University of California San Diego. 

"That certainly has been signaled here in the United States, but we're also seeing it in Europe."

Tech companies are capitalizing on this regulatory retreat, seeking the freedom to develop AI technologies that they claim have been too constrained under the Biden administration.

One of Trump's first executive actions was dismantling Biden's policies, which had proposed modest guardrails for powerful AI models and directed agencies to prepare to oversee the change.

"It's clear that we're taking a step back from that idea that there's going to be a coherent overall approach to AI regulation," noted Karen Silverman, CEO of AI advisory firm Cantellus Group.

The Trump administration has invited industry leaders to share their policy vision, emphasizing that the US must maintain its position as the "undeniable leader in AI technology" with minimal investor constraints.

The industry submissions will shape the White House's AI action plan, expected this summer.

The request has yielded predictable responses from major players, with a common theme emerging: China represents an existential threat which can only be addressed by plowing an open path for companies unencumbered by regulation.

OpenAI's submission probably goes the furthest in its contrast with China, highlighting DeepSeek, a Chinese-developed generative AI model created at a fraction of American development costs, to emphasize the competitive threat.

According to OpenAI, American AI development should be "protected from both autocratic powers that would take people's freedoms away, and layers of laws and bureaucracy that would prevent our realizing them."

For AI analyst Zvi Mowshowitz, OpenAI's "goal is to have the federal government not only not regulate AI," but also ban individual US states from doing so.

Currently engaged in litigation with the New York Times over the use of its content for training, OpenAI also argues that restricting access to online data would concede the AI race to China.

"Without fair use access to copyrighted material...America loses, as does the success of democratic AI," OpenAI said.

Another response submitted by a group of Hollywood celebrities -- including Ben Stiller and Cynthia Erivo -- rejected the notion, reflecting the film and television industry's contentious relationship with the technology.

In its response, Meta touted its open Llama AI model as part of the fight for American technological superiority.

"Open source models are essential for the US to win the AI race against China and ensure American AI dominance," the company stated.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg has even advocated for retaliatory tariffs against European regulatory efforts.

Google's input focused on infrastructure investment for AI's substantial energy requirements. 

Like its peers, Google also opposes state-by-state regulations in the US that it claims would undermine America's technological leadership.

Despite the push for minimal oversight, industry observers caution that generative AI carries inherent risks, with or without government regulation.

"Bad press is universal, and if your technology leads to really bad outcomes, you're going to get raked over the public relations coals," warned Danks.

Companies have no choice but to mitigate the dangers, he added.

Trump DOGE Executive Claims $1.5 Billion Savings From IRS Technology Budget

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The tech startup executive charged by the Trump administration with reviewing the Internal Revenue Service's technology modernization program said on Thursday that he has canceled contracts worth about $1.5 billion from the tax agency's budget.

Sam Corcos, founder and CEO of health technology firm Levels, and a member of President Donald Trump's informal Department of Government Efficiency, told Fox News Channel that he has found legacy contracts with outside technology consultants worth tens of billions of dollars for a systems modernization effort that is decades behind schedule.

"I think we've so far stopped work and cut about $1.5 billion from the modernization budget, mostly projects that were putting us down this death spiral of complexity in our code base," said Corcos, who serves as a special adviser to the Treasury.

That's from an annual modernization budget of about $3.7 billion, which is in addition to a $3.5 billion information technology systems budget, he said.

The true size and legality of many DOGE-related cuts in government spending have been challenged in court.

The IRS last week said it was pausing technology modernization investments to reevaluate its operating approach in light of new artificial intelligence technologies.

The pause marks another shift away from the original $80 billion in IRS investment funding over a decade that was included in former president Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The modernization effort was aimed making up for a decade of under-funding to revamp outdated 1960s-era computer architecture, improving taxpayer services and boosting the IRS' capability to increase tax collections through more sophisticated audits of the ultra-wealthy and business owners.

Clawing back the supplemental funding has long been a target of Republicans in Congress, who argued that it was aimed at harassing taxpayers. Subsequent stopgap government funding measures have whittled the original $80 billion down by as much as half.

Corcos praised the dedication of the IRS' 8,000 career information technology employees, saying that they have been "super cooperative" with the cost review. But he said that the agency's IT costs are far above those of private-sector banks processing similar amounts of data.

Proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health funding threaten a critical pipeline of innovation and discovery necessary to fuel advancements in patient care, warn researchers and provider groups.

Last month, the NIH said it would cut roughly $4 billion in annual funding for indirect research costs by capping reimbursement for such expenses for current and new grants. Previously, reimbursement rates averaged between 27% to 28%, according to the agency.

Provider groups have spoken out against the cuts, saying providers depend on research to bolster care quality. A spokesperson for the Washington State Hospital Association said reduced federal grant support could hinder research on opioid addiction prevention or rural staff training, for example.

The Children's Hospital Association said funding cuts will limit effective diagnostics and threaten “the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children.”

Much of the nation's cutting-edge medical research happens at leading universities and academic medical centers. Academics say cutting funding for their teams will lead to ripple effects in patient care for years to come, with innovative treatments taking longer to show up at the bedside.

“Thirty percent of all [cancer] medicines that we currently have right now that help you and me... were invented and created by academics. And so to have that go away... looking to the future, it's making a third of all the medicines that could be just disappear,” Jordan Green, professor of biomedical engineering, ophthalmology, oncology and neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins told Healthcare Dive. “It's going to have profound effects on lives.”

Already, some projects have been put on hold. Green, who is named on seven NIH grants, said one of his projects evaluating a treatment for tumors has received a stop work order. Getting going again could take months, according to the researcher, which could translate to “years” of delays before the cancer treatment is ready for patients.

Researchers at the University of North Carolina and the University of Michigan have likewise received stop work orders, spurring the University of Michigan to set up alternative funding for projects that directly impact patients. However, the program is not designed to provide long term support.

The looming disruptions to research are already forcing some teams to make tough financial decisions.

Stanford University, the University of California and Harvard University have frozen medical researcher hiring, citing funding uncertainty.

Jonathan Teyan, Associated Medical Schools of New York CEO and president, told Healthcare Dive layoffs could come soon in New York, which is home to 17 medical schools, and the state stands to lose at least $630 million annually from caps to indirect research costs.

The funding cuts “will almost certainly result in lab closures, laying off scientists and support staff and fewer career pathways for scientists in the U.S.,” Teyan said.

Johns Hopkins University — which received the most funds from the NIH last year out of any U.S. entity — will offer fewer slots for incoming doctorate students, according to Green.

He said it is the first time in his 16-year tenure that his lab will contract in size, and he expects the incoming class to be the smallest he's seen in “at least a decade.” Green said the cuts could spur a “brain drain,” in which talent moves overseas to find better opportunities. 

Ultimately, the NIH cuts seem “short sighted,” according to Green.

“In the past, this idea of biomedical research has been very bipartisan — cancer doesn't care if you're in a red state or a blue state, and we want to cure it,” said Green. “We're in a state right now of growth and acceleration, where science is making tremendous improvements to patient care ... and to just sort of pull the rug out, or take the gas out of the tank, when we have so much momentum, it's very surprising, and it saddens me.”

HONOLULU (Island News) -- "I'm originally from New Jersey. I've been on island for about six and a half years," said Keri Anacker.

Anacker is a school psychologist, who spent years in grad school for her specialist degree.

Now she works at a number of public schools assessing students for special education, then comes up with plans to help them.

Local lawmakers want to spend millions to attract and keep new healthcare professionals in Hawaii through a bill that forgives loans used when studying for their profession.

In her move to the islands, she brought more than just her belongings.

"I accumulated I want to say about a little under $30,000 in student loans," stated Anacker.

She said she would pay a little each month, but planned on paying for ten years under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Instead, she signed up for a Hawaii program that nearly wiped it all away.

"I got awarded the money 2024. I had about $26,000 in student loan debt and they sent a check to my loan servicer for $25,500," said Anacker.

She is one of the nearly 900 healthcare workers, who took part in the loan repayment program over the past two years.

Now lawmakers want to set more money aside to help hundreds more Hawaii healthcare professionals.

"$30 million, that is $15 million in each of the next two years, which pays for the loans that people take out when they study to become doctors, nurses, physician assistants, social workers. This pays back the amount of money they took out in loans up to $50,000," said Rep. Gregg Takayama.

The program is a popular one, with more than 1,300 people on the wait list, but it does come with an important requirement.

"As part of forgiving of their student loans, they have to agree to serve at least two years in a rural area, which in Hawaii is almost all of Hawaii. So we get back committed healthcare workers to serve in our community. That meets a real shortage we have of healthcare workers all across the board," added Takayama.

The House bill survived crossing over to the other side of the State Legislature, but now will be heard by the Senate Ways and Means committee, which reviews all bills with a financial impact.

For new healthcare workers like Anacker, the program has made a difference in her Hawaii career.

"Although this program didn't help bring me here, it's definitely helped to retain and keep me here," stated Anacker.

She is a such a fan of the program. She's also reached out to other current and former students, to let them know about the loan repayment program and encourage them to come to Hawaii.

"I'm hoping to bring more people to the island because of it. So I'm hoping to even recruit, more healthcare workers and mental health workers like myself," added Anacker.

Treatment has traditionally started with low- to moderate-efficacy DMTs

Michela Luciano, PhD

Starting Tysabri (natalizumab) early in multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment may lead to better outcomes, including greater reductions in relapse rates and less use of MS-related healthcare services over starting it after other therapies.

That's according to a U.S. healthcare claims analysis of more than 1,500 adults with MS. While those who switched to Tysabri later saw significant improvements, those who received it as a first-line treatment tended to have even greater benefits, the data shows.

“This suggests the potential advantages of commencing [Tysabri] early in the treatment plan for MS not only in managing the condition effectively, but also in reducing the overall utilization of healthcare resources,” the researchers wrote. The study, “Evaluating natalizumab first-line and later-line use in multiple sclerosis: a US claims database analysis,” was published in Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders. The study was led by researchers at Biogen, which markets Tysabri, and also funded the research.

More than 20 disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are approved for MS. These therapies help reduce inflammation, and seek to reduce disease activity and slow disease progression, but each comes with its own safety and efficacy profile.

Traditionally, MS treatment has followed a stepwise approach, starting with low- to moderate-efficacy DMTs, which are generally safer, but less effective at controlling the disease. More potent, higher-efficacy therapies have more safety risks and higher costs, so they've been reserved for patients who show signs of disease activity with less effective drugs.

This approach is being challenged, however. Several studies have shown that starting a high-efficacy DMT earlier in the disease course can lead to fewer relapses and less disability worsening in the long term, which should result in less use of healthcare services and costs.

“Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs increase as disability progresses, with higher disability scores and disease relapses resulting in more hospitalizations and outpatient consultations,” the researchers wrote.

Tysabri is a high-efficacy antibody-based therapy that works by preventing immune cells from getting into the brain and spinal cord where they can cause damage. It's traditionally been a second-line therapy, but researchers examined data from the U.S. Komodo Health database, which contains medical and pharmacy claims from 325 million people in the U.S., to see in a real-world setting how its effectiveness compares with its recent use as a first-line therapy.

The researchers focused on 1,568 adults who received a MS diagnosis between 2016 and 2020, and were given Tysabri as part of their treatment. Of them, 1,174 received Tysabri as their first DMT, while 394 used it as a second or later therapy.

Most of those who took Tysabri as a second-line or later therapy received moderate-efficacy DMTs — oral or older injectable therapies — as their first-line treatment. But some switched to Tysabri after first-line treatment with Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) or Kesimpta (ofatumumab). Tysabri's effectiveness in both groups was assessed with the annualized relapse rate (ARR), or the average number of relapses per year, and healthcare resource utilization during follow-up.

As a first-line treatment, Tysabri resulted in an 81% reduction in ARR compared with baseline values, that is, those collected up to a year before starting treatment. When Tysabri was a later treatment, ARR was reduced by 55% over baseline.

Patients who received Tysabri as a first-line treatment started off with a higher ARR at baseline (1.48 relapses per year vs. 0.92 relapses per year in the later-line group). But they took longer to have a relapse and their relapse rate ended up being 32% lower than those given Tysabri later in their disease course. The risk of relapse was also 27% lower.

Finally, the researchers found that Tysabri consistently reduced the use of healthcare resources, such as MS-related hospitalizations, length of hospital stay, and outpatient visits, in both groups. For most assessments, however, these reductions were more pronounced in those who received it as first-line therapy.

According to the researchers, the “decreased risk of relapse, lower ARR and longer time to relapse” for patients on first-line Tysabri compared with those receiving it later in the disease course “reinforces the importance of utilizing natalizumab as a [first-line] treatment.”

Oops, something went wrong

Mini C-arms are gaining attention in medical imaging, particularly in orthopaedic and sports medicine, for their portability and flexibility. These compact devices weigh less than 40 pounds, are small enough to fit in a suitcase and are designed to function independently or be mounted on a stand, making them ideal for environments where conventional C-arms are not practical.

At the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Annual Meeting, held in San Diego from March 10 to 14 2025, Ziehm-OrthoScan introduced the Versa mini C-arm, while Turner Imaging presented its existing Smart-C mini C-arm, which is distributed in collaboration with Siemens. These devices reflect a growing trend toward more accessible and space-efficient imaging solutions.

The appeal of mini C-arms lies in their portability. They can be used in settings such as remote healthcare facilities, outpatient clinics and mobile units, where space, budget or mobility is limited. By providing real-time imaging without requiring a complex setup or a dedicated imaging suite, the devices can enable quick diagnostic assessments in non-traditional settings such as sports medicine or emergency care. They are primarily used for extremity imaging, such as assessing fractures or injuries to the limbs, and are not suitable for imaging large areas or for procedures requiring deeper radiation penetration, such as those involving the chest or abdomen. As a result, mini C-arms are considered complementary tools rather than replacements for full-sized C-arms.

Despite their potential, the mini C-arm market remains specialised, with limited current competition and no known pipeline products from major C-arm manufacturers GE Healthcare or Philips. This may indicate a perception that the market is too niche or offers limited financial returns. However, as demand for compact and cost-effective imaging solutions increases, market dynamics could shift. In addition to mini C-arms, other technologies are emerging to improve point-of-care extremity imaging, such as Adaptix's Digital Tomosynthesis Orthopaedic imaging system. Advancements in AI-assisted imaging, software integration and expanded clinical applications could make these systems more versatile. As healthcare providers seek solutions that balance versatility with performance, these diagnostic devices could become more competitive.

While mini C-arms offer advantages in portability and accessibility, their widespread adoption will depend on their ability to align with clinical workflows. Factors such as image quality, integration with existing hospital systems, battery life and cost-effectiveness will play a role in determining their long-term viability. As imaging technology continues to evolve, these compact systems may establish a more defined role in healthcare as devices that are uniquely suited for mobile, point-of-care diagnostics.

FRESNO, Calif. (FOX26) — Expenses for Medi-Cal are higher than expected for the state of California.

For the second time in two weeks, state health leaders have come to lawmakers to request more funds to cover the expenses in the state's Medi-Cal budget.

A little over six billion dollars to be exact.

So what's causing this? Cal Matters Reporter Ana Ibarra explains.

"So there are a number of factors that the administration you know has pointed to and one of them I think the one probably you know getting more attention is that the state may have underestimated the amount needed to cover the medical expansion to undocumented people," Ibarra said.

For the past 10 years, California has expanded its Medi-Cal program to even allow more people to enroll like people aged 26 to 49.

But there's more than that.

"There are also more seniors signing up to the program, or signing up to Medi-Cal,” Ibarra said. “Last year the state also changed policy or changed the rule that allowed seniors to apply to Medi-Cal without having to count their assets. So now their houses, their cars, their savings account don't count against seniors when applying, just like everyone else."

All of these factors were brought to state leaders at a recent hearing to discuss the additional needs for funds.

But the Director of the Department of Healthcare Michelle Bass says there was also a concern in regards to pharmaceutical spending.

"Recent coverage expansions have Just like other states, the Department is experiencing an overall increase in pharmacy spend, which again really aligns to some of the experiences just generally across the healthcare sector," Bass said.

But some state leaders like Joe Patterson feel this issue is something that falls back on the department.

"Somebody reaches out to me once a month on this from all over the state,” Patterson said. “The common denominator is DHCS. They all have different plans, they all have different providers, and all of them are having the same issue. So I'm just going to ask here in a public space so everybody can hear it. Can DHCS please commit to fixing this issue?”

But while California tries to solve its own medical financial issues, eyes will also be on the federal government as cuts could come to a group of programs that include Medicaid.

Those cuts are coming from a recent vote from house republicans.

The vote advanced a proposal that could result in cuts of around $880 billion to a group of programs over the next 10 years which includes Medicaid. According to some estimates, that breaks down to about $10 to 20 billion a year.

At NVIDIA's GTC 2025 event in San Jose, California, this week – the so-called "Super Bowl of AI" – the chip giant announced multiple partnerships leveraging the power of AI to turbocharge applications in life sciences and healthcare, including a partnership with GE HealthCare and Google.

NVIDIA and GE HealthCare are developing AI-powered autonomous imaging solutions, beginning with X-ray and ultrasound technologies.

By leveraging NVIDIA's Isaac for Healthcare and Cosmos platforms, GE HealthCare plans to train and test autonomous imaging systems in a virtual environment before real-world deployment.

The initiative will initially focus on automating repetitive tasks in X-ray imaging, enabling care teams to spend more time on complex cases.

In ultrasound, AI-driven automation could help alleviate the physical strain on sonographers and improve imaging consistency.

"We are excited about the potential of autonomous X-ray and ultrasound as we focus on unlocking smarter, more automated solutions that enhance efficiency and ease the burden on healthcare professionals," Roland Rott, president and CEO of Imaging at GE HealthCare, said in a statement.

NVIDIA's GH200 and GB200 superchips, combined with CUDA-X libraries, are set to accelerate AI applications in healthcare and life sciences by delivering significant computational gains.

The latest architecture can speed up engineering simulations by up to 11x and support calculations five times larger than traditional accelerated computing platforms. These advances could drive breakthroughs in biomedical research, medical imaging, and drug discovery.

NVIDIA's cuDSS library is already enhancing large-scale engineering simulations, such as electromagnetic modeling and computational drug design, by making efficient use of shared CPU-GPU memory.

This technology, integrated into platforms like Ansys HFSS and Altair OptiStruct, allows researchers to run more complex simulations faster.

"The ability to solve massive computational problems without being constrained by memory limitations is a game changer for healthcare research and life sciences," Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, said in a statement.

NVIDIA and Alphabet's Google are deepening their AI partnership to accelerate advancements in healthcare, life sciences, and drug discovery by leveraging NVIDIA's GPUs and AI platforms, including Omniverse, Cosmos, and Isaac, to drive breakthroughs in medical research, robotics, and scientific computing.

Isomorphic Labs, a Google DeepMind-founded company focused on AI-driven drug discovery, has built a drug design engine on Google Cloud using NVIDIA GPUs, aiming to scale and refine AI models that could significantly improve therapeutic development.

In addition to drug research, the partnership will enhance Google Cloud's AI infrastructure, making NVIDIA's Blackwell-based GPUs available for computational workloads across biotech and medical imaging.

"AI and accelerated computing are transforming the future of healthcare, from drug discovery to robotics and cloud-based research," Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA said in a statement. "Together with Google, we are pushing the limits of AI to solve the most pressing challenges in medicine and science."

For the last few weeks, we've been busy covering the earnings calls of at-home care companies, which have revealed some key trends that providers are facing as they head into Q2. 

Specifically, Addus HomeCare Corporation (Nasdaq: ADUS), Enhabit Inc. (NYSE: EHAB), The Pennant Group (Nasdaq: PNTG), BrightSpring Health Services (Nasdaq: BTSG), Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: AVAH) and other publicly traded companies weighed in on industry issues and developments. 

These calls took place against the backdrop of regulatory uncertainty, with the Capitol Hill budget battle and the confirmation hearing of Dr. Oz for CMS chief being among the latest developments playing out in Washington, D.C.While home-based care executives weighed in on the uncertainty around programs like Medicaid, the cloudy outlook here did not seem to dampen executives' spirits. There was a sense of optimism around how certain strategies are bearing fruit, as well as enthusiasm about the growth potential for at-home care.

In this week's exclusive, members-only HHCN+ Update, I delve into some of the main takeaways that emerged during this latest earnings call season and offer key takeaways, including: 

— Carefully crafted payer strategies continue to fuel progress at certain home-based care companies. 

— Home-based care providers aren't just leaning on the company's key growth drivers. Instead, many are fine tuning their growth plans in order to reach new heights. 

— In addition to well-known challenges that providers are already facing, companies are also keeping an eye out for possible wrinkles that could negatively impact their businesses down the line. 

It's no secret that home health providers have been struggling with margin pressure related to Medicare Advantage rates. Commentary from Aveanna Healthcare and Enhabit executives provided reason for optimism on this front, as both companies shared some encouraging news related to their payer strategies – notably, their comments suggest how strong payer relationships not only create positive financial trends but can lead to improvements in staffing and clinical capacity. 

At Aveanna Healthcare, prioritizing preferred payers agreements is part of the company's larger transformation strategy. The company first began its transformation strategy, which centers around four primary initiatives, in 2023. Its purpose was to get back on track after a turbulent entrance into the public market.

Based in Atlanta, Aveanna Healthcare offers a range of pediatric and adult health care services. The company provides home health, hospice and pediatric care services. It has 327 locations across 34 states.

Aveanna Healthcare CEO Jeff Shaner once defined “preferred payers” as those “that support value-based care by offering us an above-market reimbursement rate and value-based payments in exchange for proven savings.” 

In Q4, the company landed eight additional preferred pay agreements, bumping its overall number up to 22.

In addition to contributing to the financial health of the company, Aveanna Healthcare has also seen other benefits to its preferred pay focus.

“We also experienced improvement in our caregiver hiring and retention trends by aligning our efforts with those payers willing to engage with us on enhanced reimbursement rates, and value-based agreements,” Shaner said last week during its Q4 earnings call. “While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, our preferred payer strategy allows us to return to a more normalized growth rate in our business segments.”

Improvement when it comes to hiring and retention trends is especially important at a time when providers continue to see the negative impact of a challenging labor market. 

Similar to Aveanna Healthcare, Enhabit also leaned on its payer innovation strategy. This has become increasingly important as the company navigates choppy waters. 

Last year, Enhabit faced a number of public battles amid its move to nail down a strategic direction. One thing that remains consistent is the company's strategy of creating “win-win” agreements with its payer partners.

“They get access to our high-quality care, superior outcomes and evidence-based specialty programs, and we get access to more members and competitive rates and terms,” Debra Konjanovski, senior vice president of payor innovation at Enhabit, previously told HHCN.  

Enhabit has shown a willingness to walk away from high-profile contracts when they no longer serve the company. In 2024, the company terminated its contract with UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE: UNH) UnitedHealthcare subsidiary, the largest MA administrator in the country. The two companies eventually formed a new agreement later that year.

In Q4, the company's payer innovation continued to bear fruit. Overall, 48% of Enhabit's non-Medicare visits are now in payer innovation contracts at improved rates. 

Enhabit also credited its payer innovation strategy for the improvement of its clinical capacity. The company negotiated 76 new contracts in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

“This, combined with continued staffing and cost disciplines, should allow us to expand home health margins as we exit 2025 despite CMS rate reimbursement increases not keeping pace with our overall market inflation,” Ryan Solomon, CFO of Enhabit, said during the Q4 earnings call earlier this month. 

Enhabit operates across 34 states and has more than 10,000 employees. The company's footprint includes 255 home health locations and 115 hospice locations.

The HHCN editorial team often asks providers to identify the main growth drivers that define their businesses. As a result, I've become familiar with the primary sources of growth at companies across the industry.

This earnings season, I was particularly interested in the comments about how BrightSpring and Pennant are planning to grow. In the case of BrightSpring, CEO Jon Rousseau was very explicit about leaning more into home-based primary care as a growth avenue and, further highlighting the importance of payer strategies, emphasized how expanding in home-based care can support involvement in shared savings frameworks. And Pennant's growth strategy for its home health business adds to a trend of health system tie-ups in the space.

BrightSpring is a Louisville, Kentucky-based company that delivers care to complex populations, offering primary care, home- and community-based services, pharmacy services and rehab services to over 400,000 consumers throughout 50 states.

Areas such as pharmacy solutions and community and rehab care have been strong growth drivers for BrightSpring. Still, the company has earmarked home-based primary care as a major future business opportunity.

“Our focus in home-based primary care is, how do we continue to drive that incredibly valuable service to as many patients as we can and get them in the ACO, so that we can drive more and more shared savings,” Rousseau said earlier this month during the company's Q4 earnings call. “We said before our five- to seven-year goal is how are we serving at least 100,000 or more people? That's what we're working towards.”

On its end, M&A has always been Pennant's bread and butter when it comes to accelerating growth. Specifically, the company's strategy involves purchasing community-driven home-based care companies with strong ties to their specific markets.

Eagle, Idaho-based Pennant Group is a holding company with independent operating subsidiaries that provide health care services. It has 131 home health and hospice agencies and 60 senior living communities.

During Q4, Pennant zeroed-in on what CEO Brent Guerisoli called “transformative partnerships.” 

In January 2024, the company entered into a joint venture with John Muir Health. Partnerships like this reflect the broader trend of home health growth through health system JVs, which fueled the growth of giants such as LHC Group and currently is a cornerstone for Compassus.

Pennant also joined forces with Hartford Health Care at Home (HHCAH), the home health and hospice segment of integrated health system Hartford HealthCare.

Guerisoli referred to the latter partnership as “a foundational relationship for future expansions in the eastern U.S.,” during the call. 

Addus is one of the biggest home-based care providers working in the Medicaid space, so it tracks that possible changes to the program would be top of mind for leaders at the company. But while the program clearly seems to be under threat, even the risks and uncertainty here did not significantly dampen Addus' outlook, maintaining the trend of generally upbeat messaging with regard to future prospects for at-home care.

Based in Frisco, Texas, Addus delivers home care, home health and hospice services to more than 62,000 consumers through 257 locations across 23 states.

In terms of government payers — which includes Medicaid — Addus has over 300 contracts with federal, state, county and municipal governments, according to the company's website. 

Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a budget resolution. While the proposal doesn't specifically name Medicaid, experts believe that a reduction in federal Medicaid spending is on the table. 

Though Addus CEO Dirk Allison said he believes that the impact to the company's business will be minimal, he pointed out the few ways they would be affected by cuts.

“The only states we serve that could be impacted by the lowering or removal of the FMAP floor would be California and Washington, [whose] combined Medicaid revenue represents approximately 2% of our total consolidated revenue,” he said during the call.

The Q4 call was also an opportunity for Allison to speak on the value of the Medicaid program more generally.

“Medicaid is a valuable state and federal lifeline to the extremely at-risk population that we serve, which, if cut, could lead to much higher total cost of care for both states and the federal government,” Allison said. “At Addus, we are focused on our strategy of expanding our services to this population as it relates to home care, which we believe remains valuable to both our states as well as Congress and this administration. We are encouraged by the bipartisan congressional comments opposing cuts to the Medicaid program.”

While Addus' leaders see the company as largely insulated from Medicaid risk, the same cannot be said for every provider that relies on Medicaid. Given that one theme of the recent earnings calls was the ability of at-home care to lower costs and deliver value to payers, I only hope that the government is hearing this message and crafting policy accordingly.

City leaders will explore the possibility of a sale of Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare property after hospital officials proposed restructuring its governance agreement in a way that city staff say would decrease city authority and oversight in broader strategic decisions affecting the healthcare system. 

To position itself for continued growth and new partnerships, the nonprofit, community based hospital wants to create a new health system board whose members wouldn't require "city confirmation authority" to oversee the broader TMH health system. The existing board would continue to manage the hospital's day-to-day operations, according to city agenda materials.

The move touched off an extraordinary staff report on the city's relationship with the hospital, potential acquisitions that could transform TMH in the future and a deep dive into the ownership arrangement to "ensure the city's interests are preserved." 

"In light of TMH's proposal, staff will evaluate whether continued city ownership remains in the city's long-term interest," according to the report in commission agenda materials for next week's meeting. "As part of this analysis, staff will also explore the feasibility and potential advantages of a possible sale of the property, considering all available options and approaches." 

While many were surprised to see the issue pop up on the agenda, City Manager Reese Goad said he added the informational item for city commissioners review because many people don't realize the city owns all of the land, buildings, equipment and other assets associated with TMH — including the fixtures inside the hospital such as beds, X-ray machines and more.

The city's largest healthcare provider began as a city-run hospital in the 1940s and transitioned into an independent, nonprofit healthcare system under a long-term lease agreement with the City.

"I think it's healthy for us to all understand the history and the current status," Goad told the Tallahassee Democrat. "That'll enable a fuller discussion for the city commission to evaluate changing the board status, and really the evolution of health care in our region."

While the city agenda item brought up the specter of a possible acquisition of the hospital by a for-profit or nonprofit entity in line with industry trends, TMH officials said there are "no current plans to transition to a different ownership or operational model."

TMH Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Stephanie Derzypolski said the request for the governance change was partially influenced by the hospital's partnership with FSU Health but mostly driven by its substantial growth over the years, which includes a new healthcare campus taking shape in Panama City.

"In fact, one goal of our relationship with FSU is to preserve our independence and avoid acquisition by a large for-profit hospital system," Derzypolski said in an emailed statement.

The hospital serves 21 counties across North Florida and Georgia, according to agenda materials. It has been in a long-term lease agreement with the city since 1979 when the city selected the non-profit group to control hospital operations. Goad said the rent has been set at $1 a year since the two parties entered into the lease.

"This structure allows the City to retain ownership and oversight while enabling TMH to expand its medical services and partnerships," agenda materials say.

Derzypolski clarified that the hospital has no intentions of terminating its lease with the city, or asking the city to consider selling.

"TMH's request to the city was simply for confirmation of changes to its governing documents in accordance with the provisions of the lease," she said.

If the governance is updated, this will not change "the city's ownership of the property or TMH's responsibility for operating the hospital and its related facilities," Derzypolski said.

Goad said the city will have to fully look at the ramifications and conduct a legal analysis before any decision is made, but he said he wouldn't assume that TMH is looking to pull away from city ownership: "I don't think that'll happen."

However, the city agenda item points to a steady decline in independent and nonprofit hospitals due to financial pressure, forcing many to "merge with larger health systems, including university-affiliated hospitals, larger nonprofit entities, and for-profit entities."

It also highlights UF Health Shands and its expansion through "strategic acquisitions and developments." But Goad said while the comparison of the Gainesville-based hospital system to the TMH-FSU Health partnership is warranted, "it might be premature."

According to agenda materials, the city "retains ownership of the land, buildings, equipment, and other assets associated" with TMH. Goad clarified that assets include everything but vehicles, yet the city has no financial obligation if something needs to be repaired or replaced, meaning there's no impact to the city's budget.

Everything is entirely paid for by TMH, he said.

When the two parties created a long-term lease agreement in 1979, everything on the property was leased to TMH. But even though everything is the city's property, the city cannot take items from the hospital.

"We cannot intervene in their operation," Goad said.

The city manger expects a robust discussion at the Wednesday, March 26, city commission meeting at 3 p.m. at City Hall.

"It could be a meaningful milestone in health care in Tallahassee," he said.

After the article published, City Commissioner Jack Porter reached out to the Tallahassee Democrat and said she has “no interest in the City selling TMH.”

Two motions from the Yukon Party regarding health care in the territory have passed unanimously in the Yukon legislature.

Motions in the legislature are non-binding and usually symbolic.

One motion, introduced by the health critic Brad Cathers, the MLA for Lake Laberge, called for the government to take advantage of the turmoil and tumult south of the border with a marketing campaign targeted at U.S. healthcare workers. The motion also asked YG allow U.S.-certified doctors to work in the Yukon, and give other U.S.-trained healthcare workers a fast pass to a license. It was introduced on March 13.

The other motion was moved by the leader of the official opposition, Currie Dixon. His motion proposed YG strike a joint task force with the Yukon Medical Association to explore ways to reduce administrative burden on doctors. However, as reported by the News, the motion was also introduced by Cathers in the legislature the previous week.

Health Minister Tracy-Anne McPhee amended both motions when they came up in the legislature on March 19.

With the motion regarding U.S. doctors, McPhee proposed a change of wording: instead of urging YG to “take immediate steps” to recruit U.S. health-care workers, the amendment said the government should consult with the Yukon Medical Associations and other professional health care organizations on appropriate recruitment measures, for health-care workers from the U.S. and elsewhere.

She also changed the language to specify that the marketing campaign would be targeted towards Americans.

McPhee said the amendment would make the motion more inclusive. Incorporating the Yukon Medical Association would be able to provide expertise on how to address recruitment and retention, she said.

“They are the front-line individuals who work in these professions,” she said.

“We absolutely must consult with them and work to collaborate with them to determine how we can best spend Yukon resources — those resources being financial, energy, opportunities or marketing — to make sure that we are reaching the audiences that we need to in order to work to solve this problem.”

Cathers accused McPhee of watering down the motion.

“The minister's proposal also takes out any reference to taking immediate action, and what we have seen from this Liberal government is a lot of lip service since we raised this issue two years ago,” said Cathers.

In defending the amendment, Premier Ranj Pillai made reference to British Columbia's U.S.-doctor-poaching plan. He said our southern neighbour is targeting doctors from west coast “blue states.”

McPhee also said she was in contact with B.C. health minister to learn more about the province's outreach to U.S. doctors, and what the Yukon can learn from it.

The Yukon Party members voted against the amendment, but the NDP members supported it. The motion was amended with 10 votes in favour. Yukon Party members did support the amended motion itself, however, and it passed unanimously.

As for the motion to strike a joint task force on reducing the administrative burden on doctors, McPhee introduced an amendment to do away with introducing a special task force altogether, instead asking the Yukon government to simply work with the Yukon Medical Association to find ways to reduce the burden of administration on doctors.

McPhee has previously called the idea of a new task force redundant, a sentiment she repeated in the legislature on March 19.

“I brought this amendment because a task force, Mr. Speaker, is not what is needed,” said McPhee. “We should not duplicate tables that exist already.”

In an email sent out on March 20, cabinet communications listed seven different committees and groups dedicated to healthcare such as the Joint Management Committee, Health Human Resources Steering Committee, Fee Liaison Committee, Joint Administrative Committee, the Physician Payment Advisory Committee, Digital Health Strategy Working Group, and the “Tripartite Leadership” meetings which are called as necessary.

McPhee's amendment received unanimous support from other members in the legislature, with Dixon saying the ultimate goal was getting the administrative load lifted from doctors.

The amended motion also passed unanimously.

The American Hospital Association and the nonprofit Health-ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) are warning of a potential terrorist threat against U.S. hospitals in the coming weeks.

On March 18, user @AXactual made a post on X with details related to the active planning of a coordinated, multi-city terrorist attack on United States health sector organizations, according to the joint threat bulletin.

The terrorist attack on hospitals would reportedly be by ISIS-K, a division of the jihadist group Islamic State, according to The HIPAA Journal. The post was added to the X account of American Kinetix, which claims to be a Christian company in the United States that consists of JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command), the CIA and combat veterans, The HIPAA Journal said.

American Kinetix said it had received reports of possible pre-attack surveillance at hospitals.

The post said chatter in ISIS-K training camps in Afghanistan confirmed planning is in the advanced stages, The HIPAA Journal said. According to the post, ISIS-K would use Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs) followed by armed assaults and hostage scenarios. 

"Intelligence suggests these attacks must occur before Al-Q'aida's planned aviation/D.C. attack, likely making hospitals a prelude to a larger-scale operation," explained the post, according to that report.

The primary targets would be mid-tier cities with low-security facilities, the joint threat bulletin said. With the information claiming multiple simultaneous targets, attackers would likely select health sector facilities with visibly weak security and conduct prior planning coordination. 

It is common practice for individuals contemplating targeted acts of violence to conduct pre-attack surveillance and reconnaissance, the bulletin said. Having a visible security presence can mitigate being chosen as a target during the planning phase of an attack.

The AHA and Health-ISAC said they were sharing the joint threat bulletin out of an abundance of caution to spread awareness of the potential threat. The AHA and Health-ISAC are in close contact with the FBI and said they would provide additional information as it became available.

At this time, no information is available to either corroborate or discount this threat's credibility, the bulletin said. 

"Generally, foreign terrorist groups do not publicize their upcoming attacks," the AHA and Health-ISAC said in the bulletin. "However, this widely viewed post may encourage others to engage in malicious activity directed toward the health sector, so threats of this nature should be taken seriously. Security teams should review emergency management plans and spread awareness of the potential threat internally."

The groups recommended that organizations review and evaluate the coordination and capabilities of physical security, cybersecurity and emergency management plans and to increase relationships with local and federal law enforcement to streamline response efforts during an attack. 

In addition, staff and security teams should remain vigilant for any suspicious activity, as well as people or vehicles on organizational premises or in the vicinity of health sector facilities, the bulletin said. If any are identified, they advise to notify local law enforcement immediately.

The Administrative Court has today rejected the appeal filed by several private care providers in primary care to remove the requirement for Millennium in primary care.

The Administrative Court writes regarding the principle of proportionality:

No evidence has been presented to support that the examples of procedure proposed by the Companies are less intrusive than the introduction of the requirement. The fact that the proposed solutions on the part of the Companies offer an equivalent alternative to the requirement does not lead to the conclusion that the requirement is not necessary to achieve the intended purpose.

Comment from Carasent CEO, Daniel Öhman:

"My impression now is that most private care providers in primary care in VGR believe that they will avoid Millennium, but I would still be surprised if they do not appeal. The Administrative Court does not question that it is possible to achieve VGR's goal without forcing everyone into the same system, but it says that it has not been proven that integration with existing systems is less intrusive than forcing everyone into Millennium. This should be quite obvious and easy to show in the next instance."

PHOENIX — Business leaders hope Arizona will be at the forefront of the AI revolution. From software to robots, the Arizona AI Venture Network hosted a networking event showcasing many of the different AI businesses that call the Valley home.

“Artificial Intelligence is in effect computers that are able to think and reason like human beings with all the known knowledge in the universe stored in their memory banks," Bill Swartz, the founder of the AI Venture Network said.

One of the featured businesses is Revobots.

“Traditionally, robots have had to have very controlled environments, doing the same motion over and over again," Kent Gilson said.

Gilson's robot instead learns from humans about what job they should perform. At the event, the robot is pouring water back and forth into two separate cups after Gilson showed it how to do the task.

Gilson doesn't see it as replacing workers, but helping businesses hire labor they can't get anyway.

“These are just going to go get a job," Gilson said. "Right now there are millions of jobs that are unfilled that we can't find anyone to actually do.”

Applications of AI go far beyond robots. Scottsdale-based Oxygen4Life uses AI to detect chronic diseases. The AI scans the body and compares it to a database of other scans, helping people detect health issues earlier.

“It's the world's most advanced infrared imaging equipment to detect inflammatory and chronic diseases," Mike Maunu said. "I know we'll save lives."

Karl Ernsberger is the founder of SkipCourse, and he is trying to use AI to help educate children.

"A school can only teach a certain number of courses or hire a certain number of teachers," Ernsberger said.

His AI model has students input their own assignments. It then helps them figure out their own learning curriculum.

"The feedback they get leads them to the next assignment," Ernsberger said. "Here's the next thing you should do, here's this field trip you can go on, here's a mentor in the field you're interested in you can connect with."

The World Economic Forum projects AI will create a 21% increase in the U.S. GDP by the end of the decade. Swartz hopes events like this help Arizona be part of that growth.

“I want to create a consortium across the state, rallying around AI and robotics, which helps make Arizona a world-class center.”

Oklahoma's insurance commissioner is warning that people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace could see sizeable increases in their health insurance premiums if federal enhanced Advanced Premium Tax Credits are not extended by Dec. 31.

Commissioner Glen Mulready said the permanent extension of $338 billion of federal health insurance subsidies looks more unlikely, which could lead to a significant spike in health insurance premiums in 2026.

"While there might be other potential solutions considered by Congress this year, Oklahoma's leaders and citizens need to be prepared for the consequences of these subsidies ending with significant changes in health insurance costs anticipated," the Republican commissioner said in a news release.

The warning comes as the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress have been seeking to slash federal spending in the face of a $36 trillion national debt.

Higher costs of health insurance premiums could push individuals to leave the marketplace and shift to Medicaid or be left uninsured, further exacerbating rate increases, according to a state Insurance Department news release.

In response, the Oklahoma Association of Health Plans is calling on the state Legislature to support bills aimed at minimizing additional hikes, including House Bill 1161, Senate Bill 1096 and Senate Bill 1067.

"If the tax credits don't go through, I think we're going to see Oklahomans that are no longer insured or who are (not) going to be able to afford their insurance," said Haley Faulkenberry, the association's executive director. "This is why it's so important that the Legislature pass bills (like these), so we're not overwhelming our premium payers in Oklahoma with additional costs that may not make sense."

Monthly medical bills for about 300,000 state residents enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans could rise as much as 165% next year without the federal subsidies, according to the state Insurance Department.

Mulready said Oklahoma Marketplace's silver plan, a common insurance choice, would rise to $153 a month next year from $58.

While he remains hopeful Congress can come to a compromise to lessen the impact of the tax credit cutoff, Mulready said, "Oklahomans and my fellow elected leaders must understand the potential impact of the expiration of these federal subsidies."

Lower- and middle-income individuals or families who depend on credits to pay for insurance coverage will be most affected.

Faulkenberry said the Legislature needs to make decisions now to protect Oklahomans from increased health insurance premium costs, which could potentially lead to increased uninsured rates in the state.

"The data clearly showed that without congressional action this year, Oklahoma families will face higher health care costs due to the expiration of eAPTCs. We urge those in Washington, D.C., to strongly consider what this means for Oklahomans," Faulkenberry said in a statement.

Oops, something went wrong

Quarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company's progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and the best and worst performers in the healthcare providers & services industry.

The healthcare providers and services sector, encompassing insurers to hospitals to outpatient care facilities, benefit from the consistent demand for healthcare services. Stable or even recurring revenues can be earned through insurance premiums, patient care contracts, and testing services agreements. However, the business models face challenges such as high operational costs especially if significant labor is involved. Reimbursement pressures from public and private payers can impact margins and an evolving regulatory landscape adds uncertainty to it all. Looking forward, this sector is poised to benefit from tailwinds such as the aging population, which means rising prevalence of chronic diseases. There is also broad demand for value-based care models, which emphasize cost efficiency and patient outcomes. Advances in telehealth, data analytics, and personalized medicine are likely to create new revenue opportunities for companies that can successfully digitize. However, headwinds abound, including labor shortages in clinical settings, continued reimbursement cuts, and regulatory scrutiny over pricing and care quality.

North Carolina Health News


					News. Policy. Trends. North Carolina.				





When Gov. Josh Stein rolled out his first budget proposal this week, he presented a $33.65 billion spending plan for lawmakers to consider that he said was “delivering on the promise of North Carolina — that where you come from should never limit how far you can go.”

Stein, a Democrat who served as attorney general for the past eight years and a legislator in the General Assembly before that, noted that such a commitment includes health care.

“We have to invest in strengthening our families and lowering costs,” Stein told reporters at a briefing Wednesday. “Too many families can't afford bare necessities like groceries, housing, health care. So we have to lower costs whenever we can.”

Stein warned of a fiscal revenue cliff that he sees the state approaching if some income and corporate tax cuts favored and pushed through by the Republican-led General Assembly go into effect. He urged lawmakers to delay those cuts, which he said overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and corporate shareholders who live outside North Carolina — and even outside the country in some cases. 

Instead, Stein recommended a child tax credit and cuts for families with low to moderate incomes that could work out to as much as $1,600 for some workers.

Making child care more affordable for North Carolinians was a theme woven throughout Stein's spending proposal, as was looking for ways the state could help alleviate the health care workforce shortage that many facilities are struggling to overcome.



On the child care front, Stein recommended:

North Carolina child care centers have been struggling to survive for several years. Many saw their enrollment numbers drop during the pandemic. Even with an infusion of federal money to help stave off some of those impacts, some centers struggled to keep their doors open. As that support was phased out last year, and centers started to close, child care advocates cautioned about a funding crisis ahead. 

Kristin Walker, state budget director with the Office of State Budget and Management, told reporters at the governor's briefing that there were 80 fewer child care centers now than there were a year ago.

Stein hopes to reverse that trend.

“When we invest in the youngest North Carolinians, we set them up for a lifetime of educational success,” Stein said. “We also help parents who want to stay in the workforce. It's counterintuitive that too many North Carolinians cannot afford to go to work. That's because they can't afford child care if they can find it at all. Getting pushed out of the workforce hurts our workers and hurts our businesses and the economy to the tune of approximately $5 billion a year in lost economic activity.”



Some of Stein's proposals to make a dent in the health care workforce shortages include:

When Stein was attorney general, he played a key role in negotiating a multi-state settlement agreement with opioid distributors and manufacturers that brought more than $750 million over an 18-year period to North Carolina to help the state continue to fight and recover from the crisis.

“While North Carolina has made progress at reducing opioid, fentanyl deaths, still too many people are dying,” Stein said.

Now, he's recommending the creation of a fentanyl law enforcement unit and a prosecutorial team “to investigate and stop the flow of this deadly poison into our communities.” 

“Too many North Carolinians have lost a loved one to a drug overdose or a senseless crime, and we honor the victims by tackling this head on,” he said.



Stein said that to “ensure North Carolinians can access the health care they need,” his proposed spending plan invests more than $770 million in the first year of the biennium and more than $580 million in the second year by leveraging federal funding.

Some of that money will go toward rural health care facilities.

Some will help people with disabilities and traumatic brain injuries who have been advocating for more community-based support for years. Stein proposes spending $35 million by year two of the biennium to support the creation of up to 200 Innovations Waiver slots that go to help people with intellectual and developmental disabilities access community-based services. Another part of that funding will support 75 slots for people to get onto the state's Traumatic Brain Injury support program.

Stein's proposal is only the starting point for a budget process that usually takes weeks, and perhaps months, to complete. But it's not certain how many of his proposals will be adopted by the Republican-led General Assembly, where lawmakers hold the pursestrings for the state. In the coming weeks, the state Senate will release its proposed spending plan, and the state House of Representatives will do the same. Together, they develop one budget for the next two years.

Stein could have more of a say in how that fiscal plan shapes up than his predecessor Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper did during the last two years of his term.

The governor has the power to veto a budget, and the state Senate has enough Republicans to overturn a veto if the objections break down along partisan lines. The state House of Representatives, however,does not have a veto-proof majority this year, leaving more room for negotiations.

Stein's proposal also calls for:

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 21, 2025) — Mental health is a crucial component of overall well-being, and in recent years, there has been growing recognition of the mental health needs of children, adolescents, and young adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 5 children experience a mental health disorder each year. Despite this increased awareness, access to mental health services remains a significant challenge, both in Kentucky and nationwide.

With support from generous donors, providers at Kentucky Children's Hospital (KCH) have launched a new Pediatric Psychology program to address the growing need for mental health services.  With a mission to improve the mental health of children, adolescents, young adults and their families by:

“Launching this new division reflects a commitment from the Department of Pediatrics to include mental health care as part of promoting healthy development in our youth,” said Megan Marsac, Ph.D., chief of the Division of Pediatric Psychology in the UK College of Medicine. “We are thrilled to be bringing mental health providers with specialized skill sets in evidence-based assessments and practices to increase our ability to meet the mental health needs of the children of Kentucky.”

The Pediatric Psychology program comprises an interdisciplinary team that frequently collaborates with child life specialists, nurses, advanced practice nurses, social workers and physicians. Together, this team ensures that both mental and physical health needs are addressed, providing comprehensive care for youth experiencing mental health conditions.

“Mental health care isn't separate from health care — it's an essential part of it,” said Scottie B. Day, physician-in-chief for KCH. “With this new division, we are reinforcing our commitment to treating the whole child and bridge the gap in access to critical mental health services for children, adolescents, and young adults.”

The division is expanding its team by recruiting additional psychologists with specialized skills to meet the growing demand for mental health services. This expansion aims to increase access to care and reduce wait times.

The program's current clinical services include:

The team also conducts research on methods that can be used to improve youth and families' experiences with medical care, their adaptation to medical conditions as well as their overall health. Clinically relevant research and quality improvement projects help identify youth and families who may benefit from mental health support, determine factors associated with mental health symptoms and evaluate treatments to enhance mental health outcomes and quality of life. The team will also partner with medical teams on identifying youth who are at risk for suicide and helping to connect them to services. 

As a division of the UK College of Medicine, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students will have the opportunity to learn about in evidence-based mental health interventions, clinically relevant research and trauma-informed care, as well providing trauma-informed care training to medical providers. 

Patients and families who wish to be connected to these services should contact their primary care provider. If your child is considering suicide, go to the nearest emergency room, call or text 988 or chat on 988lifeline.org right away. The Lifeline provides 24/7, free and confidential support for people in distress, prevention and crisis resources for you or your loved ones.

UK HealthCare is the hospitals and clinics of the University of Kentucky. But it is so much more. It is more than 10,000 dedicated health care professionals committed to providing advanced subspecialty care for the most critically injured and ill patients from the Commonwealth and beyond. It also is the home of the state's only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that cares for the tiniest and sickest newborns, the region's only Level 1 trauma center and Kentucky's top hospital ranked by U.S. News & World Report. 

As an academic research institution, we are continuously pursuing the next generation of cures, treatments, protocols and policies. Our discoveries have the potential to change what's medically possible within our lifetimes. Our educators and thought leaders are transforming the health care landscape as our six health professions colleges teach the next generation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals, spreading the highest standards of care. UK HealthCare is the power of advanced medicine committed to creating a healthier Kentucky, now and for generations to come.

THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn. — When Nolan Hunt was diagnosed with autism at 18 months, doctors warned his mother he might never speak. But nearly a decade later, the 10-year-old has defied expectations, chatting about everything from his favorite toys to his dream of becoming a YouTuber.

His mother, Kendra Hunt, remembers the uncertainty she felt when she first received his diagnosis.

"Felt like I was losing my child at that point, and I wanted to do everything in my power to make sure that he wouldn't continue to regress anymore," she said.

Determined to give Nolan the best chance to thrive, Kendra turned to Sanford Thief River Falls Behavioral Health Center, where a dedicated team of specialists began working with him.

"We had occupational therapy from Sanford twice a week. We had speech twice a week, and then I had early intervention services coming into our house once a week," Kendra said.

Nolan has been working with occupational therapist Vanessa Thompson and speech-language pathologist Ashley Holtan for nearly 10 years, developing motor and communication skills through play-based therapy.

"They see it as fun. We're just playing," Thompson said. "But in turn, we're using it to build on a skill."

"Kendra has used a lot of support and a lot of support systems with Nolan," Holtan added. "I feel like that's why he has made so much progress."

His older brother, Mason Hunt, has also played a big role in Nolan's journey.

"Being almost non-verbal to speaking in full sentences and stuff like that," Mason said, reflecting on his brother's progress.

Now, Nolan is full of energy and personality.

"I want to drink real cow milk," he said with a playful slurp.

And his ambitions are just as big.

"I want to be a YouTuber that makes plush videos," Nolan shared.

With his family's unwavering support and the continued guidance of the Sanford team, Nolan is well on his way to achieving his dreams.

The Sanford Thief River Falls Behavioral Health Center offers a range of services for children and adults, including occupational therapy, speech-language pathology and clinical psychology. Many in the community are surprised to find such resources available in a town of fewer than 10,000 people.

For Nolan and his family, those services have made all the difference, they said.

For pregnant women in the U.S., the use of oral health services during pregnancy remains low, with fewer than 40% seeking preventive oral health care. So reports a new study conducted by the Oral Health Workforce Research Center, part of the Center for Health Workforce Studies at the University at Albany's College of Integrated Health Sciences, which was featured on the cover of this month's issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association.

UAlbany researchers analyzed data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a longstanding data repository maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2016 and 2020. Disparities in gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders were highlighted, with higher odds of these pregnancy complications among lower-income and minority women. 

Lack of regular preventive oral health care and delaying dental treatment during pregnancy increases the risk of developing dental diseases such as periodontal disease, which is potentially associated with gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders.

The research team found that pregnant women who received preventive oral health care or visited a dentist or a dental clinic for oral health problems during pregnancy did in fact have a lower risk of developing gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders.

Our findings reinforce the connection between oral health and overall health. Integrating oral health education and services into maternal health care and expanding the oral health workforce through training, better distribution and interprofessional collaboration with prenatal care providers can improve access to oral health services for pregnant women - especially in underserved populations - and help reduce the risks of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders."

The former US Open champion takes on one of the tour's in-form players in a tough second-round encounter

Emma Raducanu faces a tricky second-round test at the Miami Open against in-form American and namesake, Emma Navarro.

The former US Open champion stormed through her opening encounter against 19-year-old Japanese wildcard Sayaka Ishii, a former top junior player ranked 188th in the world. 

Raducanu won 6-2, 6-1 in a little over an hour to set up a meeting with home favourite and US Open semi-finalist Navarro, who is seeded eighth in Miami and received a first-round bye. 

Her dominant first-round win was achieved without the help of coach Vladimir Platenik, who she was working with on a trial basis that ultimately ended after just two weeks. 

Follow all the action with The Independent's liveblog:

A thumping forehand from Navarro puts the American on her way towards another hold. It's been an impressive response from her after losing the tiebreak narrowly. 

A double-fault from Raducanu gets Navarro into a deuce game but the 22-year-old holds her nerve behind the second serve. She is then able to find the forehand pass to take the game as Navarro closed the net. 

A bit of a ‘what-if' game from Raducanu, who floated a return long and then missed a couple of chances to step in and put the ball away. The unforced errors are creeping into Raducanu's game. 

Navarro has been clean in this second set and has consolidated the break. 

Excellent again from Navarro, who has changed the direction of the match with her creative play from the baseline. A passing winner puts Navarro in position to break and she takes it. Advantage to the American. 

Quality drop shot from Navarro to get on the board in the second-set, with the spin beating Raducanu. 

Raducanu maintains the momentum found in the tiebreak and holds her opening game with a confident forehand strike, 

Raducanu's serve has stood up to the pressure, especially on the second serve. 

Take a bow, Emma Raducanu! She saves two set points in the tiebreak, before winning the decider! Brilliant defence again from Raducanu, and she roars as Navarro misses on the final forehand. 

She leads the World No 10. 

Navarro gets a look at set-point and she takes over the rally and thumps the smash. Great defence from Raducanu on the backhand side, and Navarro misses on the backhand down the line! Great save from Raducanu, and it's 6-6. 

What a return from Raducanu to earn the mini-break back, directing the backhand for a clear winner. 

Raducanu had chances to win the next point but Navarro wins the exchange at the net. Raducanu is down 4-5, but it's on serve. 

Fiercely tight during the tiebreak. Remaining on serve through the first five points. Navarro wins the battle of the backhands and forces Raducanu into the miss to take the mini-break into the changeover. 

4-2 to the American.

Nick Kyrgios hadn't won a match on the ATP Tour in over two years when he traveled to Florida for the Miami Open.

The 29-year-old last won a professional match at the 2022 Tokyo Open, as injuries derailed Kyrgios‘ career.

Eager to return to winning ways at the Miami Open, Kyrgios bravely fought back from a set down to beat Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

The Aussie was delighted to secure his first win in years, as he now looks ahead to his second round clash with Russia's Karen Khachanov.

He did, however, take the time to reveal what McDonald said to him at the net after their nail-biting first-round encounter.

Speaking to the Tennis Channel after his win over McDonald, Kyrgios shared what the American told him after their Miami Open clash.

“I made a conscious effort to try and make a high percentage of first serves,” he said.

“[McDonald] loves getting into those long rallies and his ball was coming through so low.

“I hadn't played a match like that in two years, where it was very hard to get under and over the ball on my forehand.

“My serve got me through the match in the end.

“We shook hands and he just said ‘great serving'.

“I think if I hadn't had served that well I wouldn't have come through.”

Kyrgios served as well as he had in 2025 against McDonald, hitting 13 aces and 79% of his first serves.

The Australian reflected on his time spent away from the sport, explaining what he found ‘very boring' over recent years.

“When you are injured it is like you have to train, then rehab, then physio, then gym and then you do it again,” said Kyrgios.

“It becomes very boring in a way.

“You see other guys you used to beat and play with and now they are at the top of the sport and you're like wow, this is where I was.

“I love seeing all these guys have success but at the same time I was like I know I have the game and the level to be there and still win at this level.”

Kyrgios was glad to finally secure his first win back as he admitted their were some ‘dark days' earlier in 2025.

“Honestly I was getting a bit discouraged thinking when is this win going to come and it came in my third match in,” he said.

“I didn't win at the Australian Open or Indian Wells and then it came yesterday.

“Mentally it was hard, I saw some dark days, I was like is this the end but I guess this puts a bit more petrol in the tank.”

He then gave fans a promising fitness update ahead of his second-round match against the world number 23.

“I hit a lot of balls today, I actually feel pretty good,” said Kyrgios.

“I am excited to get out there against [Karen] Khachanov.”

Kyrgios and Khachanov last played one another at the 2022 US Open tournament, with a place in the semi-finals up for grabs.

After former champions Daniil Medvedev and Rafael Nadal fell to defeat in the fourth round, a new Grand Slam winner was guaranteed in New York, as many tipped the Aussie to win the title.

It wasn't to be, however, as the Russian battled through in a five-set war to win 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, securing his spot in the last four.

Khachanov won in a deciding set, something that was required in the pair's two previous meetings on the ATP Tour.

Only time will tell if a third set is needed when Kyrgios and Khachanov face off at the Miami Open on Friday, March 21.

DELRAY BEACH — Tennis superstar Coco Gauff has already stamped her footprint in history as one of the greats. Now she has the shoes to back that up.

She returned to her hometown of Delray Beach this week to unveil her latest signature tennis shoe in collaboration with New Balance, just before she was set to play in the Miami Open this week. In front of family, kids and community members, she rolled out the shoe in Pompey Park, the Delray Beach park she once played in as a child. She called it the "Coco Delray," a name inspired by her hometown.

“This community means a lot to me; I grew up playing on those courts, just me and my dad,” Gauff said during her appearance Tuesday. “This is what raised me, and I want to show the world the importance of this community and community in general, and uplifting those around me because they helped uplift me to be here.”

Gauff collaborated with the brand in August 2024 to release the Coco CG2, a performance-based shoe inspired by Gauff's favorite New Balance shoe, according to the brand's site. Now releasing her second shoe with the company, the 21-year-old says she wanted to have a “classic design that people can wear at any time, at any moment.”

“I dreamt of winning trophies, but I never thought of everything that would come with it,” she beamed. “I never thought I would be here with my own shoe … It was never on any of my cards to have my own shoe, let alone a second model with New Balance,” she said.

Gauff's grandmother, or "G-Ma" as she called her, Yvonne Odom, played a significant part in the campaign. Odom, a well-known face in the Delray community, expressed great pride in her granddaughter on Tuesday, saying, “I'm just so proud.”

“I've lived here my entire adult life. Her mom and dad grew up here, and I'm just happy for this city,” Odom said. “We always knew what a special place this was; now the whole world is going to know.”

The shoe was created in partnership with creative director of the campaign video Joseph Robinson, a prominent name in streetwear, best known as Joe Freshgoods. The New Balance campaign featured a conversation between Odom and Joe Freshgoods behind a cinematic display showcasing Gauff and local residents — some young tennis players present at the event.

This project was his first time acting as a creative director. “I was tasked to make it feel more authentic to the community… I wanted to make sure it felt Black,” he said. “I'm all about a Black, proud community.”

It is evident Tuesday's event was more than just a gathering to celebrate the launch of Gauff's new shoe. It was a moment to celebrate and give back to her community. 

Surrounded by an audience of families and children bearing proud faces, the trio took to the stage in a panel-style discussion to share the inspiration behind the shoe and thank the community — who Gauff says has been supportive the entire way.  

“I am very thankful and very happy that people in my community are supporting this,” Gauff said.

And to Gauff, "The Delray" is more than just a shoe; it's an ode to her city.

“The care that I was raised in and this community is why I want to make sure everything that I do is a reflection of who I am,” she said. “The first thing they see when y'all see I play, it says ‘Coco Gauff from Delray Beach, Florida,' so I got to make sure I represent it right.”

Giving back to the community remains a priority for Gauff, following in the footsteps of her grandmother, who has been named a community leader after integrating what is now Atlantic Community High School and teaching in the city for more than 45 years.

“There's no town like Delray Beach, Florida,” Odom said.

The nine-time WTA singles winner feels public service is something ingrained in her.

“I feel like it's just in my blood,” she said. “My dad told me as a young girl, ‘You can change the world with your racket.'''

Gauff shared that accessibility was also a major priority while making the shoe, both in price point and tennis level. Listed at $109.99, Gauff and New Balance aimed to keep the shoe accessible for customers.

“The shoe was made with the inspiration for being for everyone, and being for all levels of tennis, and just life,” Gauff said. “This was kept in mind just to be accessible for everyone with the pricepoint of the shoe and just for all levels to play in; and comfortability.”

Spread across the park was a wide range of games, food, and music, provided as a fun way to bring together an already close-knit community. Matching residents in the crowd, Gauff sported her new shoes while playing a round of tennis matches with local kids.

In her first match at the Miami Open, third-seeded Gauff beat fellow American Sofia Kenin in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0 on Thursday. Gauff was scheduled to face Greece's Maria Sakkari on Sunday in the Round of 32.

Gauff said during Tuesday's appearance in Delray Beach that she hopes for another Grand Slam this year (she won the 2023 U.S. Open singles title and the 2024 French Open doubles title). However, in her personal life, Gauff said she wants to continue uplifting and giving back to the community. 

“If I did my job and I go down as a great tennis player, I failed. I want to go down as a great tennis player, and a great human, and a great humanitarian,” Gauff said.

Andy Murray's coaching partnership with Novak Djokovic continues to make headlines in 2025, as the pair prepare for the Miami Open.

24-time Major champion Djokovic joined forces with Murray ahead of the 2025 season, searching for further success on the ATP Tour.

The Brit coached Djokovic to the semi-finals of the Australian Open earlier this year, where he retired injured against Alexander Zverev having dropped the first set.

Returning alongside the Serb at Indian Wells, Murray oversaw a disappointing second-round exit at the hands of Botic van de Zandschulp.

With Djokovic set to make his return to action at the Miami Open, Murray took the time to watch two of tennis' brightest stars battle it out.

Murray took to X to share his thoughts on Joao Fonseca's thrilling win over Learner Tien in the first round of the Miami Open.

What an incredible atmosphere 👏👏Fonseca and Tien are amazing talents! Tennis isn't broken after all 😉

“What an incredible atmosphere,” he said.

“[Joao] Fonseca and [Learner] Tien are amazing talents.

“Tennis isn't broken after all.”

The atmosphere was electric during Fonseca and Tien's first-round clash, as fans cheered the Brazilian on to a 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 victory.

Even Fonseca was surprised by the support he received from the crowd, writing ‘Am I in Brazil' on the camera lens after the match.

Murray's remark about the sport not being ‘broken after all' could well be referring to the controversial news of the PTPA lawsuit against the tennis tours, which broke earlier this week.

With the likes of Fonseca and Tien leading the way, there shouldn't be too much to worry about as fans continue to enjoy the youngsters battle it out on the ATP Tour.

Fonseca and Tien may only have become professionals recently, but they have already played one another three times.

It's the Brazilian who has had the better of things, winning all three matches, establishing his dominance against the American.

Fonseca beat Tien to win the Next Gen ATP Finals title last year, lifting the biggest trophy of his young career in Saudi Arabia.

They both enjoyed big wins at the Australian Open earlier this year and have continued their rise up the rankings, now residing in the world's top 70.

Tien will drop a place following his defeat to Fonseca but the Brazilian has an opportunity to rise even further should he win his second-round match in Florida.

Fonseca will be up against it in the second round of the Miami Open as he takes on 19th seed Ugo Humbert.

The pair played in a Davis Cup qualifying match last month, as Humbert proved too much for the youngster, breezing past him in straight sets.

Fonseca played some thrilling tennis at times but couldn't keep up, losing 5-7, 3-6, as Brazil's title dreams were crushed by France as they fell to a convincing 0-4 defeat.

The Frenchman went on to win his seventh ATP title shortly after, taking down Hamad Medjedovic in the Marseille final.

It remains to be seen who will come out on top in their second career meeting but it will certainly be worth a watch when Humbert plays Fonseca for a place in the third round on Saturday, March 22.

Kim Clijsters enjoyed a superb career on the court, which involved 41 WTA titles and a rise to world number one.

Clijsters would love to play Aryna Sabalenka, with the latter currently occupying the role of WTA number one as she looks for more success at the 2025 Miami Open.

The Belarusian boasts three Grand Slam titles in her stunning career so far, one short of the tally Clijsters finished her career with.

The Belgian won three times at the US Open and once at the Australian Open, as well as reaching four other Grand Slam finals.

Now retired, the 41-year-old has been looking back on that stellar career, which involved a fantastic win-loss record of 523-132.

Speaking at the recent Indian Wells tournament, she explained the story behind her current role as honorary president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

“So I got inducted in 2017 together with Andy Roddick, and we had an amazing kind of four days of celebrations, to a point where I feel like it was so overwhelming, to be celebrated like that where you get to see your own career, reflect on your own career, but then also, it takes you all the way back to where tennis started for me and who my inspirations were,” Clijsters said on The Sit-Down podcast.

“To see my pictures or my memorabilia, my trophies, next to Steffi Graf's trophies, and Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez.

“All those women, they were my heroes growing up and so the connection and the warmth I guess too that you feel when you're there and when you can celebrate it that weekend was the reason I think why I said yes when Todd Martin called me a few years ago asking if I wanted to join the team.”

Clijsters's heroes are, of course, also true legends of the sport, and have all left a superb legacy behind them.

The current generation will be doing their utmost to follow in their footsteps, with the likes of Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff perhaps leading the way at this moment in time.

Despite saying goodbye to her playing career, New Jersey-based Clijsters remains a huge tennis fan, having also been inspired by a handful of other female icons.

“I love the sport, like I fell in love with it when I was almost five years old, and I still love playing,” she said. “People ask me do you miss playing here? And I'm like, no I don't, I don't miss playing here. I still love playing tennis, and it can be in a local, small little tennis court in New Jersey or any public court.

“I love the sport, and yeah it's a true passion. And I know it's very rare. I see it with my kids too, I know it was really rare to have found something very naturally that wasn't kind of pushed on me from my parents or anything, to find something that you've loved from such a young age, and to grow have it grow into me still being connected into the sport, right?

“And I never thought when I was a professional player that I would still be connected and have this whole tennis family at the Hall of Fame, and now being able to do the Be Legendary program, and talk to young kids around the world.

“I never thought of those things, and it's amazing how tennis kind of brings people together. And that's the beauty of the sport, is that we get… the sport is so well known around the world, and we have to thank a lot of the women that kind of paved the way for us early on. “The Billie Jean Kings, and from there on [Martina] Navratilova, Chrissy Evert, there's so many to name.

“I'll never forget that, I was 18 years old when I played, no I was younger, but I played the juniors at the US Open and listened to Billie Jean King speak.

“She has a very powerful personality, and her passion is so strong, and just listening to her at a young age, I think I was 14, and listening to her talk about the impact and what it took for them to get to the level where tennis was back then, and I'm talking maybe 1998, or so, it just stuck with me to always be ready to sign your autographs, take the pictures, be available, accessible to the media, the fans, and that's what it is.”

Novak Djokovic has admitted he disagrees with parts of the lawsuit brought against tennis' governing bodies by the player organisation he co-founded.

The Professional Tennis Players Association announced earlier this week that it was taking legal action against the ATP, WTA, International Tennis Federation and International Tennis Integrity Agency, accusing the organisations of “systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare”.

The PTPA was launched four years ago by Djokovic and Canadian Vasek Pospisil, and its statement on Tuesday said the action was being taken on behalf of all professional players.

Tennis has lost its way. Players and fans have been left behind. And after years of inaction by the powers at large, players and the PTPA were left with no choice but to pursue legal actions to force real change.

Djokovic's name was notably absent among the plaintiffs for the US suit, though, and he told reporters at the Miami Open that he was not entirely in agreement with what had been filed.

“I felt like I don't need to sign the letter because I want other players to step up,” said the Serbian.

“This is a classic lawsuit, so lawyers to lawyers, type of situation. So, to be quite frank with you, there are things that I agree with in the lawsuit and then there are also things that I don't agree with.

“And I found that maybe some wording was quite strong in there, but I guess the legal team knows what they are doing and what kind of terminology they're supposed to use in order to get the right effect.”

What an incredible atmosphere 👏👏Fonseca and Tien are amazing talents! Tennis isn't broken after all 😉

— Andy Murray (@andy_murray) March 21, 2025

The ATP and WTA both hit back strongly at the PTPA's allegations, while Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz was explicit in stating that he did not support the legal action.

Djokovic insisted he was not trying to cause rifts, saying: “I've never been a fan of division in our sport but I've always fought for better representation and influence of and positioning of the players globally in our sport, which I think is still not where I think it should be.”

Andy Murray, who is in Florida coaching the Serbian, appeared to reference the drama in a message on social media site X after watching young stars Joao Fonseca and Learner Tien battle it out.

“What an incredible atmosphere Fonseca and Tien are amazing talents! Tennis isn't broken after all,” wrote the Scot, ending with a winking emoji.

ORLANDO - After splitting a pair of top-10 matchups in Orlando to open Big 12 play, the No. 11 UCF men's tennis team will embark on its first road trip in over a month, traveling west for contests at BYU and No. 52 Utah.

Each meeting marks the second all-time between the program's, as the Knights (15-5, 1-1) will be in for a pair of difficult contests at altitude. The Cougars (11-4, 0-2) have been in and out of the ITA rankings this season, dropping both of their conference openers last weekend, while the Utes (13-5, 2-0) continue their climb following a 4-1 triumph over Texas Tech.

LAST TIME OUT

With 4-3 clinch wins being a staple of head coach Lloyd Bruce-Burgess' tenure at UCF, it was only fitting that the Knights secured their first Big 12 win of the season in a dramatic winner-take-all tiebreak over No. 10 Arizona. Dominating the doubles point once again, the Black and Gold secured wins on courts two through four, headlined by Mehdi Benchakroun's valiant triumph over ninth-ranked Jay Friend to tally the squad's second win over the Wildcats this season.

Two days prior, the Knights took the doubles point and four first sets in singles against reigning national champions TCU, however, the second-ranked Horned Frogs weathered the UCF charge to take the match, 4-2.

THE OPPONENTS

BYU - Friday at 6:30 p.m. ET

Last year's contest between the Cougars and Knights, the first all-time, was a highlight for the team's historic 2024 campaign. Down multiple match points, Paul Colin battled back to secure a 4-3 win for UCF, making for an anticipated rematch in the mountains.

A difficult 4-3 defeat in Stillwater to Oklahoma State preceded another loss to Texas Tech in Lubbock, 4-1. While the Cowboys (Knights win, 4-0) serve as the only common opponent between the two squads, both will author similar lineups to last year's contest.

Utah - Sunday at 3 p.m. ET

A lone meeting in 2007 in which UCF won, 6-1, is the only history between these two programs. The Utes have won five of their last six, including a strong triumph over Texas Tech where they secured wins on courts one, three and four.

Berk Bugarikj leads the team on court one and is ranked 97th in the nation, while Reid Jarvis and Dante Carlos Teramo sit at No. 52 in the doubles edition.

The Miami Open attracts the world's top tennis players to South Florida. Last year's event unexpectedly led to a cancer diagnosis for Canadian tennis star Gabriela Dabrowski.

Dabrowski had an impressive 2024 season. The 32-year-old won her first Olympic medal, advanced at Wimbledon, and reached her career-high doubles ranking at No. 3 in the world. But her most vicious opponent wasn't on the court – it was in the form of cancer.

“Pretty much a year ago, we have these very comprehensive physicals that look at lots of different facets of our health, and one of them is to see a general doctor," she told NBC6. "And I'd had this lump for a little while, and I thought it might be growing, and I asked her to check it out. And she said, 'Oh, I'm really not sure what it is, but because I'm not sure, I want you to get a scan.'"

That was at the 2024 Miami Open during a health screening required for every female player. Things escalated quickly from there and scans would reveal it was breast cancer. Yet only her inner circle knew about it.

“I think I compartmentalized with the help of a few key people in my life," Dabrowski said of playing while knowing about her diagnosis. "And then with the tennis part, it was like this bonus of, 'OK, can I still play?' Like, in between surgeries, I could play a little bit."

Dabrowski was able to compete alongside her doubles partner, Erin Routliffe, all while undergoing treatment and surgeries. She didn't just play a little. She dominated all while holding on to this secret. She revealed her life-altering news later in an Instagram post that she said took months to write.

“Going into the new year, I was like, 'I'm ready, I'm ready to share what I went through,' and my main goal is to just hopefully have a positive impact because I really want women to know that early screenings save lives,” Dabrowski said.



The cancer diagnosis became a catalyst for what she describes as sustained change.

“I feel really lucky to be able to play a sport for a living, to be able to travel the world, although travel days will never be fun, and I don't think that can change. Yeah, I just feel a lot more grateful to play tennis as my job and also have the opportunity to kind of get my health back,” she said.

Dabrowsit got her health back and has returned to the event that marked the beginning of her cancer journey, this time, with renewed passion and strength. She is on long-term treatment with at least five years of endocrine therapy. 

The Women's Tennis Association invited NBC6 inside the physicals that first set Dabrowski on her cancer journey at the Miami Open, and it's the first stop every female player makes before they hit the court.

Rain or shine, the Blue Devils took care of business. 

Despite a stormy start at San Diego State March 13, Duke rallied to dominate the Aztecs 4-0 in their first meeting since 1992. Duke then returned to a sunny Durham to handle Yale 7-0 on Tuesday. This was the seventh-ranked Blue Devils' third straight shutout match and first match of the season in their outdoor Ambler Stadium. 

The match started at 6 p.m. — four hours behind schedule — as the gloomy conditions persisted.

“I can't remember, in my time at Duke, playing a match where we practice one of the five days before a match,” head coach Jamie Ashworth said. “... We got here on Monday and didn't practice and couldn't practice on Tuesday and couldn't practice yesterday.”

“For us, mentally, we just try to prepare before the game,” sophomore Shavit Kimchi said. “It's not going to be easy, and we all told ourselves, “It might be nasty today, it might not be the cleanest, but we're here to fight. We're here to get the job done.”

Duke continued its strong doubles performance, with senior Ellie Coleman and freshman Irina Balus disposing of their opponents 7-5. Kimchi and freshman Ava Krug, meanwhile, lost their set 6-2. With the point in limbo, senior Emma Jackson and freshman Liv Hovde delivered for the Blue Devils with a 6-4 victory. 

“They've hit 1000 balls this spring, they've hit millions of balls in their lives, and they know how to play tennis,” Ashworth said of the team. “I think that they did a really good job of handling that adversity, because it easily could have gone the other way.”

Moving into singles, Kimchi's performance remained sluggish but competitive. Losing the first set 6-4, the Sdey Hemed, Israel, native pushed through long, rhythmic rallies from the baseline to nab the second set 6-4. 

Meanwhile, Hovde and sophomore Eleana Yu leapt out to early leads to win their first sets, 6-3, 6-2. Yu went on to wrap up her second set 6-1, increasing Duke's margin to 2-0. As Hovde's second set progressed, the Daniel Island, S.C., native and her opponent tried to use high, deep shots to get the ball out of the other's reach. Although each game remained competitive, she edged ahead and continued to build each point for a 7-5 win.

Junior Katie Codd narrowly secured her first set 7-6 with a 7-3 tiebreaker, while Jackson stormed her way to a commanding 6-1 win. In Jackson's second set, however, the La Grange Park, Ill., native found herself evenly matched and pushed around the baseline, losing 6-3 as she attempted to respond.

With one set in the bag, Kimchi was ready for a final showdown. With the match score 3-0, it fell to Kimchi, Jackson, Codd or Balus to clinch and extend the Blue Devils' win streak to six matches. 

“Eventually, I got to the second set, I got a lot of confidence from that, and then [Coach] Jamie [Ashworth] was doing a great job with trying to motivate me when I was playing the third set, and pushed me to do the right thing and make a better decision when I'm playing,” Kimchi said. 

Jackson and Balus began their third sets well before Kimchi. However, as they remained bogged down in dogfights against stubborn yet increasingly tired opposition, Kimchi pulled ahead and started her match-deciding set. Jackson made her opponent run all around the court, her boundary-testing shots getting the better of San Diego State's Gloria Alogo, while Balus's early lead slowly narrowed.

Taking advantage of her reach and height, Kimchi steadied herself and put the Aztecs' Zoe Olmos on the defensive. Her shots remained patient as her opponent's overtures failed to yield a momentum-breaking mistake. Leading 5-0, Kimchi became more aggressive; with an ace aimed down the center of the court, she clinched the ninth match of her career.

“[Kimchi] didn't have the best of fall seasons, to be honest with you. I think she's coming around and starting to play like she's capable of playing,” Ashworth explained. “I've talked to her a lot … We've not wavered in our belief [in] her.”

Physically, the stands of the outdoor Ambler Stadium were pretty sparse. But what was lacking in occupation was made up for in noise — specifically that of the rowdy Duke men's tennis team seated above court five. 

“You know what's better than one bagel?” shouted a player. 

“TWO!” responded the rest of the team.

The bagel in this scenario refers to the “0” in a 6-0 first set, which was delivered hot by Duke's Coleman to Yale's Mirabelle Brettkelly. A double-bagel was possible for Coleman.

Yet, the Midland, Mich., native's game streak ended when Brettkelly finally managed to hold onto her serve to make it 1-1 in the second set. 

At deuce, Coleman sprinted to reach a dropshot from Brettkelly, lunging to make contact with the ball before dropping her racket and falling to the ground. The senior's hustle was rewarded — the ball landed short on the other side, and Brettkelly was unable to reach it. Coleman continued her hustle against her Bulldog opponent's newfound stamina and ended the match 6-0, 6-4. 

Coleman was the second singles win in her team's eventual sweep of Yale, as Duke won all six singles matches plus the doubles point. 

“We want to make sure that we continue to make this a really tough place for people to play,” Ashworth said. “Whether that's the crowd, whether that's our men's team [being] out here and being a little bit vocal, whatever it is. We want to make sure that teams know … It's one of the tougher places to play in the country.” 

Not every set came easily, though. After double-faulting in the first-set tiebreaker, Kimchi was down 3-1 on court three. Despite only a two-point difference, it looked as though the momentum had shifted to Yale's Julia Werdiger. 

But, as the late-afternoon heat wore off, the sophomore Blue Devil kept her cool — winning the next six points to close out the set 7-6 and winning her next 6-2. 

“The biggest thing for us in those moments and those matches is not to play scared,” Ashworth said. “For the most part, we did that well … I think in singles, we're just deeper than them.” 

This roster depth was obvious from the start. In singles, Duke won the first game on every court except court three. Irina Balus, ranked No. 12 nationally, overpowered Yale's Shyla Aggarwal for an early 3-0 lead on court two. The freshman star dropped her first game in a disappointing deuce loss, which had been replayed due to a stray ball from a neighboring court. However, Balus was unfazed and went right back to overpowering Aggarwal. At 5-2, the Slovakia native hit a deep shot down the line to break the Bulldog yet again. The Blue Devil quickly closed out a second set at 6-2, earning Duke its first of six singles points. 

Blue Devils Eleana Yu and Katie Codd on courts four and six, respectively, both earned four straight points to win their first sets 6-3. Later, Yu closed out her match 6-3, 6-4, and Codd finished 6-3, 6-3. 

The first win of the night started with Kimchi and partner Ava Krug in their doubles matchup against Angela Huang and Werdiger on court two. The Yale tandem suffered many unforced errors that gave the more consistent Kimchi-Krug pairing the upper hand. The Blue Devils came out with a 6-2 win, redeeming their doubles loss to San Diego State. 

Duke's Hovde and Jackson also pulled their weight, winning 6-4 against Erin Ha and Brettkelly on court three. The Blue Devils' win here was enough to earn Duke the overall doubles point, halting Balus and Coleman's 4-4 contest on court one. 

“I think as a team we are doing really well,” Hovde said. “Every match is tough, so I think we're really resilient out here. It was our first outdoor match [at home], so I think we did really well.” 

Duke will be back at Ambler Stadium Friday at 6 p.m. to kick-off conference play against No.10 N.C. State.

That might seem like progress to Raducanu and her fans; even if her record is so-so, at least she has been healthy for a few months straight now. While has shown a couple of glimpses of her 2021 self in beating Maria Sakkari and Ekaterina Alexandrova, she hasn't been able to sustain any top-level consistency for long.The good news for Raducanu is that Navarro, despite her winning record, hasn't been the player she was a season ago. Yes, she won a title in Merida, and made the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, but there have also been some perplexing losses—to Leylah Fernandez in Doha, Sorana Cirstea in Dubai, and Donna Vekic last week in Indian Wells. Navarro doesn't get a ton of free points on her serve, which means everything else has to be extra sharp for her to succeed. That was true during her breakout 2024, but not during her follow-up 2025 thus far.Still, in the battle of the Emmas, Navarro is the cleaner ball-striker, better mover, and more complete player.

Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo were seemingly still in love when they filmed Southern Charm season 10 — but after breaking up, not all their onscreen interactions have aged well.

“My whole life is business now. That's the fun stuff for me now,” Craig told Austen Kroll during season 10, episode 4, which aired in January. “Making money, getting healthy and f—ing my girlfriend.”

Craig's life motto for season 10 — which was filmed before he and Paige parted ways in December 2024 after three years of dating — isn't the only thing that makes Us do a double take watching it back.



Many of Craig's plans were made with Paige in mind, including his choice to freeze his sperm and delay his vision of becoming a dad until she was ready. The two also were very relaxed about their hopes for marriage, which hits differently now that they aren't a couple.

“She is doing housewife duties,” Madison LeCroy pointed out during episode 5 after Paige made floral arrangements for a party at Craig's house. She then asked, “What about just engagement without being engaged?”

Craig responded that the duo were “basically” engaged — and Paige didn't disagree.

Scroll down to see which of Craig and Paige's comments from season 10 haven't gotten better with age:


“For Paige and I, time spent in the backyard, that's our quality time,” Craig revealed during episode 3, which aired in December 2024, showing off his finished Charleston house. “When we first started dating, we were out and about all the time.”

He explained, “We just I guess [have] grown with each other. We'd rather spend the time at home relaxing than out partying. I built this sanctuary for us to be away from the world and be able to relax and connect.”

Craig shocked pals Austen and Shep Rose during episode 4 when he revealed, “Me and Paige have decided to freeze my sperm.”

His conversation with Paige, however, was equally as surprising. “I was thinking about freezing my sperm,” Craig told his then-girlfriend. “That's like the craziest thing in the world,” a stunned Paige said in response.

Craig went through with the process, telling his friends that it was Paige's decision to hold off on having kids, confessing that “without any influence from Paige” he would have his own timeline. “You date a little while, then you get married, then you have kids,” he said.

During the same episode, Craig said, “I want kids one day. Have I ever told you that I want kids right now?” He claimed, “I never said I want kids right now.”

Austen, however, told the cameras, “Ever since I've known Craig, he's wanted to get married, wanted to have kids.” Austen added, “I'm not entirely sold that Craig wants what Paige wants.”

Craig later confessed that his timeline had shifted after meeting the Summer House star. “The version of life that I saw myself living isn't what I'm living, which is this stable home that I grew up with,” he told the cameras. “Every night at dinner, my mom and dad were there with my brother. I just loved that.”

He concluded: “But I think If you find the right person and they happen to be a feisty Italian from New York things aren't always going to go how you have them planned.”

Paige was supportive of Craig's Sewing Down South company throughout their romance. They even joked about his crafts during episode 4, which aired on January 2, while envisioning one of the rooms in his house.

“Don't worry about me, you do what you want in that room,” Paige told Craig, who revealed he wanted the space to be “a multifunctional room where I can craft.”

Paige teased, “I want you to be able to hem things for me. It's been three years, and you haven't hemmed a single pair of freaking pants for me!”

While Paige was on board with a sewing nook, she shut down one of Craig's more outlandish suggestions for the room. “What about a wrapping paper wall?” he asked to which Paige replied, “What the f—? No.”

During episode 5, Craig joked about hosting a party to celebrate him freezing his sperm. He then revealed that he was leaving Paige his sperm if he dies, and she wants more kids.

“Is there a return policy,” she said with a laugh. Craig, however, was serious because of his dreams of their future.

“In the rom-com world that I live in, I die and you're like, ‘But I still want to have his children,'” he said. Paige, however, noted she “would never do that.”

She argued, “What, I'm going to have a child and then actively not give them a dad?” Craig responded by saying he understood that, but “instead of throwing it away immediately” she would now have a “choice” and it was a “gift” from him.

Craig and Shep had a heart-to-heart during episode 7, which aired on January 23, talking about his ups and downs with Paige. “You have been itching for this white picket fence existence. Now you have it,” Shep said, applauding Craig for his new life.

Craig admitted, “I think everyone knows, if it was up to me we would just get engaged. But she changes her mind a lot about stuff.”

He detailed Paige's inner thoughts, explaining, “One day she'll text me and say, ‘Let's build a f—ing farmhouse in the middle of nowhere.' Or like, ‘I'm moving to Charleston.' Then she'll have a good day in New York and be like, ‘I love it up here.'”

Shep asked if that's “hard to hear” to which Craig confessed, “It gets confusing.” He added, “I think that's life. It's a bunch of decisions and compromise.”

Craig later told the cameras that he did have some reservations about going off of Paige's timeline and not his own. “Me waiting a few years to have a kid, not a big deal. But what I'm risking is, ‘What if Paige wants to turn those couple years into 10 years?'” he asked.

During episode 9, which aired on February 6, Craig and Paige went to purchase bees for his Charleston home. While Craig called the experience his “fantasy,” Paige revealed she didn't love the idea of living on a farm.

“Sometimes I do fall into that fantasyland of being like, ‘Oh, wow, we could have a farm and a bunch of kids,'” Craig said. Paige acknowledged that she also makes up “fake scenarios” in her head but claimed she's more “realistic” than him.

Craig told Paige he's happy she's “grounded” but confessed, “It's also fun to hear excitement for the future too.”

Paige claimed that she didn't have a “checklist” of items she wants to do before they get married and have kids, but said she should be “allotted” the same time that Craig was in his early 30s to make her own timeline choices.

“I definitely feel a little pressure. I'm only 31,” Paige told Craig. “I'm not gonna lie, sometimes you make me feel like I'm 75.”

Paige then expressed frustration over anyone telling her when she should have kids, saying, “F— yeah it's my decision because I'm the one that holds it in my f—ing body,” she declared. “If you said to me right now, ‘We need to have a baby or I'm leaving,' you'd have to leave.”

Craig understood where she was coming from, but confessed that when Paige talks about “our kids” or says, “I'd be a great husband,” it makes him feel like, “Oh, she likes me.”

“[Is] who I am not enough? Do I not show enough love?” Paige fired back, adding, “If you can't handle the amount of love that I give then that's, like, a personal problem.”

Craig called the conversation “stupid” and said he was simply trying to be “lovey dovey” about their future.

Despite arguing during episode 9, Craig told his pals that he and Paige were heading toward engagement sooner rather than later.

“We're gonna get married,” Craig told Patricia Altschul at her annual guys' dinner, adding, “We're not really letting the ceremonial stuff keep us from living our lives.

He later clarified, “I'm gonna propose soon. Soon as in by the end of the year.” Craig also revealed, “I showed her a sheet of rings and told her to pick her favorite. She picked an emerald cut and elongated cushion.”

When asked if a proposal would prompt Craig to ask Paige to move to Charleston full-time, he confessed, “We don't know where we're going to end up.” He then asked, “What rule says we have to pick one city?”

“You shouldn't have to force someone into liking you. If the person likes you, they'll make time for you,” Craig said during the February 13 episode while reflecting on Shep's one-sided romance.

He confessed to his own shortcomings, revealing, “It's an insecurity that I have dealt with because Paige is so busy.” Craig noted, “Her career is one of her biggest priorities and I had to learn how to exist in that world.”

During the March 6 episode, Craig confided in Austen that he was an “addict” and had struggled with alcohol over the past few years. Craig explained that he had retreated from his friendship with Austen to help himself stay on track, but Paige was always there for him.

“I am very sorry for not understanding what you were going through,” Austen said during their group trip to the Bahamas, asking, “[Are] you and Paige strong as hell? You're fine with the distance? You're not like sitting at your house and being alone and battling, or no?”

Craig revealed that Paige was “right with me this entire time.” He explained, “There's a reason that me and Paige are so close. I just could not imagine being closer to someone. I'm so lucky that she chose to be like, ‘I see someone there.' She helped me, like, beat this demon.”

During the March 13 episode, Craig spoke more about his ups and downs with alcohol, revealing alcoholism runs in his family. “It was cyclical. I would be good for a few months and then I'd go too far,” he explained.

Craig noted that he wanted to get better when he saw how it affected Paige. “I got to my bottom when I could just see it on Paige's face. Just this look of, like, I wasn't the guy that she had seen herself marrying,” he shared, revealing, “So Paige was pretty much done.”

He confessed, “It wasn't until almost losing Paige for me to change my behaviors. Paige was my rock.”

Paige, meanwhile, told Craig during the episode that she “bit my tongue so many times because it truly is a personal journey.” She revealed that once Craig got on track she was “very proud” of him and his “self-awareness” over the past year.

“I will always be grateful I didn't lose you when I hit my bottom. I don't plan on going back there,” Craig vowed. Paige then teased, “But just know if I ever need to leave in the middle of the night with kids, I will.”

During season 10, episode 14, which aired on March 13, Austen came over for a visit to see both Craig and Paige. During their poolside chat, Paige made it clear that her allegiance was to Craig after Austen and Craig finally made up after being at odds for months.

“Look, I do love you. I love you as a friend. But my loyalty will always be to Craig no matter what,” Paige said. “So if Craig is fighting with someone, I also have to hate them.”

Once they buried the hatchet, Paige and Austen started talking about his love life and new girlfriend Audrey Pratt, who is 10 years his junior. “Honestly, I love that she lives in Charlotte. I'm not even going to think about that shit until we've hit the two-year mark of dating,” Austen shared.

Paige totally understood where Austen was coming from but pointed out that her relationship with Craig wasn't that relaxed to start. “Want to hear what a mind f— this is, Craig and I have been dating two and a half years,” she said. “Right when we started dating, it was like, ‘But are you going to move?' I was like, ‘I've known this man for six months.'”

Craig was visibly upset by the comment, asking, “Would it be weird to ever talk about if you wanted kids at six months in?” Austen said the kid conversation is fine to have early, revealing he and Audrey already talked about it and she wants four kids.

“She should marry Craig, Craig wants four,” Paige quipped. Craig replied that Paige wanted three, but she fired back, “I want two.”

Craig explained, “You said if you don't have one of each though, you will keep having kids,” which Paige acknowledged was the truth, noting two was her dream number.

“When I'm with them, I've noticed things are not as calm and cool as he makes it seem,” Austen later told the cameras of the then-couple. “Like, did she just snap at him a bit or is he, like, annoyed with her? I'm going to be honest, they are so on opposite sides of, like, the spectrum of life.”

During the season 10 finale, which aired on March 20, Craig was melancholy when Paige had to leave Charleston for work before heading on a family trip to Italy and then her “Giggly Squad” podcast tour.

“When am I going to see you?” he asked before dropping Paige off at the airport. She teased, “Never, this is the last time you're ever going to see me and you just don't know it.”

When they kissed outside the terminal, Craig confessed, “Aw, I don't know why, usually it doesn't feel like this.”

Later in the episode, Craig gushed to Austen about his and Paige's life plans, saying, “[I'm] 99 percent confident I'm going to propose this year, and I think we're both very excited about it.” Five months after filming that scene, Paige and Craig's breakup made headlines.

Nina Dobrev is busy planning the perfect wedding with fiancé Shaun White, and while there are plenty of exciting and memorable moments they have experienced throughout their engagement, there is one thing that came as a big surprise.

Speaking to People, the Vampire Diaries star revealed she was shocked by the number of curious people who want to know just when she and the retired professional snowboarder will walk down the aisle and say, "I do."

"How often people ask when the wedding is," she said about the thing that continues to surprise her since the got engaged last year.

Dobrev noted that the couple didn't even have time to cherish the proposal before the questions began as even White's mother wanted to get started on all the details for the big day because she was so excited for them.

"Literally the day of. The first day. I think when we got off, when we told Shaun's mom, the first thing she asked is, 'When's the wedding?'" she recalled. "We were like, 'Literally, it just happened. We have no idea.'"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower actress and the Olympic athlete announced their engagement in October 2024 after five years of dating, showing off Dobrev's stunning diamond ring and the romantic setting where "she said YES."

Amanda Seyfried thinks her movie Jennifer's Body deserved better.

The actress starred alongside Megan Fox in the 2009 horror comedy film. She spoke about the role in a recent video with GQ where she looked back on some of her past performances.

"It's got balls," Seyfried said. "We were expressing a certain angst in a very, very specific, comedic way in a very specific genre. ... There was everything you could want."

The actress called the film a "perfect movie," saying it was ruined by a marketing strategy that ultimately misrepresented what it actually was going for.

"If the critics criticize anything it would be the marketing. The marketing sucked. It just did. And we all agree. ... The marketing team cheapened it like it was just, you know, a romp, a gory romp. I think they ruined it," Seyfried said.

Seyfried said she and Fox made a really good team and that she's looking forward to the eventual sequel, which is in the works.

"I'm looking forward to the sequel. They're working on it. I already said thumbs up. I was like, 'Whenever you're ready, I'm ready,'" Seyfried said. "We all just had a lot of fun, so I wanna celebrate it by doing a sequel."

Jennifer's Body was directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody.

The new musical Operation Mincemeat is now open on Broadway after taking London's West End by storm!

Original cast members Zoe Roberts, Claire-Marie Hall, Jak Malone, Natasha Hodgson, and David Cumming walked the red carpet together at the opening night performance on Thursday (March 21) at the Golden Theatre in New York City.

The five actors, several of whom also helped co-write the musical, all starred in the West End production back in 2023 and they've brought the show to New York for a limited run. Originally scheduled to run for 16 weeks only, Operation Mincemeat has already extended its run two times due to popular demand and tickets are on sale through August 18.

Several celebs stepped out for the opening night performance, including Jesse Eisenberg, Samuel L. Jackson with director Kenny Leon, Dylan Mulvaney, and Sydney Lemmon.

In Operation Mincemeat, "it's 1943, and the Allied Forces are on the ropes. Luckily, they've got a trick up their sleeve. Well, not up their sleeve, per se, but rather inside the pocket of a stolen corpse. Equal parts farce, thriller, and Ian Fleming-style spy caper (with an assist from Mr. Fleming himself), Operation Mincemeat tells the wildly improbable and hilarious true story of the covert operation that turned the tide of WWII." 

The show was nominated for six Olivier Awards and won two - Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical for Jak Malone.

Broadway critics are giving glowing reviews to the musical with TheaterMania calling it "a highlight of the season" and Variety notes the show has "comic madness and theatrical joy."

Kelly Clarkson has officially returned to her eponymous talk show after mysteriously disappearing earlier this month. 

The "Since U Been Gone" songstress returned to celebrate the 1000th show following her absence from a handful of March episodes, hosted instead by actor Simu Liu. Without addressing her worrisome absence, Clarkson began: 

"Welcome to the Kelly Clarkson Show and our 1,000th episode. I cannot believe today marks the 1,000th. It's crazy. We have met some hugely talented people, tons of big stars, and inspiring everyday heroes." The star highlighted the supportive community surrounding The Kelly Clarkson Show and the many "ups and downs" it has encountered since airing in September 2019 (per People). 

"A lot of ups and downs personally as well," Clarkson remarked, mentioning the pandemic and moving the show to New York City. The "Stronger" hitmaker zoomed in on gratitude and loss, both personal and related to the show.

TORONTO - Canada's biggest country music awards show will have a little more "je ne sais quoi" starting this year.

Organizers of the Canadian Country Music Association Awards are introducing a new award for francophone artist of the year, a move to celebrate homegrown country talents whose music is primarily sung in French.

They say the category recognizes the "growing influence and contributions" of francophone artists in the Canadian country scene as well as the rapidly growing popularity of the genre in Quebec.

Country music has seen a surge of listeners in the province, driven by a mixture of local French artists and touring English-language Canadian performers.

The CCMA say to qualify for the new category, at least 70 per cent of the Canadian act's submitted recordings must be sung in French. For groups and duos, at least half of the members must also be Canadian citizens or landed immigrants.

The nominees will be determined through a multi-step process that takes into account radio play, sales and ultimately a panel of industry professionals.

The new CCMA francophone award will be handed out as part of the CCMA Awards, which take place in Kelowna, B.C. on Sept. 13.

Former Gilligan's Island star Tina Louise is the last living original cast member from the classic 1960s sitcom.

Louise, 91, memorably played spoiled starlet Ginger Grant for three seasons on Gilligan's Island between 1964 and 1967, but also made news in the ‘60s for her marriage to talk show host Les Crane at the height of her fame. Crane's occasionally confrontational interview style was a forerunner for the combative talk shows that would become the norm decades later. Louise and Crane were only married for five years, but welcomed daughter (and future MTV producer) Caprice Crane before splitting in 1971. These days, Louise lives a quiet life away from the spotlight and dedicates most of her time to helping children learn to read.

Keep scrolling for a look at the Louise's high-profile marriage, her daughter's huge success in TV and what the actress's life is like today:


Louise (real name Tina Blacker) was the daughter of fashion model Sylvia Horn and Brooklyn candy store owner Joseph Blacker. Horn was only 18 years old when she gave birth to her daughter in 1934, and her marriage to Blacker broke down by the time Louise was 4 years old.



In a 2025 New York Times profile, Louise recalled being bounced between harsh boarding schools and her parents' dysfunctional homes throughout her childhood. After a brief period living with her father, Tina's mother took her in at age 11 after marrying her third of four husbands.

“I didn't have hugs,” she said of her childhood. “I didn't have loving situations.”

Blacker recalled being angry that her father didn't put up any legal fight to retain custody when her mother cut off all communication between them. Louise ended up estranged from her dad until her career breakthrough in 1958's Golden Globe-winning movie God's Little Acre when she was 24.

The actress now says she holds a sympathetic view of her mother since Sylvia was only a teenager when she gave birth.

“She didn't have the loving that she needed,” Louise said. “She always needed a man to lean on.”



Louise married Crane while working on Gilligan's Island in 1966. Crane had a varied and influential career as both a talk show host and an actor.

Crane's late-night show, Night Line (later known as The Les Crane Show), aired on WABC-TV in New York City starting in 1963, and was perhaps most notable in its local format for hosting The Rolling Stones in their American TV debut in June 1964.

After ending his talk show, Crane drifted between hosting and acting jobs before moving into the software industry in the 1980s. Perhaps his most famous acting gig was starring with Louise as a married couple in a 1970 episode of the ABC's anthology comedy show Love, American Style.

Les died at age 74 in July 2008. His and Louise's daughter, Caprice Crane, later paid tribute to her father's innovations in numerous industries.

“He was amazing. He was a fighter pilot. He was a radio DJ. He was a TV talk show host,” she told Pop Entertainment in 2009. “He won a Grammy. He started an internet company. He was all over the map. And everything he did, he succeeded in.”

Caprice went on, “He was always the first one to do something new. He was right on the edge, finding the next thing, before anyone else did. He was so smart and so funny and he died too young.”



Tina and Les' daughter, Caprice, was born in November 1970, only a few months before her parents called it quits.

After graduating from New York University, Caprice got her start in the entertainment industry as a writer-producer for MTV, where she worked on the MTV Movie Awards and was involved in the production of sports specials for the network.

She later moved on to writing novels and screenplays for Hollywood, including working on the reboots of Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place in the 2000s.

In 2009, Caprice told Pop Entertainment that Louise was always hugely “supportive” of her Hollywood aspirations even though the actress walked away from the industry.

“My mom is fantastic. She's so great, so adorable, so supportive. And we're obviously so close,” she said. “She misses me, and if there is one thing I don't like about living [in LA], it's not being so close to my mom. Some people think this is insane, but when I'm in New York, my apartment is literally one block away from my mom's apartment. And I love it. I could even live in the same building as her, but probably not the same floor. I love having her that close.”



Louise never officially retired from acting but has chosen to live away from the spotlight in recent years. The actress infamously refused to reprise her role as Ginger Grant for three Gilligan's Island TV movies in the 1970s and ‘80s, but did appear in 1975's classic science fiction film The Stepford Wives and later costarred with Brad Pitt in 1991's Johnny Suede.

The actress told The New York Times in March 2025 that, while she's “very grateful” of her time on Gilligan's Island, she would prefer “to be known for other things.” Louise explained that part of her reticence with the legacy of Gilligan's Island is due to the cast making “so little money” during production and “not a cent” from more than 50 years of reruns.

In 1996, Louise got involved with the advocacy group Learning Leaders, which helps train tutors to teach children to read.

“I loved it, being anonymous, just being the person who read to the children,” Louise told the publication. “That was very important to me because nobody ever read to me.”

She went on, “I love being in their presence for an hour. It's better than vitamins. I can't get back what I went through, but outside of being with my family, doing this is my special thing.”

In a March 2025 Forbes profile, Louise said she'd recently promised Caprice and her newborn granddaughter that she would “live [another] 40 years.”

“I'm going to do the best I can. I'm not thinking about leaving,” she insisted. “I don't think of that. I don't want to think about it. I'm running to stay healthy. I'm walking to the gym. I'm just thinking about staying alive for my family. I love being alive.”

Andrew Garfield and Monica Barbaro are enjoying public outings now that the world knows they are a couple!

The 41-year-old actor and the 34-year-old actress, who are both Oscar nominees, were seen getting into their car to head home after attending a Mumford & Sons concert on Thursday (March 21) at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.

Andrew and Monica first sparked dating rumors a little over a month ago when they were spotted together in public for the second time. Hours later, it was confirmed that they are dating.

“They've been really lowkey and have been spending time together quietly,” a source told People back in February.

Andrew and Monica are spending time together in Los Angeles these days and they were also spotted earlier in the week on a grocery run in Malibu.

Gilmore Girls has become a classic comfort watch over the years as devoted fans repeatedly tune in to rewatch the series each fall thanks to its cozy vibes and quirky New England small town charm. However, the amount that the actors get paid from residuals, even with an increase in popularity thanks to streaming services, may come as a surprise.

Lauren Graham, who starred as eccentric mom Lorelai Gilmore opposite Alexis Bledel as brainy daughter Rory Gilmore, revealed during a March 19 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live that she doesn't receive a big paycheck from streaming giants like Netflix that house the show, per E! News. 

"There really are no residuals on Netflix," she said. "But I've been paid in love and appreciation." 

The Parenthood actress noted that the show has expanded further than ever before into new audiences than what was seen during its original 2000 to 2007 run and subsequent 2016 A Year in the Life revival on Netflix. 

"And now it's trickled into younger people, older people, men whose kids or wives probably have forced them to watch it," she said, adding that she is often recognized in public. "Yeah, I get stopped a lot. It surprises me every time though."

During an appearance on The Tonight Show in February, Graham told host Jimmy Fallon that the reception to the classic series and her role in particular has continued to be heartwarming, despite some strange comments she occasionally receives.

"It's the best part I ever had," she said. "I love doing it, and I think it was really wonderful. It's just that thing where it was the perfect material and the perfect time with the perfect writer — and it just means so much to me."

Selena Gomez revealed that she was "grumpy" the day that Benny Blanco proposed to her and almost didn't show up. 

The Only Murders in the Building actress detailed the scene during a guest appearance with her fiancèe on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, revealing that she did not see the proposal coming. 

"We had to do a lot of promo for the album. So I woke up, and I was very confused about what was happening and where we were going because it seemed kind of far. So I'm kind of a little grumpy. I really am tired. This is too far. Then I tell him, 'After this shoot, I'm going to go hang out with my friends,' and he starts going, 'Uhh, sure. I'll see you when you get here.'" 

The producer interjected, revealing that his partner's mood that morning had him "freaking out" about his elaborate plan for the day. 

"Of course I'm freaking out. She was mad. She almost didn't come. She was like, 'I really don't feel that well. I think I'm going to stay home today. Can't we just make up the shoot another day?'" 

The standout referred to getting engaged as the "craziest thing in the world." 

"It's like right before you're going to tell someone you're going to be married to them forever, they're like, 'Show me how good you can lie to me.' It's so hard. I tell her everything. So she was just upset with me because the day before, I was making bad lies." 

Blanco revealed that he hid the ring in a box and kept it in their house in the days leading up to the proposal, which he remembers as the "scariest week of my life." When it was time to say "yes" to Blanco, the "Calm Down" hitmaker forgot her words. 

"I freaked out. I forgot everything." 

The star-studded duo is not only in the process of planning their wedding but just released their first joint album, I Said I Loved You First, out today!

Organizers of the Toronto-based Departure Festival announce the event's rebranding from Canadian Music Week at an event in this November 2024 handout photo. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO - Departure Festival, George Pimentel Photography

TORONTO - The founder of Canadian Music Week is taking the new owners of Departure Festival to court, alleging they've breached their contract and failed to pay fees tied to their acquisition of his music industry conference.

Former CMW president and creator Neill Dixon filed a notice of action in an Ontario court earlier this week seeking more than $435,000 in damages and another $50,000 in punitive and aggravated damages.

Dixon alleges Loft Entertainment and developer Oak View Group failed to live up to their side of the $2-million purchase of his Toronto music industry festival, which ran for more than 40 years before he announced his retirement and its sale last June.

He says the defendants began paying him through an Ontario numbered company they co-owned, but that $378,928 has remained outstanding since last December. He also says they owe him another $56,000 in unpaid consulting fees.

None of the allegations have been tested in court. 

Loft Entertainment was co-founded by Randy Lennox, the former head of Bell Media and a one-time Canadian record label executive. Oak View is a Denver-based company that recently opened offices in Toronto.

On Thursday, Lennox sent an email to staff at Loft Entertainment assuring them the festival is moving ahead this year.

"We see things very differently," he said of the legal action. "We stand firm in our position of integrity, beliefs and values."

A representative for Departure, who forwarded Lennox's email, told The Canadian Press he would not provide further comment on the allegations. 

Dixon did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent by email to him and his lawyers. 

The four-day CMW was founded in 1982 and built a reputation as one of the music scene's leading industry events, hosting conferences, awards shows and live performances.

Since buying CMW last year, the event's new owners have rebranded it as Departure Festival and Conference, expanding its scope to include stand-up comedy and technology.

The inaugural Departure event is planned to begin May 6 and run for six days, with celebrity speakers that include pop duo Tegan and Sara, Arkells frontman Max Kerman and rocker Bryan Adams.

Dixon was previously announced as the recipient of a Departure lifetime achievement award to help kick off the first year.

Paige, 32, and Craig, 36, split late last year after three years together, with her initiating the breakup.

“Craig and I have decided to no longer be together,” she said during a December 2024 episode of the “Giggly Squad” podcast. “I love him, I think he loves me. I think we will remain friends. No one did anything. It wasn't a bad thing.”

In the months that have followed, especially as the current seasons of Summer House and Southern Charm air, more details about the breakup — and the aftermath — continue emerging. Several Bravo stars have spoken out, but this week's Summer House and Southern Charm aftershows brought some savage commentary.



“I feel like when I know I met my husband, I'll want to call him before I call my dad,” Paige said during the Summer House aftershow. “And I haven't met anyone like that yet.”

Keep scrolling to read the wildest aftershow quotes:


Producers asked Paige if she thinks Craig had “a different” version of her in his head.

“Who knows, I'd love to meet her?” she quipped during the aftershow. “Sometimes he'd be like, ‘You talk really dirty on your podcast.' … Whatever. I don't think he really, you know.”

Paige got honest during the Summer House aftershow, claiming that she would “stay more quiet” while Craig was “voicing his opinions” about their relationship.

“Him voicing his opinion that he wanted to be prioritized above my career,” she said. “He knows that even if I marry you, my kids are going to come before you anyway, so you'll always be third.”

She also admitted to not telling Craig career highs. “When I would get certain milestones, no I wouldn't tell him because I knew he would want to be happy for me but I knew deep down he would not be,” she confessed.

“I loved him so much that I tolerated too much,” Paige said. “Now that I'm out of it and I look back on things, I'm like, ‘Oh wait.' Anytime I had a career milestone, he found a way to make it about him.'”

She added: “Anytime it was something for me, my friend's wedding or a family wedding, he would find a way to make it about him and make me have a bad time. It was just embarrassing. That's something I look back on now and I'm like, ‘Oh wow, I was really blinded.'”

Paige has been honest about experiencing panic attacks, and she shared Craig's reaction.

“After I had my panic attack, he watched a documentary about the band Abba … and he told me to watch this documentary because it was about how tour ruined their marriages and their lives,” she claimed. “I was like, ‘I just got a beta blocker prescription but thank you so much for the nightly TV watch.'”

Kyle Cooke and Craig had some major beef that reverberated throughout the Summer House cast. This week's episode showed the two Bravo men talking out their drama — about alcohol brands, mind you — face-to-face after Kyle called out Craig on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.

During the Summer House aftershow, Kyle's wife, Amanda Batula, asked if he “should” have any regrets about the drama with Craig. Paige was quick to chime in and add, “No,” which is some tea if you ask Us.

“You heard it straight from her mouth,” Amanda added.

During the Southern Charm aftershow, Shep bluntly stated that it was “total f—ing bulls—” that Paige never went on the cast's trips.

“I couldn't get away with that if I had a girlfriend, I'll tell you that much,” he claimed, calling it “incomprehensible” that she wasn't around.

“Every time she'd come down here, except for a few occasions, she never made an attempt to get to know Charleston, to get to know members of the group,” Patricia Altschul claimed during the after show. “They were isolated.”

Madison LeCroy told Craig that he's “good at everything” during the Southern Charm aftershow and he had quite the response.

“Except keeping a girlfriend. … That's my limit, I guess. Three years. The three-year itch, they just disappear,” he claimed. “God, I did so well on her birthday too, guess what I got her? A bag from The Row.”

Southern Charm star Venita Aspen is moving on from Jarrett “JT” Thomas and has her eyes on a One Chicago cast member.

“There is a man that is on NBC that I have my eye on,” Venita, 31, revealed during a Thursday, March 20, appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “He's a Chicago P.D. [star].”

Venita also told host Andy Cohen that she's currently single, but did slide into the mystery man's Instagram DMs.

“I just found him a couple of weeks ago and I think he's handsome,” she continued. “I slid in his DMs and I said, ‘It's so funny we work for the same network but we never ran into each other.' I got a follow and a response.”



Social media users were quick to wonder if Venita was referring to LaRoyce Hawkins, who has played Kevin Atwater on the NBC show since its 2014 debut. Us Weekly can confirm that Venita and LaRoyce follow each other on Instagram — and we don't see any other cast members on her follow list!

Venita has been candid with details regarding her love life after fellow Southern Charm cast member JT did her “so dirty” when they briefly dated.

“We started dating when I got back from New York in September [2024]. It was from September, October, November,” she told Us exclusively earlier this week. “Trying to figure out, ‘OK, are we doing this? Do we actually like each other? Is it because we're around each other all the time?'”



A post shared by Watch What Happens Live! (@bravowwhl)



JT posted his girlfriend, a woman named Ali Pereless, on Instagram, which is how she found out he was dating someone else. (JT, for his part, has downplayed his relationship with Venita. The pair will hash it out at the upcoming reunion.)

“I think it would've been nice to just have him be like, ‘Hey by the way, I'm dating someone else, and I've decided to go with her versus you,'” Venita continued. “I would not have cared. I'm like, ‘Oh my God, I appreciate you so much for saying something, being kind about it.' But he didn't do that.”

Ventia further claimed that season 10 of Southern Charm, which aired its season finale last night, has made her look like a “homewrecker” amid JT's current romance.

“It's so messy,” Venita added, noting that she wishes JT would speak out and admit he “caused all this.” When it comes to the future of their friendship, Ventia told Us that there's no way back.

“Now the door's completely shut. Closed and barred. Padlocked. No one's getting here,” she said. “I was still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and be like, just communicate with me and talk me through it.

Bollywood music composer and singer Amaal Mallik recently took to social media to share a deeply personal message with his fans, revealing that he has decided to cut ties with his family amidst struggling with clinical depression. Amaal, who has been open about his emotional challenges, addressed the media and his followers, thanking them for their support but also requesting privacy for his family.

In an emotional Instagram post, Amaal explained how his mental health has been deeply affected by the actions of "near and dear ones," including his parents, composer Daboo Malik and singer Jyoti Malik. He said that the situation had diminished his self-worth and left him emotionally drained. Despite these struggles, he acknowledged that the toll it has taken on him was primarily personal, and while he would continue to love his family, he chose to distance himself from them for the time being.

Amaal's message did not stop there. He also addressed the media, asking them not to sensationalize his vulnerability. He expressed his gratitude for the love and support he had received from fans but emphasized the importance of respecting his family's privacy. "I would request the media portals to not harass my family... Please don't sensationalize & give negative headlines to my vulnerability," Amaal wrote, urging the media to handle his personal matters with sensitivity.

Despite the ongoing personal turmoil, Amaal made it clear that his relationship with his younger brother, singer Armaan Mallik, remains unchanged. "Nothing changes between us brothers, Armaan and I are one and nothing can come between us," he assured fans. Amaal's message of peace and love for his family signified that while he is stepping away for his mental well-being, his bond with Armaan remains as strong as ever.

Amaal's open admission of his struggles with depression resonated with many of his followers, who expressed their support. His decision to distance himself from family ties, though difficult, was seen as a necessary step towards healing. The composer, known for his music in films such as Jai Ho, Khoobsurat, Roy, and MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, has always been open about his personal life, and this latest post further sheds light on the mental and emotional toll he has been grappling with.

As he continues to navigate his personal challenges, Amaal has requested that the media allow him and his family the space to heal, emphasizing that his focus remains on maintaining peace and love in his life.

Joey Bada$$ is back on Power Book III: Raising Kanan, though his character, Unique, was nearly killed off in the show's third season.

A fan-favorite on the cast, he tells ABC Audio it was "actually dope to see how much love and appreciation people have for the character in the event of his 'demise.' But it was also cool to see how people felt when they found out, 'Oh, s***, he's actually not gone,' too."

As seen in the first two episodes of season 4, Unique survived with the help of an under-the-radar doctor, who warned his injuries could lead to personality changes if he didn't receive professional help. Those changes are coupled with his desire to seek vengeance against Raq and all those who he felt had conspired against him.

Joey says it's different than the vengeance Unique's brother sought in season 3 because Ronnie had "more of, like, a social disorder." While he notes that they had similarities in their anger and frustration, he says Unique was previously "able to contain that and use it to his advantage and, like, be smart about it."

"I think now with the brain injury he's way more prone to flying off the handle," Joey adds. That showed up when Unique killed Raq's lawyer after secretly seeing the two and assuming they were together. When asked whether any of that had to do with Unique loving Raq, Joey says, "There's a lot of conflicting ideas, thoughts and emotions going on in his head, but I think they're all scrambled because of the brain injury."

Coco 2 is in development at Pixar Animation Studios.

Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger confirmed during the company's annual meeting of shareholders that the sequel, a follow-up of the 2017 original, is in "the initial stages".

He said: "While the film is just in the initial stages, we know it will be full of humour, heart and adventure.

"And we can't wait to share more soon."

The original movie — which won two Oscars, for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for Remember Me — told the story of 12-year-old Miguel, who dreamed of becoming a musician, despite his family's generations-old ban on music.

However, Miguel headed to the Land of the Dead to unlock the real story behind his family history.

Coco 2 will feature a reunion of the team behind the original movie, with Oscar-winning director Lee Unkrich and co-director Adrian Molina returning to helm the motion picture.

What's more, Mark Nielsen will produce the forthcoming film.

Anthony Gonzalez voiced the role of Miguel in the first film, and Gael García Bernal was Hector, Miguel's great-great-grandfather in the Land of the Dead.

Edward James Olmos portrayed Hector's friend Chicharrón in Coco, and he previously told how he was "in heaving sobs" after reading the script for the first film.

Speaking to Collider, Olmos said: "They [Disney] came to me and invited me to Pixar, where they literally wined and dined me at their studio, and then they told me about the story. They didn't tell me everything about it and what the twists were, which I'm very grateful for. That way, I was caught just like everybody else. I remember sitting there in heaving sobs, thinking about my own grandmother, my own relatives and those that have gone already.

"Emotionally, it was just like, 'wow'! The whole idea was achieved and attained. My character, which I was very proud of playing, is in one scene, but people who see the movie understand the depths of what we're talking about, in that moment.

"If no one thinks about you anymore or remembers you, you disappear and vanish. I hadn't thought about my grandparents in a while, but I started to think about the stories that I could tell about my life with them and what I remember.

"My father is gone and my mother is 91, and we already tell stories about her. It's fun!"

Comedian and YouTuber Samay Raina has announced the rescheduling of his much-anticipated India tour, leaving fans disappointed but understanding. The move comes amidst the ongoing legal controversy surrounding his comedy show India's Got Latent, which has caused a stir on social media and attracted significant attention from law enforcement.


In a story on Instagram, Samay Raina wrote, “Hello guys, I am rescheduling my India tour. You all will get the refunds shortly, see you soon.”

Samay Raina's comedy show ‘Unfiltered,' which was set to take place at Delhi's Talkatora Stadium recently, was cancelled amid the India's Got Latent controversy. Both the shows of Samay Raina were sold-out before they were cancelled.

It has not been easy for Samay Raina after he found himself at the centre of a controversy after a YouTube episode of India's Got Latent, where fellow YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made controversial remarks about parental sex, triggering laughter but also widespread outrage. The clip quickly went viral, sparking a nationwide debate and leading to an FIR being filed against several YouTubers, including Raina, Ashish Chanchlani, and Allahbadia, for allegedly promoting obscenity and inappropriate content.

The incident has drawn significant backlash, and the controversy continues to unfold, with the involved parties facing legal scrutiny. The Maharashtra Cyber Police are currently investigating the matter, having already summoned over 30 individuals for questioning.

Raina has yet to give his statement to the Maharashtra Cyber Cell, which has already questioned Ashish Chanchlani and Ranveer Allahbadia. Meanwhile, the controversial episode, which featured Allahbadia making comments about parents and sex, has led to multiple police complaints against the show's creators.

As part of the fallout, Raina cancelled his shows in Delhi, scheduled for March 21 and 23, as well as shows in Gujarat earlier this year. Additionally, Raina deleted all episodes of India's Got Latent from YouTube.

Despite the controversy, some fans have defended the comedians, arguing that their edgy humour should not be censored. Others, however, believe the content crossed the line. The ongoing investigation and the attention this case is attracting highlight the growing tension between free expression and moral standards in today's digital entertainment landscape.

As the case progresses, Raina and his colleagues remain at the centre of a storm that continues to unfold in the public eye.

Sydney Sweeney is adding another new movie to her growing plate!

The 27-year-old actress will be starring in and producing a new film based on a four-year-old short story on Reddit, shared by a high school English teacher, THR reports.

Keep reading to find out more...

Oscar-winning Forrest Gump writer Eric Roth is set to write the script for the movie, based on Joe Cote's Reddit story, titled, "I pretended to be a missing girl so I could rob her family.” 

The movie "centers on a young woman who shows up at a family's doorsteps ten years after their 18-year-old daughter went missing. Her plan is to convince the family she is their missing child, and stay just for one night — long enough to steal some valuables and get away."

Sydney is actually the one who brought the writer on board, and Warner Bros has won the rights to distribute the film. She will produce through her Fifty-Fifty Films production banner, with the author of the original Reddit story, Joe Cote also executive producing.

The actress has a handful of projects in the works, including  The Housemaid, the Christy Martin biopic and the upcoming third season of Euphoria.
