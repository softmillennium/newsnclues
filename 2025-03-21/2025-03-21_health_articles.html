Groundbreaking research is now transforming our understanding of this debilitating disease, offering new hope through innovative therapies and cutting-edge medical advancements. Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease that affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide, leading to symptoms such as pelvic pain, infertility, and organ dysfunction.1 However, recent advancements in endometriosis research are reshaping our understanding of the disease, offering novel therapeutic approaches that range from pharmacological interventions to regenerative medicine and microbiome-based therapies. These breakthroughs not only aim to manage symptoms but also address the root causes of endometriosis, with a focus on inflammation, immune dysregulation, and tissue remodeling.1-4 Recent studies have explored new pharmacological agents targeting estrogen synthesis, inflammation, and immune modulation.2 Among these, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists, such as elagolix, have demonstrated promising results by effectively reducing pain symptoms while minimizing estrogen deprivation-related side effects.3 Another promising development is the use of aromatase inhibitors, which inhibit local estrogen production within endometriotic lesions. Immunomodulatory therapies are also gaining attention, given the role of immune dysregulation in endometriosis pathophysiology. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) agents and regulatory T-cell therapies are being investigated for their potential to modulate inflammatory pathways associated with endometriosis progression.5 Furthermore, recent findings suggest that progesterone plays a crucial anti-inflammatory role in endometriosis management, as it modulates immune responses and reduces inflammation through specific molecular pathways.6 Advances in minimally invasive techniques, including robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, have improved precision and outcomes for patients requiring excision of extensive lesions.1 A recent meta-analysis comparing robotic-assisted and conventional laparoscopic surgery for deep endometriosis found that while robotic surgery does not significantly reduce intraoperative or postoperative complications, it offers improved surgical precision and is particularly beneficial for complex cases involving delicate anatomical structures.7 Moreover, advancements in nerve-sparing techniques are also being incorporated into laparoscopic and robotic-assisted procedures to minimize the risk of postoperative complications such as neuropathic pain and organ dysfunction.7 These techniques are particularly valuable for cases where lesions infiltrate the critical pelvic nerves. These advancements are paving the way for more precise, patient-tailored surgical interventions that maximize effectiveness while reducing recurrence rates. Stem cell therapy is being extensively explored for its ability to repair endometrial tissue damage, restore fertility, and alleviate chronic pain. Additionally, tissue engineering approaches, including bioengineered endometrial grafts, are under investigation as potential alternatives to traditional hormone therapies and surgical interventions. Moreover, exosome-based therapies are gaining traction as potential non-invasive regenerative treatments for endometriosis. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are released by most cells in the body, and these therapies leverage the ability of naturally occurring, small vesicles to deliver therapies, modulate immune responses, and promote tissue repair.8 Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, has been linked to increased inflammation, altered estrogen metabolism, and immune dysfunction in women with endometriosis.10 This altered microbiome composition may contribute to chronic inflammation and estrogen recycling, exacerbating disease progression.11 Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that specific bacterial metabolites may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of endometriosis progression.8 Furthermore, bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been found to regulate immune function and estrogen metabolism, presenting new therapeutic opportunities.11 Personalized medicine is becoming increasingly relevant in endometriosis management, with extensive research focusing on genetic and molecular biomarkers to guide individualized treatment strategies. At the same time, progesterone receptor (PR) profiling could predict resistance to progestin-based treatments.4 These findings suggest that targeting epigenetic mechanisms could offer new therapeutic options, particularly for patients who do not respond to conventional hormonal treatments. As research progresses, integrating these cutting-edge technologies into clinical practice will be crucial in improving outcomes for patients with endometriosis. Future research should focus on translating these discoveries into clinical practice, ensuring that innovative treatments reach those who need them most. Furthermore, embracing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates novel therapeutic modalities holds significant importance in the future of endometriosis care. https://doi.org/10.5301/jeppd.5000311 Kolanska, K., Alijotas-Reig, J., Cohen, J., Cheloufi, M., Selleret, L., d'Argent, E., Kayem, G., Valverde, E.

Many people don’t take pre-diabetes seriously until it’s too late. That was the case for me. I was overweight, experiencing heartburn, and had a blood pressure reading of 136/80. My doctor recommended dietary changes, but I brushed it off. Sadly, my lab results confirmed that I had high cholesterol and pre-diabetes. By April 2019, my condition worsened—my A1C had climbed to 7%, putting me officially in the diabetic range. I had gained even more weight, my BMI was at an unhealthy 38.5, and my blood pressure remained high. I also started to have occasional blurred vision to the point where I had to change eyeglass prescriptions several times within a short period of time. I had ignored the warning signs and continued with the same unhealthy habits that led me to this point. It wasn’t until I made a conscious decision to change my lifestyle that I was able to reverse the damage and improve my health.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250321/Dance-emerges-as-a-powerful-tool-for-stress-relief.aspx'>Dance emerges as a powerful tool for stress relief</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 00:00:00 <p>
Recreational dance supports stress regulation through emotional expression, social bonding, and neurobiological pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that dance may offer unique benefits for managing stress and enhancing cognitive and mental well-being—benefits that traditional forms of PE may not fully capture. Stress regulation itself is a homeostatic process, relying on two key factors: coping and resilience. Exercise is a well-established coping strategy and can also help build resilience over time. This review zeroes in on how recreational (as opposed to competitive, professional, or religious) dance helps regulate stress and explores the underlying psychological, physiological, and social pathways that might explain these effects. When viewed as a recreational activity, dance is far more than just physical movement. It blends music, rhythm, and expressive, often beautiful, communication with others. It's a form of creative expression that combines synchronized movement with shared social experience. Dance also provides opportunities for social touch, emotional release, and uninhibited physical expression. Music with engaging, rhythmic patterns can activate the brain’s reward circuits and ease stress. This flow state is linked to greater life satisfaction and emotional resilience. It communicates feeling in ways that transcend language and can be understood across cultures. It also creates a shared space where people can bond, process emotional trauma, and develop coping strategies together. Unlike many other forms of PE, dance doesn’t serve a utilitarian function—it exists for its own aesthetic and expressive purposes. This makes it especially effective at promoting social cohesion and emotional support within groups. This social touch activates neural systems involved in bonding, largely mediated by oxytocin and endorphins. Interestingly, brain imaging studies (using fMRI) show distinct neural activation in dance partners: the “leading” partner tends to display internally focused activity, while the “follower” shows externally oriented patterns. This suggests complex coordination between social and motor systems during partner dance. Although dance involves physical exertion, it differs from other types of PE in important ways. Dance relieves tension, improves mood, and supports emotional well-being, while also enhancing cognitive function. Social dancing also boosts self-confidence and provides a powerful outlet for personal expression. The findings suggest that dance can play a meaningful role in developing coping strategies and resilience. To date, much of the research has centered on dance’s physical intensity. But dance offers far more than fitness—it’s an experience that directly supports stress relief, boosts psychological well-being, and fosters healthier coping mechanisms.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
