Proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health funding threaten a critical pipeline of innovation and discovery necessary to fuel advancements in patient care, warn researchers and provider groups.

Last month, the NIH said it would cut roughly $4 billion in annual funding for indirect research costs by capping reimbursement for such expenses for current and new grants. Previously, reimbursement rates averaged between 27% to 28%, according to the agency.

Provider groups have spoken out against the cuts, saying providers depend on research to bolster care quality. A spokesperson for the Washington State Hospital Association said reduced federal grant support could hinder research on opioid addiction prevention or rural staff training, for example.

The Children's Hospital Association said funding cuts will limit effective diagnostics and threaten “the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children.”

Much of the nation's cutting-edge medical research happens at leading universities and academic medical centers. Academics say cutting funding for their teams will lead to ripple effects in patient care for years to come, with innovative treatments taking longer to show up at the bedside.

“Thirty percent of all [cancer] medicines that we currently have right now that help you and me... were invented and created by academics. And so to have that go away... looking to the future, it's making a third of all the medicines that could be just disappear,” Jordan Green, professor of biomedical engineering, ophthalmology, oncology and neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins told Healthcare Dive. “It's going to have profound effects on lives.”

Already, some projects have been put on hold. Green, who is named on seven NIH grants, said one of his projects evaluating a treatment for tumors has received a stop work order. Getting going again could take months, according to the researcher, which could translate to “years” of delays before the cancer treatment is ready for patients.

Researchers at the University of North Carolina and the University of Michigan have likewise received stop work orders, spurring the University of Michigan to set up alternative funding for projects that directly impact patients. However, the program is not designed to provide long term support.

The looming disruptions to research are already forcing some teams to make tough financial decisions.

Stanford University, the University of California and Harvard University have frozen medical researcher hiring, citing funding uncertainty.

Jonathan Teyan, Associated Medical Schools of New York CEO and president, told Healthcare Dive layoffs could come soon in New York, which is home to 17 medical schools, and the state stands to lose at least $630 million annually from caps to indirect research costs.

The funding cuts “will almost certainly result in lab closures, laying off scientists and support staff and fewer career pathways for scientists in the U.S.,” Teyan said.

Johns Hopkins University — which received the most funds from the NIH last year out of any U.S. entity — will offer fewer slots for incoming doctorate students, according to Green.

He said it is the first time in his 16-year tenure that his lab will contract in size, and he expects the incoming class to be the smallest he's seen in “at least a decade.” Green said the cuts could spur a “brain drain,” in which talent moves overseas to find better opportunities. 

Ultimately, the NIH cuts seem “short sighted,” according to Green.

“In the past, this idea of biomedical research has been very bipartisan — cancer doesn't care if you're in a red state or a blue state, and we want to cure it,” said Green. “We're in a state right now of growth and acceleration, where science is making tremendous improvements to patient care ... and to just sort of pull the rug out, or take the gas out of the tank, when we have so much momentum, it's very surprising, and it saddens me.”

HONOLULU (Island News) -- "I'm originally from New Jersey. I've been on island for about six and a half years," said Keri Anacker.

Anacker is a school psychologist, who spent years in grad school for her specialist degree.

Now she works at a number of public schools assessing students for special education, then comes up with plans to help them.

Local lawmakers want to spend millions to attract and keep new healthcare professionals in Hawaii through a bill that forgives loans used when studying for their profession.

In her move to the islands, she brought more than just her belongings.

"I accumulated I want to say about a little under $30,000 in student loans," stated Anacker.

She said she would pay a little each month, but planned on paying for ten years under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Instead, she signed up for a Hawaii program that nearly wiped it all away.

"I got awarded the money 2024. I had about $26,000 in student loan debt and they sent a check to my loan servicer for $25,500," said Anacker.

She is one of the nearly 900 healthcare workers, who took part in the loan repayment program over the past two years.

Now lawmakers want to set more money aside to help hundreds more Hawaii healthcare professionals.

"$30 million, that is $15 million in each of the next two years, which pays for the loans that people take out when they study to become doctors, nurses, physician assistants, social workers. This pays back the amount of money they took out in loans up to $50,000," said Rep. Gregg Takayama.

The program is a popular one, with more than 1,300 people on the wait list, but it does come with an important requirement.

"As part of forgiving of their student loans, they have to agree to serve at least two years in a rural area, which in Hawaii is almost all of Hawaii. So we get back committed healthcare workers to serve in our community. That meets a real shortage we have of healthcare workers all across the board," added Takayama.

The House bill survived crossing over to the other side of the State Legislature, but now will be heard by the Senate Ways and Means committee, which reviews all bills with a financial impact.

For new healthcare workers like Anacker, the program has made a difference in her Hawaii career.

"Although this program didn't help bring me here, it's definitely helped to retain and keep me here," stated Anacker.

She is a such a fan of the program. She's also reached out to other current and former students, to let them know about the loan repayment program and encourage them to come to Hawaii.

"I'm hoping to bring more people to the island because of it. So I'm hoping to even recruit, more healthcare workers and mental health workers like myself," added Anacker.

Treatment has traditionally started with low- to moderate-efficacy DMTs

Starting Tysabri (natalizumab) early in multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment may lead to better outcomes, including greater reductions in relapse rates and less use of MS-related healthcare services over starting it after other therapies.

That's according to a U.S. healthcare claims analysis of more than 1,500 adults with MS. While those who switched to Tysabri later saw significant improvements, those who received it as a first-line treatment tended to have even greater benefits, the data shows.

“This suggests the potential advantages of commencing [Tysabri] early in the treatment plan for MS not only in managing the condition effectively, but also in reducing the overall utilization of healthcare resources,” the researchers wrote. The study, “Evaluating natalizumab first-line and later-line use in multiple sclerosis: a US claims database analysis,” was published in Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders. The study was led by researchers at Biogen, which markets Tysabri, and also funded the research.

More than 20 disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are approved for MS. These therapies help reduce inflammation, and seek to reduce disease activity and slow disease progression, but each comes with its own safety and efficacy profile.

Traditionally, MS treatment has followed a stepwise approach, starting with low- to moderate-efficacy DMTs, which are generally safer, but less effective at controlling the disease. More potent, higher-efficacy therapies have more safety risks and higher costs, so they've been reserved for patients who show signs of disease activity with less effective drugs.

This approach is being challenged, however. Several studies have shown that starting a high-efficacy DMT earlier in the disease course can lead to fewer relapses and less disability worsening in the long term, which should result in less use of healthcare services and costs.

“Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs increase as disability progresses, with higher disability scores and disease relapses resulting in more hospitalizations and outpatient consultations,” the researchers wrote.

Tysabri is a high-efficacy antibody-based therapy that works by preventing immune cells from getting into the brain and spinal cord where they can cause damage. It's traditionally been a second-line therapy, but researchers examined data from the U.S. Komodo Health database, which contains medical and pharmacy claims from 325 million people in the U.S., to see in a real-world setting how its effectiveness compares with its recent use as a first-line therapy.

The researchers focused on 1,568 adults who received a MS diagnosis between 2016 and 2020, and were given Tysabri as part of their treatment. Of them, 1,174 received Tysabri as their first DMT, while 394 used it as a second or later therapy.

Most of those who took Tysabri as a second-line or later therapy received moderate-efficacy DMTs — oral or older injectable therapies — as their first-line treatment. But some switched to Tysabri after first-line treatment with Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) or Kesimpta (ofatumumab). Tysabri's effectiveness in both groups was assessed with the annualized relapse rate (ARR), or the average number of relapses per year, and healthcare resource utilization during follow-up.

As a first-line treatment, Tysabri resulted in an 81% reduction in ARR compared with baseline values, that is, those collected up to a year before starting treatment. When Tysabri was a later treatment, ARR was reduced by 55% over baseline.

Patients who received Tysabri as a first-line treatment started off with a higher ARR at baseline (1.48 relapses per year vs. 0.92 relapses per year in the later-line group). But they took longer to have a relapse and their relapse rate ended up being 32% lower than those given Tysabri later in their disease course. The risk of relapse was also 27% lower.

Finally, the researchers found that Tysabri consistently reduced the use of healthcare resources, such as MS-related hospitalizations, length of hospital stay, and outpatient visits, in both groups. For most assessments, however, these reductions were more pronounced in those who received it as first-line therapy.

According to the researchers, the “decreased risk of relapse, lower ARR and longer time to relapse” for patients on first-line Tysabri compared with those receiving it later in the disease course “reinforces the importance of utilizing natalizumab as a [first-line] treatment.”

Oops, something went wrong

Mini C-arms are gaining attention in medical imaging, particularly in orthopaedic and sports medicine, for their portability and flexibility. These compact devices weigh less than 40 pounds, are small enough to fit in a suitcase and are designed to function independently or be mounted on a stand, making them ideal for environments where conventional C-arms are not practical.

At the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Annual Meeting, held in San Diego from March 10 to 14 2025, Ziehm-OrthoScan introduced the Versa mini C-arm, while Turner Imaging presented its existing Smart-C mini C-arm, which is distributed in collaboration with Siemens. These devices reflect a growing trend toward more accessible and space-efficient imaging solutions.

The appeal of mini C-arms lies in their portability. They can be used in settings such as remote healthcare facilities, outpatient clinics and mobile units, where space, budget or mobility is limited. By providing real-time imaging without requiring a complex setup or a dedicated imaging suite, the devices can enable quick diagnostic assessments in non-traditional settings such as sports medicine or emergency care. They are primarily used for extremity imaging, such as assessing fractures or injuries to the limbs, and are not suitable for imaging large areas or for procedures requiring deeper radiation penetration, such as those involving the chest or abdomen. As a result, mini C-arms are considered complementary tools rather than replacements for full-sized C-arms.

Despite their potential, the mini C-arm market remains specialised, with limited current competition and no known pipeline products from major C-arm manufacturers GE Healthcare or Philips. This may indicate a perception that the market is too niche or offers limited financial returns. However, as demand for compact and cost-effective imaging solutions increases, market dynamics could shift. In addition to mini C-arms, other technologies are emerging to improve point-of-care extremity imaging, such as Adaptix's Digital Tomosynthesis Orthopaedic imaging system. Advancements in AI-assisted imaging, software integration and expanded clinical applications could make these systems more versatile. As healthcare providers seek solutions that balance versatility with performance, these diagnostic devices could become more competitive.

While mini C-arms offer advantages in portability and accessibility, their widespread adoption will depend on their ability to align with clinical workflows. Factors such as image quality, integration with existing hospital systems, battery life and cost-effectiveness will play a role in determining their long-term viability. As imaging technology continues to evolve, these compact systems may establish a more defined role in healthcare as devices that are uniquely suited for mobile, point-of-care diagnostics.

"The rise of mini C-arms as a portable imaging healthcare solution" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.

FRESNO, Calif. (FOX26) — Expenses for Medi-Cal are higher than expected for the state of California.

For the second time in two weeks, state health leaders have come to lawmakers to request more funds to cover the expenses in the state's Medi-Cal budget.

A little over six billion dollars to be exact.

So what's causing this? Cal Matters Reporter Ana Ibarra explains.

"So there are a number of factors that the administration you know has pointed to and one of them I think the one probably you know getting more attention is that the state may have underestimated the amount needed to cover the medical expansion to undocumented people," Ibarra said.

For the past 10 years, California has expanded its Medi-Cal program to even allow more people to enroll like people aged 26 to 49.

But there's more than that.

"There are also more seniors signing up to the program, or signing up to Medi-Cal,” Ibarra said. “Last year the state also changed policy or changed the rule that allowed seniors to apply to Medi-Cal without having to count their assets. So now their houses, their cars, their savings account don't count against seniors when applying, just like everyone else."

All of these factors were brought to state leaders at a recent hearing to discuss the additional needs for funds.

But the Director of the Department of Healthcare Michelle Bass says there was also a concern in regards to pharmaceutical spending.

"Recent coverage expansions have Just like other states, the Department is experiencing an overall increase in pharmacy spend, which again really aligns to some of the experiences just generally across the healthcare sector," Bass said.

But some state leaders like Joe Patterson feel this issue is something that falls back on the department.

"Somebody reaches out to me once a month on this from all over the state,” Patterson said. “The common denominator is DHCS. They all have different plans, they all have different providers, and all of them are having the same issue. So I'm just going to ask here in a public space so everybody can hear it. Can DHCS please commit to fixing this issue?”

But while California tries to solve its own medical financial issues, eyes will also be on the federal government as cuts could come to a group of programs that include Medicaid.

Those cuts are coming from a recent vote from house republicans.

The vote advanced a proposal that could result in cuts of around $880 billion to a group of programs over the next 10 years which includes Medicaid. According to some estimates, that breaks down to about $10 to 20 billion a year.</p>

At NVIDIA's GTC 2025 event in San Jose, California, this week – the so-called "Super Bowl of AI" – the chip giant announced multiple partnerships leveraging the power of AI to turbocharge applications in life sciences and healthcare, including a partnership with GE HealthCare and Google.

NVIDIA and GE HealthCare are developing AI-powered autonomous imaging solutions, beginning with X-ray and ultrasound technologies.

By leveraging NVIDIA's Isaac for Healthcare and Cosmos platforms, GE HealthCare plans to train and test autonomous imaging systems in a virtual environment before real-world deployment.

The initiative will initially focus on automating repetitive tasks in X-ray imaging, enabling care teams to spend more time on complex cases.

In ultrasound, AI-driven automation could help alleviate the physical strain on sonographers and improve imaging consistency.

"We are excited about the potential of autonomous X-ray and ultrasound as we focus on unlocking smarter, more automated solutions that enhance efficiency and ease the burden on healthcare professionals," Roland Rott, president and CEO of Imaging at GE HealthCare, said in a statement.

NVIDIA's GH200 and GB200 superchips, combined with CUDA-X libraries, are set to accelerate AI applications in healthcare and life sciences by delivering significant computational gains.

The latest architecture can speed up engineering simulations by up to 11x and support calculations five times larger than traditional accelerated computing platforms. These advances could drive breakthroughs in biomedical research, medical imaging, and drug discovery.

NVIDIA's cuDSS library is already enhancing large-scale engineering simulations, such as electromagnetic modeling and computational drug design, by making efficient use of shared CPU-GPU memory.

This technology, integrated into platforms like Ansys HFSS and Altair OptiStruct, allows researchers to run more complex simulations faster.

"The ability to solve massive computational problems without being constrained by memory limitations is a game changer for healthcare research and life sciences," Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, said in a statement.

NVIDIA and Alphabet's Google are deepening their AI partnership to accelerate advancements in healthcare, life sciences, and drug discovery by leveraging NVIDIA's GPUs and AI platforms, including Omniverse, Cosmos, and Isaac, to drive breakthroughs in medical research, robotics, and scientific computing.

Isomorphic Labs, a Google DeepMind-founded company focused on AI-driven drug discovery, has built a drug design engine on Google Cloud using NVIDIA GPUs, aiming to scale and refine AI models that could significantly improve therapeutic development.

In addition to drug research, the partnership will enhance Google Cloud's AI infrastructure, making NVIDIA's Blackwell-based GPUs available for computational workloads across biotech and medical imaging.

"AI and accelerated computing are transforming the future of healthcare, from drug discovery to robotics and cloud-based research," Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA said in a statement. "Together with Google, we are pushing the limits of AI to solve the most pressing challenges in medicine and science."

For the last few weeks, we've been busy covering the earnings calls of at-home care companies, which have revealed some key trends that providers are facing as they head into Q2. 

Specifically, Addus HomeCare Corporation (Nasdaq: ADUS), Enhabit Inc. (NYSE: EHAB), The Pennant Group (Nasdaq: PNTG), BrightSpring Health Services (Nasdaq: BTSG), Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: AVAH) and other publicly traded companies weighed in on industry issues and developments. 

These calls took place against the backdrop of regulatory uncertainty, with the Capitol Hill budget battle and the confirmation hearing of Dr. Oz for CMS chief being among the latest developments playing out in Washington, D.C.While home-based care executives weighed in on the uncertainty around programs like Medicaid, the cloudy outlook here did not seem to dampen executives' spirits. There was a sense of optimism around how certain strategies are bearing fruit, as well as enthusiasm about the growth potential for at-home care.

In this week's exclusive, members-only HHCN+ Update, I delve into some of the main takeaways that emerged during this latest earnings call season and offer key takeaways, including: 

— Carefully crafted payer strategies continue to fuel progress at certain home-based care companies. 

— Home-based care providers aren't just leaning on the company's key growth drivers. Instead, many are fine tuning their growth plans in order to reach new heights. 

— In addition to well-known challenges that providers are already facing, companies are also keeping an eye out for possible wrinkles that could negatively impact their businesses down the line. 

It's no secret that home health providers have been struggling with margin pressure related to Medicare Advantage rates. Commentary from Aveanna Healthcare and Enhabit executives provided reason for optimism on this front, as both companies shared some encouraging news related to their payer strategies – notably, their comments suggest how strong payer relationships not only create positive financial trends but can lead to improvements in staffing and clinical capacity. 

At Aveanna Healthcare, prioritizing preferred payers agreements is part of the company's larger transformation strategy. The company first began its transformation strategy, which centers around four primary initiatives, in 2023. Its purpose was to get back on track after a turbulent entrance into the public market.

Based in Atlanta, Aveanna Healthcare offers a range of pediatric and adult health care services. The company provides home health, hospice and pediatric care services. It has 327 locations across 34 states.

Aveanna Healthcare CEO Jeff Shaner once defined “preferred payers” as those “that support value-based care by offering us an above-market reimbursement rate and value-based payments in exchange for proven savings.” 

In Q4, the company landed eight additional preferred pay agreements, bumping its overall number up to 22.

In addition to contributing to the financial health of the company, Aveanna Healthcare has also seen other benefits to its preferred pay focus.

“We also experienced improvement in our caregiver hiring and retention trends by aligning our efforts with those payers willing to engage with us on enhanced reimbursement rates, and value-based agreements,” Shaner said last week during its Q4 earnings call. “While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, our preferred payer strategy allows us to return to a more normalized growth rate in our business segments.”

Improvement when it comes to hiring and retention trends is especially important at a time when providers continue to see the negative impact of a challenging labor market. 

Similar to Aveanna Healthcare, Enhabit also leaned on its payer innovation strategy. This has become increasingly important as the company navigates choppy waters. 

Last year, Enhabit faced a number of public battles amid its move to nail down a strategic direction. One thing that remains consistent is the company's strategy of creating “win-win” agreements with its payer partners.

“They get access to our high-quality care, superior outcomes and evidence-based specialty programs, and we get access to more members and competitive rates and terms,” Debra Konjanovski, senior vice president of payor innovation at Enhabit, previously told HHCN.  

Enhabit has shown a willingness to walk away from high-profile contracts when they no longer serve the company. In 2024, the company terminated its contract with UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE: UNH) UnitedHealthcare subsidiary, the largest MA administrator in the country. The two companies eventually formed a new agreement later that year.

In Q4, the company's payer innovation continued to bear fruit. Overall, 48% of Enhabit's non-Medicare visits are now in payer innovation contracts at improved rates. 

Enhabit also credited its payer innovation strategy for the improvement of its clinical capacity. The company negotiated 76 new contracts in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

“This, combined with continued staffing and cost disciplines, should allow us to expand home health margins as we exit 2025 despite CMS rate reimbursement increases not keeping pace with our overall market inflation,” Ryan Solomon, CFO of Enhabit, said during the Q4 earnings call earlier this month. 

Enhabit operates across 34 states and has more than 10,000 employees. The company's footprint includes 255 home health locations and 115 hospice locations.

The HHCN editorial team often asks providers to identify the main growth drivers that define their businesses. As a result, I've become familiar with the primary sources of growth at companies across the industry.

This earnings season, I was particularly interested in the comments about how BrightSpring and Pennant are planning to grow. In the case of BrightSpring, CEO Jon Rousseau was very explicit about leaning more into home-based primary care as a growth avenue and, further highlighting the importance of payer strategies, emphasized how expanding in home-based care can support involvement in shared savings frameworks. And Pennant's growth strategy for its home health business adds to a trend of health system tie-ups in the space.

BrightSpring is a Louisville, Kentucky-based company that delivers care to complex populations, offering primary care, home- and community-based services, pharmacy services and rehab services to over 400,000 consumers throughout 50 states.

Areas such as pharmacy solutions and community and rehab care have been strong growth drivers for BrightSpring. Still, the company has earmarked home-based primary care as a major future business opportunity.

“Our focus in home-based primary care is, how do we continue to drive that incredibly valuable service to as many patients as we can and get them in the ACO, so that we can drive more and more shared savings,” Rousseau said earlier this month during the company's Q4 earnings call. “We said before our five- to seven-year goal is how are we serving at least 100,000 or more people? That's what we're working towards.”

On its end, M&A has always been Pennant's bread and butter when it comes to accelerating growth. Specifically, the company's strategy involves purchasing community-driven home-based care companies with strong ties to their specific markets.

Eagle, Idaho-based Pennant Group is a holding company with independent operating subsidiaries that provide health care services. It has 131 home health and hospice agencies and 60 senior living communities.

During Q4, Pennant zeroed-in on what CEO Brent Guerisoli called “transformative partnerships.” 

In January 2024, the company entered into a joint venture with John Muir Health. Partnerships like this reflect the broader trend of home health growth through health system JVs, which fueled the growth of giants such as LHC Group and currently is a cornerstone for Compassus.

Pennant also joined forces with Hartford Health Care at Home (HHCAH), the home health and hospice segment of integrated health system Hartford HealthCare.

Guerisoli referred to the latter partnership as “a foundational relationship for future expansions in the eastern U.S.,” during the call. 

Addus is one of the biggest home-based care providers working in the Medicaid space, so it tracks that possible changes to the program would be top of mind for leaders at the company. But while the program clearly seems to be under threat, even the risks and uncertainty here did not significantly dampen Addus' outlook, maintaining the trend of generally upbeat messaging with regard to future prospects for at-home care.

Based in Frisco, Texas, Addus delivers home care, home health and hospice services to more than 62,000 consumers through 257 locations across 23 states.

In terms of government payers — which includes Medicaid — Addus has over 300 contracts with federal, state, county and municipal governments, according to the company's website. 

Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a budget resolution. While the proposal doesn't specifically name Medicaid, experts believe that a reduction in federal Medicaid spending is on the table. 

Though Addus CEO Dirk Allison said he believes that the impact to the company's business will be minimal, he pointed out the few ways they would be affected by cuts.

“The only states we serve that could be impacted by the lowering or removal of the FMAP floor would be California and Washington, [whose] combined Medicaid revenue represents approximately 2% of our total consolidated revenue,” he said during the call.

The Q4 call was also an opportunity for Allison to speak on the value of the Medicaid program more generally.

“Medicaid is a valuable state and federal lifeline to the extremely at-risk population that we serve, which, if cut, could lead to much higher total cost of care for both states and the federal government,” Allison said. “At Addus, we are focused on our strategy of expanding our services to this population as it relates to home care, which we believe remains valuable to both our states as well as Congress and this administration. We are encouraged by the bipartisan congressional comments opposing cuts to the Medicaid program.”

While Addus' leaders see the company as largely insulated from Medicaid risk, the same cannot be said for every provider that relies on Medicaid. Given that one theme of the recent earnings calls was the ability of at-home care to lower costs and deliver value to payers, I only hope that the government is hearing this message and crafting policy accordingly.

City leaders will explore the possibility of a sale of Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare property after hospital officials proposed restructuring its governance agreement in a way that city staff say would decrease city authority and oversight in broader strategic decisions affecting the healthcare system. 

To position itself for continued growth and new partnerships, the nonprofit, community based hospital wants to create a new health system board whose members wouldn't require "city confirmation authority" to oversee the broader TMH health system. The existing board would continue to manage the hospital's day-to-day operations, according to city agenda materials.

The move touched off an extraordinary staff report on the city's relationship with the hospital, potential acquisitions that could transform TMH in the future and a deep dive into the ownership arrangement to "ensure the city's interests are preserved." 

"In light of TMH's proposal, staff will evaluate whether continued city ownership remains in the city's long-term interest," according to the report in commission agenda materials for next week's meeting. "As part of this analysis, staff will also explore the feasibility and potential advantages of a possible sale of the property, considering all available options and approaches." 

While many were surprised to see the issue pop up on the agenda, City Manager Reese Goad said he added the informational item for city commissioners review because many people don't realize the city owns all of the land, buildings, equipment and other assets associated with TMH — including the fixtures inside the hospital such as beds, X-ray machines and more.

The city's largest healthcare provider began as a city-run hospital in the 1940s and transitioned into an independent, nonprofit healthcare system under a long-term lease agreement with the City.

"I think it's healthy for us to all understand the history and the current status," Goad told the Tallahassee Democrat. "That'll enable a fuller discussion for the city commission to evaluate changing the board status, and really the evolution of health care in our region."

While the city agenda item brought up the specter of a possible acquisition of the hospital by a for-profit or nonprofit entity in line with industry trends, TMH officials said there are "no current plans to transition to a different ownership or operational model."

TMH Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Stephanie Derzypolski said the request for the governance change was partially influenced by the hospital's partnership with FSU Health but mostly driven by its substantial growth over the years, which includes a new healthcare campus taking shape in Panama City.

"In fact, one goal of our relationship with FSU is to preserve our independence and avoid acquisition by a large for-profit hospital system," Derzypolski said in an emailed statement.

The hospital serves 21 counties across North Florida and Georgia, according to agenda materials. It has been in a long-term lease agreement with the city since 1979 when the city selected the non-profit group to control hospital operations. Goad said the rent has been set at $1 a year since the two parties entered into the lease.

"This structure allows the City to retain ownership and oversight while enabling TMH to expand its medical services and partnerships," agenda materials say.

Derzypolski clarified that the hospital has no intentions of terminating its lease with the city, or asking the city to consider selling.

"TMH's request to the city was simply for confirmation of changes to its governing documents in accordance with the provisions of the lease," she said.

If the governance is updated, this will not change "the city's ownership of the property or TMH's responsibility for operating the hospital and its related facilities," Derzypolski said.

Goad said the city will have to fully look at the ramifications and conduct a legal analysis before any decision is made, but he said he wouldn't assume that TMH is looking to pull away from city ownership: "I don't think that'll happen."

However, the city agenda item points to a steady decline in independent and nonprofit hospitals due to financial pressure, forcing many to "merge with larger health systems, including university-affiliated hospitals, larger nonprofit entities, and for-profit entities."

It also highlights UF Health Shands and its expansion through "strategic acquisitions and developments." But Goad said while the comparison of the Gainesville-based hospital system to the TMH-FSU Health partnership is warranted, "it might be premature."

According to agenda materials, the city "retains ownership of the land, buildings, equipment, and other assets associated" with TMH. Goad clarified that assets include everything but vehicles, yet the city has no financial obligation if something needs to be repaired or replaced, meaning there's no impact to the city's budget.

Everything is entirely paid for by TMH, he said.

When the two parties created a long-term lease agreement in 1979, everything on the property was leased to TMH. But even though everything is the city's property, the city cannot take items from the hospital.

"We cannot intervene in their operation," Goad said.

The city manger expects a robust discussion at the Wednesday, March 26, city commission meeting at 3 p.m. at City Hall.

"It could be a meaningful milestone in health care in Tallahassee," he said.

After the article published, City Commissioner Jack Porter reached out to the Tallahassee Democrat and said she has “no interest in the City selling TMH.”

Two motions from the Yukon Party regarding health care in the territory have passed unanimously in the Yukon legislature.

Motions in the legislature are non-binding and usually symbolic.

One motion, introduced by the health critic Brad Cathers, the MLA for Lake Laberge, called for the government to take advantage of the turmoil and tumult south of the border with a marketing campaign targeted at U.S. healthcare workers. The motion also asked YG allow U.S.-certified doctors to work in the Yukon, and give other U.S.-trained healthcare workers a fast pass to a license. It was introduced on March 13.

The other motion was moved by the leader of the official opposition, Currie Dixon. His motion proposed YG strike a joint task force with the Yukon Medical Association to explore ways to reduce administrative burden on doctors. However, as reported by the News, the motion was also introduced by Cathers in the legislature the previous week.

Health Minister Tracy-Anne McPhee amended both motions when they came up in the legislature on March 19.

With the motion regarding U.S. doctors, McPhee proposed a change of wording: instead of urging YG to “take immediate steps” to recruit U.S. health-care workers, the amendment said the government should consult with the Yukon Medical Associations and other professional health care organizations on appropriate recruitment measures, for health-care workers from the U.S. and elsewhere.

She also changed the language to specify that the marketing campaign would be targeted towards Americans.

McPhee said the amendment would make the motion more inclusive. Incorporating the Yukon Medical Association would be able to provide expertise on how to address recruitment and retention, she said.

“They are the front-line individuals who work in these professions,” she said.

“We absolutely must consult with them and work to collaborate with them to determine how we can best spend Yukon resources — those resources being financial, energy, opportunities or marketing — to make sure that we are reaching the audiences that we need to in order to work to solve this problem.”

Cathers accused McPhee of watering down the motion.

“The minister's proposal also takes out any reference to taking immediate action, and what we have seen from this Liberal government is a lot of lip service since we raised this issue two years ago,” said Cathers.

In defending the amendment, Premier Ranj Pillai made reference to British Columbia's U.S.-doctor-poaching plan. He said our southern neighbour is targeting doctors from west coast “blue states.”

McPhee also said she was in contact with B.C. health minister to learn more about the province's outreach to U.S. doctors, and what the Yukon can learn from it.

The Yukon Party members voted against the amendment, but the NDP members supported it. The motion was amended with 10 votes in favour. Yukon Party members did support the amended motion itself, however, and it passed unanimously.

As for the motion to strike a joint task force on reducing the administrative burden on doctors, McPhee introduced an amendment to do away with introducing a special task force altogether, instead asking the Yukon government to simply work with the Yukon Medical Association to find ways to reduce the burden of administration on doctors.

McPhee has previously called the idea of a new task force redundant, a sentiment she repeated in the legislature on March 19.

“I brought this amendment because a task force, Mr. Speaker, is not what is needed,” said McPhee. “We should not duplicate tables that exist already.”

In an email sent out on March 20, cabinet communications listed seven different committees and groups dedicated to healthcare such as the Joint Management Committee, Health Human Resources Steering Committee, Fee Liaison Committee, Joint Administrative Committee, the Physician Payment Advisory Committee, Digital Health Strategy Working Group, and the “Tripartite Leadership” meetings which are called as necessary.

McPhee's amendment received unanimous support from other members in the legislature, with Dixon saying the ultimate goal was getting the administrative load lifted from doctors.

The amended motion also passed unanimously.

The American Hospital Association and the nonprofit Health-ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) are warning of a potential terrorist threat against U.S. hospitals in the coming weeks.

On March 18, user @AXactual made a post on X with details related to the active planning of a coordinated, multi-city terrorist attack on United States health sector organizations, according to the joint threat bulletin.

The terrorist attack on hospitals would reportedly be by ISIS-K, a division of the jihadist group Islamic State, according to The HIPAA Journal. The post was added to the X account of American Kinetix, which claims to be a Christian company in the United States that consists of JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command), the CIA and combat veterans, The HIPAA Journal said.

American Kinetix said it had received reports of possible pre-attack surveillance at hospitals.

The post said chatter in ISIS-K training camps in Afghanistan confirmed planning is in the advanced stages, The HIPAA Journal said. According to the post, ISIS-K would use Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs) followed by armed assaults and hostage scenarios. 

"Intelligence suggests these attacks must occur before Al-Q'aida's planned aviation/D.C. attack, likely making hospitals a prelude to a larger-scale operation," explained the post, according to that report.

The primary targets would be mid-tier cities with low-security facilities, the joint threat bulletin said. With the information claiming multiple simultaneous targets, attackers would likely select health sector facilities with visibly weak security and conduct prior planning coordination. 

It is common practice for individuals contemplating targeted acts of violence to conduct pre-attack surveillance and reconnaissance, the bulletin said. Having a visible security presence can mitigate being chosen as a target during the planning phase of an attack.

The AHA and Health-ISAC said they were sharing the joint threat bulletin out of an abundance of caution to spread awareness of the potential threat. The AHA and Health-ISAC are in close contact with the FBI and said they would provide additional information as it became available.

At this time, no information is available to either corroborate or discount this threat's credibility, the bulletin said. 

"Generally, foreign terrorist groups do not publicize their upcoming attacks," the AHA and Health-ISAC said in the bulletin. "However, this widely viewed post may encourage others to engage in malicious activity directed toward the health sector, so threats of this nature should be taken seriously. Security teams should review emergency management plans and spread awareness of the potential threat internally."

The groups recommended that organizations review and evaluate the coordination and capabilities of physical security, cybersecurity and emergency management plans and to increase relationships with local and federal law enforcement to streamline response efforts during an attack.

Mr. Rajeev Taneja, Founder and Managing Director of GlobalCare Health, emphasizes the need for improved awareness and support stating, “”Over the past five years, India's medical tourism industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth. After a pandemic-induced decline in 2020, the sector rebounded strongly, growing at a consistent 20-25% (CAGR) YOY. This consistent upward trajectory is a testament to our state-of-the-art medical facilities, robust infrastructure, and the unwavering support from the government in promoting India as the wellness destination. Our medical fraternity stands among the best globally, ensuring that patients receive world-class care without compromise. In a world where conflicts and economic instability often disrupt access to quality healthcare, India stands tall as a beacon of medical excellence. By 2025, the medical tourism industry is expected to reach USD 8.35 billion, with projections estimating nearly double that amount—approximately USD 18 billion—by 2027.

The Administrative Court has today rejected the appeal filed by several private care providers in primary care to remove the requirement for Millennium in primary care.

The Administrative Court writes regarding the principle of proportionality:

No evidence has been presented to support that the examples of procedure proposed by the Companies are less intrusive than the introduction of the requirement. The fact that the proposed solutions on the part of the Companies offer an equivalent alternative to the requirement does not lead to the conclusion that the requirement is not necessary to achieve the intended purpose.

Comment from Carasent CEO, Daniel Öhman:

"My impression now is that most private care providers in primary care in VGR believe that they will avoid Millennium, but I would still be surprised if they do not appeal. The Administrative Court does not question that it is possible to achieve VGR's goal without forcing everyone into the same system, but it says that it has not been proven that integration with existing systems is less intrusive than forcing everyone into Millennium. This should be quite obvious and easy to show in the next instance."

PHOENIX — Business leaders hope Arizona will be at the forefront of the AI revolution. From software to robots, the Arizona AI Venture Network hosted a networking event showcasing many of the different AI businesses that call the Valley home.

“Artificial Intelligence is in effect computers that are able to think and reason like human beings with all the known knowledge in the universe stored in their memory banks," Bill Swartz, the founder of the AI Venture Network said.

One of the featured businesses is Revobots.

“Traditionally, robots have had to have very controlled environments, doing the same motion over and over again," Kent Gilson said.

Gilson's robot instead learns from humans about what job they should perform. At the event, the robot is pouring water back and forth into two separate cups after Gilson showed it how to do the task.

Gilson doesn't see it as replacing workers, but helping businesses hire labor they can't get anyway.

“These are just going to go get a job," Gilson said. "Right now there are millions of jobs that are unfilled that we can't find anyone to actually do.”

Applications of AI go far beyond robots. Scottsdale-based Oxygen4Life uses AI to detect chronic diseases. The AI scans the body and compares it to a database of other scans, helping people detect health issues earlier.

“It's the world's most advanced infrared imaging equipment to detect inflammatory and chronic diseases," Mike Maunu said. "I know we'll save lives."

Karl Ernsberger is the founder of SkipCourse, and he is trying to use AI to help educate children.

"A school can only teach a certain number of courses or hire a certain number of teachers," Ernsberger said.

His AI model has students input their own assignments. It then helps them figure out their own learning curriculum.

"The feedback they get leads them to the next assignment," Ernsberger said. "Here's the next thing you should do, here's this field trip you can go on, here's a mentor in the field you're interested in you can connect with."

The World Economic Forum projects AI will create a 21% increase in the U.S. GDP by the end of the decade. Swartz hopes events like this help Arizona be part of that growth.

“I want to create a consortium across the state, rallying around AI and robotics, which helps make Arizona a world-class center.”

Oklahoma's insurance commissioner is warning that people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace could see sizeable increases in their health insurance premiums if federal enhanced Advanced Premium Tax Credits are not extended by Dec. 31.

Commissioner Glen Mulready said the permanent extension of $338 billion of federal health insurance subsidies looks more unlikely, which could lead to a significant spike in health insurance premiums in 2026.

"While there might be other potential solutions considered by Congress this year, Oklahoma's leaders and citizens need to be prepared for the consequences of these subsidies ending with significant changes in health insurance costs anticipated," the Republican commissioner said in a news release.

The warning comes as the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress have been seeking to slash federal spending in the face of a $36 trillion national debt.

Higher costs of health insurance premiums could push individuals to leave the marketplace and shift to Medicaid or be left uninsured, further exacerbating rate increases, according to a state Insurance Department news release.

In response, the Oklahoma Association of Health Plans is calling on the state Legislature to support bills aimed at minimizing additional hikes, including House Bill 1161, Senate Bill 1096 and Senate Bill 1067.

"If the tax credits don't go through, I think we're going to see Oklahomans that are no longer insured or who are (not) going to be able to afford their insurance," said Haley Faulkenberry, the association's executive director. "This is why it's so important that the Legislature pass bills (like these), so we're not overwhelming our premium payers in Oklahoma with additional costs that may not make sense."

Monthly medical bills for about 300,000 state residents enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans could rise as much as 165% next year without the federal subsidies, according to the state Insurance Department.

Mulready said Oklahoma Marketplace's silver plan, a common insurance choice, would rise to $153 a month next year from $58.

While he remains hopeful Congress can come to a compromise to lessen the impact of the tax credit cutoff, Mulready said, "Oklahomans and my fellow elected leaders must understand the potential impact of the expiration of these federal subsidies."

Lower- and middle-income individuals or families who depend on credits to pay for insurance coverage will be most affected.

Faulkenberry said the Legislature needs to make decisions now to protect Oklahomans from increased health insurance premium costs, which could potentially lead to increased uninsured rates in the state.

"The data clearly showed that without congressional action this year, Oklahoma families will face higher health care costs due to the expiration of eAPTCs. We urge those in Washington, D.C., to strongly consider what this means for Oklahomans," Faulkenberry said in a statement.

Oops, something went wrong

Quarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company's progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and the best and worst performers in the healthcare providers & services industry.

The healthcare providers and services sector, encompassing insurers to hospitals to outpatient care facilities, benefit from the consistent demand for healthcare services. Stable or even recurring revenues can be earned through insurance premiums, patient care contracts, and testing services agreements. However, the business models face challenges such as high operational costs especially if significant labor is involved. Reimbursement pressures from public and private payers can impact margins and an evolving regulatory landscape adds uncertainty to it all. Looking forward, this sector is poised to benefit from tailwinds such as the aging population, which means rising prevalence of chronic diseases. There is also broad demand for value-based care models, which emphasize cost efficiency and patient outcomes. Advances in telehealth, data analytics, and personalized medicine are likely to create new revenue opportunities for companies that can successfully digitize. However, headwinds abound, including labor shortages in clinical settings, continued reimbursement cuts, and regulatory scrutiny over pricing and care quality.

The 40 healthcare providers & services stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts' consensus estimates by 1.6% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line.
