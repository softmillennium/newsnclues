⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious A meticulously crafted 2015 Camaro conversion replicates the look of a 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle, blending modern performance with vintage muscle aesthetics. This unique build, set to cross the auction block, seamlessly merges classic muscle car styling with modern performance. The project, showcased by Mecum Auctions, replaces the Camaro’s factory body with custom fiberglass molds reinforced with carbon fiber, sculpted to replicate the timeless look of a ’69 Chevelle. From the sculpted hood to the iconic Chevelle grille and centered emblem, the attention to detail makes this vehicle a convincing throwback to one of Chevrolet’s most beloved muscle cars. Despite its exterior transformation, the car’s interior remains largely stock to the original 2015 Camaro, aside from a set of redesigned headrests. While some purists may have preferred a full retro-inspired cabin makeover, the original modern amenities provide a functional and comfortable driving experience. The vehicle, which has already logged 40,000 miles, is scheduled for auction later this month, offering collectors and enthusiasts the chance to own a one-of-a-kind blend of past and present. In a world where classic restorations and modern restomods often require trade-offs, this Camaro-based Chevelle homage proves that bridging the gap between two automotive eras is possible—if you’re willing to invest the time.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/certified-pre-owned-cars-worth-155156236.html'>Are certified pre-owned cars worth it? Yes — here’s how to buy one</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 20:09:00 <p>
Finding perfect financing for your CPO requires the same care you would take when buying a new or used option. Certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles have to meet additional standards from manufacturers or dealers. Buying a certified pre-owned car offers several benefits as well, including extended warranties and lower overall costs. Certified pre-owned vehicles are returned leased vehicles or newer trade-ins that go through additional inspections by factory-trained mechanics before they’re put up for sale. They are typically sold at less of a markup than new vehicles, though they tend to cost more than the average used option. According to recent data from Consumer Reports, CPO vehicles have consistently fewer mechanical issues than other used options — so the higher price tends to pay off in the long run. A certified pre-owned car can also give you more peace of mind if you are wary of buying a used car. The warranty offered by manufacturers, among other benefits, make a CPO car more expensive — but may bring much-needed peace of mind when you’re shopping. Learn more: Try our new vs. used car loan calculator A certified pre-owned vehicle may come with an extended warranty. Look for a list of components that aren’t covered — like tires — under the CPO warranty. Another benefit of buying certified pre-owned is that it generally lowers the vehicle’s overall cost over time. You won’t have to worry about future mechanical issues or repair costs as much as you would with a used car that isn’t certified. Depending on the manufacturer and dealer, you may be able to return the car within a certain amount of time if it doesn’t meet your expectations. This isn’t available for all CPO vehicles, though, so check with the dealer before signing on if you want this feature. Before you start shopping, prepare to take out an auto loan by completing some basic research, shopping around for a great deal and pouring over the car’s details and inspection report to ensure you’re buying the best possible auto for your needs. Start by considering what you truly need in a car: competitive gas mileage, lots of space or just something simple to get from point A to point B. Research prices for different vehicle options and check sites like Kelley Blue Book (KBB) and Edmunds to see current prices. Pay close attention to any features you value, like backup cameras, seat temperature controls or towing ability. Once you know what vehicle you might want, check out the CPO programs offered by the manufacturer or dealership of your choice. Vehicle history: Is it made available to potential buyers? Available discounts: Does the manufacturer offer special incentives, like 0 percent APR? After you narrow down your choices, it is time to shop. If you have a solid idea of the type of vehicle you want, heading directly to the franchised dealerships is your best bet. Otherwise, shopping online allows you time to compare options with tools offered by Edmunds and KBB. Requesting and reading the inspection report before purchase can give you extra confidence. The report should detail any previous accidents, damage or mechanical problems. Trusted dealers perform inspections that should cover the following: While an outside inspection by a third-party mechanic isn’t strictly necessary, it’s still smart to have an unbiased professional inspect any used vehicle. If the seller pushes back at this request, consider shopping elsewhere. While the introduction of “buy online” auto sales has meant many cars are sold off the lot for a set price without any wiggle room, it never hurts to ask if you can pay less than what they’re asking. Come equipped with any information you learned from the inspection and use it as leverage to get the best deal on your used car. And look out for dealer options the seller might try to add on that aren’t always worth it. Coming in with an auto loan lined up will give you even more room to negotiate a deal you’ll be proud of.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/us-leading-autonomous-vehicle-company-194328011.html'>US’ Leading Autonomous Vehicle Company Collected 589 Parking Tickets Last Year in San Francisco</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 19:43:28 <p>
Tickets for Waymo’s fleet, which is comprised of 300 vehicles, equated to $65,065. Comparatively, Los Angeles tagged Waymo with 75 tickets last year, where the company has 100 deployed vehicles, but its service was launched in November of 2024. The autonomous rideshare company has attributed its San Francisco tickets to vehicles dropping off passengers in commercial loading zones when alternative drop-off areas were congested main roads or a spot too far from the rider’s destination, along with brief parking between trips when cars were too far from Waymo’s facility. Waymo SUVs have also been cited for blocking traffic and ignoring street cleaning schedules. Sterling Haywood, who has been a San Francisco parking control officer for 17 years, told The Washington Post: “I gave it [Waymo vehicle] the same courtesy I would give if there was somebody in the car.” Haywood described this courtesy as honking twice to warn the Waymo taxi that it was parked in a street cleaning zone during enforcement hours in San Francisco’s Mission District. After the Waymo vehicle didn’t move, he placed a $96 dollar ticket on its window. Waymo has received the most tickets for street cleaning violations at 138 citations, however, it’s important to note that Waymo’s 589 tickets last year in San Francisco represent less than 1% of the city’s 1.2 million issued tickets during 2024. Waymo operates 24/7 across San Francisco, so accounting for less than 1% of the city’s tickets during 2024 can be viewed as quite impressive. Unlike General Motors-backed Cruise’s self-driving vehicles, which hit San Francisco streets in 2022, Waymo is still operating its fleet and growing. While it would be ideal for Waymo SUVs to avoid tickets altogether during instances like parking in street cleaning zones during enforcement hours, the rideshare service would likely receive more criticism if its fleet dropped off pedestrians in dangerous areas to avoid citations.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/311109/tether-engaging-with-big-4-accounting-firm-report'>Tether Engaging With 'Big 4' Accounting Firm on Independent Audit: Report</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 19:43:10 <p>
Stablecoin giant Tether has said that it is in talks with a Big Four accounting firm to get independently audited, according to a report on Friday by Reuters. The Big Four accounting firms are PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG. Tether did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. Tether mints stablecoins—digital tokens backed by assets such as gold and dollars. USDT, which Tether says is backed by U.S. treasuries and other assets, runs on a number of blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. It will also soon be available on Bitcoin’s network. Traders use USDT—and other stablecoins—to quickly enter and exit crypto transactions without having to access traditional financial rails, a reason for their popularity. Tether has said it is keen to work with a Big Four firm for an audit. Tether in 2021 agreed to no longer do business in New York after a two-year state attorney general investigation found that the firm had "made false statements about the backing" of its token. New Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, currently custodies billions of dollars in assets that back Tether.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Public Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies. This week: After predicting it wouldn’t survive this long, Bakkt Holdings has undergone another transformation; the largest securities clearinghouse in the world doubles down on Ethereum; and Robinhood launches a prediction market for your March Madness bracket. There’s new business afoot for crypto trading and payment solutions company Bakkt, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the BKKT symbol. But there’s also a bit of blood in the water. The company just hired a new co-CEO: Akshay Naheta, who oversaw SoftBank’s investments in chip manufacturer ARM and GPU giant Nvidia. “Once this partnership takes effect, Bakkt believes it will be positioned to unlock new revenue streams in crypto trading and stablecoin payments, while adding efficiency to the vast and rapidly growing cross-border payments market,” the company said in its press release. This isn’t the first time things have looked bleak for Bakkt. Around this time last year, the company had just announced a big international expansion. If it seems like Bakkt is pivoting at a dizzying rate, remember that it has strong ties to Wall Street and has been given a lot of space to figure out what kind of company it wants to be. Case in point: Bakkt was launched in 2018 by Intercontinental Exchange, which also goes by ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. The initial vision was for Bakkt to act as a regulated Bitcoin futures and custody platform. “The divestiture is expected to streamline operations by reducing operating expenses by $3.8 million annually and freeing up approximately $3.0 million of capital held for regulatory reserves,” the company wrote in its earnings report. It handles the bulk of clearing, settlement, and trade reporting for U.S. markets. The company, which is owned by its bank and institution customers, processed securities transactions valued at $3 quadrillion in 2023. The Japan Securities Clearing Corporation has been collaborating with DTCC to test out settlements on Ethereum since last year. And Hong Kong’s central securities depository has been partial to the Canton Network. After making its big announcement with March Madness markets, the company added a new one that invites users to wager on whether Fed fund rates will be above 4% or 4.25% after the next Federal Open Markets Committee meeting. In October, Kalshi won its yearslong legal battle against the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Earlier this week, Robinhood got a “Buy” rating from research firm Compass Point as it initiated coverage of the company. Coinbase is in advanced talks to buy crypto derivatives exchange Derebit, unnamed sources told Bloomberg. Derebit, founded in 2016, is the world’s largest platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Coinbase already offers derivatives trading, but not in the United Kingdom or Spain—two regions where Derebit is available. Earlier this year, the news outlet reported that Coinbase competitor Kraken was eyeing it for an acquisition. But at the time of writing, was changing hands for $188.69 and trailing its opening price by 0.85%. Strategy started the week like a lamb and ended it by saying MOAR. The software company, which trades on Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, made its smallest Bitcoin buy yet by adding 130 Bitcoin valued at $10.7 million to its corporate reserve on Monday. The next day, it unveiled a $500 million offering of its Strife (STRF) perpetual preferred stock to fund more BTC acquisition. Then, by Friday, it had upsized that offering to $723 million. Bitcoin mining stocks had another rough week, despite getting good news from none other than the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Top publicly traded miners MARA, CleanSpark, and Bitdeer had all lost a few percentage points by Friday afternoon. But it’s not all bad news for miners: Bitfarms completed its acquisition of Stronghold in a deal valued at $175 million. Don’t feel too bad for Kraken missing out on a Derebit acquisition. On Thursday, the exchange announced that it has acquired futures broker NinjaTrader in a deal valued at $1.5 billion. The Dubai Financial Services Authority put out the call for “expressions of interest” from companies wanting to experiment with “tokenization services” in its regulatory sandbox.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/cadillac-no-plans-gas-powered-192500701.html'>Cadillac Has No Plans For A Gas-Powered CT4 And CT5 In The Future: Report</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 19:25:00 <p>
Undeterred by its plans to walk back the promise of an all-electric lineup by 2030, Cadillac will still end production of the gas-powered CT4 and CT5 sedans after this generation. Right now, it would seem that a few all-electric sedans are on the table, but when these cars go away, it will almost certainly be the end of internal combustion-powered sedans at Caddy. Admittedly, these vehicles may not take the traditional three-box sedan form factor. Unnamed sources tell the outlet that they may have a sportback profile similar to the Escala concept or ultra-luxurious Celestiq. It's supposed to be a more upscale, premium version of General Motors' BEV3 platform, which underpins the Lyriq, Optiq, Vistiq, Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV. Read more: The 2024 Lexus GX 550 Turned Me Into A Believer From my experience of driving some of these cars, it already feels like a rather premium platform, so it'll be exciting to see what GM engineers can do with a bespoke luxury platform. It'll certainly be interesting to see if Cadillac buyers actually want an electric sedan — or if they're going to want sedans at all. It makes sense why Cadillac has so far put all of its EV eggs in the crossover basket (Celestiq notwithstanding). We have no additional product plans to announce at this time."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In a display of a location we likely have yet to see, this video shows us a world of classic and modern luxury cars thought to have been lost to time. At first you can see some vehicles that are a bit tricky in terms of identifying what they actually are. This was definitely the case for one vehicle that ports Gullwing doors and a unique front facia. Perhaps someone a little more knowledgeable would be able to point out the exact make, year, and model but the shots that we do get of this particular car are difficult to assess. Either way it's something of great significance if not simply because of its rarity then also for its part in the collection. Rather, a majority of these cars are from later years than you might expect, including one Bently which looks like it's from the early to mid 2000s. This raises a lot of questions as to when the collection was left there and why exactly such a massive gathering of cars was abandoned. Despite Europe, especially the UK, seeming to be a sort of hub for internet car finds, you'd be hard pressed to find anything like this on YouTube making it a truly special experience. One of the coolest cars in the entire piece has to be a Formula One car which has been stripped down a bit since its days where it may have once competed.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/compare-specs-2025-honda-civic-190000822.html'>We Compare Specs on the 2025 Honda Civic, Mazda 3, and Acura Integra</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 19:00:00 <p>
While vehicles have been trending upward in size for a while, there are a few reasons why compact cars and hatchbacks still have mass appeal. Cars in this segment offer impressive fuel economy, solid value for money, and often some driving verve. The Acura Integra, Honda Civic, and Mazda 3 are popular examples of compacts that deliver on all of those fronts. The Acura Integra is offered solely with a 200-hp turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder and front-wheel drive. In base models, the engine is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), while the top-tier A-Spec Technology trim is available with a six-speed manual. While the Integra has the most potent base engine in this trio of compacts, those looking for even more punch should consider the racier Integra Type S, which features a 320-hp turbocharged inline-four and a standard six-speed manual. The base engine is available with either front- or all-wheel drive, and a six-speed manual can be ordered on front-drive hatchback models. Turbo models that feature the more powerful engine come standard with all-wheel drive and an automatic transmission. While lacking go-pedal gusto, the Honda Civic's standard engine is impressively efficient. Six-speed-equipped models perform notably worse in the city and marginally poorer on the highway, with ratings of 26 mpg and 36 mpg, respectively. The most economical sedan variant equipped with the base engine earns EPA ratings of 27 mpg city and 37 mpg highway. As a hatchback fitted with the turbocharged engine, the 3's fuel-economy figures fall substantially to 23 mpg city and 31 mpg highway. While compact cars aren’t known for being particularly spacious, the Integra, Civic, and Mazda 3 offer seating for five and are available in hatchback variants that expand cargo capacity behind the rear seats. In our testing, we were able to put six carry-on suitcases into the Civic hatchback and five into both the Integra and Mazda 3. While the Integra comes exclusively as a hatchback, both the Civic and Mazda 3 are offered as sedans that provide less cargo room than their five-door-hatch counterparts. With a base price of $25,135, the Mazda 3 is the least expensive of these three compacts, but you'll have to fork over an additional $5460 if you want all-wheel drive. The Carbon Turbo trim, which couples all-wheel drive with the more powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged engine, costs even more at $33,285. Without any options, an entry-level 2025 Civic LX sedan costs $25,245. The Sport trim, which adds equipment such as blind-spot monitoring, remote start, and 18-inch wheels, is priced at $27,345 in sedan form. Upgrading to the A-Spec trim for an additional $2600 adds sportier exterior styling, special interior trim, and LED fog lights.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

San Francisco-based AI developer Perplexity AI was again making the case for taking over TikTok's embattled social media platform amid reports that it had started talks to raise money at a potential $18 billion valuation. In a blog post published on Friday, Perplexity claimed it is the best choice for an American company to take over TikTok before a U.S. presidential order banning the Chinese company is expected to take effect on April 5. Perplexity AI, launched in 2022, is an AI-powered search engine that delivers real-time, cited answers through a conversational interface. It combines large language models with live web data for accuracy and transparency. Perplexity joins a group of American companies—including Oracle, Microsoft, and Walmart—that have previously expressed interest in acquiring TikTok. At one point, X owner Elon Musk was rumored to be interested in acquiring TikTok. While it makes its case for taking over TikTok, Perplexity AI is eyeing a new funding round after valuing the company at $18 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg. The valuation and news of the upcoming funding round come as Perplexity broadens its offerings beyond search to include AI-driven tools that help users find answers more efficiently. Next week, we will start giving access to a small set of initial users. We are trying our best to get it out in a few weeks. Using its AI, powered by Nvidia’s new Dynamo platform, Perplexity said it could boost TikTok’s recommendation system while improving transparency amid rising concerns over misinformation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Among funds, which began trading last year, outflows from the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) totaled $146 million and $106 million, the most over this period, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. The outflows have dovetailed with Ethereum’s tumble to its current level of around $1,950 from $2,200 on March 5, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko. The asset has swooned in recent months amid investors doubts about its speed and efficiency compared to blockchain rivals and a wider fall-off in crypto and other risk-on assets prompted by macroeconomic angst. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $660 million this week, regaining a small amount of ground lost in their own recent downturn. In an interview on Thursday at the Digital Asset Summit in New York, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, said that the Ethereum ETFs’ lackluster debut came partly because they do not permit staking. NYSE Arca filed for just that on behalf of Bitwise this week, while Grayscale, 21Shares and Fidelity have also filed for rule changes on their funds to permit staking. Staking rewards are issued to Ethereum investors that lock up their capital and participate in the process of validating transactions. Spot Ethereum funds have generated $2.45 billion in net inflows since their debut last July, with BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF garnering $587 million. Analysts consider their launch successful, although their performance is dwarfed by spot Bitcoin ETFs that have received more than $35 billion in net inflows, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. “This highlights a growing institutional risk appetite for BTC, while ETH’s recovery remains sluggish as investors wait for stronger catalysts,” the crypto research firm BRN said on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Friday.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It seems despite feedback from the market indicating electric cars continue to have niche appeal, Cadillac is moving forward on plans to switch its sedans for EVs. This could be yet another example of GM reacting in all the wrong ways, failing to read the room, and even telling consumers what they want. We’re sure some will find this plan to be brilliant and forward-thinking. Time will tell if this is a major flub and black eye for the Cadillac brand or a way for it to at least keep up with if not leapfrog the competition. Instead, GM will keep them around a bit longer, then replace both with new EV models. Supposedly, these two all-electric sedans will have a sportback design, similar to the Cadillac Escala concept. They’re supposedly going to be using the brand’s next-generation EV architecture, too, which is a leap beyond what the Lyriq and others currently use. This information comes yet again from anonymous sources within GM, so we wouldn’t exactly call it gospel truth. We know the talk within Cadillac for a long time was how the brand could catch up or surpass premium European brands like Mercedes and BMW. Do you think it’s wise for Cadillac to abandon the premium internal combustion engine market like this?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Wood Brothers Racing played a pivotal role in Jim Clark's historic Indy 500 win for Lotus in 1965, and for this weekend's NASCAR throwback race at Darlington Raceway the team is reliving that wonderful winning weekend with a classic green and yellow livery paint scheme. Josh Berry's number 21 Motorcraft Ford will be decked out in the same British racing green and canary yellow as Clark's famed Lotus-Ford was sixty years ago. The throwback look was unveiled on Thursday with a commemorative event at The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan, where Clark's original race-winner is displayed. "This was a really fun project to work on with the team, from sorting all the details to making sure it properly reflected such an important moment in history," said Jon Wood, president of Wood Brothers Racing. "It's always special to run a throwback, but this one carries extra meaning because of the connection our family had to that Indy 500 win. 21 in those colors is a great way to honor that history, and I think it's something fans will really appreciate."

The Woods came up with an innovative gravity-feed pressurized venturi fueling system that packed a car to the brim in mere seconds while other teams were still relying on fuel cans and pumps. According to a recounting from Leonard Wood one of the Indianapolis pit stall inspectors didn't believe it would work, and bet the team that they "couldn't pour 20 gallons a minute to come out of that tank." The Wood Brothers still say that Clark used a single set of tires for the full 500 mile race. Maybe with some quick pit stops and a fast Ford engine Berry can find his way to victory lane again after winning last weekend's Las Vegas round.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/whoopsie-tesla-recalled-nearly-every-175300307.html'>Whoopsie, Tesla Recalled Nearly Every Cybertruck Because It Used the Wrong Glue</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 17:53:00 <p>
But unlike many of its previous offenses, this is one of the first significant body repairs that can’t be addressed with a simple over-the-air update. The recall affects 46,096 Cybertrucks manufactured between November 2023 and late February 2025. While it might sound blasphemous for Tesla to use adhesive instead of fasteners, many automakers have made this standard practice, claiming considerable weight savings and improved structural integrity . The recall says the adhesive showed signs of “environmental embrittlement,” which causes causes materials to lose their ductility , making them prone to cracking and failure. As such a large body panel coming loose poses considerable risk to other motorists, Tesla voluntarily recalled the Cybertruck on March 11, 2025. The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) warning light may not remain illuminated between drive cycles, failing to warn the driver of low tire pressure. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 138, "Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems." The rearview camera image may be delayed after shifting into reverse. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111, "Rear Visibility." The trunk bed trim sail applique could have been improperly adhered and can loosen." Excessive electrical current can cause the front windshield wiper motor controller to fail." As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 105, "Hydraulic and Electric Brake Systems" and 135, "Light Vehicle Brake Systems." In an ironic twist of fate, this latest recall gives us great insight into just how many Cybertrucks Tesla has sold to customers. Following initial claims of a million reservations and the manufacturing muscle to build 500,000 Cybertrucks a year, Tesla has achieved less than 10 percent of their production target. However, with so few Cybertrucks on the road, this could actually prove to be a fairly straightforward and rapid fix for Tesla to rectify. If we look at some of the issues and numbers other automakers are dealing with, it’s clear things could be a lot worse. For context, Ford had to fix dodgy fuel pumps on 295,000 of its Super Duty trucks . As of March 14, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says Tesla has identified 151 Cybertruck warranty claims that could be related to the recall.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In the interest of expanding our long-term experience with plug-in hybrids, a segment that keeps growing in popularity as it splits the difference between EVs and hybrids, we welcome a 2024 Kia Niro PHEV to our fleet for 40,000 miles. The Kia Niro PHEV pairs a 1.6-liter four-cylinder gas engine with an 83-hp electric motor sandwiched between the engine and automatic transmission. While the gas engine itself only produces 104 horsepower and 106 pound-feet of torque, net output for the combined powertrain is a solid 180 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. SX Touring models get larger wheels, a power sunroof, a power liftgate, an upgraded audio system, and front seats with both heating and ventilation. We tossed in some $175 carpeted floor mats and a $95 cargo mat, bringing our grand total to $41,785. The Niro's interior is pretty straightforward, offering a mix of touchscreen and physical controls. The seats aren't too bad either! The Niro arrived with its break-in completed, so we were able to test it right away. The Niro PHEV made it to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds and finished the quarter mile in 15.8 seconds at 89 mph. Keep going to check out even more pictures of our long-term 2024 Kia Niro PHEV.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/2024-kia-niro-phev-sx-153000594.html'>Our Long-Term 2024 Kia Niro PHEV Doesn't Play to Definitions</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 17:24:00 <p>
On Saturday Night Live's "Coffee Talk" sketch, Mike Myers's Linda Richman character once reminded us that Rhode Island is neither a road nor an island. Just like that confusingly named state, our long-term Kia Niro plug-in hybrid exists between definitions that don't necessarily suit it based on our experiences. Is our 2024 Kia Niro PHEV working more like a standard hybrid or an electric vehicle? If you really want to get the most out of your plug-in hybrid, you'll have to charge it, and we do—for the most part. Senior editor Greg Fink was the sole staffer who raised his hand and said he regularly charged the Niro on a 120-volt plug, which he did at an Airbnb rental. There are a few reasons why this might be the case. Level 2 infrastructure in our neck of the woods isn't ubiquitous, so we often find ourselves in locations that simply lack the framework. There's also the matter of time: It takes around three hours to charge the 8.9-kWh lithium-ion battery, and someone may only be running a 10-minute errand, which doesn't leave much time to fill up. The gas engine's existence is another factor; with that fallback option, there isn't a true need to expend the effort to find a plug and charge up. Managing reviews editor Andrew Krok and testing director Dave VanderWerp live close to the office, so they can commute on electricity alone, which means that most of the time the Niro is running like a hybrid for most of our staff. One of the logbook's most oft-voiced complaints concerns that electric motor. VanderWerp's main annoyance with electric operation comes from how Kia arranged the powertrain: "The electric motor shifts up through the gears even when running as an EV, which makes it not nearly as seamless as most actual EVs." Head honcho Tony Quiroga added that the lack of power is his only complaint. Since our last update, we took the Niro PHEV in for service at around 16,000 miles. Not too long after that, we took the Niro back in for some recall work; our model was recalled because the manual seat adjustment may contact and damage some airbag and seatbelt wiring. What makes plug-in hybrids interesting, though, is that they can be used in a variety of ways. But that isn't a possible use case for us; with our daily driver swaps, frequent road trips, and lack of consistent home charging, the Niro PHEV ends up living as a hybrid far more often than it does as an EV. Oh, the places you'll go in a 2024 Kia Niro PHEV! We may have taken some time to start racking up the miles on our plug-in-hybrid Niro, but once it hit the road in earnest, it's been a road-trip warrior since. Overall, the car had more than enough space and storage for her and her husband, but they did have some gripes: There was no place for her purse, it could use a couple more cupholders, and relying on a single swappable interface for both infotainment and climate controls was frustrating. Many a staffer has been keen to assess how PHEVs fit into day-to-day life. Deputy video editor Carlos Lago's logbook entry cast the PHEV "ownership" experience in a positive light: "It's nice running errands within the EV-range window while still seeing 400-plus miles of overall range." What hasn't been sufficient for Lago, however, is the operation of the driver's-side sun visor—and don't even start when his garage door opener is also attached to it. Senior editor Greg Fink wrote that the gas-electric setup is very dependent on battery level. Or at least that's what Fink assumes, because at no point did he feel like those downshifts were necessary due to a lack of power. Many of our Niro's first 10,000 miles have come from road trips, which isn't optimal as far as battery use is concerned, yet our average fuel economy has bumped from 40 MPGe up to 42 MPGe. But with winter coming, those long road trips may be few and far between, giving us more time to enjoy the PHEV's electric operation, which will certainly be trying its hardest in the forthcoming colder weather. Our long-term garage has been thick with just about every kind of propulsion except for PHEVs, so when Kia decided to add a more powerful electric motor to its 2024 Niro PHEV, we thought it would be a good opportunity to get better acquainted with this middle-ground approach that continues to grow in popularity. Now, we're back in the office, with new EV chargers about to be installed, so we'll have plenty of chances to see how much we can squeeze from the Niro, which is rated at 33 miles of EV-only operation. When it came time to choose how we wanted to spec our Niro PHEV, we opted for the SX Touring trim, which starts at $41,515 and comes with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder gas engine paired with an 83-hp electric motor sandwiched between the engine and transmission, as well as an estimated 8.9-kWh lithium-ion battery located under the rear seat. Total output is rated at 180 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. The Niro PHEV arrived with its break-in miles completed, so we were able to jump right into testing. Almost immediately, we took a trip to Kansas City that had the Kia returning an average of 38 mpg over the course of 1591 miles. They only have the SAE J1772 plug without DC fast-charging capability, so you aren't able to plug it into, say, your local high-speed Electrify America stall. However, if you're able to charge overnight and you keep the trips short, those 33 miles of estimated EV range should make for minimal gas-engine usage in daily driving. In addition to treating the Niro PHEV as we would any other long-term vehicle, we are excited to dive into plug-in-specific questions during our time with it. How much range can you really get from the battery? How many of our 40,000 miles will we be able to cover on electricity alone?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/wait-why-cybertruck-held-together-171820856.html'>Wait, Why Is the Cybertruck Held Together With Glue?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 17:18:20 <p>
On Thursday, it issued a recall for nearly every single Cybertruck it's manufactured to date because their stainless steel body panels could fly off while driving, providing other motorists on the road a sharp-edged Mario Kart obstacle to dodge during their morning commute. The Elon Musk owned automaker definitely has a few screws loose, but that's not why these panels are detaching. Roll that back — did they say these things are held together by glue? Although the use of glue isn't uncommon in the world of automotive construction, you can leave it to Tesla — which is facing its eighth recall for the Cybertruck, a vehicle that's only been on the road for little over a year and was hyped as the culmination of Elon's engineering genius — to find some way to mess up sticking two things together. "Glues are used a lot more than people think in car body construction these days," Dale Harrow, chair and director of the Intelligent Mobility Design Center at the Royal College of Art London, told Wired. Jaguar, Lexus, Audi, they'll use glues at some point." I've not heard [of problems] anywhere else." One reason that you don't hear about other automakers having glue problems is probably that they're wise enough not to use the same metal used in kitchen utensils for the exterior of their vehicles. And that could be due to the stainless steel having a different density from standard steel." "It's not a small company, and it's not doing things on the cheap," Harrow added. "So I'll be very surprised if there wasn't the knowledge within the company to fix this." But the Cybertruck has been plagued with so many issues — from bricking in car washes to bricking while driving, to its big dumb accelerator pedals getting stuck in the down position — that you really shouldn't be surprised at this point.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

As of this writing, MARA and BTDR are both down about 1.5%, while CLSK has fallen by 4.5%. None of them showed a significant bounce after the Commission’s guidance circulated on Thursday afternoon, and they're currently underperforming relative to leading indices like the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, are down 0.03% and 0.4% respectively Friday as of this writing. Other major publicly traded crypto firms are also down on the day, with leading American crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) dipping 1.4% and top Bitcoin treasury reserve firm Strategy (MSTR) down 1% so far Friday. Consensus mechanisms like proof-of-stake (PoS) or proof-of-work (PoW)—the ways in which many major blockchains secure their networks and verify transactions—have drawn the ire of the SEC in the past. For example, in 2022, former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler indicated that proof-of-stake assets like Ethereum or Solana could be considered securities. Thursday’s guidance, which makes specific mention of the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, didn’t do much for the price of the top mined assets like Bitcoin or Dogecoin either.

In brief Privacy advocates call coin mixers a necessary tool for protecting anonymity. Government officials call coin mixers tools for money laundering. In 2021, the founder of coin mixer Bitcoin Fog was arrested on charges including money laundering and operating a money transmission business without a license. A year later, the U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions against Tornado Cash, an Ethereum coin mixing service, effectively banning Americans from using it. In a landmark ruling in November 2024, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the Treasury had overstepped by sanctioning Tornado Cash's smart contracts, although its broader designation remained intact. There are many legitimate uses for this kind of service. But as the adoption of crypto and blockchain tools grows, real-world identities are becoming increasingly linked to blockchain addresses—with every purchase, transfer, or interaction associated with those addresses laid bare on a public, transparent, distributed ledger. However, this ability to mask the identity of wallets and obfuscate transactions makes coin mixers an attractive tool for cybercriminals, and thus a target for law enforcement. While politicians and law enforcement have railed against the use of cryptocurrency in criminal enterprises, coin mixers occupy a gray area between facilitating money laundering and preserving the right to privacy. Because of blockchain's permissionless and transparent nature, some crypto users rely on the added privacy that coin mixers provide. Privacy advocates argue that coin mixers are especially useful, even necessary, in cases where a person's activities—like journalism, civil disobedience, and protest—can put that person at risk. Because of this, they require greater privacy in their crypto transactions. Completely legal (until today) reasons to use tornado cash - you get paid in crypto and don’t want your employer knowing all ur financial details - you pay for a service in eth and don’t want them to be able to see everything you’ve ever done onchain — reza.eth (@rezajafery) August 8, 2022 On the other hand, law enforcement and government agencies see coin mixers as a way for criminals to launder money using cryptocurrency, and services like Tornado Cash as a means of obscuring where the funds originated. In its announcement of the sanctions against Tornado Cash, the Treasury Department said that criminals had used Tornado Cash to launder money, saying the service processed more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019. Among those illicit funds, the Treasury said, were a combined $103.8 million stolen from crypto bridging services by Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored North Korean cybercriminal group. A November 2024 ruling by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court found that the Treasury had overstepped its authority, and that Tornado Cash's immutable smart contracts "are not property because they are not capable of being owned." The decision reversed a lower court ruling, noting that protocols built on smart contracts cannot be classified as services because they operate without "human intervention." In March 2025, the Treasury reversed course, removing Tornado Cash from its list of sanctioned entities. "Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury," the Treasury said in a statement. Tornado Cash exclusively services the Ethereum Network and is non-custodial.

Bitcoin Fog: Founded in 2011 by Roman Sterlingov, Bitcoin Fog was a custodial mixer, and held user funds in the process of mixing them. Before Tornado Cash was taken down, it used smart contracts to accept token deposits from one address and enable their withdrawal from a different address. Other coin mixers operate in a similar way, with smart contracts that work as a pool where all the deposited tokens get mixed together. Because these services use no intermediary, they are reliably neutral—but that also means they can be a tempting tool for cybercriminals looking to launder stolen crypto, as in the case of Lazarus Group.

Let’s say there’s a business owner and crypto enthusiast named Robert who wants to send Ethereum to a hacktivist group operating out of Ukraine. If this hypothetical scenario sounds familiar, it's based on a tweet from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, posted after the Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash. The November 2024 ruling that immutable smart contracts cannot be classified as "property" was hailed by crypto and privacy advocates as a landmark moment, meaning that self-executing code that operates without any administrative control cannot be subject to sanctions. More recent projects like Railgun aim to give users on-chain privacy, but also ensure that they remain compliant in the eyes of the law. Railgun is not a traditional mixer; it doesn’t mix coins from multiple sources together, and its founders believe it avoids the pitfalls that ultimately led to mixers getting sanctioned or sued. It also utilizes “Private Proof of Innocence” to ensure bad actors cannot use the platform for illicit purposes. As Lia Holland, Campaigns & Communications Director at Fight for the Future, wrote in 2022: “Let us be clear, hackers and cybercriminals, as well as those that support them, are deplorable and should be stopped—but not in a way that compromises human rights and the first amendment.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Department of Treasury has lifted Sanctions on Tornado Cash, the Ethereum based smart contract mixer, following a series of legal defeats and administrative challenges. “Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury,” the Treasury Department stated. Tornado Cash was launched in 2019 as a decentralized protocol to enhance transaction privacy on Ethereum. U.S. law enforcement alleged that Tornado Cash facilitated over $7 billion in money laundering, including funds linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. This led to a ban on U.S. persons using the service and legal action against its co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, who were indicted in 2023 for money laundering tied to over $1 billion in transactions. A Texas federal court ruled in January 2025 that the smart contracts couldn’t be sanctioned, a decision upheld by the Fifth Circuit in November 2024. The Treasury nevertheless reinforced its intent to enforce sanctions against Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), an ongoing source of geopolitical tension given the recent $1 billion+ hack from Bybit argued to have been executed by Lazarous, a hacking group with DRKP ties. “Treasury will continue to monitor closely any transactions that may benefit malicious cyber actors or the DPRK, and U.S. persons should exercise caution before engaging in transactions that present such risks.” Although the lifted sanction appears to be good news for financial privacy software developers, it is too early to tell what this means for the Bitcoin and crypto industry in general, or whether it will have an effect on upcoming court cases like those against the Samurai Wallet developers. “Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The United States Treasury announced Friday that it has delisted Ethereum coin mixing service Tornado Cash from its list of parties sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, reversing course after first blacklisting the service in 2022. "Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury," the Treasury said Friday. But the Treasury Department is actually tardy in its sanctions reversal. In November, a fifth circuit judge ruled that the Treasury Dept. had overstepped its authority by targeting Tornado Cash’s smart contracts. That’s even though the Fifth Circuit has clearly held that OFAC did not have the power to impose these sanctions.… https://t.co/TkUizyVRJH — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 10, 2025 There’s also a pending money laundering trial against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, who was arrested in 2023. In November, after the ruling that the Tornado Cash sanctions were an overreach, a U.S. district court judge struck down Storm’s motion to have his case dismissed. In Friday’s statement, the Treasury said that it continues to be concerned about money laundering, particularly from North Korea—whose malicious hacking groups have stolen billions from various crypto protocols and companies. “Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, in a statement. In fact, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin very publicly declared that he had used it to privately make donations to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/311089/strategy-strife-offering-723-million-buy-bitcoin'>Strategy Ups ‘Strife’ Offering to $723 Million to Buy More Bitcoin</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 14:25:06 <p>
Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, upsized its recently announced Strife perpetual stock offering to $723 million, after having initially priced it at $500 million when it was announced on Tuesday. The total offering translates to 8.5 million shares of Strategy’s so-called “preferred strife perpetual stock.” The company expects its sale of preferred stock to settle on March 25. Of course, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm said it plans to use $711 million in proceeds to purchase more Bitcoin—padding its stash of 499,226 BTC currently valued at around $41.4 billion. Instead of being able to convert Strife into common shares, as several of the company's past offerings allow, the product is set to receive quarterly dividends solely in cash. However, based on Strife’s terms, the company is also able to delay dividend payments. If that happens, those dividends can be compounded per quarter missed by up to 18%, Strategy said. Analysts say that as Bitcoin’s price has fallen, it has become notably more difficult for the company to raise capital as cheaply to buy the asset. Strategy’s stock price dropped on Friday, showing a 2.5% decline to $295 not long after the opening bell, according to Nasdaq. The company’s stock price has fallen around 2% over the past month, but is still changing hands for 84% more than it did a year ago.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This integration not only enhances transaction efficiency but also opens doors for a myriad of applications that traditional cryptocurrencies fail to offer. In this article, we will explore why NexChain deserves your attention and investment as it embarks on its ambitious journey toward reshaping the crypto landscape.

This proactive approach to security is vital in an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, AI also enables NexChain to facilitate smart contracts that are self-executing based on real-time data. The initial token offering provides an enticing opportunity for those interested in early-stage crypto investment. Incentives for Holding Tokens: NexChain offers staking rewards for those who choose to hold their tokens, creating a community of vested stakeholders who are keen on the platform’s success. This democratized approach aligns incentives across the community and encourages sustained investment. Tokens within the NexChain ecosystem will serve multiple functions, from transaction fees to unlocking premium AI features. This intrinsic utility will help to create consistent demand, making it more than just a speculative investment; it’s a potential cornerstone in the future of smart transactions. Polkadot: While Polkadot’s primary focus is interoperability between different blockchains, it lacks the depth of AI integration and automated smart contracts that NexChain offers, which can limit its utility in fast-paced business environments. Ultimately, NexChain is positioned to capitalize on the strengths of existing platforms while mitigating their weaknesses. This will not only attract users but also create new use cases previously deemed impractical in traditional blockchain systems. Collaborations with established companies can help facilitate product updates, ensuring the platform remains competitive. Community Support: The growing community around NexChain, fueled by its transparent communication and strong governance model, indicates strong grassroots support that’s essential for long-term success. As you look to diversify your investment portfolio, keep a close eye on NexChain; it just might be the ticket to your next significant investment success. NexChain enables content creators to sell their AI-generated works directly on its platform, utilizing blockchain for secure and transparent transactions. Smart contracts automate royalty payments, ensuring that creators are fairly compensated. NexChain integrates regulatory compliance measures into its platform, such as data encryption, secure access controls, and auditing features, to help organizations meet industry standards and regulations like HIPAA for healthcare data.

Ethereum real-world asset platform Zoth has suffered an attack that resulted in the loss of $8.85 million. On Friday morning, a Zoth proxy contract was upgraded by what security firm Cyvers called a "suspicious address.” Soon thereafter, $8.85 million worth of stablecoin USD0++ was transferred out of the proxy contract into the attackers wallet before all funds were swapped into DAI and moved to another address. “We want to assure you that we are taking every necessary measure to mitigate the impact and resolve the issue.” A proxy contract is a smart contract that, among other things, forwards calls and funds to other contracts called implementation contracts to facilitate the smooth operation of business—this is very common in the world of DeFi. “This type of attack typically occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to the private keys controlling a wallet or smart contract, allowing them to transfer funds out of the system,” a spokesperson for PeckShield told Decrypt. “The attacker gained admin access, likely through a leaked key or exploit,” according to Hakan Unal, Senior Blockchain Scientist at Cyvers. He added that it is likely that Zoth has multiple proxy contracts, such as this contract holding $12.28 million USYC—meaning more funds could also be at risk if they share the same admin access. Cyvers suggested that setting up real-time monitoring that alerted the company when admin roles or contract upgrades were made could have helped prevent this attack. This came about as a result of an exploit in a liquidity pool that allowed the attacker to mint ZeUSD without depositing sufficient collateral, according to smart contract auditing firm Solidity Scan.

A former sound engineer for Grammy Award-winning rapper Marshall Mathers—popularly known as Eminem—has been charged with selling the musician’s unreleased songs for $50,000 in Bitcoin. Joseph Strange, 46, of Holly, Michigan, is accused of selling at least 25 tracks that Eminem recorded between 1999 and 2018, which were still in development and never meant for public release, as per a statement released by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern Office of Michigan. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s probe was triggered by tips from Eminem's studio employees, who saw the stolen music posted online on platforms including Reddit and YouTube, as per an affidavit filed by the agency on Wednesday. On January 28, in a search of Strange’s home in Holly, FBI agents found hard drives containing copies of the stolen music, as well as handwritten lyric sheets by Eminem and a VHS tape containing an unreleased Eminem music video. If convicted, Strange faces up to 10 years in prison for interstate transportation of stolen goods and up to five years for criminal copyright infringement. He could also face a fine of up to $250,000. Notably, one of the other individuals with access was Mike Strange, Joseph's uncle, who continues to work at Eminem's studio as an engineer. The Canadian man also revealed that Strange claimed to possess more than 300 unreleased tracks and handwritten lyric sheets created by Eminem. "The significant damage caused by a trusted employee to Eminem's artistic legacy and creative integrity cannot be overstated, let alone the enormous financial losses incurred by the many creators and collaborators that deserve protection for their decades of work," Eminem's representative said in a statement to The Detroit Free Press. Eminem’s music has been leaked without his permission a number of times in the past, with unauthorized tracks appearing online in the early 2000s and 2010s.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pump.fun stated that its original goal was to build “the most frictionless environment for trading coins.” With PumpSwap, the team expects to solve the “major point of friction” that slows “a coin’s momentum.” Pump.fun stated that it operates similarly to popular platforms Raydium V4 and Uniswap V2, using an automated market maker (AMM) with a constant product formula. Coins completing their bonding curve, which is a mechanism to manage token pricing and liquidity on Pump.fun, will automatically migrate to PumpSwap, removing the previous delays and the 6 SOL migration fee. This feature is expected to boost trading momentum and user satisfaction. Each trade on PumpSwap carries a 0.25% fee, which will be split between liquidity providers (0.20%) and the protocol (0.05%), Pump.fun stated. “If it succeeds, millions of dollars will go towards aligning creators with their communities and incentivizing higher quality launches,” Pump.fun noted. The launch of PumpSwap comes after Raydium introduced LaunchLab, its own meme coin launchpad that adopts a similar bonding curve to Pump.fun. Raydium’s platform will allow third-party interfaces to set fees, support multiple quote tokens, and integrate with Raydium’s liquidity provider locker to ensure fee security. The separate developments of Pump.fun and Raydium raise questions about their relationship as it appears to have weakened since Pump.fun was rumored to start testing its own AMM earlier this year. Before Raydium’s LaunchLab, a number of memecoin launchpads had been launched to compete with Pump.fun. Some successes were achieved, such as Moonshot, which gained popularity after Trump launched his official meme token. Nevertheless, these platforms lose traction as the memecoin market dries up. Dune Analytics data shows that Pump.fun’s graduation rate, which measures the number of tokens that successfully move from the incubation phase to full transactability, has been below 1% for over a month.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/the-fair-act-would-protect-bitcoin-holders'>The FAIR Act Would Protect Bitcoin Holders</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 11:09:45 <p>
With the US Government stating that civil asset forfeiture will form a key pillar in building its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act of 2023, also known as the FAIR Act, is arguably the most important Bill introduced in Congress today to protect Bitcoin holders from extensive Government overreach. Without it, many may see their bitcoin seized and forfeited on behalf of the Reserve with little to no recourse. Civil asset forfeiture has long been argued to be in need of drastic reform. From police seizing a Vietnam veteran’s van for serving as a “container” for marijuana, or attempting to appropriate a man’s life savings over a seat belt violation, civil asset forfeiture is “one of the gravest abuses of power in the country today,” according to the Institute for Justice. Especially in light of bitcoin’s scarcity and its consequent value appreciation over time, this financial incentive is only exacerbated when civil asset forfeiture is applied to build the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. To protect citizens from civil asset forfeiture abuse, the FAIR Act of 2023, which was reintroduced in 2024 co-sponsored by Sen. Lummis, among others, aims to revise the federal laws that govern the process to ensure that civil asset forfeiture proceedings follow due process as governed by the Fifth Amendment. First, it does so by raising the evidentiary standard from “preponderance” of evidence – meaning that a party’s claim is rather true than not – to clear and convincing evidence, increasing the burden of proof the Government has to provide to enforce a forfeiture. “Civil asset forfeiture allows federal law enforcement to seize the property of Americans who haven’t even been charged with or convicted of a crime,” said Sen. Booker, who introduced the Bill together with Sen. Rand Paul. “Under this system, police can keep cash, cars, and even homes based on mere suspicion of a crime. These losses often become law enforcement’s profit because the burden is on the property owner to prove they should get their property back.” Yet, under current civil asset forfeiture laws, Americans are being stripped of their property without ever being charged or convicted of a crime.

The SEC has declared that proof-of-work crypto mining does not violate U.S. securities law This ruling specifically benefits Bitcoin and Dogecoin, two major cryptocurrencies that use proof-of-work The SEC stated mining operations do not need to register as securities because rewards aren’t derived from third-party managerial efforts This marks a shift from the previous administration’s approach, which had targeted proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum This decision brings clarity to miners of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies who now know their operations don’t require securities registration. This ruling marks a key distinction in how different consensus mechanisms are treated by regulators. This test determines if an asset qualifies as a security based on investment of money with profit expectations from others’ efforts. Large facilities with specialized equipment now dominate the mining landscape, though some still attempt to mine independently. Since President Donald Trump took office, the SEC has established a crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce. Peirce, often called “Crypto Mom” for her supportive stance on digital assets, has been critical of the previous administration’s approach. The SEC under Trump has moved away from what some called “regulation by enforcement.” The regulator has dropped several lawsuits and investigations against crypto companies that had been initiated under former Chair Gary Gensler. This regulatory clarity comes as Bitcoin trades near $84,000, having recently broken a four-month downtrend.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ethereum software firm Consensys has pushed back against a proposed rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that could drastically change how unhosted blockchain wallets such as MetaMask are regulated. Introduced in January, the proposed interpretive rule sought to regulate unhosted wallets under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA), holding developers accountable for fraudulent or unauthorized transactions and enforcing traditional financial institution regulations on decentralized wallets. In a short comment sent to Scott Bessent, Acting Director of the CFPB, Consensys called the rule a “radical departure from current law” and that the regulatory regime would be detrimental to both “blockchain developers and users.” “It is our view that this proposal is clearly improper as a matter of substantive law, public policy, and administrative procedure,” the letter said about the rule, which was proposed just before Joe Biden’s departure from office. Describing the proposed rule as “industry-redefining,” Bill Hughes, Senior Counsel & Director of Global Regulatory Matters at Consensys, warned that its implementation would cause “unparalleled damage” to U.S.-based blockchain developers. Today, @Consensys submitted a short comment in response to the CFPB's proposed interpretive rule that unhosted wallets like @MetaMask are actually regulated under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) and CFPB's Regulation E.

He also criticized the rule for bypassing proper legislative procedures, saying how implementing such changes through an interpretive rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act—a move Hughes claimed courts would likely oppose. Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly showcased his commitment to crypto with key moves, from unveiling plans for a Bitcoin reserve to creating a crypto task force with pro-crypto leaders. The CFPB, an agency proposed in 2007 by crypto-skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren while she was a Harvard law school professor, has been closely associated with stricter consumer protections.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The digital euro is seen as essential for Europe’s monetary and financial autonomy amid increasing geopolitical fragmentation According to ECB data, US firms process 65% of euro area card payments, creating vulnerability in Europe’s financial infrastructure This is the third time in 2025 that ECB officials have urged adoption of a digital euro European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Economist Philip Lane has once again called for the creation of a digital euro. He stressed its importance in reducing Europe’s reliance on US payment firms and limiting the influence of dollar-based stablecoins. According to ECB data, these US firms process 65% of all euro area card payments. Some EU countries have even completely replaced their national payment systems with these international alternatives. Lane argued that Europe “effectively outsources its payment infrastructure” by relying on international cards, apps, and stablecoins. This makes the region vulnerable to policy changes and regulatory actions from outside jurisdictions. A digital euro could help address the fragmentation in Europe’s retail payments. It could serve as a unifying force for collaboration among banks and payment service providers across the region. He sees it as a way to strengthen Europe’s position in the global financial landscape. China has been developing its digital yuan, while BRICS nations are pursuing their own CBDC initiatives. On March 17, ECB Governing Council member François Villeroy de Galhau expressed concerns about President Donald Trump’s push for crypto adoption. In January, ECB board member Piero Cipollone called for an accelerated digital euro launch. Lane warned that delays in launching a CBDC could leave Europe exposed to risks. This is particularly concerning as foreign stablecoins and non-European payment firms continue to expand their influence in the region. This would reduce the region’s dependence on foreign payment providers and strengthen its financial sovereignty.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Authorities from the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office searched Bithumb’s offices in Yeoksam-dong. They are looking into claims that the exchange provided a 3 billion won ($2.3 million) lease deposit to its former CEO, Kim Dae-sik. Investigators suspect Kim used these funds to buy a personal apartment in Seoul’s Seongsu-dong district. They are reviewing whether the original transaction broke financial regulations or corporate governance rules. This case has intensified scrutiny over Bithumb’s internal financial management practices. The exchange has been working toward a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO). The former board of directors chairman, Lee Jeong-hoon, was indicted on alleged fraud charges. This acquittal has allowed the exchange to move forward with its IPO plans. Bithumb’s IPO plans date back to 2020 when local media first reported on them. There are separate claims that both Bithumb and rival exchange Upbit facilitated token listings through intermediaries. The report suggests certain intermediaries had connections to Upbit shareholders and market makers. Upbit has denied these claims and demanded that Wu Blockchain provide evidence. The current investigation has raised concerns about broader governance issues within Bithumb. The exchange has faced repeated legal and regulatory scrutiny in recent years.

Trump administration plans to restructure USAID into US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) under State Department control Thousands of USAID employees have been placed on administrative leave and many foreign aid contracts terminated The plan aims to focus aid on global health, food security, disaster response, and countering China The Trump administration has revealed plans for a major restructuring of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), including renaming it, placing it under direct State Department control, and implementing blockchain technology to track aid distribution. According to an internal State Department memo reviewed by WIRED, USAID will be renamed as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA). It would also allow for more flexible programming focused on measurable impact rather than simply completing activities, according to the memo. It remains unclear whether the plan involves cryptocurrency transactions, stablecoins, or simply using blockchain as a ledger to track aid disbursement. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, the State Department placed all agency staff on administrative leave and halted payments to numerous partner organizations worldwide. This initiative is effectively headed by Elon Musk, who has been exploring blockchain technology to enhance various US governmental processes. This included organizations providing what some described as lifesaving work in various regions around the world. The plans for incorporating blockchain technology have caught many staffers off guard. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, questioned the need for blockchain. Raftree added that she has never found an instance where blockchain offered advantages over existing tools. Giulio Coppi, a senior humanitarian officer at Access Now, shared similar concerns. Despite these criticisms, there have been some examples of blockchain use in humanitarian work. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ran a small pilot providing cash assistance to displaced Ukrainians using stablecoins. The restructuring proposal suggests funding should be contingent on outcomes rather than inputs. “Tying payment to outcomes and results rather than inputs would ensure taxpayer dollars deliver maximum impact,” the memo states. Some USAID employees point out that many contracts already function this way. Organizations are often paid after completing their work rather than receiving funding upfront. However, a USAID employee who requested anonymity noted that such arrangements aren’t always practical. These include global health, food security, disaster response, and countering China’s influence. According to Bloomberg, Musk is exploring blockchain technology for several government applications. These include improving tracking of federal expenditures, securing data, streamlining payments, and managing government properties.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin has pulled back from $87,500 to below $85,000, dropping around 2% in 24 hours Market manipulation by whales is suspected, with “spoofing” tactics creating artificial resistance Despite volatility, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their fifth consecutive day of inflows totaling $165.75 million Technical indicators suggest possible further decline to $80,000 support level Technical analysis shows Bitcoin is testing a long-standing resistance trendline. This signals an extended pullback might be in progress. It has reached a low of $52.81 billion in the futures market. The long-to-short ratio shows a subtle rise in bearish positions, now at 0.9861. This reflects ongoing bullish sentiment toward long positions despite traders paying extra premium. Large blocks of sell orders have appeared on exchange order books. This tactic is known as “spoofing.” It involves placing large orders with no intention of fulfilling them. The practice creates artificial resistance levels and prevents upward momentum. Higher leverage could trigger a new wave of volatility and potential mass liquidations. On the institutional front, support for Bitcoin appears to be strengthening. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $165.75 million in net inflows on March 20. VanEck, Fidelity, and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust also recorded positive inflows. However, some ETFs like Bitwise, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Franklin Templeton saw outflows. A breakdown below this level could push Bitcoin toward $78,350. Conversely, a bullish rebound could challenge the resistance trendline again. Based on Fibonacci analysis, a successful breakout could extend to the 61.80% level around $95,350. The European trading session has shown a lack of momentum. This reinforces the theory that price suppression is influencing market activity. Traders are watching whether it can overcome the apparent resistance at $87,500. The alternative is a deeper correction toward $80,000 where previous buying interest emerged.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

SUI has experienced a significant correction of over 32% in the past four weeks. This decline coincided with broader market reactions following U.S. President Donald Trump’s second inauguration in January. Despite these headwinds, SUI has shown resilience by rebounding 5% over the past week. Following this peak, the price entered an ABCDE correction within a descending wedge pattern. This technical indicator suggests that selling pressure may be waning, creating conditions for a possible upward move. SUI has been retesting a major resistance point from April 2024 over the past two weeks. An ascending triangle pattern has formed on the 1-hour chart according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. If SUI successfully breaks above $2.4, a rally toward the next key resistance at $2.89 could follow. However, caution is warranted as a drop below $2.2 would invalidate the bullish setup.

Increased social engagement and accumulation by traders suggest growing investor confidence in DOGE Two respected crypto analysts have identified promising patterns in DOGE’s price charts. Ali Martinez highlighted a symmetrical triangle formation on the one-hour chart. This move would release buying pressure that has been building over the past ten days. Now it's time to move towards the Fibonacci retracement level of 1.618. CW noted that Dogecoin recently crossed above the wedge’s downward-sloping resistance line. This event is widely considered a bullish reversal signal once confirmed by subsequent price action holding above that line. Failure to maintain this level could send DOGE lower toward $0.1660 or the $0.1600 ascending support line. If this occurs, traders might see a period of consolidation between $0.143 and $0.176 in the coming days or weeks. Over the past week, it experienced only a slight 2.64% dip, holding relatively steady amid market fluctuations. This places it just behind Cardano (ADA), which has a market cap of $26.17 billion. Smart DEX traders appear to view the current price range as a potential value zone. These investors have formed an accumulation base at key price support levels, which could be a sign of potential price appreciation in the near future. The combination of smart buyers’ purchases and strong social sentiment provides support for DOGE’s price. This creates favorable conditions for further market growth as investor confidence continues to build. The broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin’s steady uptrend, is showing signs of strength. Historically, DOGE has responded positively to Bitcoin’s upward movements, which could set the stage for a breakout if bullish conditions persist. A decisive move beyond either of these levels could determine Dogecoin’s next major price action in the coming days.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ethereum’s supply on exchanges has fallen to the lowest level since November 2015 (8.97 million ETH) Ethereum faces challenges including decreased mainnet activity, lower fee revenue, and competition from Layer-2 networks The sharp decline suggests ETH holders are moving their assets into cold storage wallets for long-term holding. Many crypto analysts view this as a bullish signal of growing conviction in Ethereum’s future price appreciation. They noted that ETH has been rapidly leaving exchanges since the end of January. This pattern often precedes what traders call a “supply shock.” When fewer tokens are available for immediate trading on exchanges, even modest increases in demand can drive prices higher. In January, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves hit a seven-year low just before BTC surged to new all-time highs. Despite these positive supply dynamics, Ethereum’s price performance has been weak. ETH reached around $4,000 on multiple occasions during the late 2024 and early 2025 bull run. Unlike Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum failed to set a new all-time high above its previous record of $4,878 from November 2021. Trader Crypto General told his 230,800 X followers that it’s “just a question of time before the big supply shock.” Another commentator named Ted suggested that with ETH supply on exchanges decreasing daily, “buyers will soon compete, leading to bidding wars.” Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin has been at its lowest point in five years, according to trader Daan Crypto Trades. Layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Base are gaining traction due to their lower fees. The recent Dencun upgrade reduced gas fees by 95%, making transactions less costly but further impacting revenue. If ETH breaks above this level, the next targets would be $2,163 and $2,370. On the downside, a failure to hold $1,986 could see ETH decline toward $1,714, where previous buying interest emerged. The RSI indicator at 41.22 shows ETH recovering from oversold conditions but lacking strong momentum. Standard Chartered analysts recently lowered their year-end ETH price target from $10,000 to $4,000. They cited increased competition from other networks, especially Ethereum layer-2s, as a main factor for this revision.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Australia plans to integrate digital assets into its economy with a new regulatory framework The government will address de-banking concerns and work with major banks Draft legislation is expected in 2025, ahead of a closely contested federal election Australia’s Treasury Department released a white paper on March 21 outlining the new framework. Under the new rules, crypto exchanges will be known as Digital Asset Platforms (DAPs) in Australia. This means exchanges must hold enough funds to cover potential losses. This separation aims to keep user funds safe if an exchange faces financial troubles. The government plans to exempt small-scale platforms and startups from some requirements. This exception will help new businesses enter the market without facing heavy regulatory burdens. De-banking has been a major concern for crypto businesses in Australia. The government promises to address this issue through its new licensing regime. Treasury officials will work with Australia’s four largest banks to better understand de-banking. The vote is scheduled to be held by May 17, with current polls showing a tight race between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s Labor Party and the opposition Coalition. The Coalition has also promised to prioritize crypto regulation if elected. The government expects to release draft legislation for public consultation later in 2025.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://blockonomi.com/south-korea-takes-action-against-unregistered-crypto-exchanges/'>South Korea Takes Action Against Unregistered Crypto Exchanges</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 09:14:55 <p>
South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is targeting several foreign crypto exchanges including BitMEX and KuCoin for operating without proper registration The crackdown affects BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX, which face potential criminal penalties This follows previous regulatory actions in 2022 when South Korea blocked 16 unregistered exchanges South Korean financial authorities have launched a crackdown on multiple foreign cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country without proper registration. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has identified several platforms, including BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX, for allegedly offering services to Korean users illegally. However, they have failed to register as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under the country’s Specific Financial Information Act. They are consulting with the Korea Communications Standards Commission on how to implement these restrictions effectively. The regulator is gathering data on damage cases to strengthen communication between authorities. This crackdown is part of South Korea’s broader efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency market. Several platforms like GDAC, ProBit, Huobi Korea, and Bitrade failed to renew their registrations. This led to their removal from the nation’s registry of approved crypto businesses. The targeted exchanges have allegedly continued to serve Korean customers despite not meeting regulatory requirements. They have maintained Korean-language services and marketing campaigns aimed at local users. These changes are part of a potential regulatory revamp focused on preventing financial crimes. They cited concerns about Bitcoin’s volatile nature and inherent risks as reasons for this decision. On March 20, prosecutors raided Bithumb following suspicions that its former CEO, Kim Dae-sik, embezzled company funds to purchase an apartment. Rumors have also emerged about intermediaries allegedly receiving payments to list projects on major Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Upbit. As South Korea continues to develop its crypto regulatory framework, these actions against unregistered exchanges represent an important step in the government’s efforts to bring the industry under proper oversight.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Large XRP holders (whales) have added 2.82 billion coins (6.5% increase) to their holdings in recent months Network activity increased dramatically in March, with active addresses six times higher than January-February levels Technical analysis suggests a potential 75% rally to around $4.35 if the symmetrical triangle pattern plays out Despite the legal victory, Ripple still faces an injunction limiting XRP sales to institutional investors These large holders, often called “whales,” have added 2.82 billion XRP to their wallets during this period. They now collectively own more than 46.4 billion XRP tokens, showing continued confidence despite previous market downturns. Wallets with at least 1M $XRP now hold 46.4B coins, as they have accumulated 6.5% more in just the past 2 months alone. An injunction issued by Judge Analisa Torres restricts the company from selling XRP directly to institutional investors like banks and financial institutions. This limitation could affect Ripple’s business model, which has focused on promoting XRP adoption among financial institutions for cross-border payments. In a positive development for US traders, crypto exchange Bitnomial has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the SEC. Futures contracts will allow traders to speculate on XRP’s price without directly holding the asset. The current rally comes months after XRP experienced a major price surge following Donald Trump’s election victory. That increase was driven by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the US. While XRP is up over the past week, it has yet to recapture its all-time high price. Some analysts wonder if the current situation could lead to a “sell-the-news” scenario, where prices drop after positive events are fully priced in. For now, active addresses remain high and whale accumulation continues, suggesting that market participants maintain a positive outlook on XRP’s future prospects.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Metaplanet, Japan’s largest corporate bitcoin holder, has appointed Eric Trump to its newly formed strategic board of advisers. JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet appoints Eric Trump as a strategic advisor to help drive Bitcoin adoption. The focus will be bringing together leaders in business, politics and technology to further bitcoin’s acceptance globally. Metaplanet Representative Director Simon Gerovich welcomed Trump’s appointment, emphasizing his business acumen and enthusiasm for the bitcoin community. Gerovich said, “His business expertise and passion for BTC will help drive our mission forward as we continue building one of the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Companies.” The Tokyo-based company has aggressively accumulated bitcoin reserves, now holding over 3,200 BTC worth approximately $267 million. Earlier in March, Metaplanet purchased 150 additional bitcoins at a value of $12.5 million. He is involved with World Liberty Financial, a Trump family’s crypto venture. His father, Donald Trump, recently signed an executive order to launch a strategic bitcoin reserve. With bitcoin going mainstream, Metaplanet is betting on crypto-friendly advisers like Trump to drive institutional adoption.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

I’ve spoken with a number of politicians in the past few weeks. They all see bitcoin as a store of value and believe that U.S. citizens have the right to hold their private keys. I can’t say that it doesn’t feel good to hear U.S. elected officials express these views and even propose bills that would codify pro-bitcoin legislation into law. And one of the most well-known mixers was Samourai Wallet, which enabled users to mix their bitcoin in a noncustodial fashion. This software was shut down early last year, though, when the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) pressed charges against the Samourai developers including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering charges. (The developers of Tornado Cash, open-source mixing software deployed on Ethereum, are also facing similar charges.) (With that said, Senator Lummis has also coauthored a bill in which she calls for the U.S. Treasury to “conduct a study on combatting anonymous crypto asset transactions like asset mixers,” but I digress.) Mixers are incredibly important for human rights activists who need to maintain their anonymity when sending and receiving funds as well as to everyday people who value transactional privacy. For this reason, I’m asking you to use the letter template published by my colleague Shinobi at the end of this piece to write your representatives. So, please heed this call to action and inform your representatives about this matter so that by the time I have a conversation with them about it, they have some understanding of the issue.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After reaching an all-time high above $100,000, the Bitcoin price has entered a multi-week downtrend. This correction has naturally raised questions about whether Bitcoin is still aligned with the 2017 bull cycle. Here we’ll analyze the data to assess how closely Bitcoin’s current price action correlates with previous bull markets, and what we can expect next for BTC. Figure 1: The current cycle trajectory has recently diverged from historical patterns. The MVRV Ratio is a key indicator of investor behavior. When the MVRV ratio rises sharply, it indicates that investors are sitting on significant unrealized profits, a condition that often precedes market tops. For example, Bitcoin’s price action has shown a strong correlation with Global Liquidity, the total supply of money in major economies; however, historical analysis shows that changes in liquidity often take around 2 months to reflect in Bitcoin’s price action. Figure 3: Global M2 has a delayed impact on BTC price action. Figure 4: Price is still very closely following the 2017 data when delayed by 30 days. What 2017 Bull Cycle Signals Mean for Bitcoin Price Today History may not repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Bitcoin’s current cycle may not deliver 2017-style exponential gains, but the underlying market psychology remains strikingly similar.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/311043/trump-aides-reform-usaid-blockchain-transparency'>Trump Aides Look To Reform USAID With Blockchain For 'Transparency': Report</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 05:43:08 <p>
Trump administration officials have crafted a proposal to overhaul U.S. foreign aid programs, with a section exploring how it could make use of blockchain technology to track aid distributions and increase accountability. Under a section for "modernized, performance-based procurement," the document references an initiative to secure and trace distributions "via blockchain technology" to "radically increase security, transparency, and traceability." The proposal comes as USAID faces an uncertain future. In January, the State Department placed the agency's staff on administrative leave and halted payments to partner organizations, prompting legal challenges. A federal judge has since issued a preliminary injunction against dismantling the agency, following efforts by D.O.G.E., the Department of Government Efficiency, established by Elon Musk that sought to do so. The blockchain implementation appears to be part of broader reforms intended to impose stricter controls on aid distribution, requiring measurable outcomes through "third-party metrics, not self-reporting." Congressional authorization would likely be required for major structural changes, though the document indicates some reforms could be implemented through executive action. More broadly, the proposed overhaul limits USAID's focus on global health, food security, and disaster response, making U.S. foreign aid initiatives leaner in terms of scope. The document also outlines a restructured framework based on three organizational pillars—"Safer, More Prosperous, and Stronger"—led by three agencies under the Secretary of State's direction. The ideas resonate with existing literature on how blockchain technology could be used for public good.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

To help keep your streak trundling along, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Friday's puzzle (#1,371). Wordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. Wordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. You'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once. How to play Wordle more than once a day If you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games. In addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. Before today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed: Every day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle. This should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly.

In a report released Thursday, CryptoQuant revealed its Bull Score Index has fallen to 20 — showing only two out of ten key metrics in bullish territory. The analytic firm's Bull Score Index combines ten distinct metrics measuring network activity, investor behavior, Bitcoin demand, and market liquidity to gauge overall market health. Historically, Bitcoin has required scores above 60 to maintain significant price rallies, while extended periods below 40 have consistently aligned with bear markets, CryptoQuant explained. CryptoQuant's dashboard for the model shows a significant deterioration in on-chain fundamentals since mid-February 2025, with eight metrics now flashing warning signals. The Network Activity Index, a key component tracking on-chain usage, has remained bearish since December 2024. If the score "remains below 40 for an extended period," this could signal that "bearish market conditions" could continue, challenging the notion that Bitcoin's recent drawdown by up to 23% of its recent peak of $109,000 in January represents a "temporary correction," analysts noted in the report. Bitcoin volatility has jumped to a six-month high, even while some observers project new all-time highs by mid-year, driven by easing global liquidity conditions. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said it would hold interest rates steady. Major crypto markets, from Bitcoin to Ethereum and Solan, saw immediate, modest gains on the news. Over on MYRIAD, an on-chain prediction market launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, 68% think that Bitcoin will stay above $83,000 before next week.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Short-term price dips are par for the course in bitcoin’s (BTC) bull markets, but one indicator suggests the current decline from recent highs may reflect a deeper structural shift in market dynamics. Bitcoin was trading around $84,000 as European morning hours on Friday, a 23% drop from its January peak of $109,000. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Such pullbacks are not uncommon — BTC has weathered similar declines in past bull cycles, often rebounding to new heights. The index evaluates ten critical indicators—spanning network activity (like transaction volume), investor profitability, market liquidity, among other factors, assigning a score from 0 to 100. Higher scores denote a robust, bullish environment, while lower readings flag bearish conditions. “Historically, bitcoin has only sustained major price rallies when the Bull Score is above 60, while prolonged readings below 40 have aligned with bear markets,” CryptoQuant analysts said in the Thursday report. Investor profitability has waned as short-term holders face unrealized losses, while demand softens — U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, once aggressive buyers, have registered a net $180 million outflows in the past 30 days, or among the highest rates of withdrawals since they started trading at the beginning of 2024. In previous cycles, readings below 40 for weeks or months have preceded extended bear phases, like the 2022 slump that saw bitcoin shed over 60% of its value from peak. Either the index rebounds, signaling renewed strength, or it entrenches below 40, cementing a bearish shift that could test bitcoin’s $80,000 support zone — one flagged by analysts as a critical level to watch for.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://coindesk.com/opinion/2025/03/21/now-is-the-time-to-rally-to-web3-gaming'>Now Is the Time to Rally to Web3 Gaming</a></h2><b>Source:</b> coindesk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 00:00:00 <p>
Right now, my X feed is full of people who are giving up on Web3 gaming. Over $12 billion of venture capital funding has gone into it since 2020 and they haven’t seen the sort of breakout success that many expected. Even the best games haven’t reached anything close to mainstream scale. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . At its core, Web3 gaming is about giving players real ownership — not just of the in-game items that they buy and earn, but also their identities and achievements. In traditional games, players invest time, effort and money into digital assets that ultimately belong to the publisher. Players have wanted more control over their in-game assets for years. Look at the massive markets for CS:GO skins or World of Warcraft gold. But until now, those economies have been fragmented, restricted, or at risk of being shut down if a centralized publisher decides to shut it down or change the rules. Ownership has always been the foundation of Web3 gaming, and play-to-earn was an experimental model that showed the potential for open and permissionless virtual economies on blockchain. Traditional gaming has had decades to fine-tune game design, build massive player bases, and develop business models that work, while Web3 gaming is still in its experimental phase. Sure, billions of dollars of investment can speed things up, but throwing money at a brand new category doesn’t magically buy it a track record or instantly create new games that people love. I’ve been making games for over 20 years and I have seen every major shift get dismissed before it took over. Nobody believed mobile gaming could compete with PCs or consoles until it became bigger than both. Esports was a joke until stadiums sold out and prize pools hit millions. Digital skins were “worthless” before they became a multi-billion dollar market. And now, Web3 gaming is at that same inflection point. CryptoKitties were digital things that no one could take away from you. As someone who’s spent their life grinding in games, and their career convincing others to grind the same — without really getting anything for it — that idea of digital ownership gave me a whole new way to think. The market was in a deep bear cycle, and many teams either gave up or ran out of money before they could launch. We stayed lean, experimented, and learned everything the hard way. Looking back, I’m so glad we didn’t pack it in when success was just around the corner. Investors who ignored our emails were asking how much they could put in. My email inbox filled up with fundraising decks pitching the next YGG. Then in 2022, the market crashed, and just as quickly, we went back to being crazy. But that never really bothered me because crazy people are the ones who make big things happen. Now, everyone’s asking: When is the next big Web3 game? And if you look past the red candles to take notice of what exists already today, you’ll see we how much progress we’ve made since our industry was seeded in 2018: Today, Ronin — the blockchain it built — has millions of active users, with 17 new games launched, and 134% growth in NFT trading volume in 2024 compared to 2023. It’s also gone permissionless, which means there will be more games, faster development, stronger network effects, and unpredictably big breakthroughs. Some of the biggest innovations in gaming like modding, free-to-play and esports came from unexpected places. Pixels, a farming game on Ronin, hit a peak of 1.3 million daily active users (DAUs) and is holding strong now with around 250,000 DAUs even with its token down 96%. Players are spending more than they cash out, buying land, upgrading assets, and actually putting money back into the game, fueling the economy instead of extracting from it. This is how virtual economies should work, with real demand and strong retention. Most importantly, it is an indication that the play-to-earn model can work if done right. Parallel, a trading card game (TCG) on Ethereum, just hosted a world championship in Las Vegas at the HyperX Arena — a venue that has hosted some of the biggest esports competitions from “League of Legends All-Stars” to “Street Fighter V’s Capcom Cup.” This was a prestigious event that saw some of the world’s best TCG players crossover from traditional titles like Hearthstone to become some of the first Web3 esports legends. These are just a few examples, but they show the kind of traction we’re seeing: better infrastructure, growing communities, more sustainable virtual economies, digital ownership. Those who FUD Web3 gaming today don’t understand it. Web3 is growing and innovating faster than any other sector in gaming. Let them call us whatever they want: crazy, delusional.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Crypto prices suffered from being increasingly correlated with the wider financial markets, which are down on tariff worries and decreased corporate earnings. Some even said the bitcoin bull market was over. On the regulatory front, Washington agencies are gearing up for an historic “market structure” bill in Congress, Jesse Hamilton reported. Our reporters did some great deep-dives on protocol projects. Oliver Knight lifted the lid on Cardano’s price surge following ADA’s (sort of) inclusion in a putative national crypto reserve. Interestingly, that project doesn’t measure success in total value locked (TVL), an otherwise universal metric, preferring real-world use cases. Danny Nelson looked at Pump.fun’s aspirations to dominate DeFi trading on Solana DeFi (following its domination of Solana’s memecoin issuance).

The Trump administration is preparing to restructure the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and integrate blockchain technology into its procurement system, Wired reported, citing a memo circulating among State Department staff. The plan proposes rebranding the agency as U.S. International Humanitarian Assistance and moving it directly under the authority of the Secretary of State, Wired said. It would leverage a blockchain to trace aid distributions and enforce payment models based on outcomes rather than inputs. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today .

It’s unclear whether the blockchain would involve cryptocurrency or stablecoin usage, or simply act as a digital ledger. USAID has been under scrutiny from the Trump administration since the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. DOGE has in the past proposed the use of blockchain technology to boost efficiency. The president froze USAID payments in a Jan. 20 executive order.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions watchdog removed Tornado Cash from its global blacklist Friday. The crypto mixing tool has been accused of helping North Korea's Lazarus Group launder stolen funds from its various hacks and thefts, and the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control sanctioned it — meaning no U.S. person or anyone doing business with the U.S. could engage with it financially — multiple times. However, a federal appeals court ruled last November that OFAC couldn't sanction Tornado Cash's smart contracts because they weren't the "property" of any foreign national.

Another developer was charged but has not yet been arrested. That motion was smacked down in February, with Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) arguing that, whether or not Tornado Cash itself was subject to sanctions "does not affect the sanctions Defendant allegedly conspired to violate (those on the Lazarus Group)." Storm's lawyer, Brian Klein of Waymaker LLP, told CoinDesk that he was "very pleased" to see the sanctions against Tornado Cash removed.

WASHINGTON, DC-The US Securities Commission team has finally embraced the opportunity to work with the crypto industry to define a digital asset transaction supervision policy, Hester Peirce, chief of the agency's crypto task force, said. See All Newsletters Sign Me Up By Senting Up, You Will Receive Emails About Coindesk Products and You Agree to Our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Mark Uyeda, interim president of the agency, told reporters that despite the recent SEC policy statements that certain areas of the crypture sector are subject to securities laws - meme and mining currencies, so far - is a "definitive possibility" that others are defined as titles. "We are advancing on several trails here," he said in response to a question from Coindesk. Each statement issued so far "is ultimately a team statement" that T has legal backing, but he said the round table represents the entire commission - currently three members - analyzing how a "potential interpretation of the commission may seem." In his opening speech at the event, Uyeda, who was appointed by President Donald Trump as SEC awaits Paul Atkins's confirmation by the Senate, argued that the agency should have been more willing in recent years to make such public interpretations. The discussion panel was attended by a dozen securities lawyers in the crypto industry that evaluated specific issues that observed when advising companies. "What is the biggest question you face when trying to deal with this issue?" Asked moderator Troy Paredes, a former SEC councilor who now runs the consulting firm Strategies, Sarah Brennan, a legal consultant at Delphi Ventures and one of the 11 panelists. Panelists speak at the first round table of SEC crypto Task Force (Nikhilesh de/ Coindesk) "These assets in the traditional model are designed to have a wide and wide distribution, and most of the market is protecting this based on the application of securities laws, so it looks a lot like traditional markets, where people will organize to a bag listing without this wide dissemination or price support or really launch technology." "It doesn't matter if you're talking about performance farms, ostriches or orange orchards, the purpose of securities regulation was to involve all this in a very large, wide and principle-based regulation," said Sec John Reed Stark. Before the round table, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep Jake Achincloss, both Massachusetts Democrats, wrote an open letter to Uyeda asking about the team's secdeclaration about Memecoinse as developed. Warren and Achinclloss also asked SEC to explain how she would specifically define memecoins as distinct from "general cryptocurrency", how she would distinguish between real memecoins and memecoins that attend the team's statement and which memecoins to analyze when writing her team statement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"We're moving on multiple tracks here," he said in answer to a question from CoinDesk. Each statement issued so far "ultimately is a staff statement" that doesn't have legal backing, but he said the roundtable represents the entire commission — currently three members — looking at what a "potential commission interpretation might look like." In his opening remarks at the event, Uyeda, who was appointed by President Donald Trump as the SEC awaits a Senate confirmation of Paul Atkins, argued that the agency should have been more willing in recent years to make such interpretations public. "When judicial opinions have created uncertainty from our participants in the past, the commission and its staff have stepped in to provide guidance," Uyeda said. "This approach of using common rulemaking for explaining the commission's process or releases rather than enforcement actions, should have been considered for classifying crypto assets under the federal security laws." "What's the biggest question that you face in trying to wrestle with this question?," moderator Troy Paredes, a former SEC commissioner who now runs consulting firm Paredes Strategies, asked Sarah Brennan, the general counsel at Delphi Ventures and one of the 11 panelists. Panelists speak at the SEC Crypto Task Force's first roundtable discussion (Nikhilesh De/CoinDesk) "These assets in the traditional model are designed to have wide, broad early distribution and most of the market is hedging that on the application of securities laws, so it ends up looking a lot like your traditional markets where people will marshal their way to an exchange listing without that broad dissemination or price support or actually fully launching the technology." "Whether you're talking yield farms or ostrich farms or orange groves, the whole point of securities regulation was to wrap that all up into a very big, broad, principles-based regulation," former SEC attorney John Reed Stark said. His concern is that, even in 2025, much of the market lacks utility. Ahead of the roundtable, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Jake Auchincloss, both Massachusetts Democrats, wrote an open letter to Uyeda asking about the SEC's staff statement on memecoins and how it was developed. Peirce told reporters on the event's sidelines that a next possibility for another agency crypto policy statement (following recent statements for memecoins and mining) could be non-fungible tokens. She said NFTs could probably benefit from clarity on the agency's thinking. When asked by CoinDesk whether non-binding, unofficial staff statements are the way to approach policy signals from the agency, she said this is a response to recent years in which the agency was reticent to talk about any of it. but I think not when you're just saying, 'This is how we're looking at the law,'" she said. "It's always sad to me when you lose someone with a lot of experience, but people do come and go from the SEC," she said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
