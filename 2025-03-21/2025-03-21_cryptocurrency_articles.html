A meticulously crafted 2015 Camaro conversion replicates the look of a 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle, blending modern performance with vintage muscle aesthetics.

A stunning automotive transformation has turned a 2015 Chevrolet Camaro into a near-perfect replica of a 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle after 2,000 hours of meticulous craftsmanship. This unique build, set to cross the auction block, seamlessly merges classic muscle car styling with modern performance.

The project, showcased by Mecum Auctions, replaces the Camaro’s factory body with custom fiberglass molds reinforced with carbon fiber, sculpted to replicate the timeless look of a ’69 Chevelle. From the sculpted hood to the iconic Chevelle grille and centered emblem, the attention to detail makes this vehicle a convincing throwback to one of Chevrolet’s most beloved muscle cars.

Under the hood, the car retains its modern muscle roots with a 6.2-liter LS3 V8 engine, originally developed for the Corvette. While the exterior embraces 1960s nostalgia, the drivetrain ensures that performance remains firmly in the present, delivering impressive horsepower and reliability.

Despite its exterior transformation, the car’s interior remains largely stock to the original 2015 Camaro, aside from a set of redesigned headrests. While some purists may have preferred a full retro-inspired cabin makeover, the original modern amenities provide a functional and comfortable driving experience.

The vehicle, which has already logged 40,000 miles, is scheduled for auction later this month, offering collectors and enthusiasts the chance to own a one-of-a-kind blend of past and present.

In a world where classic restorations and modern restomods often require trade-offs, this Camaro-based Chevelle homage proves that bridging the gap between two automotive eras is possible—if you’re willing to invest the time.

                <p>Key takeaways

Certified pre-owned vehicles come with the added assurance of a trusted history, at a cost slightly higher than a basic used option.

Having a vehicle inspected by a mechanic before purchase is one of the best ways to ensure you get a quality vehicle, even if it’s CPO.

Finding perfect financing for your CPO requires the same care you would take when buying a new or used option.

Certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles have to meet additional standards from manufacturers or dealers. Buying a certified pre-owned car offers several benefits as well, including extended warranties and lower overall costs.

If you’re in the market for a used car but hoping to find one that may be a better deal in the long run, considering CPOs makes a lot of sense. Before you begin your search, however, you should learn what certified pre-owned vehicles actually are, the benefits they come with and steps you can take to lock in the best price.

What are certified pre-owned cars?

Certified pre-owned vehicles are returned leased vehicles or newer trade-ins that go through additional inspections by factory-trained mechanics before they’re put up for sale. They are typically sold at less of a markup than new vehicles, though they tend to cost more than the average used option. Despite the markup, these cars come with factory-backed warranties and the peace of mind that a reputable dealership provides.

According to recent data from Consumer Reports, CPO vehicles have consistently fewer mechanical issues than other used options — so the higher price tends to pay off in the long run.

Are certified pre-owned cars worth it?

A certified pre-owned car can also give you more peace of mind if you are wary of buying a used car. The warranty offered by manufacturers, among other benefits, make a CPO car more expensive — but may bring much-needed peace of mind when you’re shopping.

Extended warranty

A certified pre-owned vehicle may come with an extended warranty. The warranty may include a limited powertrain warranty covering the engine, transmission and drivetrain components and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty covering components of the body and interior.

Check to see how long the vehicle warranty lasts and ask about any warranty exclusions. Look for a list of components that aren’t covered — like tires — under the CPO warranty. If the vehicle has electrical components that require a lot of maintenance, like brake and tire wear sensors, ask the dealer if the warranty will cover replacements.

Better value

Another benefit of buying certified pre-owned is that it generally lowers the vehicle’s overall cost over time. This is because the dealership has checked the vehicle, and it comes with a warranty. Both of these can lead to a lower total cost of ownership.

You won’t have to worry about future mechanical issues or repair costs as much as you would with a used car that isn’t certified. This will allow you to focus more on the vehicle and less on potential hidden problems.

Exchange programs

Depending on the manufacturer and dealer, you may be able to return the car within a certain amount of time if it doesn’t meet your expectations. This isn’t available for all CPO vehicles, though, so check with the dealer before signing on if you want this feature.

How buying a certified pre-owned car works

To find a certified pre-owned car, you’ll want to follow similar steps as buying any used car. Before you start shopping, prepare to take out an auto loan by completing some basic research, shopping around for a great deal and pouring over the car’s details and inspection report to ensure you’re buying the best possible auto for your needs.

1. Do your research

Start by considering what you truly need in a car: competitive gas mileage, lots of space or just something simple to get from point A to point B. Once you know your needs, start looking for models that both meet those needs and fit your budget.

Advertisement Advertisement

Research prices for different vehicle options and check sites like Kelley Blue Book (KBB) and Edmunds to see current prices. Pay close attention to any features you value, like backup cameras, seat temperature controls or towing ability.

Once you know what vehicle you might want, check out the CPO programs offered by the manufacturer or dealership of your choice. Consider the following factors.

Vehicle age and mileage: Programs set a maximum age and mileage for vehicles they’re willing to certify.

Vehicle warranty: Do vehicles in the CPO program come with a free factory-backed extended warranty?

Inspection process: What does the CPO inspection include?

Vehicle history: Is it made available to potential buyers?

Available discounts: Does the manufacturer offer special incentives, like 0 percent APR?

2. Shop for it

There are many places to find certified pre-owned cars, such as franchise dealerships, rental companies, online dealers or CPO-specific dealerships. After you narrow down your choices, it is time to shop. If you have a solid idea of the type of vehicle you want, heading directly to the franchised dealerships is your best bet. Otherwise, shopping online allows you time to compare options with tools offered by Edmunds and KBB.

3. Check the inspection report

One of the main perks of buying a CPO car is knowing they’ve been thoroughly inspected. Requesting and reading the inspection report before purchase can give you extra confidence. The report should detail any previous accidents, damage or mechanical problems. Trusted dealers perform inspections that should cover the following:

Advertisement Advertisement

Road testing.

Interior/exterior damage and overall wear and tear.

Vehicle tires, rims and wheels.

Under-the-hood components.

Brake fluid and coolant.

Bankrate tip

While an outside inspection by a third-party mechanic isn’t strictly necessary, it’s still smart to have an unbiased professional inspect any used vehicle. If the seller pushes back at this request, consider shopping elsewhere.

4. Complete your purchase

Once you find a vehicle you feel comfortable with that also meets your needs, you’re ready to begin the price negotiation process . While the introduction of “buy online” auto sales has meant many cars are sold off the lot for a set price without any wiggle room, it never hurts to ask if you can pay less than what they’re asking. This is true whether you’re buying from a dealer or a private party .

Once an agreement has been reached in terms of the purchase price, it’s time to sign the paperwork and make the vehicle yours. Come equipped with any information you learned from the inspection and use it as leverage to get the best deal on your used car. And look out for dealer options the seller might try to add on that aren’t always worth it.

Bottom line

Purchasing a certified pre-owned car involves research and planning, but with some patience, you can get a solid car at a great price. Once you find the right fit, qualify for financing before you sit down to finalize the purchase. Coming in with an auto loan lined up will give you even more room to negotiate a deal you’ll be proud of.</p></b>

                <p>Waymo isn’t immune to the everyday traffic ticket

Waymo, the US’ leading self-driving taxi company that’s backed by Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc, collected almost 600 parking tickets last year in San Francisco, the city where the rideshare service began testing in 2021. Tickets for Waymo’s fleet, which is comprised of 300 vehicles, equated to $65,065. Comparatively, Los Angeles tagged Waymo with 75 tickets last year, where the company has 100 deployed vehicles, but its service was launched in November of 2024. Waymo’s fleet is fully electric and primarily uses Jaguar’s I-PACE SUV. The autonomous rideshare company has attributed its San Francisco tickets to vehicles dropping off passengers in commercial loading zones when alternative drop-off areas were congested main roads or a spot too far from the rider’s destination, along with brief parking between trips when cars were too far from Waymo’s facility.

Waymo SUVs have also been cited for blocking traffic and ignoring street cleaning schedules. Waymo spokesman Ethan Teicher told The Washington Post that safety is the rideshare company’s highest priority “both for people who choose to ride with us and with whom we share the streets.” Teicher added that Waymo cars are designed “to take the safest action available during the few minutes we are picking up or dropping off riders, which is when many of these parking citations occurred.”

Sterling Haywood, who has been a San Francisco parking control officer for 17 years, told The Washington Post: “I gave it [Waymo vehicle] the same courtesy I would give if there was somebody in the car.” Haywood described this courtesy as honking twice to warn the Waymo taxi that it was parked in a street cleaning zone during enforcement hours in San Francisco’s Mission District. After the Waymo vehicle didn’t move, he placed a $96 dollar ticket on its window. Waymo has received the most tickets for street cleaning violations at 138 citations, however, it’s important to note that Waymo’s 589 tickets last year in San Francisco represent less than 1% of the city’s 1.2 million issued tickets during 2024. In addition to Los Angeles, Waymo operates in Phoenix, Arizona, and Austin, Texas.

Waymo

Final Thoughts

Waymo operates 24/7 across San Francisco, so accounting for less than 1% of the city’s tickets during 2024 can be viewed as quite impressive. The organization’s autonomous technology is also relatively early in its development, launching in San Francisco in 2021. Unlike General Motors-backed Cruise’s self-driving vehicles, which hit San Francisco streets in 2022, Waymo is still operating its fleet and growing.

Cruise suspended its operations in October 2023 after a series of incidents, including dragging a pedestrian, which occurred during the same month. General Motors had invested $10 billion into Cruise by the time the company shut down. While it would be ideal for Waymo SUVs to avoid tickets altogether during instances like parking in street cleaning zones during enforcement hours, the rideshare service would likely receive more criticism if its fleet dropped off pedestrians in dangerous areas to avoid citations.</p></b>

Stablecoin giant Tether has said that it is in talks with a Big Four accounting firm to get independently audited, according to a report on Friday by Reuters.

The company—which is now based in El Salvador—has struggled to get a top accounting firm to independently audit what backs its stablecoin.

The company is "engaging" with one of the top firms, the firm's CEO Paolo Ardoino said, according to Reuters. The Big Four accounting firms are PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG.

Tether did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

Tether mints stablecoins—digital tokens backed by assets such as gold and dollars. Tether’s main product, USDT, is the most-traded cryptocurrency in the industry and the third biggest virtual token in market capitalization, according to data provider CoinGecko.

USDT, which Tether says is backed by U.S. treasuries and other assets, runs on a number of blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. It will also soon be available on Bitcoin’s network.

Traders use USDT—and other stablecoins—to quickly enter and exit crypto transactions without having to access traditional financial rails, a reason for their popularity.

But regulators have in the past criticized Tether for not being transparent enough about what backs its token in reserves. Tether has said it is keen to work with a Big Four firm for an audit.

Tether in 2021 agreed to no longer do business in New York after a two-year state attorney general investigation found that the firm had "made false statements about the backing" of its token.

New Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, currently custodies billions of dollars in assets that back Tether.

Public Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies. This week: After predicting it wouldn’t survive this long, Bakkt Holdings has undergone another transformation; the largest securities clearinghouse in the world doubles down on Ethereum; and Robinhood launches a prediction market for your March Madness bracket.

Setbacks for Bakkt Holdings

There’s new business afoot for crypto trading and payment solutions company Bakkt, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the BKKT symbol. But there’s also a bit of blood in the water.

The company just hired a new co-CEO: Akshay Naheta, who oversaw SoftBank’s investments in chip manufacturer ARM and GPU giant Nvidia. Bakkt also inked a deal with Distributed Technologies Research, which Naheta founded, to integrate its stablecoin-based payments tech into its crypto trading platform.

It’s unclear which other companies were already using DRT’s stablecoin payments tech.

“Once this partnership takes effect, Bakkt believes it will be positioned to unlock new revenue streams in crypto trading and stablecoin payments, while adding efficiency to the vast and rapidly growing cross-border payments market,” the company said in its press release.

But the company began the week in the uncomfortable position of having to announce that two of its largest clients—Bank of America and Webull—are not renewing their commercial agreements. The most damning line in the company’s SEC filing: Webull represented 74% of its crypto services revenue.

This isn’t the first time things have looked bleak for Bakkt. Around this time last year, the company had just announced a big international expansion. Then, weeks later, told the SEC it wasn’t sure it would survive another 12 months.

If it seems like Bakkt is pivoting at a dizzying rate, remember that it has strong ties to Wall Street and has been given a lot of space to figure out what kind of company it wants to be.

Case in point: Bakkt was launched in 2018 by Intercontinental Exchange, which also goes by ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. The initial vision was for Bakkt to act as a regulated Bitcoin futures and custody platform.

But just this week, the company revealed in its delayed earnings report that it sold its custody division for $1.5 million to none other than its parent company, Intercontinental Exchange.

“The divestiture is expected to streamline operations by reducing operating expenses by $3.8 million annually and freeing up approximately $3.0 million of capital held for regulatory reserves,” the company wrote in its earnings report.

Must be ICE having such a supportive parent company.

Tokenization Tea Leaves

Tokenization and RWA nerds: Take heed. Just as the RWA, or real-world assets segment, surpasses $19 billion, the market infrastructure companies are picking favorites.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, has joined the ERC3643 Association, the company said on Thursday.

For those not already in the know: DTCC is the world’s largest central securities depository. It handles the bulk of clearing, settlement, and trade reporting for U.S. markets. The company, which is owned by its bank and institution customers, processed securities transactions valued at $3 quadrillion in 2023.

In conjunction with its announcement, DTCC has added support for ERC-3643 tokens to its tokenized securities platform, ComposerX.

What this boils down to is the biggest securities settlement corporation in the world doubling down on Ethereum. And where it goes, others will follow. The Japan Securities Clearing Corporation has been collaborating with DTCC to test out settlements on Ethereum since last year.

But that doesn’t mean the securities clearinghouses of the world have reached consensus.

As Ledger Insights explains, Euroclear has built its tokenization platform on the Corda blockchain—although it’s not exclusively tied to it. And Hong Kong’s central securities depository has been partial to the Canton Network.

Robinhood Sets Sites on Prediction Markets

Popular trading app Robinhood has made a big push into prediction markets with a new feature that lets users gamble—er, speculate—on sports.

After making its big announcement with March Madness markets, the company added a new one that invites users to wager on whether Fed fund rates will be above 4% or 4.25% after the next Federal Open Markets Committee meeting.

The company tried out its first prediction market in October last year with a U.S. presidential election prediction market. It was open only to American users. At the time, that seemed like a shot across the bow of would-be competitor Polymarket, which has never been open to U.S. bettors and had to assure regulators that it was making an effort to stop would-be rule breakers using VPNs to use the platform.

But now, Robinhood has partnered with Kalshi. In October, Kalshi won its yearslong legal battle against the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Analysts have estimated that Robinhood’s foray into prediction markets could create a $260 million stream for the company, which trades on the Nasdaq under the HOOD ticker.

Earlier this week, Robinhood got a “Buy” rating from research firm Compass Point as it initiated coverage of the company.

Happy Fri-M&A

Coinbase is in advanced talks to buy crypto derivatives exchange Derebit, unnamed sources told Bloomberg. The news broke late enough that it almost didn’t make it into this edition of Public Keys.

Derebit, founded in 2016, is the world’s largest platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum options. As of this writing, it has seen $3 billion worth of volume in the past day and boasts that it has 85% of the BTC and ETH derivatives market cornered.

Coinbase already offers derivatives trading, but not in the United Kingdom or Spain—two regions where Derebit is available. Conversely, Derebit is not available in the U.S., where Coinbase serves the bulk of its customers.

The anonymous sources told Bloomberg that the companies have already given regulators in Dubai a heads up about the impending deal, since Derebit has a license there that would be transferred to Coinbase if the deal goes through.

Earlier this year, the news outlet reported that Coinbase competitor Kraken was eyeing it for an acquisition. At the time, unnamed sources familiar with those talks estimated that the derivatives exchange was worth between $4-5 billion.

Coinbase, which trades on the Nasdaq under the COIN ticker, picked up a little upward momentum ahead of the closing bell. But at the time of writing, was changing hands for $188.69 and trailing its opening price by 0.85%.

Other Keys

Strategy started the week like a lamb and ended it by saying MOAR. The software company, which trades on Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, made its smallest Bitcoin buy yet by adding 130 Bitcoin valued at $10.7 million to its corporate reserve on Monday. The next day, it unveiled a $500 million offering of its Strife (STRF) perpetual preferred stock to fund more BTC acquisition. Then, by Friday, it had upsized that offering to $723 million.

Bitcoin mining stocks had another rough week, despite getting good news from none other than the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Yesterday, the securities regulator clarified that Bitcoin mining operations “do not involve the offer and sale of securities.” Phew, right? More like meh. Top publicly traded miners MARA, CleanSpark, and Bitdeer had all lost a few percentage points by Friday afternoon.

But it’s not all bad news for miners: Bitfarms completed its acquisition of Stronghold in a deal valued at $175 million.

Don’t feel too bad for Kraken missing out on a Derebit acquisition. On Thursday, the exchange announced that it has acquired futures broker NinjaTrader in a deal valued at $1.5 billion. The exchange confirmed to Decrypt earlier this month that it’s planning to go public, but declined to share a timeline.

And, finally, how’s Dubai sound for spring break? The Dubai Financial Services Authority put out the call for “expressions of interest” from companies wanting to experiment with “tokenization services” in its regulatory sandbox. But they need to move fast, the deadline is April 24, 2025.</p></b>

                <p>Undeterred by its plans to walk back the promise of an all-electric lineup by 2030, Cadillac will still end production of the gas-powered CT4 and CT5 sedans after this generation. Right now, it would seem that a few all-electric sedans are on the table, but when these cars go away, it will almost certainly be the end of internal combustion-powered sedans at Caddy.

There are apparently two electric sedans in the pipeline that are roughly the same size as the current CT5 and now-dead CT6, according to GM Authority, which first broke this story. Admittedly, these vehicles may not take the traditional three-box sedan form factor. Unnamed sources tell the outlet that they may have a sportback profile similar to the Escala concept or ultra-luxurious Celestiq.

The pair of EV sedans are expected to ride on GM's upcoming BEV Prime architecture, GM Authority reports. It's supposed to be a more upscale, premium version of General Motors' BEV3 platform, which underpins the Lyriq, Optiq, Vistiq, Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV.

Sedan Love Is Waning

Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing - Cadillac

From my experience of driving some of these cars, it already feels like a rather premium platform, so it'll be exciting to see what GM engineers can do with a bespoke luxury platform.

It'll certainly be interesting to see if Cadillac buyers actually want an electric sedan — or if they're going to want sedans at all. In 2024, Cadillac sold over 160,000 vehicles. Just a tick over 21,000 of those were sedans. Both the CT4 and CT5 were by far Cadillac's worst-selling models, with just 6,209 people buying a CT4 and 14,861 going for the larger CT5. It makes sense why Cadillac has so far put all of its EV eggs in the crossover basket (Celestiq notwithstanding). It's what the people want.

In a statement to Jalopnik, a Cadillac spokesperson said, "In the last 12 months, Cadillac has launched six new products which have been a mix of ICE and EVs. Cadillac will continue to evolve our portfolio and offer choice to our luxury customers. We have no additional product plans to announce at this time."

It’s an expensive find!

In a display of a location we likely have yet to see, this video shows us a world of classic and modern luxury cars thought to have been lost to time. At first you can see some vehicles that are a bit tricky in terms of identifying what they actually are. This was definitely the case for one vehicle that ports Gullwing doors and a unique front facia. Perhaps someone a little more knowledgeable would be able to point out the exact make, year, and model but the shots that we do get of this particular car are difficult to assess. Either way it's something of great significance if not simply because of its rarity then also for its part in the collection.

Looking around the area, it's clear that the collection was not only limited to vintage models, though the building appears to have been abandoned some time ago. Rather, a majority of these cars are from later years than you might expect, including one Bently which looks like it's from the early to mid 2000s. This raises a lot of questions as to when the collection was left there and why exactly such a massive gathering of cars was abandoned. Despite Europe, especially the UK, seeming to be a sort of hub for internet car finds, you'd be hard pressed to find anything like this on YouTube making it a truly special experience.

Across the small building, you can see many vintage models ranging from the earliest years of automotive production to the last few decades. One of the coolest cars in the entire piece has to be a Formula One car which has been stripped down a bit since its days where it may have once competed. Whether the car actually raced back in the day or not, it's still a ridiculously interesting piece of automotive history. The same could be said about the entire collection in fact as it features some of the world’s best automobiles likely valued in the millions of dollars range.

                <p>While vehicles have been trending upward in size for a while, there are a few reasons why compact cars and hatchbacks still have mass appeal. Cars in this segment offer impressive fuel economy, solid value for money, and often some driving verve. The Acura Integra, Honda Civic, and Mazda 3 are popular examples of compacts that deliver on all of those fronts. Here, we'll look at the specs for three of the most competitive entries in the compact segment and see how they stack up against one another.

Engine Options

The Acura Integra is offered solely with a 200-hp turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder and front-wheel drive. In base models, the engine is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), while the top-tier A-Spec Technology trim is available with a six-speed manual. While the Integra has the most potent base engine in this trio of compacts, those looking for even more punch should consider the racier Integra Type S, which features a 320-hp turbocharged inline-four and a standard six-speed manual.

Acura

The Honda Civic's standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder musters 150 horsepower and is only available with a CVT and front-wheel drive. The new-for-2025 Civic Hybrid is a peppier option, which pairs a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine with two electric motors for a total output of 200 horsepower. Making the same power without any electric motors, the Civic Si offers the 200-hp turbo four-cylinder with a six-speed manual, as found in the Integra. The front-wheel-chirping Civic Type R is the most powerful model in the Civic family tree, delivering 315 horsepower from a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder and six-speed manual transmission.

Marc Urbano - Car and Driver

The Mazda 3 offers two different engine options including a base 191-hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 250-hp turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The base engine is available with either front- or all-wheel drive, and a six-speed manual can be ordered on front-drive hatchback models. Turbo models that feature the more powerful engine come standard with all-wheel drive and an automatic transmission.

Fuel Economy

While lacking go-pedal gusto, the Honda Civic's standard engine is impressively efficient. The nonhybrid Civic sedan earns EPA fuel-economy ratings of 32 mpg city and 41 mpg highway. The zippier hybrid variant does even better, with ratings of 50 mpg city and 47 mpg highway.

The Integra offers impressive fuel economy, too. When fitted with the CVT, the Integra can deliver 30 mpg city and 37 mpg highway, per the EPA. Six-speed-equipped models perform notably worse in the city and marginally poorer on the highway, with ratings of 26 mpg and 36 mpg, respectively.

Outside of the manual Integra, the Mazda 3 is the least efficient of the bunch. The most economical sedan variant equipped with the base engine earns EPA ratings of 27 mpg city and 37 mpg highway. As a hatchback fitted with the turbocharged engine, the 3's fuel-economy figures fall substantially to 23 mpg city and 31 mpg highway.

Mazda

Interior and Cargo

While compact cars aren’t known for being particularly spacious, the Integra, Civic, and Mazda 3 offer seating for five and are available in hatchback variants that expand cargo capacity behind the rear seats. Front legroom is nearly identical in all three vehicles, but the Civic and Integra offer the most space for rear passengers with 37.4 inches of legroom compared to the 35.1 inches in the Mazda 3.

The Civic hatchback and Integra edge out the Mazda 3 when it comes to cargo capacity. With all seats in the upright position, the Civic and Integra offer 24.3 cubic feet of cargo space, while the Mazda 3 measures in at 20.1 cubic feet. In our testing, we were able to put six carry-on suitcases into the Civic hatchback and five into both the Integra and Mazda 3.

While the Integra comes exclusively as a hatchback, both the Civic and Mazda 3 are offered as sedans that provide less cargo room than their five-door-hatch counterparts. The four-door Civic offers 14.8 cubic feet of trunk space while the Mazda 3 has 13.2 cubic feet of space in the boot. The Mazda 3 hatchback offers more cargo capacity than the sedan on paper, but we managed to fit an additional carry-on into the sedan's trunk for a total of six.

Pricing and Trims

With a base price of $25,135, the Mazda 3 is the least expensive of these three compacts, but you'll have to fork over an additional $5460 if you want all-wheel drive. The Carbon Turbo trim, which couples all-wheel drive with the more powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged engine, costs even more at $33,285.

Honda

Without any options, an entry-level 2025 Civic LX sedan costs $25,245. The Sport trim, which adds equipment such as blind-spot monitoring, remote start, and 18-inch wheels, is priced at $27,345 in sedan form. The Sport hatchback, with a more capacious rear storage area, is $1200 more than the sedan. Pricing for hybrid variants of the Civic starts at $29,845 for the Sport Hybrid sedan and goes as high as $34,045 for the top-spec Sport Touring Hybrid hatchback.

Michael Simari - Car and Driver

The Integra is the priciest of the three by a significant margin, starting at $33,595. Upgrading to the A-Spec trim for an additional $2600 adds sportier exterior styling, special interior trim, and LED fog lights. The highest-tier A-Spec Technology trim costs $39,195 and serves as a lower-cost alternative to the high-performance Integra Type S. While it has significantly less horsepower, the A-Spec Technology looks the part and can be optioned with a six-speed manual transmission.

San Francisco-based AI developer Perplexity AI was again making the case for taking over TikTok's embattled social media platform amid reports that it had started talks to raise money at a potential $18 billion valuation.

In a blog post published on Friday, Perplexity claimed it is the best choice for an American company to take over TikTok before a U.S. presidential order banning the Chinese company is expected to take effect on April 5.

“Perplexity is singularly positioned to rebuild the TikTok algorithm without creating a monopoly, combining world-class technical capabilities with Little Tech independence,” Perplexity AI wrote.

Perplexity AI, launched in 2022, is an AI-powered search engine that delivers real-time, cited answers through a conversational interface. It combines large language models with live web data for accuracy and transparency.

“We want to communicate clearly to the end user that we're not here to sell you another chatbot and alternative to ChatGPT,” Perplexity co-founder and CEO Aravind Srinivas previously told Decrypt. “We're here to help find answers to any question, and that's why we call [Perplexity] an answer engine.”

On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order delaying for 75 days the enforcement of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which would effectively ban TikTok in the United States. This delay allowed time to assess national security concerns while preventing an abrupt shutdown of the platform used by millions of Americans, and providing an opportunity for an American buyer to take over TikTok.

Perplexity joins a group of American companies—including Oracle, Microsoft, and Walmart—that have previously expressed interest in acquiring TikTok. Others eyeing a purchase of TikTok include consortiums headed by Frank McCourt, the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Roblox CEO Jesse Tinsley. At one point, X owner Elon Musk was rumored to be interested in acquiring TikTok.

“Any acquisition by a consortium of investors could in effect keep ByteDance in control of the algorithm, while any acquisition by a competitor would likely create a monopoly in the short form video and information space,” Perplexity wrote. “All of society benefits when content feeds are liberated from the manipulations of foreign governments and globalist monopolists.”

While it makes its case for taking over TikTok, Perplexity AI is eyeing a new funding round after valuing the company at $18 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg. Citing persons familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the funding round would range from $500 million to $1 billion.

The valuation and news of the upcoming funding round come as Perplexity broadens its offerings beyond search to include AI-driven tools that help users find answers more efficiently. In February, Perplexity announced the waitlist for a new Comet browser that leverages AI agents for what the company called “Agentic Search.”

Next week, we will start giving access to a small set of initial users. We are trying our best to get it out in a few weeks. https://t.co/7MkZZ4aa88 — Aravind Srinivas (@AravSrinivas) March 21, 2025

Using its AI, powered by Nvidia’s new Dynamo platform, Perplexity said it could boost TikTok’s recommendation system while improving transparency amid rising concerns over misinformation.

“A TikTok rebuilt and powered by Perplexity would create the world's greatest platform for creativity and knowledge discovery,” they said.

Decrypt reached out to Perplexity for comment.

If you fall into the latter camp, here's something that might help you warm up to the cleaning process: deals! More specifically, early deals from Amazon's Big Spring Sale.

Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds have shed $370 million in assets over the past 12 trading days, notching their longest losing streak yet, as the price of the underlying asset has struggled.

Among funds, which began trading last year, outflows from the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) totaled $146 million and $106 million, the most over this period, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass.

The outflows have dovetailed with Ethereum’s tumble to its current level of around $1,950 from $2,200 on March 5, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko. The asset has swooned in recent months amid investors doubts about its speed and efficiency compared to blockchain rivals and a wider fall-off in crypto and other risk-on assets prompted by macroeconomic angst.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $660 million this week, regaining a small amount of ground lost in their own recent downturn.

In an interview on Thursday at the Digital Asset Summit in New York, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, said that the Ethereum ETFs’ lackluster debut came partly because they do not permit staking.

NYSE Arca filed for just that on behalf of Bitwise this week, while Grayscale, 21Shares and Fidelity have also filed for rule changes on their funds to permit staking.

The SEC has acknowledged the NYSE and Grayscale filings, and earlier this month, the Commission met with Coinbase to discuss how certain liquidity risks could be mitigated for spot Ethereum ETFs depending on the amount of ETH withheld from staking.

“A staking yield is a meaningful part of how you can generate investment return in this space,” Mitchnick said.

Staking rewards are issued to Ethereum investors that lock up their capital and participate in the process of validating transactions.

The amount of Ethereum being staked has meanwhile increased to 33.8 million ETH, according to data from testnet block explorer beaconcha.in. That represents a 0.5% increase from the 33.6 million Ethereum staked on March 5, when spot Ethereum ETFs began their recent bleed.

Spot Ethereum funds have generated $2.45 billion in net inflows since their debut last July, with BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF garnering $587 million. Analysts consider their launch successful, although their performance is dwarfed by spot Bitcoin ETFs that have received more than $35 billion in net inflows, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors.

“This highlights a growing institutional risk appetite for BTC, while ETH’s recovery remains sluggish as investors wait for stronger catalysts,” the crypto research firm BRN said on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Friday.

Report: Cadillac Switching Sedans To All-Electric

It seems despite feedback from the market indicating electric cars continue to have niche appeal, Cadillac is moving forward on plans to switch its sedans for EVs. This could be yet another example of GM reacting in all the wrong ways, failing to read the room, and even telling consumers what they want.

In the meantime, the Trump Administration has eviscerated the EPA’s fuel economy standards.

We’re sure some will find this plan to be brilliant and forward-thinking. Time will tell if this is a major flub and black eye for the Cadillac brand or a way for it to at least keep up with if not leapfrog the competition.

While the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 will stick around for another model year, that’s 2026, a new report from GM Authority indicates that’s the end of the line for both. Considering they shared a factory with the late Camaro, their demise was anticipated, just at the same time.

Instead, GM will keep them around a bit longer, then replace both with new EV models. One will be about the size of the CT5, while the other will be around the same as the CT6. We guess the CT4 is just considered too small, for now.

Supposedly, these two all-electric sedans will have a sportback design, similar to the Cadillac Escala concept. They’re supposedly going to be using the brand’s next-generation EV architecture, too, which is a leap beyond what the Lyriq and others currently use.

This information comes yet again from anonymous sources within GM, so we wouldn’t exactly call it gospel truth. But it could be spot on – we’ll see.

We know the talk within Cadillac for a long time was how the brand could catch up or surpass premium European brands like Mercedes and BMW. However, with the uprising of Tesla that’s changed as GM has been working to position its crown jewel as a Tesla rival, the same as what the Europeans have been trying to accomplish.

In the meantime, we’ve noted the oft-used phrase “Tesla killer” seen in other media outlets has gone away, despite Cadillac and others trying to meet the American automaker on its own ground.

Do you think it’s wise for Cadillac to abandon the premium internal combustion engine market like this?

                <p>Wood Brothers Racing played a pivotal role in Jim Clark's historic Indy 500 win for Lotus in 1965, and for this weekend's NASCAR throwback race at Darlington Raceway the team is reliving that wonderful winning weekend with a classic green and yellow livery paint scheme. Josh Berry's number 21 Motorcraft Ford will be decked out in the same British racing green and canary yellow as Clark's famed Lotus-Ford was sixty years ago. The throwback look was unveiled on Thursday with a commemorative event at The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan, where Clark's original race-winner is displayed.

"This was a really fun project to work on with the team, from sorting all the details to making sure it properly reflected such an important moment in history," said Jon Wood, president of Wood Brothers Racing. "It's always special to run a throwback, but this one carries extra meaning because of the connection our family had to that Indy 500 win. Unveiling it at The Henry Ford, right next to the original car, made it even more special. Seeing the No. 21 in those colors is a great way to honor that history, and I think it's something fans will really appreciate."

How'd They Do It?

Clark's number 85 car was the first rear-engine car to ever win at Indy, due in large part to its more aerodynamic shape and better handling character around the Brickyard, but the Wood Brothers brought innovation to the team's pit stops. The Woods came up with an innovative gravity-feed pressurized venturi fueling system that packed a car to the brim in mere seconds while other teams were still relying on fuel cans and pumps. According to a recounting from Leonard Wood one of the Indianapolis pit stall inspectors didn't believe it would work, and bet the team that they "couldn't pour 20 gallons a minute to come out of that tank." The team knew their secret weapon in the pits would help them win the race and didn't take the bet for fear of actually taking that man's money. "We connected it and stopped it. We put 58 gallons in in 15 seconds." confessed Wood. "That was pretty awesome, really."

Clark, who led 190 of the 200 laps that year, took the win by a little under two minutes at the end. The Wood Brothers still say that Clark used a single set of tires for the full 500 mile race. It's safe to say that Josh Berry will need more than one set of Goodyears to make it to the end of this weekend's Goodyear 400 at Darlington. Maybe with some quick pit stops and a fast Ford engine Berry can find his way to victory lane again after winning last weekend's Las Vegas round.

                <p>As the Coldware (COLD) presale gains momentum, many investors are wondering if it can surpass Pepe Coin (PEPE)’s trading volume at launch, which stands at an impressive $850 million. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) has captivated investors through its meme-driven hype, Coldware (COLD) is focused on offering real-world applications with its blockchain technology, potentially setting it up for a far-reaching impact in the market.

Coldware (COLD): A Real-World Blockchain Solution with Unmatched Potential

Unlike meme coins, Coldware (COLD) is making waves by focusing on real-world applications powered by blockchain. By providing decentralized solutions for industries such as logistics, retail, and healthcare, Coldware (COLD) offers real value beyond speculative trading. This approach has gained the attention of whales and retail investors alike, positioning Coldware (COLD) to have a significant impact in the crypto space.

The Surge of Pepe Coin (PEPE)

Pepe Coin (PEPE) made waves upon its launch, driven primarily by social media hype and meme culture. However, as time passed, the project has faced challenges in sustaining its growth. The meme coin’s price fluctuations, coupled with its reliance on community-driven speculation, have led many to question its long-term sustainability. Although PEPEexperienced massive trading volumes during its early days, the asset is now in a phase of stagnation, prompting investors to search for projects with more utility.

The Potential of Coldware’s Presale: Could It Overtake PEPE?

The Coldware (COLD) presale has already shown signs of strong investor interest. With a unique value proposition that goes beyond meme coin trends, Coldware (COLD) could very well surpass Pepe Coin (PEPE)’s trading volume at launch. As more investors turn to projects with sustainable growth prospects, Coldware (COLD) is poised to capture a significant share of the market, especially as its utility-based model offers far more potential for long-term gains.

Why Coldware (COLD) is Gaining Traction Among Investors

Coldware (COLD) is attracting attention for several reasons. First, its focus on scalability and real-world blockchain applications provides a solid foundation for future growth. Second, the increasing participation in its presale highlights investor confidence in the project’s long-term success. As Coldware (COLD) positions itself as a serious player in the blockchain space, its presale could see a surge in participation, potentially outpacing Pepe Coin (PEPE)’s initial volume.

Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) Poised for Market Leadership

While Pepe Coin (PEPE) has made a name for itself in the meme coin space, Coldware (COLD) is strategically positioned to capture a larger share of the market by offering real utility.

As the Coldware (COLD) presale progresses, it’s clear that investors are looking for more than just hype — they’re seeking sustainable, scalable blockchain solutions. Coldware (COLD) has the potential to surpass PEPE’s early trading volume, signaling the dawn of a new era in blockchain investment.

                <p>The landscape of the cryptocurrency market is shifting as Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) show signs of fading out, with new meme-driven projects struggling to maintain momentum. As these meme coins face challenges in sustaining their popularity, Coldware (COLD) is on the rise, offering innovative solutions that go beyond meme hype. With its Freeze.mint feature, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a serious player in the blockchain space, attracting attention from both retail investors and whales.

Coldware (COLD): A New Era in Blockchain Solutions

Amid the fading popularity of meme coins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Coldware (COLD) is making waves with its innovative approach to blockchain technology. With its Freeze.mint feature, Coldware (COLD) is offering scalable, decentralized solutions that address real-world challenges in areas like logistics, healthcare, and retail. This shift from meme-driven hype to tangible blockchain applications is attracting the attention of investors who are looking for more than just speculation.

The Potential of Freeze.mint in Coldware’s Ecosystem

The Freeze.mint feature is one of the standout offerings of Coldware (COLD). By providing a solution that supports real-world blockchain applications, Coldware (COLD) is setting itself apart from meme coins like PEPE and DOGE. As investors turn their attention to projects with solid use cases and scalability, Coldware (COLD) is well-positioned to grow and expand in the blockchain ecosystem.

Pepe Coin (PEPE) Faces a Decline in Popularity

Pepe Coin (PEPE), which once saw explosive growth thanks to its viral status, is now showing signs of losing steam. The recent surge in PEPE’s price, driven largely by social media trends and speculative interest, has started to plateau. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) continues to attract attention, its lack of real-world applications and the volatility typical of meme coins is starting to catch up. Without significant development or new use cases, PEPE risks becoming another short-lived meme coin in the crypto market.

Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Status Struggles to Drive Long-Term Growth

Similarly, Dogecoin (DOGE), the pioneering meme coin, continues to show relatively stable price action. However, the price has failed to break out significantly, and the lack of substantial development in its ecosystem has limited its long-term growth potential. While DOGE enjoys strong community support and celebrity endorsements, it lacks the fundamental utility that investors are now seeking in the crypto space.

Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) Set to Lead the Way

As Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) face challenges in maintaining their momentum, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a strong contender in the blockchain space.

With its Freeze.mint feature and real-world blockchain solutions, Coldware (COLD) is poised to lead the next wave of crypto innovation, offering long-term growth potential for investors who are looking beyond meme coins. The future of Coldware (COLD) looks bright as it continues to gain traction in the market, positioning itself for success in 2025 and beyond.

                <p>Lest you think things couldn’t get any worse for Tesla in 2025, the automaker just announced a recall on the Cybertruck, claiming one of the stainless steel body panels could come detached while driving.

This is the eighth recall the stainless-clad vehicle has collected in the mere two years it’s been on the road. But unlike many of its previous offenses, this is one of the first significant body repairs that can’t be addressed with a simple over-the-air update.

The recall affects 46,096 Cybertrucks manufactured between November 2023 and late February 2025.

What Is the Issue?

Courtesy Tesla

The issue stems from something called the cantrail, a strip of stainless steel trim glued to the exterior of the vehicle that runs along the windshield and the roof. The recall noted that environmental conditions may have compromised the adhesive used to keep the trim piece attached to the vehicle. While it might sound blasphemous for Tesla to use adhesive instead of fasteners, many automakers have made this standard practice, claiming considerable weight savings and improved structural integrity .

Advertisement Advertisement

The recall says the adhesive showed signs of “environmental embrittlement,” which causes causes materials to lose their ductility , making them prone to cracking and failure.

What Is the Fix?

As such a large body panel coming loose poses considerable risk to other motorists, Tesla voluntarily recalled the Cybertruck on March 11, 2025. The fix is fairly straightforward: attaching a new cantrail with the proper adhesive that “isn’t susceptible to environmental embrittlement.” Along with using the correct sticky stuff, Tesla also plans to add redundancy, welding a threaded metal stud to the panel that clamps onto the vehicle with a nut.

To offer some perspective on the Cybertruck’s recall history, here’s a look at its last seven infractions:

Tire Pressure Monitoring (December 2025)

"Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2024 Cybertruck, 2017-2025 Model 3, and 2020-2025 Model Y vehicles. The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) warning light may not remain illuminated between drive cycles, failing to warn the driver of low tire pressure. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 138, "Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems."

Inverter Fault (November 2024)

"Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. A fault in the drive inverter may cause a loss of drive power to the wheels."

Back Over Prevention (September 2024)

"Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. The rearview camera image may be delayed after shifting into reverse. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111, "Rear Visibility."

Loose Body Panel (July 2024)

"Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. The trunk bed trim sail applique could have been improperly adhered and can loosen."

Windshield Wiper/Washer Motor (July 2024)

"Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. Excessive electrical current can cause the front windshield wiper motor controller to fail."

Accelerator Pedal (April 2024)

"Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. The accelerator pedal pad may dislodge and cause the pedal to become trapped by the interior trim."

Instrument Cluster/Panel (January 2024)

"Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2012-2023 Model S, 2016-2024 Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, 2019-2024 Model Y, and 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. An incorrect font size is displayed on the instrument panel for the Brake, Park, and Antilock Brake System (ABS) warning lights. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 105, "Hydraulic and Electric Brake Systems" and 135, "Light Vehicle Brake Systems."





Cybertrucks by the Numbers

In an ironic twist of fate, this latest recall gives us great insight into just how many Cybertrucks Tesla has sold to customers. As the recall window overlaps most of the truck’s lifetime, we can confidently assume that Tesla has delivered fewer than 50,000 units. Following initial claims of a million reservations and the manufacturing muscle to build 500,000 Cybertrucks a year, Tesla has achieved less than 10 percent of their production target.

However, with so few Cybertrucks on the road, this could actually prove to be a fairly straightforward and rapid fix for Tesla to rectify. If we look at some of the issues and numbers other automakers are dealing with, it’s clear things could be a lot worse. For context, Ford had to fix dodgy fuel pumps on 295,000 of its Super Duty trucks .

As of March 14, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says Tesla has identified 151 Cybertruck warranty claims that could be related to the recall.

On his desk is a $1,799 curved ultra-wide Samsung gaming monitor attached to a gaming PC.

Popular with gamers, ultra-wide screens also have tons of screen real estate to help with multitasking.

Elon Musk's DOGE office desk is leaning into his gamer aesthetic.

The Tesla CEO shared a photo of his office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Friday, revealing a massive curved computer screen that many gamers would instantly recognize.

The screen is a $1,799 Samsung G9 model, which sports a wraparound OLED curved display. You can usually find it on sale — a quick search shows some retailers selling it for around $1,100.

We'll spare you all the nitty gritty specs, but suffice it to say it's about as gamery as computer screens get, with the supersized screen designed to fill more of your field of view so you feel more immersed in virtual worlds.

Samsung's 49" Odyssey QD-OLED G9 gaming monitor has a retail price of $1,799. Samsung

And while the attached gaming PC visible below his desk all but guarantees Musk uses the setup to play some of his favorite video games, such as "Diablo IV," an "ultra-wide" screen like Musk's is also genuinely useful for productivity too.

When working, all that extra screen real estate allows you to set up multiple side-by-side windows, so Musk could theoretically have a full-size web browser open next to his X news feed next to a workplace communication app like Slack.

However, the most eye-catching thing in Musk's DOGE office pic may be a framed image of the internet meme character "Kekius Maximus," which Musk changed his X profile name to for a time in December.

"My @DOGE office with the late great Kekius Maximus on the wall," Musk wrote on Friday.

The meme is a variation of the internet character Pepe the Frog, popular in some online communities as well as some in the far-right. The Pepe the Frog meme is now considered by the Anti-Defamation League to be a hate symbol, though the organization has said that "the mere fact of posting a Pepe meme does not mean that someone is racist or white supremacist."

"The majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be, non-bigoted," the Anti-Defamation League wrote. "However, it was inevitable that, as the meme proliferated in online venues such as 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit, which have many users who delight in creating racist memes and imagery, a subset of Pepe memes would come into existence that centered on racist, antisemitic or other bigoted themes."

"In recent years, with the growth of the 'alt right' segment of the white supremacist movement, a segment that draws some of its support from some of the above-mentioned internet sites, the number of 'alt right' Pepe memes has grown, a tendency exacerbated by the controversial and contentious 2016 presidential election," the ADL added.

Musk, who frequently posts internet memes to his X account, has previously posted memes containing Pepe the Frog.

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the image from Business Insider.

Other decorations in Musk's office include a "DOGE" desk plaque and a "Make America Great Again" hat.

The Kia Niro PHEV pairs a 1.6-liter four-cylinder gas engine with an 83-hp electric motor sandwiched between the engine and automatic transmission.

Michael Simari - Car and Driver

While the gas engine itself only produces 104 horsepower and 106 pound-feet of torque, net output for the combined powertrain is a solid 180 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque.

                <p>On Saturday Night Live's "Coffee Talk" sketch, Mike Myers's Linda Richman character once reminded us that Rhode Island is neither a road nor an island. Just like that confusingly named state, our long-term Kia Niro plug-in hybrid exists between definitions that don't necessarily suit it based on our experiences. Is our 2024 Kia Niro PHEV working more like a standard hybrid or an electric vehicle? We've been talking amongst ourselves on this one as the Niro's odometer creeps past 20,000 miles, and the answer is... well, it depends.

If you really want to get the most out of your plug-in hybrid, you'll have to charge it, and we do—for the most part. Our Ann Arbor office has plenty of charging stations, and the Niro generally departs at the end of a workday with a full box of juice. But when it's not at the office, it's a crap shoot. Roughly one-third of our staff has charging solutions at home, and of that group, about half of them habitually plug in the Kia. Most of those who don't charge the Niro at home are apartment dwellers who lack access to even a 120-volt plug, forcing them to treat the car as a hybrid, which is how the Niro functions when it lacks the battery charge to operate on its electric motor alone. Senior editor Greg Fink was the sole staffer who raised his hand and said he regularly charged the Niro on a 120-volt plug, which he did at an Airbnb rental. A gold star for Greg.

Becca Hackett - Car and Driver

We also polled the staff about on-the-go charging. Interestingly, nobody mentioned charging the Niro PHEV on a Level 2 charging unit when out and about. There are a few reasons why this might be the case. Level 2 infrastructure in our neck of the woods isn't ubiquitous, so we often find ourselves in locations that simply lack the framework. There's also the matter of time: It takes around three hours to charge the 8.9-kWh lithium-ion battery, and someone may only be running a 10-minute errand, which doesn't leave much time to fill up. The gas engine's existence is another factor; with that fallback option, there isn't a true need to expend the effort to find a plug and charge up. There simply isn't any range anxiety, even when the instrument cluster says the battery is down to the electric equivalent of fumes.

With an EPA-estimated electric range of only 33 miles on a full charge, the Niro can't take us far before the battery drops to roughly 17 percent, the threshold where the car will only run as a hybrid. Managing reviews editor Andrew Krok and testing director Dave VanderWerp live close to the office, so they can commute on electricity alone, which means that most of the time the Niro is running like a hybrid for most of our staff.

Michael Simari - Car and Driver

One of the logbook's most oft-voiced complaints concerns that electric motor. VanderWerp's main annoyance with electric operation comes from how Kia arranged the powertrain: "The electric motor shifts up through the gears even when running as an EV, which makes it not nearly as seamless as most actual EVs." Technical editor Mike Sutton echoed that comment, saying that the Niro is a fine little hatchback that gets around decently as an EV, albeit "a bit slowly and clumsily with that transmission." Head honcho Tony Quiroga added that the lack of power is his only complaint.

Since our last update, we took the Niro PHEV in for service at around 16,000 miles. The dealer performed an oil and filter change, rotated the tires, replaced the cabin air filter, and performed a multipoint inspection for a grand total of $206. Not too long after that, we took the Niro back in for some recall work; our model was recalled because the manual seat adjustment may contact and damage some airbag and seatbelt wiring. Since our Niro had no damaged wiring, the dealer installed a protective cover and sent us on our way. To handle whatever Michigan decided to throw at us over the winter, the Niro PHEV donned a set of Nokian Remedy WRG5 all-weather tires, which performed admirably in the snow.

Marc Urbano - Car and Driver

But while the snow didn't faze us, the temperature did; our first 10,000 miles saw an average fuel economy of 42 MPGe, but colder temps (and the winter tires' higher rolling resistance) brought that average down to 40 MPGe as we approached the 20,000-mile mark. In the first 18,500 miles, 437 gallons of fuel entered the Niro PHEV's tank (not counting the gallons used for vehicle testing). Over that same distance, various plugs have added 736 kilowatt-hours to the battery, which is the energy equivalent of only 22 gallons of fuel.

What makes plug-in hybrids interesting, though, is that they can be used in a variety of ways. Our use of the Niro PHEV may not be the same as someone who owns a home charger and takes maximum advantage of the EV range with mostly in-town driving. But that isn't a possible use case for us; with our daily driver swaps, frequent road trips, and lack of consistent home charging, the Niro PHEV ends up living as a hybrid far more often than it does as an EV.

10,000-Mile Update

Oh, the places you'll go in a 2024 Kia Niro PHEV! We may have taken some time to start racking up the miles on our plug-in-hybrid Niro, but once it hit the road in earnest, it's been a road-trip warrior since.

Copy editor Meredith Conrow drove the Niro to New York to run a half-marathon, spending plenty of time in the PHEV and hitting several interesting places along the way, such as Letchworth State Park ("the Grand Canyon of the East") and the Finger Lakes. She thought the Niro was a great road-trip companion: "The gas mileage is great, the seats and ride are comfortable, and it's got plenty of zip for passing maneuvers," she wrote in the logbook. Overall, the car had more than enough space and storage for her and her husband, but they did have some gripes: There was no place for her purse, it could use a couple more cupholders, and relying on a single swappable interface for both infotainment and climate controls was frustrating.

Michael Simari - Car and Driver

Many a staffer has been keen to assess how PHEVs fit into day-to-day life. Deputy video editor Carlos Lago's logbook entry cast the PHEV "ownership" experience in a positive light: "It's nice running errands within the EV-range window while still seeing 400-plus miles of overall range." Based on his needs, plugging into a standard 120-volt outlet overnight was sufficient to have a full battery for the next day. What hasn't been sufficient for Lago, however, is the operation of the driver's-side sun visor—and don't even start when his garage door opener is also attached to it.

The PHEV's powertrain has proved useful in many instances, but we have also heard a lot of noise about the e-motor and how it moves through the gears. Senior editor Andrew Krok noted, "Running the e-motor through the dual-clutch transmission was certainly a choice," given the occasional frustrating pauses in electric motivation. Senior editor Greg Fink wrote that the gas-electric setup is very dependent on battery level. The whole thing needs a good bit of electricity to run at full bore, and when the battery charge gets low, "the little 1.6-liter will just drop down a gear at highway speed and rev its little heart out to both replenish the battery and assist in propelling the car forward." Or at least that's what Fink assumes, because at no point did he feel like those downshifts were necessary due to a lack of power.

Michael Simari - Car and Driver

So far, the PHEV experience has had hits and misses, with efficiency leaning toward the latter. Many of our Niro's first 10,000 miles have come from road trips, which isn't optimal as far as battery use is concerned, yet our average fuel economy has bumped from 40 MPGe up to 42 MPGe. But with winter coming, those long road trips may be few and far between, giving us more time to enjoy the PHEV's electric operation, which will certainly be trying its hardest in the forthcoming colder weather.

Introduction



While most automotive conversations these days focus on hybrids or fully electric vehicles, there's a groundswell of interest in plug-in hybrids, which offer the flexibility of a hybrid but with a plug and a larger battery for genuine electric travel. Our long-term garage has been thick with just about every kind of propulsion except for PHEVs, so when Kia decided to add a more powerful electric motor to its 2024 Niro PHEV, we thought it would be a good opportunity to get better acquainted with this middle-ground approach that continues to grow in popularity.

We've only previously welcomed two long-term PHEVs to our stable: a 2018 Chrysler Pacifica, which might have been ahead of its time and didn't hold up to the gasoline-powered Pacifica; and a 2020 Volvo S60, which arrived right at the beginning of the tumultuous work-from-home era and didn't allow for much EV operation given the lack of home-charging options at the time. Now, we're back in the office, with new EV chargers about to be installed, so we'll have plenty of chances to see how much we can squeeze from the Niro, which is rated at 33 miles of EV-only operation.

When it came time to choose how we wanted to spec our Niro PHEV, we opted for the SX Touring trim, which starts at $41,515 and comes with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder gas engine paired with an 83-hp electric motor sandwiched between the engine and transmission, as well as an estimated 8.9-kWh lithium-ion battery located under the rear seat. Total output is rated at 180 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. Moving up to the SX Touring boosts the PHEV's price by $5750 over the base EX, but the features list grows significantly. In addition to increasing the wheel size to 18 inches, the SX Touring adds a power sunroof, a power liftgate, a Harman/Kardon premium audio system, and front seats with both heating and ventilation. We also tacked on carpeted floor mats for $175 and a cargo mat for $95, taking us to a grand total of $41,785.

The Niro PHEV arrived with its break-in miles completed, so we were able to jump right into testing. Our initial results include a 7.5-second romp to 60 mph and a quarter-mile pass of 15.8 seconds at 89 mph. That proved quicker than a 2023 Niro hybrid we tested that needed 8.9 seconds to reach 60 and ran the quarter-mile in 16.9 seconds at 82 mph. Weighing in at almost 3500 pounds, the Niro PHEV pulled 0.83 g around the skidpad, while the hybrid gave us a stickier result of 0.87 g. In our 70-mph braking test, the Niro PHEV ground itself to a halt in 185 feet, nowhere close to the lighter hybrid's more impressive 168-foot stop.



Michael Simari - Car and Driver

It didn't take long for us to get the Niro PHEV on the road. Almost immediately, we took a trip to Kansas City that had the Kia returning an average of 38 mpg over the course of 1591 miles. But PHEVs introduce an interesting twist: Most PHEVs, including this Niro, are not equipped to be recharged during road trips. They only have the SAE J1772 plug without DC fast-charging capability, so you aren't able to plug it into, say, your local high-speed Electrify America stall. If you can't find a basic Level 2 charger where you can park for a few hours, or if you lack access to a 120-volt plug for overnight charging, you'll probably treat your plug-in more as a regular hybrid. However, if you're able to charge overnight and you keep the trips short, those 33 miles of estimated EV range should make for minimal gas-engine usage in daily driving.

In addition to treating the Niro PHEV as we would any other long-term vehicle, we are excited to dive into plug-in-specific questions during our time with it. How much range can you really get from the battery? How many of our 40,000 miles will we be able to cover on electricity alone? Do PHEVs with a low-range battery even do much? These are all questions we're looking forward to investigating over the course of the next year.

                <p>Tesla is in a sticky situation. On Thursday, it issued a recall for nearly every single Cybertruck it's manufactured to date because their stainless steel body panels could fly off while driving, providing other motorists on the road a sharp-edged Mario Kart obstacle to dodge during their morning commute.

The Elon Musk owned automaker definitely has a few screws loose, but that's not why these panels are detaching. According to a regulatory filing, the issue is caused by the shoddy glue used to attach the angular pieces of the Cybertruck's exterior, specifically a lengthy portion above the side windows connecting to the vehicle's roof known as the cant rail.

Roll that back — did they say these things are held together by glue?

Yes. Although the use of glue isn't uncommon in the world of automotive construction, you can leave it to Tesla — which is facing its eighth recall for the Cybertruck, a vehicle that's only been on the road for little over a year and was hyped as the culmination of Elon's engineering genius — to find some way to mess up sticking two things together.

In the filing, Tesla says that the adhesive it used was "susceptible to environmental embrittlement," and that the way it will fix the issue is by replacing it with a glue that won't disintegrate after a year on the road.

To experts, it's a baffling blunder.

"Glues are used a lot more than people think in car body construction these days," Dale Harrow, chair and director of the Intelligent Mobility Design Center at the Royal College of Art London, told Wired. "Rather than having a mechanical fixing, weld or a screw or a bolt, it's very effective gluing panels together for a lighter construction. It's become very popular. Jaguar, Lexus, Audi, they'll use glues at some point."

"So I'm very surprised," Harrow said. "It's not as if it's an unknown science. I've not heard [of problems] anywhere else."

But the Cybertruck is different. One reason that you don't hear about other automakers having glue problems is probably that they're wise enough not to use the same metal used in kitchen utensils for the exterior of their vehicles.

"Stainless steel is the big difference," Harrow told Wired, suggesting that the problem seems to arise with how the metal conducts cold better. "I could surmise that something on the production line is not quite bonding at the right temperature or getting the right UV coverage? And that could be due to the stainless steel having a different density from standard steel."

"It's not a small company, and it's not doing things on the cheap," Harrow added. "So I'll be very surprised if there wasn't the knowledge within the company to fix this."

For one reason or another, the glue slipped through the cracks. But the Cybertruck has been plagued with so many issues — from bricking in car washes to bricking while driving, to its big dumb accelerator pedals getting stuck in the down position — that you really shouldn't be surprised at this point.

No pull: New cabinet hardware can really change the look of your kitchen. (Getty)

A few months ago, I started renovating my home. But with a limited budget, I had to be choosy about what I upgraded. The bathroom, with its '80s shell-shaped sink and beige vinyl walls? A definite goner. In the kitchen, the counters were chipped and falling apart, so they had to go, but the rest of the space? Solid wood cabinets, a U-shaped layout ... it wasn't so bad!



It still needed a style boost, though — and that's where my home-editor brain kicked into gear. Throughout my 20-year career, I've interviewed countless designers about easy ways to update a space. And without fail, whenever the conversation turns to the kitchen, they recommend one thing: Change out your cabinet hardware.

Leather pulls in a kitchen might seem risky, but they actually look better (and get softer) with age. (Getty)

Though knobs and pulls are small, they can transform the look of cabinets and drawers. Sleek matte black knobs add a modern vibe; brass cup pulls give a space a historic feel. Unlike light fixtures and appliances, hardware is simple to swap out — usually, all you need is a screwdriver — and it won't destroy your budget. Many of my favorite knobs and pulls start at just a buck apiece, meaning you can make over your kitchen for less than the cost of dinner out. Worth it!

Amazon Rous Hardware Mid-Century Modern T-Bar Knob These are the exact knobs I used, so I'm definitely biased, but I think they're the perfect combination of funky and traditional. The shape feels great in my hand, and the matte finish is a fun departure from traditional shiny/metallic hardware. They also work just as well on cabinets as they do on drawers. Not into green? You can grab them in eight other colors, including black, blue and white. $11 at Amazon

Amazon Amerock 3-Inch Cup Pulls, 10-Pack Want to make your kitchen look rich? Cup pulls (aka bin pulls or half-moon pulls) are the answer. These unique pulls were popularized in the Victorian era and have serious historic charm. They work well in traditional and farmhouse kitchens, but you can also find simpler, narrower styles that feel modern if you love the look but have a more contemporary space. $23 at Amazon

Amazon Zernmiarder Celadon Pumpkin Knobs, 12-Pack Ceramic knobs deliver instant vintage vibes, and they're an easy way to add a pop of color to an all-white or wood kitchen. These come in a veritable rainbow of colors: 22 in total, ranging from antique white to deep teal. $13 at Amazon

Amazon Amerock Cabinet Pull, 5-1/16" For less than $9, this pull gives you two great trends in one.

                <p>The cryptocurrency market is hitting a new stride, with several projects capturing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. XRP, Solana, and BinoFi stand at the forefront of this shift, each opening up promising opportunities and reshaping the landscape of digital finance. Here’s how these powerhouses are leading the charge into a brighter future for the crypto community.

XRP Climbs Higher with Ripple’s Landmark SEC Victory

Ripple’s recent legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sent shockwaves through the industry. After years of contention, the SEC officially dropped its appeal against a July 2023 ruling declaring XRP’s sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities.

Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, called the decision a “resounding victory” and a game-changer for the blockchain space. The news spurred a sharp jump in XRP’s price, shooting up 10% to end the day at $2.51 before settling slightly lower at $2.47.

This rally reflects newfound investor confidence not only in XRP but in the broader cryptocurrency market as regulatory clarity begins to emerge. Ripple’s leadership hinted at ambitious plans, with its Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty emphasizing the company’s strengthened position moving forward.

The legal breakthrough for Ripple also signals a potential easing of the regulatory environment under new SEC leadership. For investors, this is a moment to celebrate, as it clears the path for accelerating innovation and adoption across the blockchain industry.

Solana’s Resilience and Its Push Toward Innovation

Meanwhile, Solana continues to hold its ground as one of the leading blockchain platforms. Despite market fluctuations and occasional setbacks, Solana remains a top choice for developers and investors alike.

Although Solana has faced challenges, including increased competition from emerging projects, its innovative approach and vibrant developer community have kept it in the spotlight.

However, the crypto space is highly dynamic, and attention has swayed to up-and-coming projects like BinoFi, which offer novel solutions to traditional pain points in crypto trading.

BinoFi Sets New Standards in Crypto Trading

BinoFi has firmly placed itself on the map as one of the most talked-about projects of 2025. The hybrid exchange platform combines the advantages of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges, delivering features like cross-chain trading, AI-powered analytics, and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet technology. By pooling liquidity and maintaining user autonomy, BinoFi ensures fast, secure, and seamless trading experiences.

The platform’s presale is a staggering success, with over 20 million $BINO tokens already sold at an initial price of $0.02. Early adopters are betting on the token’s projected launch price of $0.30, setting the stage for a potential 15x return on investment

With demand surging and excitement building, BinoFi has captured the imagination of retail and institutional investors preparing for the next big wave in DeFi.

BinoFi’s innovative approach, focusing on bridging the best of CEXs and DEXs while addressing their weaknesses, has made it a standout contender in an increasingly crowded market. This integrative model, coupled with revolutionary security and usability features, places BinoFi at the forefront of crypto evolution.

A New Dawn for Investment Opportunities

The confluence of XRP’s legal triumph, Solana’s resilience, and BinoFi’s innovations is ushering in a new era of opportunity in the cryptocurrency market.

Ripple’s SEC victory sets a precedent for legal clarity, bolstering industry confidence. Solana remains a favored choice for blockchain innovation, while BinoFi’s visionary platform offers a fresh path for investors seeking high-growth potential.

Whether you’re rallying behind XRP’s newfound momentum, appreciating Solana’s steady position, or seeking entry into BinoFi’s presale, the crypto market is full of possibilities. With the space evolving rapidly, the opportunities for wealth creation and technological advancements appear limitless.

Shares of some of the top publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies have fallen amid a broader market decline, even after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission clarified on Thursday that mining operations “do not involve the offer and sale of securities.”

MARA (MARA), CleanSpark (CLSK), and Bitdeer (BTDR) are among the mining companies showing losses so far Friday, though they've all rebounded somewhat since earlier in the morning. Riot Platforms (RIOT), meanwhile, is relatively flat on the day after being down earlier Friday.

As of this writing, MARA and BTDR are both down about 1.5%, while CLSK has fallen by 4.5%. None of them showed a significant bounce after the Commission’s guidance circulated on Thursday afternoon, and they're currently underperforming relative to leading indices like the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, are down 0.03% and 0.4% respectively Friday as of this writing.

Other major publicly traded crypto firms are also down on the day, with leading American crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) dipping 1.4% and top Bitcoin treasury reserve firm Strategy (MSTR) down 1% so far Friday.

Consensus mechanisms like proof-of-stake (PoS) or proof-of-work (PoW)—the ways in which many major blockchains secure their networks and verify transactions—have drawn the ire of the SEC in the past. For example, in 2022, former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler indicated that proof-of-stake assets like Ethereum or Solana could be considered securities.

Thursday’s guidance, which makes specific mention of the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, didn’t do much for the price of the top mined assets like Bitcoin or Dogecoin either. The coins are down 0.1% and 1.1% in the last 24 hours, respectively.

The last day’s slide continues a poor trend for publicly traded Bitcoin miners, who recently reported a loss of more than $23 billion in collective market cap in a month’s span, according to a JP Morgan report.

The SEC’s latest mining guidance adds to a slew of crypto-positive headlines connected to the Commission, including a handful of dropped investigations and lawsuits, such as those focused on notable companies like Coinbase and Ripple.

                <p>In brief Privacy advocates call coin mixers a necessary tool for protecting anonymity.

Government officials call coin mixers tools for money laundering.

Billions in crypto have changed hands using coin mixers.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Coin mixers have captured the attention of both the cryptocurrency community and regulators as the battle for privacy ramps up.

In 2021, the founder of coin mixer Bitcoin Fog was arrested on charges including money laundering and operating a money transmission business without a license.

A year later, the U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions against Tornado Cash, an Ethereum coin mixing service, effectively banning Americans from using it.

In a landmark ruling in November 2024, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the Treasury had overstepped by sanctioning Tornado Cash's smart contracts, although its broader designation remained intact.

In a reversal of its 2022 decision, the Treasury announced in March 2025 that it had delisted Tornado Cash from its list of parties sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.

But what do coin mixers like Tornado Cash and Bitcoin Fog do—and why do people use them? In this article, we'll examine the technology behind mixers and their legitimate and illegitimate uses.

What is a coin mixer, and why use them?

A coin mixer is a service that allows users to obfuscate the origin and destination of transactions. Users send cryptocurrency to the service, have that crypto mixed with other coins or tokens, and then send the equivalent amount of “mixed” coins to a recipient address, hiding the connection between the sender and recipient.

There are many legitimate uses for this kind of service. Just as you may not want your employer to know the intimate details of every bank or credit card transaction that you've ever made, you may also not want your employer—or anyone else, for that matter—to know every detail of every crypto transaction you've ever made either.

But as the adoption of crypto and blockchain tools grows, real-world identities are becoming increasingly linked to blockchain addresses—with every purchase, transfer, or interaction associated with those addresses laid bare on a public, transparent, distributed ledger. And that's where coin mixers come in.

However, this ability to mask the identity of wallets and obfuscate transactions makes coin mixers an attractive tool for cybercriminals, and thus a target for law enforcement.

While politicians and law enforcement have railed against the use of cryptocurrency in criminal enterprises, coin mixers occupy a gray area between facilitating money laundering and preserving the right to privacy. Because of blockchain's permissionless and transparent nature, some crypto users rely on the added privacy that coin mixers provide.

Privacy advocates argue that coin mixers are especially useful, even necessary, in cases where a person's activities—like journalism, civil disobedience, and protest—can put that person at risk. Because of this, they require greater privacy in their crypto transactions.

Completely legal (until today) reasons to use tornado cash - you get paid in crypto and don’t want your employer knowing all ur financial details - you pay for a service in eth and don’t want them to be able to see everything you’ve ever done onchain — reza.eth (@rezajafery) August 8, 2022

On the other hand, law enforcement and government agencies see coin mixers as a way for criminals to launder money using cryptocurrency, and services like Tornado Cash as a means of obscuring where the funds originated.

In its announcement of the sanctions against Tornado Cash, the Treasury Department said that criminals had used Tornado Cash to launder money, saying the service processed more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019. According to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, around $1.5 billion of that figure was connected to illicit activity.

Among those illicit funds, the Treasury said, were a combined $103.8 million stolen from crypto bridging services by Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored North Korean cybercriminal group.

A November 2024 ruling by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court found that the Treasury had overstepped its authority, and that Tornado Cash's immutable smart contracts "are not property because they are not capable of being owned." The decision reversed a lower court ruling, noting that protocols built on smart contracts cannot be classified as services because they operate without "human intervention."

In March 2025, the Treasury reversed course, removing Tornado Cash from its list of sanctioned entities. "Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury," the Treasury said in a statement.

Bitcoin Fog: Founded in 2011 by Roman Sterlingov, Bitcoin Fog was a custodial mixer, and held user funds in the process of mixing them. Sterlingov was convicted of money laundering in 2024.

How do coin mixers work?

Before Tornado Cash was taken down, it used smart contracts to accept token deposits from one address and enable their withdrawal from a different address.

Other coin mixers operate in a similar way, with smart contracts that work as a pool where all the deposited tokens get mixed together. When funds are withdrawn from those pools, the on-chain link between the source and the destination is broken, anonymizing the transaction.

These kinds of coin mixers are typically non-custodial, meaning there is no third-party control of the wallet and funds, simply the creation of the smart contracts.

Because these services use no intermediary, they are reliably neutral—but that also means they can be a tempting tool for cybercriminals looking to launder stolen crypto, as in the case of Lazarus Group.

Legitimate use cases of coin mixers

Let’s say there’s a business owner and crypto enthusiast named Robert who wants to send Ethereum to a hacktivist group operating out of Ukraine. Robert doesn't want his donation to be traced back to him, so he uses a coin mixer.

Robert goes to the coin mixer website and deposits the Ethereum he wants to donate. The sent amount is deposited into the mixer's smart contract and pooled with the other hundred, thousands, or even millions of transactions already in its pool. After receiving confirmation that the deposit was successful, Robert goes to the withdraw tab, enters the recipient's address into the mixer, and sends the Ethereum from the mixer.

The Ethereum is then sent from the mixing to the recipient. On the receiving end, the address shown is that of the mixer and not the original sender’s address, anonymizing the transaction.

If this hypothetical scenario sounds familiar, it's based on a tweet from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, posted after the Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash.

I'll out myself as someone who has used TC to donate to this exact cause. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 9, 2022

The future of coin mixers

The debate over crypto privacy continues to rage, despite the series of legal cases and sanctions against coin mixers.

The November 2024 ruling that immutable smart contracts cannot be classified as "property" was hailed by crypto and privacy advocates as a landmark moment, meaning that self-executing code that operates without any administrative control cannot be subject to sanctions.

More recent projects like Railgun aim to give users on-chain privacy, but also ensure that they remain compliant in the eyes of the law.

Railgun is not a traditional mixer; it doesn’t mix coins from multiple sources together, and its founders believe it avoids the pitfalls that ultimately led to mixers getting sanctioned or sued.

It also utilizes “Private Proof of Innocence” to ensure bad actors cannot use the platform for illicit purposes. For example, on July 11, 2024, a notorious crypto drainer known as Inferno Drainer attempted to use Railgun to launder 174 ETH. However, Railgun identified that the wallet was tied to a bad actor and blocked the transactions.

Whether crypto privacy projects' efforts to create legally compliant mixing services will mollify lawmakers is open to debate. One thing's for certain, though—privacy advocates will continue to fight to ensure that crypto isn't a panopticon.

As Lia Holland, Campaigns & Communications Director at Fight for the Future, wrote in 2022: “Let us be clear, hackers and cybercriminals, as well as those that support them, are deplorable and should be stopped—but not in a way that compromises human rights and the first amendment.”

                <p>The Department of Treasury has lifted Sanctions on Tornado Cash, the Ethereum based smart contract mixer, following a series of legal defeats and administrative challenges.



“Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury,” the Treasury Department stated.

Quick Overview of the Tornado Cash Story

Tornado Cash was launched in 2019 as a decentralized protocol to enhance transaction privacy on Ethereum.

In August 2022, the mixer was added to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list, which includes sanctioned individuals and entities. U.S. law enforcement alleged that Tornado Cash facilitated over $7 billion in money laundering, including funds linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

This led to a ban on U.S. persons using the service and legal action against its co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, who were indicted in 2023 for money laundering tied to over $1 billion in transactions.

Six Tornado Cash users, backed by Coinbase, sued the Treasury, challenging the sanctions.

A Texas federal court ruled in January 2025 that the smart contracts couldn’t be sanctioned, a decision upheld by the Fifth Circuit in November 2024.

Today the Treasury officially lifted the sanctions, citing evolving legal and technological considerations, though it expressed concern about ongoing illicit crypto activities and reinforced its intent and authority to continue DPRK sanctions.

Tension Continues

The Treasury nevertheless reinforced its intent to enforce sanctions against Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), an ongoing source of geopolitical tension given the recent $1 billion+ hack from Bybit argued to have been executed by Lazarous, a hacking group with DRKP ties.



“We remain deeply concerned about the significant state-sponsored hacking and money laundering campaign aimed at stealing, acquiring, and deploying digital assets for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Kim regime,” the agency stated.

“Treasury will continue to monitor closely any transactions that may benefit malicious cyber actors or the DPRK, and U.S. persons should exercise caution before engaging in transactions that present such risks.”

Although the lifted sanction appears to be good news for financial privacy software developers, it is too early to tell what this means for the Bitcoin and crypto industry in general, or whether it will have an effect on upcoming court cases like those against the Samurai Wallet developers.

“Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “Securing the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors is essential to establishing U.S. leadership and ensuring that the American people can benefit from financial innovation and inclusion.”</p></b>

The United States Treasury announced Friday that it has delisted Ethereum coin mixing service Tornado Cash from its list of parties sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, reversing course after first blacklisting the service in 2022.

"Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury," the Treasury said Friday.

But the Treasury Department is actually tardy in its sanctions reversal.

In November, a fifth circuit judge ruled that the Treasury Dept. had overstepped its authority by targeting Tornado Cash’s smart contracts. The judge wrote that autonomous software cannot be classified as property and therefore cannot be sanctioned.

After the judge’s ruling, Department of Justice prosecutors asked that the Treasury be granted a 60-day delay. That pushed OFAC’s deadline to March 17.

Coinbase backed the lawsuit, arguing that the sanctioning of Tornado Cash was unjust. And Paul Grewal, the crypto exchange’s chief legal officer, has had a lot to say about the delays.

If you're a little frustrated, I'm more than a little frustrated. OFAC continues to list Tornado Cash on its sanctions list and prevent U.S. persons from using it. That’s even though the Fifth Circuit has clearly held that OFAC did not have the power to impose these sanctions.… https://t.co/TkUizyVRJH — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 10, 2025

There’s also a pending money laundering trial against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, who was arrested in 2023. In November, after the ruling that the Tornado Cash sanctions were an overreach, a U.S. district court judge struck down Storm’s motion to have his case dismissed.

The Treasury Dept. initially sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, saying in a statement at the time that it had been used “to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019.”

In Friday’s statement, the Treasury said that it continues to be concerned about money laundering, particularly from North Korea—whose malicious hacking groups have stolen billions from various crypto protocols and companies. But the department is trying to balance maintaining vigilance without stamping out innovation in the process.

“Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, in a statement. “Securing the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors is essential to establishing U.S. leadership and ensuring that the American people can benefit from financial innovation and inclusion.”

It’s worth noting that despite the U.S. sanctions and lawsuits, Tornado Cash was never actually disabled—much to the chagrin of lawamkers. In fact, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin very publicly declared that he had used it to privately make donations to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.

Not only is it officially spring, it's also Friday — could our cups possibly runneth over anymore? Actually, you're gonna need a bigger mug, because get this: In just a few days (March 25, to be precise), Amazon's Big Spring Sale officially kicks off and runs through the end of the month. Well, that's the official timeline, but I'm already seeing markdowns of up to 75% on everything from bedding and tech gear to kitchenware, beauty finds and spring style staples. Looks like the mega-retailer decided to treat us early birds to a little price-drop preview, and I'm not complaining about it. Let's get that worm!

Top early Amazon Big Spring Sale deals

Among the hits? A Stanley tumbler and Ina Garten's go-to knives are down to record-low prices as we speak. My advice? Scoop 'em up before they sell out, because they're not likely to dip lower than they are now. I also spotted the countertop pizza oven my parents can't stop talking about (it's also down to an all-time low), as well as a Dyson cordless stick vacuum on rare sale (just in time for spring cleaning). On the fashion front, a classic Hanes zip-up hoodie can be yours for just $16, and not one, but two pairs of Kyle Richards-approved sunnies are a mere $6.

Now, before we jump into the rest of the best early Amazon Big Spring Sale deals, I also need to make you aware of an insane Disney+ and Hulu bundle bargain: From now until March 30, you can get a Disney+, Hulu Bundle Basic subscription for just $2.99 per month for four months (after which, you'll be charged the regular price of $10.99 per month). That's a 72% savings! Just note that this offer only applies to new and eligible returning customers.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, upsized its recently announced Strife perpetual stock offering to $723 million, after having initially priced it at $500 million when it was announced on Tuesday.

Dubbed Strife, the company’s latest offering pays a fixed rate of 10% while featuring a public offering price of $85 per share, the company said in a press release.

The total offering translates to 8.5 million shares of Strategy’s so-called “preferred strife perpetual stock.”

The company expects its sale of preferred stock to settle on March 25. Of course, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm said it plans to use $711 million in proceeds to purchase more Bitcoin—padding its stash of 499,226 BTC currently valued at around $41.4 billion.

Instead of being able to convert Strife into common shares, as several of the company's past offerings allow, the product is set to receive quarterly dividends solely in cash.

Dividend payments would begin in June. That means Strategy would be on the hook to pay Strife investors as much as $71 million in roughly 100 days.

However, based on Strife’s terms, the company is also able to delay dividend payments. If that happens, those dividends can be compounded per quarter missed by up to 18%, Strategy said.

The 10% fixed rate is based on the shares’ stated amount of $100, as reflected in the company’s initial announcement for Strife on Tuesday, the company added.

Strategy purchased billions of dollars of Bitcoin last year by selling stock and convertible debt, which pays 0% interest. Analysts say that as Bitcoin’s price has fallen, it has become notably more difficult for the company to raise capital as cheaply to buy the asset.

Strategy’s stock price dropped on Friday, showing a 2.5% decline to $295 not long after the opening bell, according to Nasdaq. The company’s stock price has fallen around 2% over the past month, but is still changing hands for 84% more than it did a year ago.

                <p>The world of cryptocurrency is in a constant state of flux, with new projects emerging around the globe, each claiming to be the next big thing. Among this plethora of innovation, NexChain stands out as a compelling option for savvy investors seeking early-stage crypto investment opportunities. With its focus on artificial intelligence, game-changing tokenomics, and a robust technological foundation, NexChain is being hailed as one of the most promising crypto startups to watch.

In positioning itself as a revolutionary blockchain platform, NexChain operates at the intersection of AI and blockchain technology. This integration not only enhances transaction efficiency but also opens doors for a myriad of applications that traditional cryptocurrencies fail to offer. In this article, we will explore why NexChain deserves your attention and investment as it embarks on its ambitious journey toward reshaping the crypto landscape.

Understanding the Vision Behind NexChain

NexChain is built on the principle that innovation should serve humanity’s needs while ensuring security and transparency. The founders of NexChain understand that the future of finance is not just about digital transactions; it’s about utilizing technology to create a more equitable economic landscape. By employing AI to enhance blockchain capabilities, NexChain aims to solve some of the most pressing challenges in the crypto space, including scalability, speed, and security.

The Role of AI in Enhancing Blockchain

One of the standout features of NexChain is its integration of artificial intelligence to revolutionize how transactions are conducted and managed. AI algorithms are employed to analyze transaction patterns, helping to flag irregularities and enhance security. This proactive approach to security is vital in an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated.

Moreover, AI also enables NexChain to facilitate smart contracts that are self-executing based on real-time data. This allows for greater automation and efficiency, reducing the need for intermediaries in various business transactions. With these features, NexChain is positioning itself as a not just another blockchain service but as a comprehensive ecosystem that can serve a wide range of industries—from finance to supply chain management.

A Structurally Sound Tokenomics Model

The NexChain presale tokenomics is designed to reward early investors while setting the stage for sustainable growth. The initial token offering provides an enticing opportunity for those interested in early-stage crypto investment. Key aspects of NexChain’s tokenomics include:

Low Entry Barrier: Investors who participate in the presale can acquire tokens at a significantly lower price, setting the foundation for substantial returns once the platform gains traction. Incentives for Holding Tokens: NexChain offers staking rewards for those who choose to hold their tokens, creating a community of vested stakeholders who are keen on the platform’s success. Decentralized Governance: Token holders have a voice in the project’s development, with voting rights that empower them to influence the direction of the platform. This democratized approach aligns incentives across the community and encourages sustained investment.

Long-term Utility and Value

Tokens within the NexChain ecosystem will serve multiple functions, from transaction fees to unlocking premium AI features. This intrinsic utility will help to create consistent demand, making it more than just a speculative investment; it’s a potential cornerstone in the future of smart transactions.

The Competitive Landscape: How NexChain Stands Out

In an arena crowded with promising platforms, NexChain rises above its competitors through its distinct advantages. Consider the following when comparing NexChain with other blockchain projects:

Polkadot: While Polkadot’s primary focus is interoperability between different blockchains, it lacks the depth of AI integration and automated smart contracts that NexChain offers, which can limit its utility in fast-paced business environments.

Solana: Renowned for its speed and low transaction costs, Solana faces ongoing challenges related to decentralization and network reliability. In contrast, NexChain addresses both speed and security by leveraging AI to monitor network health and performance, ensuring scalability without sacrificing decentralization.

Ultimately, NexChain is positioned to capitalize on the strengths of existing platforms while mitigating their weaknesses. This will not only attract users but also create new use cases previously deemed impractical in traditional blockchain systems.

Investment Timing: Why Now is the Right Moment

For investors contemplating early-stage crypto investment, timing can be crucial. Getting in early on promising startups allows for potentially higher returns when the project gains traction in the market. Several factors make NexChain an attractive option right now:

Tech Accelerators and Partnerships: NexChain has begun forming strategic partnerships within the tech space, which bodes well for market presence. Collaborations with established companies can help facilitate product updates, ensuring the platform remains competitive. Regulatory Guidance: With the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulations worldwide, NexChain is designed to adhere to compliance standards, preparing it for sustainable growth and broader acceptance. Community Support: The growing community around NexChain, fueled by its transparent communication and strong governance model, indicates strong grassroots support that’s essential for long-term success.

Conclusion: The Future Awaits

As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, NexChain emerges as a beacon of innovation and potential investment value. With its unique integration of AI technology, robust tokenomics, and strong community governance, NexChain stands to be one of the most promising crypto startups of this generation.

For those considering an early-stage crypto investment, NexChain represents not just a speculative asset but a potential pillar of future decentralized ecosystems. Investing in NexChain now may offer early adopters a seat at the table as the project unfolds and matures, providing access to the myriad possibilities that lie ahead.

In an industry characterized by volatility and uncertainty, few projects offer the same level of promise and purpose as NexChain. As you look to diversify your investment portfolio, keep a close eye on NexChain; it just might be the ticket to your next significant investment success.

Victoria, Seychelles, March 21, 2025 – MEXC, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a strategic partnership with pump.fun, the world’s leading crypto token launchpad where anyone can create their own token for free. This collaboration aims to enhance the trading experience on MEXC’s DEX+ platform and explore further synergies between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The first step in this partnership will be the integration with pump.fun’s new DEX, PumpSwap.

MEXC has recently launched its innovative hybrid product, DEX+ , offering a seamless, one-stop solution for both on-chain and off-chain trading. This unique platform enables users to trade directly on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) through the MEXC App and website, providing access to a diverse array of on-chain assets. The initial version of DEX+ will support the Solana ecosystem, giving users the ability to trade over 10,000 tokens available on Raydium and pump.fun. Future updates will expand to include additional DEXs and blockchain networks, broadening the platform’s reach and liquidity.

MEXC DEX+ simplifies the complexities of DEX by enabling users to trade various on-chain assets within the Solana ecosystem directly through a familiar CEX interface. This eliminates the need to manually hurdle through multi-step interactions, such as switching wallets or cross-chain transactions.

Through this strategic partnership with pump.fun , MEXC aims to provide a streamlined, accessible experience for the potential onchain assets, further solidifying its commitment to innovative solutions within the crypto space.

MEXC DEX+ users gain unique access to trade newly launched tokens on pump.fun at an early stage. DEX+ allows users to participate in trading as soon as a meme coin is issued, even before it is listed on CEX, enabling them to capitalize on market opportunities from the outset. By leveraging pump.fun’s robust capabilities in launching meme coins, this model significantly lowers the entry barrier for users seeking to enter the Web3 trading space.

“MEXC is committed to offering a broad spectrum of accessible assets through our listing strategy while ensuring fast listing speeds and top-tier security for our users. With DEX+, we aim to address key challenges by providing a familiar, CEX-like trading experience while retaining the benefits of accessing on-chain assets. We are thrilled to partner with pump.fun to empower users to discover and support meme coins in this rapidly evolving investment space. This collaboration underscores our dedication to fostering innovation and providing new opportunities for our users in the ever-evolving crypto landscape,” said Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC.

“pump.fun democratized token creation, standardized token contracts, and brought crypto to the people. pump.fun’s partnership with MEXC will give DEX+ users a powerful tool to access the coins they want to trade—long before they’re available on a centralized exchange. pump.fun is building crypto’s largest social network, and bridging communities across crypto through partnerships like this with MEXC is how that foundation is built,” said Alon Cohen, Co-Founder pump.fun.

Looking ahead, MEXC’s DEX+ is positioned to be a transformative force in the evolution and mass adoption of DeFi and DEX ecosystems, with its strategic partnership with pump.fun marking a crucial first step in this journey. As user adoption of decentralized trading accelerates, the seamless integration of centralized and decentralized exchange models becomes essential, and MEXC stands at the forefront of this convergence, systematically expanding our ecosystem partnerships to deliver increasingly sophisticated, secure, and user-centric trading experiences that will define the next generation of crypto trading.

To celebrate the successful launch of DEX+ and its strategic partnership with pump.fun, MEXC is pleased to announce its incentive program: new users completing trades of 100 USDT or more on the DEX+ platform will be eligible to receive a 20 USDT reward.

Bitcoin, along with most top coins, has taken a dip as investors brace for a "triple witching" dose of market volatility.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin's price has shed 2.4% since yesterday, slipping below $84,000. The Ethereum price followed it, also dropping 2.4% to trade for $1,948.93, according to CoinGecko data.

ETH hasn't been this low since November 2023, right before a Bitcoin rally helped it climb out of a months-long trough and back above $2,000.

The XRP price has dropped by 5.2% since yesterday. Earlier this week, XRP saw a huge surge after Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the SEC will soon drop its lawsuit against the company—though the regulator has yet to file paperwork to do so, and declined to comment on the matter when asked by Decrypt.

What is triple witching?

Triple witching describes the simultaneous expiry of stock index futures, stock index options, and stock options in traditional markets. Today marks the first of four such events in 2025.

They always occur on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. They're known to set off heightened volatility as traders rush to adjust and close positions before contracts settle at the end of the day.

In rare events, it coincides with the expiry of single-stock futures and creates a quadruple witching day. But investors are being spared that level of tumult today.

Today's “triple-witching” will see about $4.5 trillion worth of contracts tied to stocks, indexes and exchange-traded funds expire, according to estimates from Citigroup analysts.

As a measure of traditional market unrest, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, has already risen to 5.6% since yesterday's close. Although, to be fair, the VIX's current 20.78 rating is well below the spike to 29.07 seen at the start of last week amid roiling global trade issues.

As for crypto markets, Glassnode analysts noted in a recent report that the Bitcoin options market shows traders are increasingly looking to mitigate the risk of BTC taking a dive.

"The Volatility Smile shows that puts are trading at a higher premium than calls, signaling risk-averse positioning as investors hedge against further downside"

Zooming out, CryptoQuant noted in a recent weekly report that its Bitcoin Bull Score has dropped to a 2-year low.

"Bitcoin’s down 23% from its peak, and history shows strong rallies only happen when the score is above 60," the analysts wrote. "Extended low scores often come with bear markets."

Among users of decentralized prediction market MYRIAD (launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN), optimism around Bitcoin's price appears to have slipped, with just over 60% now expecting Bitcoin to hold above $83,000 by the end of the week, down from over 75% on Thursday. Around 57% of MYRIAD users also expect the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, a measure of sentiment, to remain below 36 by March 25.

Ethereum real-world asset platform Zoth has suffered an attack that resulted in the loss of $8.85 million. Security experts believe the hack, the second suffered by the company in a month, came about as the result of a private key leak.

On Friday morning, a Zoth proxy contract was upgraded by what security firm Cyvers called a "suspicious address.” Soon thereafter, $8.85 million worth of stablecoin USD0++ was transferred out of the proxy contract into the attackers wallet before all funds were swapped into DAI and moved to another address. The attacker later swapped the stolen funds for 4,223 ETH ($8,300,800).

"Our team is actively investigating the situation alongside our security partners,” a spokesperson for Zoth told Decrypt. “We want to assure you that we are taking every necessary measure to mitigate the impact and resolve the issue.”

Security Notice Our system has experienced a security breach. We’re actively investigating the incident and taking all necessary steps to resolve it as swiftly as possible. We are working closely with our partners to mitigate the impact and fully resolve the issue. A detailed… — ZOTH (@zothdotio) March 21, 2025

A proxy contract is a smart contract that, among other things, forwards calls and funds to other contracts called implementation contracts to facilitate the smooth operation of business—this is very common in the world of DeFi.

In this exploit, it appears the attacker gained access to the private key for the proxy contract which enabled them to update it, changing the implementation contract address to their own wallet. This then allowed for all of the funds from inside the proxy contract to be sent directly to the attacker.

“This type of attack typically occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to the private keys controlling a wallet or smart contract, allowing them to transfer funds out of the system,” a spokesperson for PeckShield told Decrypt.

“The attacker gained admin access, likely through a leaked key or exploit,” according to Hakan Unal, Senior Blockchain Scientist at Cyvers. He added that it is likely that Zoth has multiple proxy contracts, such as this contract holding $12.28 million USYC—meaning more funds could also be at risk if they share the same admin access.

Zoth did not comment on how the contract’s private key fell into the hands of the attacker, but told Decrypt that it will release an update once it has finished its investigation.

Cyvers suggested that setting up real-time monitoring that alerted the company when admin roles or contract upgrades were made could have helped prevent this attack.

This appears to be the second hack to hit the DeFi project in the space of a month, after the project lost $285,000 as the result of a March 6 attack. This came about as a result of an exploit in a liquidity pool that allowed the attacker to mint ZeUSD without depositing sufficient collateral, according to smart contract auditing firm Solidity Scan.

Zoth did not respond to Decrypt’s request for comment on this second attack.</p></b>

                <p>Singapore, March 21, 2025 — Mira, the pioneer in decentralized AI verification technology, announces unprecedented growth with 2.5 million users and two billion tokens processed daily across its ecosystem applications.

The milestone demonstrates growing market demand for AI that can operate autonomously without human oversight. Processing two billion tokens daily is equivalent to approximately half of Wikipedia’s content, generating 7.9 million images, or processing over 2,100 hours of video content per day.

“This growth confirms we’re addressing the critical barrier to AI’s transformative potential,” said Karan Sirdesai, Co-founder and CEO of Mira. “Today’s AI remains constrained by the need for human verification—we’re removing that bottleneck to enable truly autonomous intelligence capable of operating independently in high-stakes scenarios.”

Enabling the Shift from ‘Baby AI’ to Autonomous Intelligence

Current AI systems excel at generating content and solving problems, but their probabilistic nature makes them fundamentally unreliable. This creates a paradox: the more powerful AI becomes, the more human hours are required to verify its output, severely limiting AI’s potential.

Mira is addressing this challenge through decentralized verification that enables AI systems to operate autonomously in consequential domains. By transforming the verification process from a human bottleneck to a scalable, trustless system, Mira is paving the way for AI’s next evolutionary leap.

Applications Demonstrating the Vision

This vision is coming to life through several applications built on Mira’s verification infrastructure:

Klok — A multi-LLM chat application providing access to leading AI models including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.3 70B Instruct within a unified interface. Klok treats each AI model as a trustless independent node, with verification features set to roll out in coming weeks.

WikiSentry — An AI agent that autonomously fact-checks Wikipedia articles against verified sources, identifying hallucinations, biases, and misinformation—a task previously requiring extensive human oversight.

Astro — A guidance platform helping users navigate life’s important decisions through personalized, AI-powered insights that leverage verified information for reliable advice.

Amor — A supportive AI companion offering conversation and emotional connection for those seeking meaningful interaction, with verification ensuring consistent and trustworthy responses.

Public Testnet Enables Developer Innovation

Mira has today launched its Public Testnet, enabling developers, enterprises, and users to explore its blockchain-based verification network at explorer.mira.network, where all AI inferences are recorded as transparent, verifiable events. Read more here.

Strategic Partnerships Expanding the Ecosystem

Mira has integrated with leading agent frameworks including Eliza, SendAI, Arc, ZerePy, and FereAI, while establishing partnerships with blockchain networks like Monad and Plume Network. Infrastructure collaborations with io.net, Aethir, Hyperbolic, Exabits, and Spheron, along with industry partnerships with KernelDAO and Delphi Digital, further strengthen Mira’s ecosystem.

Backed by $9 million in funding from Framework, Accel, Mechanism, and Bitkraft, with angel investors including Balaji Srinivasan and Sandeep Nailwal, Mira is positioned to transform how AI systems operate at scale.

About Mira

Mira is building the foundational verification layer that enables trustless AI systems through advanced consensus mechanisms. The network combines sophisticated claim transformation and distributed verification protocols to achieve reliable AI execution at scale. By solving the fundamental challenge of error rates in AI, Mira is establishing new standards for reliability—paving the way for autonomous intelligence that can operate without human oversight, unlocking AI’s transformative potential across society.

A former sound engineer for Grammy Award-winning rapper Marshall Mathers—popularly known as Eminem—has been charged with selling the musician’s unreleased songs for $50,000 in Bitcoin.

Joseph Strange, 46, of Holly, Michigan, is accused of selling at least 25 tracks that Eminem recorded between 1999 and 2018, which were still in development and never meant for public release, as per a statement released by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern Office of Michigan.

The federal charges include criminal copyright infringement and interstate transportation of stolen goods, as the tracks were leaked online without Eminem's consent.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s probe was triggered by tips from Eminem's studio employees, who saw the stolen music posted online on platforms including Reddit and YouTube, as per an affidavit filed by the agency on Wednesday.

Former Employee of Marshall Mathers, AKA Eminem, Charged with Criminal Infringement of a Copyright and Interstate Transportation of Stolen Goods https://t.co/jOxw2dO0F5 @FBIDetroit — U.S. Attorney EDMI (@USAO_MIE) March 19, 2025

On January 28, in a search of Strange’s home in Holly, FBI agents found hard drives containing copies of the stolen music, as well as handwritten lyric sheets by Eminem and a VHS tape containing an unreleased Eminem music video.

If convicted, Strange faces up to 10 years in prison for interstate transportation of stolen goods and up to five years for criminal copyright infringement. He could also face a fine of up to $250,000.

Strange, who worked at the studio from 2007 to 2021, was one of the four employees who had direct access to the hard drives, and authorities allege he took advantage of this access to steal the music, the affidavit noted.

Notably, one of the other individuals with access was Mike Strange, Joseph's uncle, who continues to work at Eminem's studio as an engineer.

The agents also found financial records documenting payments for the music Joseph Strange is accused of having sold, linking him to the transactions.

According to the FBI, Strange sold the tracks to a 31-year-old man from Ontario, Canada, known as “Doja Rat,” for $50,000 in Bitcoin.

Doja Rat later told the FBI that he raised the funds with the help of a group of Eminem fans.

The Canadian man also revealed that Strange claimed to possess more than 300 unreleased tracks and handwritten lyric sheets created by Eminem.

"The significant damage caused by a trusted employee to Eminem's artistic legacy and creative integrity cannot be overstated, let alone the enormous financial losses incurred by the many creators and collaborators that deserve protection for their decades of work," Eminem's representative said in a statement to The Detroit Free Press.

Eminem’s music has been leaked without his permission a number of times in the past, with unauthorized tracks appearing online in the early 2000s and 2010s. In 2002, a leak of “The Eminem Show” led to the album’s release date being moved up to prevent further piracy.</p></b>

                <p>Leading memecoin launchpad Pump.fun said Thursday it is launching PumpSwap, a new decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to to make token migrations instant and free.

The platform will implement creator revenue sharing, which will redistribute a portion of protocol revenue to token creators. Given how popular memecoin trading is, the platform is likely to attract users.

The goal behind PumpSwap’s creation is to increase liquidity for traded coins, making them easier to buy and sell, thus improving users’ trading experience. Pump.fun stated that its original goal was to build “the most frictionless environment for trading coins.”

More Ways To Trade!

With PumpSwap, the team expects to solve the “major point of friction” that slows “a coin’s momentum.” Pump.fun stated that it operates similarly to popular platforms Raydium V4 and Uniswap V2, using an automated market maker (AMM) with a constant product formula.

Introducing PumpSwap, Pump’s new native DEX beginning NOW all coins that complete their bonding curve will migrate directly to PumpSwap PumpSwap enables

– 0 migration fees (down from 6 SOL)

Coins completing their bonding curve, which is a mechanism to manage token pricing and liquidity on Pump.fun, will automatically migrate to PumpSwap, removing the previous delays and the 6 SOL migration fee. This feature is expected to boost trading momentum and user satisfaction.

Each trade on PumpSwap carries a 0.25% fee, which will be split between liquidity providers (0.20%) and the protocol (0.05%), Pump.fun stated. However, the distribution is subject to change as Pump.fun plans to implement a revenue-sharing model in the future.

The team stated that a feature—where a portion of protocol revenue is distributed to coin creators—will be deployed soon, aimed at incentivizing robust community development and high-quality project launches.

“If it succeeds, millions of dollars will go towards aligning creators with their communities and incentivizing higher quality launches,” Pump.fun noted.

On the security side, Pump.fun said that PumpSwap has completed nine security audits from partners including Pashov Group, OSEC, Blockpain, and Sec3. The exchange allows users to create liquidity pools at no cost, add to existing pools, and trade tokens from verified partners, including projects newly bridged to Solana.

PumpSwap is not limited to meme coins; it also features verified partner tokens, some of which are making their Solana debut, including Tron’s TRX, Frax Finance’s FXS and frxUSD, Ethena’s USDe, Aptos’ APT, Plume Network’s PLUME, and Sei Network’s SEI.

Pump.fun Faces Competition from Raydium

The launch of PumpSwap comes after Raydium introduced LaunchLab, its own meme coin launchpad that adopts a similar bonding curve to Pump.fun.

Raydium’s platform will allow third-party interfaces to set fees, support multiple quote tokens, and integrate with Raydium’s liquidity provider locker to ensure fee security.

The separate developments of Pump.fun and Raydium raise questions about their relationship as it appears to have weakened since Pump.fun was rumored to start testing its own AMM earlier this year.

If Pump.fun fully transitions to its own AMM, it could reduce its reliance on Raydium, retaining liquidity and fees within its ecosystem, which has already impacted Raydium’s revenue and token value.

Pump.fun and Raydium initially had a strong, symbiotic relationship. Pump.fun relied on Raydium to provide liquidity for tokens launched on its platform, transferring tokens to Raydium’s trading pools once they reached a $69,000 market cap.

Before Raydium’s LaunchLab, a number of memecoin launchpads had been launched to compete with Pump.fun.

Some successes were achieved, such as Moonshot, which gained popularity after Trump launched his official meme token. The platform once joined the top 10 finance app on on the U.S. Apple App Store following TRUMP launch.

Nevertheless, these platforms lose traction as the memecoin market dries up. Even Pump.fun, the major launchpad for meme coins, faces challenges

Dune Analytics data shows that Pump.fun’s graduation rate, which measures the number of tokens that successfully move from the incubation phase to full transactability, has been below 1% for over a month.</p></b>

                <p>A few weeks ago, we briefly touched on how civil asset forfeiture may apply to Bitcoin, a process in which the Government may seize citizen’s assets without accusing a person of a crime. With the US Government stating that civil asset forfeiture will form a key pillar in building its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act of 2023, also known as the FAIR Act, is arguably the most important Bill introduced in Congress today to protect Bitcoin holders from extensive Government overreach. Without it, many may see their bitcoin seized and forfeited on behalf of the Reserve with little to no recourse.

Civil asset forfeiture has long been argued to be in need of drastic reform. Across the country, states have become known to abuse the process to enrich their own law enforcement agencies, which may appropriate the funds collected. From police seizing a Vietnam veteran’s van for serving as a “container” for marijuana, or attempting to appropriate a man’s life savings over a seat belt violation, civil asset forfeiture is “one of the gravest abuses of power in the country today,” according to the Institute for Justice.

Civil asset forfeiture is particularly problematic as the process creates a financial incentive for law enforcement to forfeit citizen’s property to the Government without due process, as stated by the ACLU. Especially in light of bitcoin’s scarcity and its consequent value appreciation over time, this financial incentive is only exacerbated when civil asset forfeiture is applied to build the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

To protect citizens from civil asset forfeiture abuse, the FAIR Act of 2023, which was reintroduced in 2024 co-sponsored by Sen. Lummis, among others, aims to revise the federal laws that govern the process to ensure that civil asset forfeiture proceedings follow due process as governed by the Fifth Amendment.

First, it does so by raising the evidentiary standard from “preponderance” of evidence – meaning that a party’s claim is rather true than not – to clear and convincing evidence, increasing the burden of proof the Government has to provide to enforce a forfeiture.

With the FAIR Act, enforcing agencies have to establish that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense as well as that the owner of any interest in the seized property used the property with intent to facilitate the offense, or knowingly consented or was willfully blind to the use of the property by another in connection with the offense. This forms the most important aspect of the Act as it applies to bitcoin.

At the moment, the Government could seize a person’s legally acquired bitcoin if the UTXO itself had, for example, previously been used in sanctions evasion or touched a darknet market; regardless of whether its owner was aware of the coin’s history when obtaining it. By introducing active consent and willful blindness, the FAIR Act prerequisites that the owner of bitcoin to be forfeited was aware of the acquired BTC’s origins for forfeiture to apply.

The FAIR Act also requires the Government to appoint a counsel to property owners who are financially unable to obtain representation, or if the cost of obtaining representation would exceed the value of the seized property – an issue that has arguably kept many from contesting the forfeiture of assets in the first place, as civil asset forfeiture effectively reverses the burden of proof. At the moment to get your property back you need to prove the Government wrong instead of the Government having to make a case against you.

“Civil asset forfeiture allows federal law enforcement to seize the property of Americans who haven’t even been charged with or convicted of a crime,” said Sen. Booker, who introduced the Bill together with Sen. Rand Paul. “Under this system, police can keep cash, cars, and even homes based on mere suspicion of a crime. These losses often become law enforcement’s profit because the burden is on the property owner to prove they should get their property back.”

“The government should never have the power to seize a person’s property without due process. Yet, under current civil asset forfeiture laws, Americans are being stripped of their property without ever being charged or convicted of a crime. The FAIR Act directly addresses these injustices and is a critical step toward restoring fairness and accountability, protecting property owners’ rights, and curbing the weaponization of civil forfeiture laws once and for all,” Paul added to the statement.

If you are rooting for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the passing of the FAIR Act should be a prerequisite for its establishment to ensure that the Government’s bitcoin stack is not built on the abuse of its powers.

The SEC has declared that proof-of-work crypto mining does not violate U.S. securities law

This ruling specifically benefits Bitcoin and Dogecoin, two major cryptocurrencies that use proof-of-work

The SEC stated mining operations do not need to register as securities because rewards aren’t derived from third-party managerial efforts

This marks a shift from the previous administration’s approach, which had targeted proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum

The Trump administration’s SEC has established a crypto task force led by Hester Peirce and is moving away from “regulation by enforcement”

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Thursday that proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining does not fall under U.S. securities law. This decision brings clarity to miners of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies who now know their operations don’t require securities registration.

The guidance specifically addresses mining activities on public, permissionless blockchain networks. The SEC explained that miners are simply “engaging in an administrative or ministerial activity to secure the network” when they add computational resources.

This ruling marks a key distinction in how different consensus mechanisms are treated by regulators. While proof-of-work mining has been cleared, proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum and Solana have previously been flagged by regulators.

Under the previous administration, the SEC had suggested proof-of-stake systems could satisfy the Howey test. This test determines if an asset qualifies as a security based on investment of money with profit expectations from others’ efforts.

The new guidance centers on the source of rewards for participants. According to the SEC, proof-of-work mining doesn’t constitute a security because miners’ “expectation to receive rewards is not derived from any third party’s managerial or entrepreneurial efforts.”

Trump’s SEC Shifts Course on Crypto Mining

Bitcoin and Dogecoin stand to benefit most from this ruling. These cryptocurrencies are the two largest proof-of-work coins by market capitalization, both ranking in the top 10 overall.

Proof-of-work mining involves computers competing to solve complex mathematical problems. This process secures the network while processing transactions on the blockchain.

Bitcoin mining has evolved into a major industrial operation. Large facilities with specialized equipment now dominate the mining landscape, though some still attempt to mine independently.

The SEC’s announcement continues a trend of regulatory clarity under the new administration. Since President Donald Trump took office, the SEC has established a crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce.

Peirce, often called “Crypto Mom” for her supportive stance on digital assets, has been critical of the previous administration’s approach. In February, she wrote that it would take time to correct what she described as a regulatory “mess.”

The SEC under Trump has moved away from what some called “regulation by enforcement.” The regulator has dropped several lawsuits and investigations against crypto companies that had been initiated under former Chair Gary Gensler.

This shift aligns with Trump’s stated goal to make America a “Bitcoin superpower” and the “world’s blockchain and crypto capital.” His administration has created the Council of Advisers on Digital Assets to develop regulations for the industry.

Additional crypto-friendly legislation may be on the horizon. The Blockchain Association has indicated that a cryptocurrency market structure bill could be ready by summer, while a comprehensive stablecoin bill might reach the president’s desk within months.

This regulatory clarity comes as Bitcoin trades near $84,000, having recently broken a four-month downtrend. The market appears poised to benefit from what industry insiders describe as a “pro-crypto policy tailwind” under the current administration.</p></b>

Ethereum software firm Consensys has pushed back against a proposed rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that could drastically change how unhosted blockchain wallets such as MetaMask are regulated. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)

Introduced in January, the proposed interpretive rule sought to regulate unhosted wallets under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA), holding developers accountable for fraudulent or unauthorized transactions and enforcing traditional financial institution regulations on decentralized wallets.

In a short comment sent to Scott Bessent, Acting Director of the CFPB, Consensys called the rule a “radical departure from current law” and that the regulatory regime would be detrimental to both “blockchain developers and users.”

“It is our view that this proposal is clearly improper as a matter of substantive law, public policy, and administrative procedure,” the letter said about the rule, which was proposed just before Joe Biden’s departure from office.

Describing the proposed rule as “industry-redefining,” Bill Hughes, Senior Counsel & Director of Global Regulatory Matters at Consensys, warned that its implementation would cause “unparalleled damage” to U.S.-based blockchain developers.

Today, @Consensys submitted a short comment in response to the CFPB's proposed interpretive rule that unhosted wallets like @MetaMask are actually regulated under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) and CFPB's Regulation E. It is our view that this proposal, described in… https://t.co/JABqXCcVkL pic.twitter.com/PmrTjINwZW — Bill Hughes : wchughes.eth 🦊 (@BillHughesDC) March 20, 2025

“Bending ourselves into a pretzel to apply the EFTA to unhosted wallets is bad policy because it would put wallets in an impossible bind,” he said.

He also criticized the rule for bypassing proper legislative procedures, saying how implementing such changes through an interpretive rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act—a move Hughes claimed courts would likely oppose.

Consensys fully expects the CFPB, now under the leadership of President Trump’s treasury pick Scott Bessent, to either withdraw this interpretive rule from its agenda or revise it to exclude the crypto sector.

“When that happens, we will applaud the agency for doing the right thing both legally and policy-wise,” Hughes tweeted.

Trump’s crypto agenda

Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly showcased his commitment to crypto with key moves, from unveiling plans for a Bitcoin reserve to creating a crypto task force with pro-crypto leaders.

The 47th U.S. President has vowed to make America the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower,” marking a departure from the previous administration’s regulatory stance on crypto.

The CFPB, an agency proposed in 2007 by crypto-skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren while she was a Harvard law school professor, has been closely associated with stricter consumer protections.

While former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra defended the controversial rule as a measure to protect consumers, many—including Hughes—saw it as an overreach.

Consensys has also directed the CFPB to a comment letter from the Blockchain Association, of which it is a member, and the DeFi Education Fund, with Hughes emphasizing that the platform fully endorses the upcoming letter which addresses the concerns with the rule.</p></b>

ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane emphasized the need for a digital euro to counter the influence of dollar-based stablecoins and reduce dependence on US payment companies

The digital euro is seen as essential for Europe’s monetary and financial autonomy amid increasing geopolitical fragmentation

According to ECB data, US firms process 65% of euro area card payments, creating vulnerability in Europe’s financial infrastructure

This is the third time in 2025 that ECB officials have urged adoption of a digital euro

The ECB has been developing the digital euro project since 2021 and is expected to conclude a preparatory phase by October

European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Economist Philip Lane has once again called for the creation of a digital euro. He stressed its importance in reducing Europe’s reliance on US payment firms and limiting the influence of dollar-based stablecoins.

Lane made these comments at a conference in Cork, Ireland on March 20. He said the digital euro central bank digital currency (CBDC) is key to keeping Europe’s monetary and financial systems independent.

The ECB economist pointed out that a digital euro would “limit the likelihood of foreign-currency stablecoins gaining a foothold as a medium of exchange in the euro area.” This comes as European interest in stablecoins continues to grow rapidly.

Currently, the stablecoin market is mostly tied to the US dollar. In fact, the US Dollar backs 99% of stablecoins in circulation today.

Lane also highlighted Europe’s heavy dependence on American payment providers. These include companies like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

According to ECB data, these US firms process 65% of all euro area card payments. Some EU countries have even completely replaced their national payment systems with these international alternatives.

Europe’s Payment Landscape at a Crossroads

This situation creates a weakness in Europe’s financial structure. It gives foreign companies control over critical parts of Europe’s payment infrastructure.

Lane argued that Europe “effectively outsources its payment infrastructure” by relying on international cards, apps, and stablecoins. This makes the region vulnerable to policy changes and regulatory actions from outside jurisdictions.

A digital euro could help address the fragmentation in Europe’s retail payments. It could serve as a unifying force for collaboration among banks and payment service providers across the region.

“The case for a central bank digital currency is especially strong for a monetary union, especially in the context of a fragmented and externally dependent payments system,” Lane added. He sees it as a way to strengthen Europe’s position in the global financial landscape.

The ECB has been working on the digital euro project since 2021. They are expected to finish a preparatory phase by October 2025.

This push for a digital euro comes amid broader global developments in digital currencies. China has been developing its digital yuan, while BRICS nations are pursuing their own CBDC initiatives.

Lane’s comments mark the third time this year that ECB officials have urged the adoption of a digital euro. Earlier in March, ECB President Christine Lagarde told lawmakers in Brussels that Europe must speed up progress on both retail and wholesale versions of the digital euro.

On March 17, ECB Governing Council member François Villeroy de Galhau expressed concerns about President Donald Trump’s push for crypto adoption. He warned that this could introduce financial instability.

In January, ECB board member Piero Cipollone called for an accelerated digital euro launch. This was in response to Trump’s executive order promoting dollar-backed stablecoins.

Cipollone warned that stablecoins pose a growing threat to traditional banking systems. He said they could erode bank revenues and client relationships if left unchecked.

The European Commission has already proposed draft legislation for the digital euro. This proposal is currently under review by the European Council and the European Parliament.

Lane warned that delays in launching a CBDC could leave Europe exposed to risks. This is particularly concerning as foreign stablecoins and non-European payment firms continue to expand their influence in the region.

The ECB believes that introducing a digital euro would provide a secure, widely accepted payment option under European control. This would reduce the region’s dependence on foreign payment providers and strengthen its financial sovereignty.</p></b>

South Korean prosecutors raided Bithumb’s headquarters on March 19 investigating potential corporate fund misuse

Former CEO Kim Dae-sik allegedly used a 3 billion won ($2.3 million) company lease deposit to purchase a personal apartment

Bithumb acknowledged the allegations, stating Kim took an external loan after the initial investigation and has repaid the funds

The raid comes amid Bithumb’s push toward an IPO planned for 2025

Separate allegations claim Bithumb and Upbit facilitated token listings through intermediaries charging projects between $2-10 million

South Korean prosecutors raided the headquarters of cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb on March 19. The search was part of an investigation into alleged corporate fund misuse by the company’s former CEO.

Authorities from the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office searched Bithumb’s offices in Yeoksam-dong. They are looking into claims that the exchange provided a 3 billion won ($2.3 million) lease deposit to its former CEO, Kim Dae-sik.

Investigators suspect Kim used these funds to buy a personal apartment in Seoul’s Seongsu-dong district. Kim currently serves as an advisor to the company after stepping down as CEO.

The initial investigation was conducted by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), South Korea’s financial regulator. The FSS later transferred the case to prosecutors for further action.

A Bithumb spokesperson has acknowledged some of the allegations in an interview with The Chosun Daily. The representative confirmed that Kim had taken a loan from an external lender following the FSS investigation.

The company also stated that Kim has since repaid the funds in full. Despite this repayment, prosecutors are continuing their investigation.

They are reviewing whether the original transaction broke financial regulations or corporate governance rules. This case has intensified scrutiny over Bithumb’s internal financial management practices.

Exchange Governance in Question

The raid comes at a challenging time for Bithumb. The exchange has been working toward a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO).

CEO Lee Jae-won recently reaffirmed the company’s plan to list on the stock market in 2025. The company has made structural changes to reduce legal risks connected to key shareholders.

In 2021, Bithumb faced another legal challenge. The former board of directors chairman, Lee Jeong-hoon, was indicted on alleged fraud charges.

However, South Korea’s Supreme Court later acquitted the Bithumb executive. This acquittal has allowed the exchange to move forward with its IPO plans.

Bithumb’s IPO plans date back to 2020 when local media first reported on them. The company chose an underwriter for its IPO in 2023, renewing interest in its stock market debut.

In 2024, Bithumb Korea set up a non-exchange business to speed up its plans to enter the stock market. However, this news came alongside reports of a 57% loss in annual revenue for the exchange operator in 2023.

Beyond the fund misuse allegations, Bithumb faces other controversies. There are separate claims that both Bithumb and rival exchange Upbit facilitated token listings through intermediaries.

According to researcher Wu Blockchain, some crypto projects paid between $2 million and $10 million to secure listings on the exchanges. The report suggests certain intermediaries had connections to Upbit shareholders and market makers.

These intermediary fees reportedly ranged from 3% to 5% of total token supplies. Upbit has denied these claims and demanded that Wu Blockchain provide evidence.

Upbit asked for “the list of digital asset projects that have paid the brokerage fees” and requested “specific evidence and data” to support the accusations. The exchange also requested more information about the alleged illegal brokerage activities.

The current investigation has raised concerns about broader governance issues within Bithumb. The exchange has faced repeated legal and regulatory scrutiny in recent years.

South Korean authorities continue to monitor the country’s crypto sector for potential misconduct. The outcome of this investigation could impact Bithumb’s IPO plans and its standing in the Korean cryptocurrency market.</p></b>

Trump administration plans to restructure USAID into US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) under State Department control

The reorganization includes implementing blockchain technology for aid distribution tracking

Thousands of USAID employees have been placed on administrative leave and many foreign aid contracts terminated

Experts question the necessity of blockchain, suggesting existing tools could accomplish the same goals

The plan aims to focus aid on global health, food security, disaster response, and countering China

The Trump administration has revealed plans for a major restructuring of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), including renaming it, placing it under direct State Department control, and implementing blockchain technology to track aid distribution.

According to an internal State Department memo reviewed by WIRED, USAID will be renamed as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA). This change comes as part of broader reforms targeting the 60-year-old agency.

The memo states that the reorganized agency will “leverage blockchain technology” in its procurement processes. “All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the document reads.

The technology implementation aims to encourage innovation among partners. It would also allow for more flexible programming focused on measurable impact rather than simply completing activities, according to the memo.

The document does not specify exactly how the blockchain technology would be used. It remains unclear whether the plan involves cryptocurrency transactions, stablecoins, or simply using blockchain as a ledger to track aid disbursement.

This announcement follows major disruptions at USAID. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, the State Department placed all agency staff on administrative leave and halted payments to numerous partner organizations worldwide.

The agency was an early target of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This initiative is effectively headed by Elon Musk, who has been exploring blockchain technology to enhance various US governmental processes.

Agency Workforce Reduction

Thousands of USAID employees were sent home globally. This action stopped nearly all foreign aid programs and created widespread uncertainty among staff and partner organizations.

Many contracts deemed nonessential were terminated. This included organizations providing what some described as lifesaving work in various regions around the world.

A federal judge has since issued a preliminary injunction against the dismantling of the agency. However, the memo suggests the administration plans to continue drastically cutting USAID and folding it into the State Department.

The plans for incorporating blockchain technology have caught many staffers off guard. Experts in the humanitarian sector express skepticism about the necessity of such technology for aid distribution.

Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, questioned the need for blockchain. “It feels like a fake technological solution for a problem that doesn’t exist,” she told WIRED.

Raftree added that she has never found an instance where blockchain offered advantages over existing tools. “I don’t think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldn’t use existing tools.”

Giulio Coppi, a senior humanitarian officer at Access Now, shared similar concerns. “There’s no proven advantage that it’s cheaper or better,” he said, describing the approach as “tech solutionist” without substantial real-world impact.

Despite these criticisms, there have been some examples of blockchain use in humanitarian work. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ran a small pilot providing cash assistance to displaced Ukrainians using stablecoins.

Other pilot programs have been tested in Kenya by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross also helped develop the Humanitarian Token Solution.

One unnamed representative from an NGO that uses blockchain technology noted that stablecoins can sometimes provide faster money transfers in disaster areas. However, they cautioned that “introducing new systems means you’re setting up a new burden” for smaller organizations.

The restructuring proposal suggests funding should be contingent on outcomes rather than inputs. “Tying payment to outcomes and results rather than inputs would ensure taxpayer dollars deliver maximum impact,” the memo states.

Some USAID employees point out that many contracts already function this way. Organizations are often paid after completing their work rather than receiving funding upfront.

However, a USAID employee who requested anonymity noted that such arrangements aren’t always practical. “Those kinds of agreements are often not flexible enough for the environments we work in,” they explained, pointing out that conditions in conflict or disaster zones can change rapidly.

The Trump administration’s plan aims to focus USAID on areas deemed crucial to U.S. interests. These include global health, food security, disaster response, and countering China’s influence.

The proposal argues that current development programs are “inefficient and fragmented.” It claims they are spread too thin across too many sectors and countries, resulting in poor outcomes.

Under the new vision, all aid programs would have clear end dates. They would also be closely measured for success against predetermined metrics.

According to Bloomberg, Musk is exploring blockchain technology for several government applications. These include improving tracking of federal expenditures, securing data, streamlining payments, and managing government properties.

The initiative could potentially create the largest government blockchain project in US history. The goals include promoting transparency and reducing costs across multiple government sectors.</p></b>

Bitcoin has pulled back from $87,500 to below $85,000, dropping around 2% in 24 hours

Market manipulation by whales is suspected, with “spoofing” tactics creating artificial resistance

Liquidations are approaching $200 million, with long positions accounting for $131 million

Despite volatility, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their fifth consecutive day of inflows totaling $165.75 million

Technical indicators suggest possible further decline to $80,000 support level

Bitcoin has experienced a pullback to below $85,000 after reaching a 13-week high of $87,500 on March 20. The cryptocurrency is now trading at around $84,135, reflecting a 2% decrease over the past 24 hours.

The decline coincides with increasing market liquidations. These have approached $200 million in the last 24 hours. Long position liquidations account for $131 million of this total.

Technical analysis shows Bitcoin is testing a long-standing resistance trendline. The cryptocurrency is forming price rejection candles on the 4-hour chart. This signals an extended pullback might be in progress.

Market indicators are turning bearish. The MACD and signal lines have crossed negatively. This potentially signals a sell-off in the short term.

Bitcoin’s open interest has decreased by 4.45%. It has reached a low of $52.81 billion in the futures market. The long-to-short ratio shows a subtle rise in bearish positions, now at 0.9861.

Despite these bearish signals, the funding rate remains positive. It currently stands at 0.0051%. This reflects ongoing bullish sentiment toward long positions despite traders paying extra premium.

Whale behavior appears to be influencing price action. Analysis from Material Indicators suggests that Bitcoin’s inability to break through $87,500 is due to market manipulation. Large blocks of sell orders have appeared on exchange order books.

$BTC Still fighting that Daily 200MA/EMA and previous support. Looking at the higher timeframe, the bulls would want to get back above ~$89K-$90K to really turn this around. Key level to hold on the daily candle is $84K-85K to not risk falling back to the local lows. https://t.co/28umCuHo6w pic.twitter.com/Lm7XshoqTr — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) March 20, 2025

This tactic is known as “spoofing.” It involves placing large orders with no intention of fulfilling them. The practice creates artificial resistance levels and prevents upward momentum.

The open interest-to-market cap ratio has spiked again. This signals an increase in market leverage. Higher leverage could trigger a new wave of volatility and potential mass liquidations.

Institutions Buy as Whales Suppress

On the institutional front, support for Bitcoin appears to be strengthening. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $165.75 million in net inflows on March 20. This marks their fifth consecutive day of positive flows.

BlackRock led ETF acquisitions with an inflow of $172.14 million. VanEck, Fidelity, and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust also recorded positive inflows. However, some ETFs like Bitwise, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Franklin Templeton saw outflows.

Looking at support levels, the current recovery will likely retest local support near $83,000. A breakdown below this level could push Bitcoin toward $78,350. This would represent a deeper correction from recent highs.

Conversely, a bullish rebound could challenge the resistance trendline again. Based on Fibonacci analysis, a successful breakout could extend to the 61.80% level around $95,350.

The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) sit around $85,000. Bulls are currently attempting to flip these key bull market trendlines to support.

The European trading session has shown a lack of momentum. This reinforces the theory that price suppression is influencing market activity. Recent gains from the Asian session have been erased.

For now, Bitcoin remains in a critical phase. Traders are watching whether it can overcome the apparent resistance at $87,500. The alternative is a deeper correction toward $80,000 where previous buying interest emerged.</p></b>

SUI is showing signs of a potential trend reversal after completing an ABCDE correction

Key resistance level stands at the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement of $2.89

SUI has formed an ascending triangle pattern that could lead to a breakout if price closes above $2.4

The token has rebounded 5% in the past week despite dropping 32% over the previous four weeks

Strong fundamentals include over $1.1 billion in total value locked (TVL) across Sui’s Web3 ecosystem

Sui (SUI) has been navigating a challenging market landscape since early 2025, showing recent signs of recovery after completing a corrective phase. The cryptocurrency is now testing key technical levels that could determine its next major move.

SUI has experienced a significant correction of over 32% in the past four weeks. This decline coincided with broader market reactions following U.S. President Donald Trump’s second inauguration in January.

Despite these headwinds, SUI has shown resilience by rebounding 5% over the past week. The large-cap altcoin, with a market capitalization of approximately $22.8 billion, continues to see high trading volumes around $889 billion daily.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis reveals that SUI has formed a five-wave impulsive structure that peaked at $5.35 on January 6. Following this peak, the price entered an ABCDE correction within a descending wedge pattern.

The 4-hour chart shows price action stabilizing near the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.31. This level represents a critical support zone that could serve as the foundation for a potential reversal.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour timeframe is attempting to recover from oversold conditions. This technical indicator suggests that selling pressure may be waning, creating conditions for a possible upward move.

SUI has been retesting a major resistance point from April 2024 over the past two weeks. This level was previously broken in October 2024, and the current retesting phase could be preparing the way for another breakout.

An ascending triangle pattern has formed on the 1-hour chart according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. This pattern often precedes breakouts when the price consistently closes above a key level – in this case, $2.4.

If SUI successfully breaks above $2.4, a rally toward the next key resistance at $2.89 could follow. This level aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement from the broader downtrend and would validate the bullish scenario.

However, caution is warranted as a drop below $2.2 would invalidate the bullish setup. Such a move could trigger a deeper correction toward $2 or lower, with $1.48 (0.786 Fibonacci) acting as the last major support.

Looking at the Elliott Wave structure, a five-wave sequence was recently completed at $2.50. This suggests that a corrective (a)-(b)-(c) pullback may occur before a renewed uptrend can begin.

During this pullback, the price may retrace toward the $2.31 level before forming a higher low. If this support holds, the next impulsive wave could target the $2.89 region.

A successful breakout above $2.89 would open the door to higher targets. The 0.382 Fibonacci level at $3.47 would then become the next major resistance to watch.

While short-term price movements capture most attention, SUI’s long-term fundamentals continue to strengthen. The network has developed a robust Web3 ecosystem hosting several DeFi protocols including Suilend, NAVI, Cetus AMM, and Haedal.

The total value locked (TVL) in Sui’s ecosystem has reached over $1.1 billion. This achievement highlights growing interest and confidence in the network’s capabilities and future potential.</p></b>

Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern with analysts predicting a possible 16% price increase

DOGE is currently trading around $0.17 and is close to overtaking Cardano’s market cap

Technical analysis indicates DOGE has broken above a falling wedge formation, considered a bullish reversal signal

The crypto is currently experiencing short-term pressure with support at $0.143 and resistance at $0.176

Increased social engagement and accumulation by traders suggest growing investor confidence in DOGE

Dogecoin (DOGE) appears to be on the verge of a price breakout after weeks of trading in a narrow range. The popular meme cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $0.17, with multiple technical indicators suggesting a potential upward move in the near future.

Two respected crypto analysts have identified promising patterns in DOGE’s price charts. Ali Martinez highlighted a symmetrical triangle formation on the one-hour chart. This pattern shows Dogecoin trading within a narrowing range with an upper limit near $0.18 and a lower support line extending upward from $0.144.

According to Martinez, a clear hourly close above the $0.16-$0.18 zone could trigger a 16% price increase from the breakout point. This move would release buying pressure that has been building over the past ten days.

Another analyst, CW, presented a daily chart showing what appears to be a falling wedge formation dating back to December 2024. In this pattern, DOGE formed lower highs and lower lows, converging toward a narrowing point.

CW noted that Dogecoin recently crossed above the wedge’s downward-sloping resistance line. This event is widely considered a bullish reversal signal once confirmed by subsequent price action holding above that line.

Market Analysis

The 4-hour price chart for DOGE shows a breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern by surpassing the descending resistance line at around $0.1730. This move positions DOGE for a potential climb to $0.1790 before experiencing a possible downward correction.

For the breakout to remain valid, bulls need to defend prices above $0.1730. Failure to maintain this level could send DOGE lower toward $0.1660 or the $0.1600 ascending support line.

Short-term challenges remain for Dogecoin. The cryptocurrency recently formed a bearish tweezer formation on the daily chart after failing to sustain momentum at the $0.176 resistance level.

This pattern suggests DOGE may retest the $0.143 support level. If this occurs, traders might see a period of consolidation between $0.143 and $0.176 in the coming days or weeks.

Despite these short-term pressures, DOGE has shown resilience. Over the past week, it experienced only a slight 2.64% dip, holding relatively steady amid market fluctuations.

At press time, Dogecoin had a market capitalization of $25.22 billion. This places it just behind Cardano (ADA), which has a market cap of $26.17 billion. To overtake Cardano, DOGE would need to increase its price by just 1.03 times.

Social sentiment remains strong for Dogecoin. The cryptocurrency maintains its position as the top meme coin based on social engagement thanks to its passionate community and robust public support.

Smart DEX traders appear to view the current price range as a potential value zone. These investors have formed an accumulation base at key price support levels, which could be a sign of potential price appreciation in the near future.

The combination of smart buyers’ purchases and strong social sentiment provides support for DOGE’s price. This creates favorable conditions for further market growth as investor confidence continues to build.

The broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin’s steady uptrend, is showing signs of strength. Historically, DOGE has responded positively to Bitcoin’s upward movements, which could set the stage for a breakout if bullish conditions persist.

For now, traders are closely monitoring the key support level at $0.143 and resistance at $0.176. A decisive move beyond either of these levels could determine Dogecoin’s next major price action in the coming days.</p></b>

Ethereum’s supply on exchanges has fallen to the lowest level since November 2015 (8.97 million ETH)

ETH price is down 26-47% in the past month, currently trading around $1,970-$1,990

Reduced exchange supply typically signals long-term holder accumulation and potential “supply shock”

Ethereum faces challenges including decreased mainnet activity, lower fee revenue, and competition from Layer-2 networks

Spot Ethereum ETFs have seen 12 straight days of outflows totaling $370.6 million

Ethereum’s supply on crypto exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since November 2015, with just 8.97 million ETH now available on trading platforms. This represents a decrease of 16.4% in just the past seven weeks.

The sharp decline suggests ETH holders are moving their assets into cold storage wallets for long-term holding. Many crypto analysts view this as a bullish signal of growing conviction in Ethereum’s future price appreciation.

Crypto analytics platform Santiment reported the data on March 20. They noted that ETH has been rapidly leaving exchanges since the end of January.

👋 Thanks to the many DeFi and staking options, Ethereum's holders have now brought the available supply on exchanges down to 8.97M, the lowest amount in nearly 10 years (November, 2015). There is 16.4% less $ETH on exchanges compared to just 7 weeks ago. 😮 pic.twitter.com/r5957wPhLi — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 20, 2025

This pattern often precedes what traders call a “supply shock.” When fewer tokens are available for immediate trading on exchanges, even modest increases in demand can drive prices higher.

We’ve seen similar patterns with Bitcoin in the past. In January, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves hit a seven-year low just before BTC surged to new all-time highs.

Despite these positive supply dynamics, Ethereum’s price performance has been weak. The token is currently trading at around $1,990, down 26-47% from its recent peaks.

ETH reached around $4,000 on multiple occasions during the late 2024 and early 2025 bull run. Unlike Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum failed to set a new all-time high above its previous record of $4,878 from November 2021.

The token experienced a steep decline, bottoming at $1,750 just last week. This represents a 55% drop from its local peak during this market cycle.

ETH’s Conflicting Signals

Several crypto traders remain optimistic despite these challenges. Trader Crypto General told his 230,800 X followers that it’s “just a question of time before the big supply shock.”

Another commentator named Ted suggested that with ETH supply on exchanges decreasing daily, “buyers will soon compete, leading to bidding wars.”

Exchange reserve $ETH is decreasing with the day. With limited supply, buyers will soon compete, leading to bidding wars. It's only a matter of time. pic.twitter.com/uKVkknAAOC — Ted (@TedPillows) March 19, 2025

Crypto trader Naber has made an even bolder prediction. They believe the largest ETH accumulation is taking place now, potentially leading to an $8,000-$10,000 price range in the future.

Not all indicators are positive, however. Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin has been at its lowest point in five years, according to trader Daan Crypto Trades.

Ethereum spot ETFs have experienced 12 straight days of outflows. These outflows have totaled $370.6 million according to Farside data.

The decreased activity on Ethereum’s mainnet is another concern. Monthly decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on Ethereum has fallen from $92 billion in December to $82 billion in February.

Layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Base are gaining traction due to their lower fees. These networks processed $5.67 billion of the past week’s $9.8 billion in Ethereum-based DEX protocols.

This shift has hurt Ethereum’s fee revenue, which dropped from $218 million in December to just $46 million in February. The recent Dencun upgrade reduced gas fees by 95%, making transactions less costly but further impacting revenue.

From a technical perspective, Ethereum faces resistance at $2,042, with the 50-day moving average acting as a barrier. If ETH breaks above this level, the next targets would be $2,163 and $2,370.

On the downside, a failure to hold $1,986 could see ETH decline toward $1,714, where previous buying interest emerged. The RSI indicator at 41.22 shows ETH recovering from oversold conditions but lacking strong momentum.

Standard Chartered analysts recently lowered their year-end ETH price target from $10,000 to $4,000. They cited increased competition from other networks, especially Ethereum layer-2s, as a main factor for this revision.

A potential catalyst for Ethereum could come from staking exchange-traded funds. Both the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange have submitted requests to the SEC to permit staking in Ethereum ETFs.</p></b>

Australia plans to integrate digital assets into its economy with a new regulatory framework

Crypto exchanges will need financial service licenses and meet capital requirements

The government will address de-banking concerns and work with major banks

Stablecoins will be regulated as “stored-value facilities” under payment licensing reforms

Draft legislation is expected in 2025, ahead of a closely contested federal election

The Australian government has announced a new approach to regulating digital assets in the country. This plan aims to integrate cryptocurrencies into the broader economy while setting up rules to protect consumers.

Australia’s Treasury Department released a white paper on March 21 outlining the new framework. The plan draws inspiration from regulatory models used in the European Union and Singapore.

Under the new rules, crypto exchanges will be known as Digital Asset Platforms (DAPs) in Australia. These platforms will need to obtain an Australian Financial Services License to operate legally.

The licensing requirements include meeting capital adequacy standards. This means exchanges must hold enough funds to cover potential losses.

Customer protection is a key focus of the new regulations. Crypto exchanges will need to use third-party custodians to store customer assets. This separation aims to keep user funds safe if an exchange faces financial troubles.

The government plans to exempt small-scale platforms and startups from some requirements. This exception will help new businesses enter the market without facing heavy regulatory burdens.

Blockchain software developers will also be exempt. Companies that create digital assets that aren’t financial products won’t need to follow the same rules as exchanges.

Stablecoins will receive special treatment under the framework. The government will regulate payment stablecoins as “stored-value facilities” under its Payment Licensing Reforms.

The plan includes pilot trials for tokenized money. The Australian Treasury, Securities and Investment Commission, and Reserve Bank will test using stablecoins to settle transactions in wholesale markets.

The De-Banking Challenge

De-banking has been a major concern for crypto businesses in Australia. This happens when traditional banks refuse to provide services to crypto companies. The government promises to address this issue through its new licensing regime.

Treasury officials will work with Australia’s four largest banks to better understand de-banking. This collaboration aims to find solutions that allow crypto businesses to access banking services.

The timing of these announcements comes ahead of a federal election. The vote is scheduled to be held by May 17, with current polls showing a tight race between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s Labor Party and the opposition Coalition.

The Coalition has also promised to prioritize crypto regulation if elected. Both political parties appear to recognize the importance of creating clear rules for the digital asset industry.

Caroline Bowler, CEO of local exchange BTC Markets, called the reforms “sensible.” She noted they would help Australia stay competitive with global peers in the crypto space.

Jonathon Miller from Kraken Australia emphasized the “urgent need for bespoke crypto legislation.” He believes clear regulations will remove barriers to growth in the Australian economy.

The government expects to release draft legislation for public consultation later in 2025. This timeline gives stakeholders a chance to provide feedback before the rules become final.</p></b>

Eric Trump appointed to Metaplanet’s new Strategic Board of Advisors

Eric Trump has emerged as a key crypto figure, especially after ties to World Liberty Financial

Metaplanet’s stock jumped 17% following the announcement

Metaplanet, Japan’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, has appointed Eric Trump to its newly formed Strategic Board of Advisors, the company announced Friday. The Tokyo-based firm is making this move as part of its strategy to boost Bitcoin adoption and strengthen its position as a leading Bitcoin treasury company.

Simon Gerovich, Representative Director of Metaplanet Inc, welcomed Trump’s appointment in a press release. “We are honored to welcome Eric Trump as the first member of our Strategic Board of Advisors,” Gerovich stated.

The company believes Trump’s business experience will be valuable to their mission. “His business acumen, love of the Bitcoin community and global hospitality perspective will be invaluable in accelerating Metaplanet’s vision,” Gerovich added in the announcement.

Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, has recently gained attention in the cryptocurrency world. His involvement with World Liberty Financial, a Trump family crypto venture launched in September 2024, has raised his profile in the space.

Trump’s Crypto Influence

The younger Trump has publicly endorsed Bitcoin on social media. He has also shown interest in Ethereum, though a February recommendation to buy ETH didn’t work out well as the price later dropped 30%.

In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH. — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 3, 2025

Metaplanet currently holds over 3,200 Bitcoin in its treasury. The firm recently added to its holdings with a purchase of 150 BTC for approximately 1.8 billion yen (about $12.5 million).

The company’s stock responded positively to the announcement. Metaplanet shares jumped more than 17% to JPY 4,730.00 following the news of Trump’s appointment.

The newly established advisory board will include more members in the future. Metaplanet plans to bring together “influential voices, speakers and thought leaders from around the world” who support Bitcoin adoption and financial innovation.

Metaplanet is often compared to MicroStrategy, a U.S. company known for its Bitcoin investments. Similar to MicroStrategy’s approach under Michael Saylor, Metaplanet has been actively building its Bitcoin holdings.

The announcement comes during a period of market fluctuation for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was trading around $84,000 on Friday, down about 2% amid broader market uncertainty.

Bitcoin has been trading in a range between $81,000 and $84,000 over the past week. The leading cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume dropped 32% to $25 billion, showing reduced market activity.

Despite this short-term volatility, more companies are adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Nasdaq-listed biopharmaceutical firm Atai Life Sciences recently announced plans to start a Bitcoin treasury program.

Metaplanet didn’t share specific details about what role Trump will play on the advisory board. The company only mentioned that his appointment “reflects Metaplanet’s commitment to assembling top-tier advisory talent to advance its strategic objectives.”

The firm is continuing to expand its Bitcoin holdings while developing new financial products. No further information was provided about these upcoming initiatives or products.

Tether purchased $33.1 billion in U.S. Treasury securities in 2024, ranking as 7th largest foreign net buyer

This places Tether ahead of countries like Canada, Mexico, and Germany in Treasury purchases

USDT’s market cap grew by $45 billion in 2024, reaching $143 billion (62.45% of the $230 billion stablecoin market)

Tether reported a record $13 billion net profit in 2024 despite regulatory challenges

U.S. officials, including President Trump, have highlighted stablecoins’ role in maintaining dollar dominance

Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has emerged as a major player in the U.S. government debt market. According to data shared by CEO Paolo Ardoino on March 20, 2025, Tether purchased a net $33.1 billion worth of U.S. Treasury securities in 2024.

This massive purchase places the crypto company as the seventh largest foreign net buyer of U.S. Treasuries last year. Tether now outranks several countries including Canada, Mexico, and Germany in Treasury acquisitions.

The data highlights the growing influence of U.S. dollar stablecoins in traditional financial markets. Tether’s position comes behind only the Cayman Islands, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Singapore, and the United Kingdom in net Treasury purchases.

Ardoino noted that some jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg represent multiple entities. “Indeed, Lux and Cayman numbers include all the hedge funds buying into t-bills,” he explained on social media.

While Tether made substantial purchases, other major economies reduced their holdings. Japan and China were net sellers in 2024, cutting their U.S. Treasury positions by large amounts.

Tether’s Treasury holdings now total approximately $94 billion as of December 2024. These investments help maintain the stability and backing of the USDT stablecoin.

Stablecoin Dominance and Financial Growth

USDT continues to dominate the stablecoin market. It currently represents 62.45% of the total $230 billion stablecoin supply, according to DeFiLlama data.

The stablecoin’s market capitalization has reached $143 billion. This is nearly three times larger than its closest competitor, Circle’s USDC, which stands at $59 billion.

Tether reported strong financial results in 2024 despite facing regulatory challenges in Europe. The company posted a record $13 billion net profit for the year.

Tether just released the attestation for Q4 2024. Highlights as of 31st December 2024: – $13.7 billion profit for year 2024

– ~$6 billion profit for Q4 2024

– $113 billion in direct and indirect holdings

– $7 billion in Tether's excess stablecoin reserves (36% increase YoY),… https://t.co/izYONstKuF — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) January 31, 2025

The stablecoin issuer maintained rapid growth, issuing 23 billion USDT in the fourth quarter alone. This contributed to a total issuance of 45 billion USDT throughout 2024.

Tether’s global user base has also expanded. Ardoino reported that USDT adoption has surpassed 400 million users, with most coming from developing nations.

Despite its success, Tether may face hurdles in the U.S. market. A proposed stablecoin bill could restrict offshore issuers from accessing U.S. Treasury markets, potentially benefiting U.S.-based competitors like USDC.

At a March 11 event hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Ardoino defended Tether’s role in the financial system. “We’ve done more for financial inclusion than anyone else,” he stated. “And while doing that, we’re buying back U.S. debt. If we were a country, we’d be the 18th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries.”

U.S. officials have recognized the importance of stablecoins for American financial influence. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently stated that crypto and stablecoins are key to preserving the U.S. dollar’s global dominance.

President Donald Trump echoed this sentiment during a pre-recorded message at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20. Trump said that “crypto will expand the dominance of the U.S. dollar” and called on Congress to pass clear regulations to encourage institutional adoption.</p></b>

South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is targeting several foreign crypto exchanges including BitMEX and KuCoin for operating without proper registration

The exchanges are accused of running Korean-language websites and marketing to South Korean users without registering under the Specific Financial Information Act

Authorities are considering access-blocking measures and sanctions against these platforms

The crackdown affects BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX, which face potential criminal penalties

This follows previous regulatory actions in 2022 when South Korea blocked 16 unregistered exchanges

South Korean financial authorities have launched a crackdown on multiple foreign cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country without proper registration. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has identified several platforms, including BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX, for allegedly offering services to Korean users illegally.

These exchanges have been found operating Korean-language websites and targeting local investors with marketing and customer support. However, they have failed to register as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under the country’s Specific Financial Information Act.

The FIU is now reviewing access-blocking measures for these overseas exchanges. They are consulting with the Korea Communications Standards Commission on how to implement these restrictions effectively.

“We are currently reviewing access blocking measures for unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors,” said an FIU official. The regulator is gathering data on damage cases to strengthen communication between authorities.

Under South Korean law, any company dealing with cryptocurrency trading, custody, or management must register with the FIU. Failure to comply can result in criminal penalties and administrative sanctions.

This crackdown is part of South Korea’s broader efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency market. The country aims to balance market growth with user protection.

The latest action follows similar measures taken in 2022. That year, the FIU requested the blocking of 16 unregistered foreign exchanges, including KuCoin, MEXC, and Poloniex.

Tightening the Crypto Net

Many exchanges withdrew from the South Korean market after those actions. According to the FIU, there are now only 31 registered crypto trading firms in South Korea, down more than 26% from 42 in 2024.

Several platforms like GDAC, ProBit, Huobi Korea, and Bitrade failed to renew their registrations. This led to their removal from the nation’s registry of approved crypto businesses.

The targeted exchanges have allegedly continued to serve Korean customers despite not meeting regulatory requirements. They have maintained Korean-language services and marketing campaigns aimed at local users.

South Korea’s regulatory focus extends beyond just registration issues. The country has also been working on strengthening anti-money laundering regulations in the crypto sector.

Recently, South Korean authorities announced plans to implement stronger anti-money laundering rules. These changes are part of a potential regulatory revamp focused on preventing financial crimes.

The country is also exploring other aspects of blockchain technology. The Bank of Korea plans to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program in April, which may last for three months.

At the same time, the central bank has rejected the idea of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. They cited concerns about Bitcoin’s volatile nature and inherent risks as reasons for this decision.

South Korean crypto exchanges are facing additional scrutiny beyond the registration issues. On March 20, prosecutors raided Bithumb following suspicions that its former CEO, Kim Dae-sik, embezzled company funds to purchase an apartment.

Rumors have also emerged about intermediaries allegedly receiving payments to list projects on major Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Upbit. These allegations have prompted responses from the exchanges involved.

Upbit has demanded that media outlets disclose any list of digital asset projects that paid brokerage fees. This highlights the tense relationship between exchanges and regulators in the current environment.

The FIU expects to take “tangible measures” against the unregistered exchanges within this year. They are organizing cases and related data to prepare for enforcement actions.

As South Korea continues to develop its crypto regulatory framework, these actions against unregistered exchanges represent an important step in the government’s efforts to bring the industry under proper oversight.</p></b>

XRP price jumped about 7-8% following the SEC dropping its appeal against Ripple

Large XRP holders (whales) have added 2.82 billion coins (6.5% increase) to their holdings in recent months

Network activity increased dramatically in March, with active addresses six times higher than January-February levels

Technical analysis suggests a potential 75% rally to around $4.35 if the symmetrical triangle pattern plays out

Despite the legal victory, Ripple still faces an injunction limiting XRP sales to institutional investors

XRP (XRP) has seen its price increase by approximately 7-8% in the past week, reaching around $2.51. This rise follows several key developments in both the legal and on-chain fronts that have revitalized interest in the cryptocurrency.

The most important catalyst came when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its appeal against Ripple. This effectively ends the four-year legal battle that has hung over the cryptocurrency.

The news sparked an immediate price surge. XRP jumped from $2.3 to $2.6 within an hour of the announcement, though it has since settled back to around $2.4.

On-chain data suggests some investors may have anticipated this outcome. According to analytics firm Santiment, wallets holding at least one million XRP tokens (worth about $2.5 million) have increased their holdings by 6.5% in the two months leading up to the announcement.

These large holders, often called “whales,” have added 2.82 billion XRP to their wallets during this period. They now collectively own more than 46.4 billion XRP tokens, showing continued confidence despite previous market downturns.

📈 XRP has decoupled from the altcoin pack, surging another +14% and breaching the $2.50 resistance for the first time in 12 days. Wallets with at least 1M $XRP now hold 46.4B coins, as they have accumulated 6.5% more in just the past 2 months alone. Address activity has also… pic.twitter.com/87PiB2OxeU — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 19, 2025

Network activity has also seen a major uptick. Active addresses on the XRP blockchain in March have been approximately six times higher than levels seen in January and February.

This increased activity points to growing interest from retail users. More people are making transactions on the network, which typically indicates heightened engagement with the cryptocurrency.

Technical Analysis

The technical picture for XRP also appears promising. The cryptocurrency is forming what analysts identify as a symmetrical triangle pattern on price charts, which is often considered a bullish signal.

If XRP breaks above the upper trendline of this pattern, technical analysis suggests it could target a price of $4.35 by June. This would represent a 75% increase from current levels.

However, crypto lawyer John Deaton points out that Ripple still faces hurdles. An injunction issued by Judge Analisa Torres restricts the company from selling XRP directly to institutional investors like banks and financial institutions.

This limitation could affect Ripple’s business model, which has focused on promoting XRP adoption among financial institutions for cross-border payments.

In a positive development for US traders, crypto exchange Bitnomial has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the SEC. The exchange plans to launch the first CFTC-regulated XRP futures in the United States.

Futures contracts will allow traders to speculate on XRP’s price without directly holding the asset. This typically increases market activity and improves liquidity.

The current rally comes months after XRP experienced a major price surge following Donald Trump’s election victory. That increase was driven by expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the US.

While XRP is up over the past week, it has yet to recapture its all-time high price. Some analysts wonder if the current situation could lead to a “sell-the-news” scenario, where prices drop after positive events are fully priced in.

The direction XRP takes in the coming weeks will likely depend on broader market conditions as well as how Ripple navigates its remaining legal constraints.

For now, active addresses remain high and whale accumulation continues, suggesting that market participants maintain a positive outlook on XRP’s future prospects.</p></b>

                <p>Metaplanet, Japan’s largest corporate bitcoin holder, has appointed Eric Trump to its newly formed strategic board of advisers. The move aims to advance Metaplanet’s bitcoin adoption mission as bitcoin gains mainstream traction.

Metaplanet announced the move on Friday, stating that Trump’s expertise and passion for bitcoin will help drive the company’s goals. As the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, Eric Trump has emerged as an influential voice supporting the growth bitcoin and the crypto industry.

The advisory board will also include other high-profile figures yet to be named, according to Metaplanet. The focus will be bringing together leaders in business, politics and technology to further bitcoin’s acceptance globally.

Metaplanet Representative Director Simon Gerovich welcomed Trump’s appointment, emphasizing his business acumen and enthusiasm for the bitcoin community. Gerovich said, “His business expertise and passion for BTC will help drive our mission forward as we continue building one of the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Companies.”

The Tokyo-based company has aggressively accumulated bitcoin reserves, now holding over 3,200 BTC worth approximately $267 million. Earlier in March, Metaplanet purchased 150 additional bitcoins at a value of $12.5 million.

Established in 1999, Metaplanet has shifted its focus to bitcoin investment and advocacy. The company trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and was previously known as Red Planet Japan.

Eric Trump has increasingly backed bitcoin and cryptos. He is involved with World Liberty Financial, a Trump family’s crypto venture. His father, Donald Trump, recently signed an executive order to launch a strategic bitcoin reserve.

With bitcoin going mainstream, Metaplanet is betting on crypto-friendly advisers like Trump to drive institutional adoption. Major corporations adding bitcoin to reserves could accelerate acceptance and solidify bitcoin as a sound corporate asset.</p></b>

                <p>I’ve spoken with a number of politicians in the past few weeks. They all see bitcoin as a store of value and believe that U.S. citizens have the right to hold their private keys.

I can’t say that it doesn’t feel good to hear U.S. elected officials express these views and even propose bills that would codify pro-bitcoin legislation into law. It’s surely refreshing, especially after the political antagonism that Bitcoiners and the Bitcoin industry endured under the Biden administration.

With that said, there is still work to be done, and much of that work involves advocating to preserve our right to transact with bitcoin privately.

One of the best privacy-preserving tools we have at the Bitcoin base layer is bitcoin mixers, which help users to anonymize their transactions.

And one of the most well-known mixers was Samourai Wallet, which enabled users to mix their bitcoin in a noncustodial fashion. That is, the developers and maintainers of the wallet never touched users’ private keys.

This software was shut down early last year, though, when the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) pressed charges against the Samourai developers including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering charges. (The developers of Tornado Cash, open-source mixing software deployed on Ethereum, are also facing similar charges.)

Some politicians, including Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) have come out in support of the Samourai developers, drafting a letter to the former U.S. Attorney General, the Honorable Merrick Garland, in which they outlined that the developers clearly did not operate a money transmitting business as per the definition of such a business in FinCEN guidance from 2019. (With that said, Senator Lummis has also coauthored a bill in which she calls for the U.S. Treasury to “conduct a study on combatting anonymous crypto asset transactions like asset mixers,” but I digress.)

Mixers are incredibly important for human rights activists who need to maintain their anonymity when sending and receiving funds as well as to everyday people who value transactional privacy.

Therefore, we need to bring this issue to the attention of politicians, as many are unfamiliar with it, so to hopefully have more of them come out in defense of the Samourai developers and to see the importance of preserving U.S. citizens’ right to use mixers.

For this reason, I’m asking you to use the letter template published by my colleague Shinobi at the end of this piece to write your representatives.

Just as we’ve rallied to Free Ross and to protect the right to self custody, we must rally in support of transactional privacy.

This is something that I, the political correspondent for this publication, cannot do alone. I need your help. So, please heed this call to action and inform your representatives about this matter so that by the time I have a conversation with them about it, they have some understanding of the issue.</p></b>

                <p>After reaching an all-time high above $100,000, the Bitcoin price has entered a multi-week downtrend. This correction has naturally raised questions about whether Bitcoin is still aligned with the 2017 bull cycle. Here we’ll analyze the data to assess how closely Bitcoin’s current price action correlates with previous bull markets, and what we can expect next for BTC.

Bitcoin Price Trends in 2025 vs. 2017 Bull Cycle

Bitcoin’s price trajectory since the cycle lows set during the 2022 bear market has shown remarkable similarities to the 2015–2017 cycle, the bull market that culminated in Bitcoin reaching $20,000 in December 2017. However, Bitcoin’s recent downtrend marks the first major divergence from the 2017 pattern. If Bitcoin were still tracking the 2017 cycle, it should have been rallying to new all-time highs over the past month, instead, Bitcoin has been moving sideways and declining, suggesting that the correlation may be weakening.

Figure 1: The current cycle trajectory has recently diverged from historical patterns.

View Live Chart 🔍

Despite the recent divergence, the historical correlation between Bitcoin’s current cycle and the 2017 cycle remains surprisingly high. The correlation between the current cycle and the 2015–2017 cycle was around 92% earlier this year. The recent price divergence has reduced the correlation slightly to 91%, still an extremely high figure for financial markets.

How Bitcoin Market Behavior Echoes 2017 Cycle Patterns

The MVRV Ratio is a key indicator of investor behavior. It measures the relationship between Bitcoin’s current market price and the average cost basis of all BTC held on the network. When the MVRV ratio rises sharply, it indicates that investors are sitting on significant unrealized profits, a condition that often precedes market tops. When the ratio declines toward the realized price, it signals that Bitcoin is trading close to the average acquisition price of investors, often marking a bottoming phase.

Figure 2: The MVRV Ratio is still moving similarly to the 2017 cycle.

View Live Chart 🔍

The recent decline in the MVRV ratio reflects Bitcoin’s correction from all-time highs, however, the MVRV ratio remains structurally similar to the 2017 cycle with an early bull market rally, followed by multiple sharp corrections, and as such, the correlation remains at 80%.

Bitcoin Price Correlation with 2017 Bull Cycle Data

One possible explanation for the recent divergence is the influence of data lag. For example, Bitcoin’s price action has shown a strong correlation with Global Liquidity, the total supply of money in major economies; however, historical analysis shows that changes in liquidity often take around 2 months to reflect in Bitcoin’s price action.

Figure 3: Global M2 has a delayed impact on BTC price action.

View Live Chart 🔍

By applying a 30-day lag to Bitcoin’s price action relative to the 2017 cycle, the correlation increases to 93%, which would be the highest recorded correlation between the two cycles. The lag-adjusted pattern suggests that Bitcoin could soon resume the 2017 trajectory, implying that a major rally could be on the horizon.

Figure 4: Price is still very closely following the 2017 data when delayed by 30 days.

What 2017 Bull Cycle Signals Mean for Bitcoin Price Today

History may not repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Bitcoin’s current cycle may not deliver 2017-style exponential gains, but the underlying market psychology remains strikingly similar. If Bitcoin resumes its correlation with the lagging 2017 cycle, the historical precedent suggests that Bitcoin could soon recover from the current correction, and a sharp upward move could follow.

Trump administration officials have crafted a proposal to overhaul U.S. foreign aid programs, with a section exploring how it could make use of blockchain technology to track aid distributions and increase accountability.

The plan would rename the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) as the U.S. Agency for International Humanitarian Assistance and bring it directly under the Secretary of State's authority, according to an initial report from Politico showing an internal document purportedly circulating at the State Department.

Under a section for "modernized, performance-based procurement," the document references an initiative to secure and trace distributions "via blockchain technology" to "radically increase security, transparency, and traceability."

The proposal comes as USAID faces an uncertain future. In January, the State Department placed the agency's staff on administrative leave and halted payments to partner organizations, prompting legal challenges.

A federal judge has since issued a preliminary injunction against dismantling the agency, following efforts by D.O.G.E., the Department of Government Efficiency, established by Elon Musk that sought to do so.

It remains unclear who authored the document, as it appears to be scanned from a physical copy. Decrypt has reached out to the agency to learn more.

Innovation, efficiency, impact

The proposal further argues that the approach would "encourage innovation and efficiency" and focus on "tangible impact" instead of "simply completing activities and inputs."

The blockchain implementation appears to be part of broader reforms intended to impose stricter controls on aid distribution, requiring measurable outcomes through "third-party metrics, not self-reporting."

Congressional authorization would likely be required for major structural changes, though the document indicates some reforms could be implemented through executive action.

More broadly, the proposed overhaul limits USAID's focus on global health, food security, and disaster response, making U.S. foreign aid initiatives leaner in terms of scope.

The document also outlines a restructured framework based on three organizational pillars—"Safer, More Prosperous, and Stronger"—led by three agencies under the Secretary of State's direction.

The ideas resonate with existing literature on how blockchain technology could be used for public good.

A 2018 article published in the Journal for Humanitarian Action cites core features of the technology as having the potential to "remove corruption by providing transparency as well as accountability."

                <p>Hey, there! The weekend is almost upon us, but in the meantime, we have one more weekday game of Wordle to enjoy. To help keep your streak trundling along, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Friday's puzzle (#1,371).

It may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that too.

What is Wordle?

Wordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. The gist is that there is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.

Advertisement Advertisement

Wordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.

The New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.

How to play Wordle

To start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard.

You'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.

Wordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.

How to play Wordle more than once a day

If you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.

In addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.

Bitcoin market sentiment has deteriorated to levels not seen since January 2023, according to crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant.

In a report released Thursday, CryptoQuant revealed its Bull Score Index has fallen to 20 — showing only two out of ten key metrics in bullish territory.

This reading marks the lowest level in over two years and sits well below the threshold historically needed to support sustained price appreciation, the analytics firm said.

Because it returns to a previous low, a "weak environment" for Bitcoin reduces "the likelihood of a sustained rally in the near term," the report reads.

Those insights raise questions about market direction, one that CryptoQuant sees "could be part of a broader bearish trend, rather than a short-term correction."

The analytic firm's Bull Score Index combines ten distinct metrics measuring network activity, investor behavior, Bitcoin demand, and market liquidity to gauge overall market health.

Historically, Bitcoin has required scores above 60 to maintain significant price rallies, while extended periods below 40 have consistently aligned with bear markets, CryptoQuant explained.

CryptoQuant's dashboard for the model shows a significant deterioration in on-chain fundamentals since mid-February 2025, with eight metrics now flashing warning signals.

The Network Activity Index, a key component tracking on-chain usage, has remained bearish since December 2024.

If the score "remains below 40 for an extended period," this could signal that "bearish market conditions" could continue, challenging the notion that Bitcoin's recent drawdown by up to 23% of its recent peak of $109,000 in January represents a "temporary correction," analysts noted in the report.

Broader contexts are also at play here. Bitcoin volatility has jumped to a six-month high, even while some observers project new all-time highs by mid-year, driven by easing global liquidity conditions.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said it would hold interest rates steady. Major crypto markets, from Bitcoin to Ethereum and Solan, saw immediate, modest gains on the news.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down 1.8% to $84,400. Over on MYRIAD, an on-chain prediction market launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, 68% think that Bitcoin will stay above $83,000 before next week.

“We are honored to welcome Eric Trump as the first member of our Strategic Board of Advisors and look forward to welcoming him to our annual meeting,” said Simon Gerovich, Representative Director of Metaplanet Inc, in the release.

“His business acumen, love of the Bitcoin community and global hospitality perspective will be invaluable in accelerating Metaplanet’s vision of becoming one of the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Companies.”

The newly established board will comprise influential voices, speakers and thought leaders, though Metaplanet did not share specifics.

Trump, son of President Donald Trump, has emerged as a key figure in recent months mainly after his ties to World Liberty Financial, a Trump family crypto venture launched in September 2024. He has since publicly endorsed bitcoin and ether (ETH) investing on X.

Metaplanet holds over 3,200 BTC as of Friday, after their latest reported purchase on March 18 when they acquired an additional 150 BTC for approximately 1.8 billion yen (around $12.5 million at the time).</p></b>

                <p>A key gauge of economic sentiment and corporate credit health has receded from its recent multi-month highs in a positive development for risk-taking in stocks and crypto markets. The relief, however, could be short-lived, per some observers.

The indicator in consideration is the ICE/BofA U.S. High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS), which measures the average yield difference (spread) between U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted for embedded optionality in the bonds.

It's widely tracked as a credit risk barometer, with the widening spread representing growing investor concern about corporate defaults or economic weakness, often leading to investors lightening their exposure to riskier assets such as technology stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The OAS, representing the premium investors demand for holding high-yielding bonds over the relatively safer Treasury notes, has dropped to 3.2% from the six-month high of 3.4% early this month.

The decline in the spread supports a renewed upswing in bitcoin (BTC) and Nasdaq.

The spread surged by 100 basis points in four weeks to mid-March as President Donald Trump's tariffs raised the recession spectre. During that time, both BTC and Nasdaq took a beating, with the cryptocurrency falling to lows under $80K.

Temporary relief?

Analysts expect the OAS spread to widen further in the coming weeks as the negative impact of Trump's tariffs becomes clear, according to Mint and Reuters.

"We think this is just getting started and will get worse before it gets better," Hans Mikkelsen, managing director of credit strategy at TD Securities, said in a recent client note.

Applying technical analysis principles to the OAS chart suggests the same.

The spread has moved past the three-year descending trendline, warranting high alert from risk asset investors.</p></b>

                <p>Short-term price dips are par for the course in bitcoin’s (BTC) bull markets, but one indicator suggests the current decline from recent highs may reflect a deeper structural shift in market dynamics.

Bitcoin was trading around $84,000 as European morning hours on Friday, a 23% drop from its January peak of $109,000. The fall has rattled investors and fueled debate over whether this marks the start of a new bear market or a fleeting correction within a broader bullish trend.

Such pullbacks are not uncommon — BTC has weathered similar declines in past bull cycles, often rebounding to new heights. Yet, on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index, a composite metric designed to gauge bitcoin’s market health, shows signs of deeper weakness.

The index evaluates ten critical indicators—spanning network activity (like transaction volume), investor profitability, market liquidity, among other factors, assigning a score from 0 to 100. Higher scores denote a robust, bullish environment, while lower readings flag bearish conditions.

As of now, the Bull Score Index sits at a troubling 20 — the lowest since January 2023, when bitcoin sat around $16,000 post the collapse of then-behemoth crypto exchange FTX.

Eight of the ten metrics tracked by the index show warning signs, with network activity been bearish since December 2024 and dried up transaction volumes and liquidity.

“Historically, bitcoin has only sustained major price rallies when the Bull Score is above 60, while prolonged readings below 40 have aligned with bear markets,” CryptoQuant analysts said in the Thursday report.

Investor profitability has waned as short-term holders face unrealized losses, while demand softens — U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, once aggressive buyers, have registered a net $180 million outflows in the past 30 days, or among the highest rates of withdrawals since they started trading at the beginning of 2024.

In previous cycles, readings below 40 for weeks or months have preceded extended bear phases, like the 2022 slump that saw bitcoin shed over 60% of its value from peak.

The coming weeks will be pivotal. Either the index rebounds, signaling renewed strength, or it entrenches below 40, cementing a bearish shift that could test bitcoin’s $80,000 support zone — one flagged by analysts as a critical level to watch for.</p></b>

                <p>Right now, my X feed is full of people who are giving up on Web3 gaming. I get it. Over $12 billion of venture capital funding has gone into it since 2020 and they haven’t seen the sort of breakout success that many expected. Even the best games haven’t reached anything close to mainstream scale. Token prices are down. Studios are shutting down. And everyone is exhausted.

But measuring Web3 gaming by token prices alone is like calling the internet a failure because of the dot-com crash — it ignores how far the technology has come and where it's headed. It’s missing the real story.

At its core, Web3 gaming is about giving players real ownership — not just of the in-game items that they buy and earn, but also their identities and achievements. In traditional games, players invest time, effort and money into digital assets that ultimately belong to the publisher. Web3 changes that. By putting assets on-chain, players can truly own what they earn—whether that’s tradable items like weapons or land, or non-transferable badges of reputation, guild history, or verifiable skill. It’s not just about buying and selling stuff — it’s about agency, persistence, and getting proper recognition for what you’ve built and what is really yours in the ecosystem.

The concept isn’t new. Players have wanted more control over their in-game assets for years. Look at the massive markets for CS:GO skins or World of Warcraft gold. But until now, those economies have been fragmented, restricted, or at risk of being shut down if a centralized publisher decides to shut it down or change the rules. Web3 makes these economies open, interoperable, player-owned and player-driven.

Ownership has always been the foundation of Web3 gaming, and play-to-earn was an experimental model that showed the potential for open and permissionless virtual economies on blockchain. Now, the industry is evolving with a stronger focus on sustainable economies and better tokenomics, deeper gameplay, and long-term player engagement.

But if you’re comparing Web3 gaming to Web2 gaming, you’ll be disappointed. Traditional gaming has had decades to fine-tune game design, build massive player bases, and develop business models that work, while Web3 gaming is still in its experimental phase. Sure, billions of dollars of investment can speed things up, but throwing money at a brand new category doesn’t magically buy it a track record or instantly create new games that people love.

I’ve been making games for over 20 years and I have seen every major shift get dismissed before it took over. Nobody believed mobile gaming could compete with PCs or consoles until it became bigger than both. Free-to-play was called a scam until it made more money and reached more players than ever before. Esports was a joke until stadiums sold out and prize pools hit millions. Digital skins were “worthless” before they became a multi-billion dollar market.

And now, Web3 gaming is at that same inflection point.

When I first heard about blockchain in 2018, everyone I knew in FinTech was talking about it. So of course I thought it was boring and I ignored it. It wasn’t until I learned about CryptoKitties that I actually took notice. When I saw people collecting, trading and actually owning these cute on-chain cats, that’s when I got excited because I knew they weren't like other in-game assets. CryptoKitties were digital things that no one could take away from you. As someone who’s spent their life grinding in games, and their career convincing others to grind the same — without really getting anything for it — that idea of digital ownership gave me a whole new way to think.

So I went all-in on blockchain games. But 2018 and 2019 were really tough times. Pretty much no one else cared back then. There was no support, no real funding, no clear idea of what these games could be beyond speculation, and (outside of a handful of believers) there was very little conviction. The market was in a deep bear cycle, and many teams either gave up or ran out of money before they could launch. Still, some of us kept building. We stayed lean, experimented, and learned everything the hard way. It feels similarly bad now, but not as bad as it was then. Looking back, I’m so glad we didn’t pack it in when success was just around the corner.

When Axie Infinity broke through in 2021, everything changed. Web3 founders like Jeffrey “Jihoz” Zirlin of Sky Mavis, Yat Siu of Animoca Brands, Sebastien Borget of The Sandbox, and me, went from being called crazy to visionary overnight. Suddenly, we were speaking on the main stage at conferences where we used to watch in the audience. We made news headlines and “Most Influential” lists. Investors who ignored our emails were asking how much they could put in. My email inbox filled up with fundraising decks pitching the next YGG.

Then in 2022, the market crashed, and just as quickly, we went back to being crazy. But that never really bothered me because crazy people are the ones who make big things happen.

Now, everyone’s asking: When is the next big Web3 game? The answer is this: good games take time. And if you look past the red candles to take notice of what exists already today, you’ll see we how much progress we’ve made since our industry was seeded in 2018:

In 2020, Axie Infinity had fewer than 500 daily players. Today, Ronin — the blockchain it built — has millions of active users, with 17 new games launched, and 134% growth in NFT trading volume in 2024 compared to 2023. It’s also gone permissionless, which means there will be more games, faster development, stronger network effects, and unpredictably big breakthroughs. Some of the biggest innovations in gaming like modding, free-to-play and esports came from unexpected places. By lowering the barrier to entry, a permissionless Ronin invites the kind of experimentation that could lead to the next Axie-scale success.

Pixels, a farming game on Ronin, hit a peak of 1.3 million daily active users (DAUs) and is holding strong now with around 250,000 DAUs even with its token down 96%. Players are spending more than they cash out, buying land, upgrading assets, and actually putting money back into the game, fueling the economy instead of extracting from it. This is how virtual economies should work, with real demand and strong retention. Most importantly, it is an indication that the play-to-earn model can work if done right.

Parallel, a trading card game (TCG) on Ethereum, just hosted a world championship in Las Vegas at the HyperX Arena — a venue that has hosted some of the biggest esports competitions from “League of Legends All-Stars” to “Street Fighter V’s Capcom Cup.” This was a prestigious event that saw some of the world’s best TCG players crossover from traditional titles like Hearthstone to become some of the first Web3 esports legends.

These are just a few examples, but they show the kind of traction we’re seeing: better infrastructure, growing communities, more sustainable virtual economies, digital ownership.

Those who FUD Web3 gaming today don’t understand it. They missed CryptoKitties in 2018, Axie in 2020, YGG in 2021, and they’ll miss the next wave too because they’re measuring the wrong metrics. Web3 is growing and innovating faster than any other sector in gaming. It’s not time to quit. It's time to double down. Let them call us whatever they want: crazy, delusional. Visionary, pioneering. It doesn’t change what we do. We’ve been here before. Stay the path.

                <p>Markets-wise, crypto was flat this week. Bitcoin was rangebound ($83,000 to $84,000). And the CoinDesk 20, which tracks about 80% of the market, stayed at about 2,600. Crypto prices suffered from being increasingly correlated with the wider financial markets, which are down on tariff worries and decreased corporate earnings. Some even said the bitcoin bull market was over.

But markets, of course, only tell part of the crypto story. There was a ton of stuff happening and much of it was positive for the industry’s future.

On the regulatory front, Washington agencies are gearing up for an historic “market structure” bill in Congress, Jesse Hamilton reported. Paul Atkins, someone who knows crypto intimately, is nearing confirmation as SEC Chair, as is OCC pick Jonathan Gould. Congress continues hearings on a stablecoin bill, as Tether continues to show its systemic importance (Kris Sandor reported). EU officials are fussing about USD hegemony of stablecoins, and are readying plans for a digital euro or CBDC (Jamie Crawley).

Eric Trump joined Metaplanet, Japan’s answer to Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, as the Trump family continues to bet privately and publicly on crypto’s success.

Our reporters did some great deep-dives on protocol projects. Oliver Knight lifted the lid on Cardano’s price surge following ADA’s (sort of) inclusion in a putative national crypto reserve. Interestingly, that project doesn’t measure success in total value locked (TVL), an otherwise universal metric, preferring real-world use cases.

Danny Nelson looked at Pump.fun’s aspirations to dominate DeFi trading on Solana DeFi (following its domination of Solana’s memecoin issuance).

Meanwhile bitcoin miners are feeling the pinch of lower hashrates and declining transaction fees, which has erased post-election gains, Tom Carreras reported.

Jamie Crawley explored the efforts of bitcoin developers to introduce zero-knowledge proofs to that blockchain. (TLDR: it’s hard to soft-fork blockchains with decentralization as good as bitcoin’s).

Our Asia team continued to kill it, particularly in markets coverage. Resident technical analysis wiz, Omkar Godbole, correctly reported on the Fed ending QT as well as highlighting how the Turkish lira's flash crash led to a surge in bitcoin volume in that country.

Shaurya Malwa continued his strong reporting on XRP, writing about Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse’s comments on XRP's chances of being added to the strategic reserve and on Ripple's IPO plans. Malwa also reported on Raydium's plan to start a pump.fun rival.

Sam Reynolds, who is based in Hong Kong, covered North Dakota passing a crypto ATM bill as well as reporting on how the man who stabbed Haru Invest CEO could face over a decade in prison.

And lastly, Parikshit Mishra's swift coverage of Kraken buying NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion trumped most of the competition.

It was one of those weeks when a lot happened under the hood. Prices may be in a plateau. But the industry continued to move forward on lots of fronts.

                <p>The Trump administration is preparing to restructure the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and integrate blockchain technology into its procurement system, Wired reported, citing a memo circulating among State Department staff.

The plan proposes rebranding the agency as U.S. International Humanitarian Assistance and moving it directly under the authority of the Secretary of State, Wired said. It would leverage a blockchain to trace aid distributions and enforce payment models based on outcomes rather than inputs.

“All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reportedly reads, adding that such an approach would encourage innovation and efficiency.

It’s unclear whether the blockchain would involve cryptocurrency or stablecoin usage, or simply act as a digital ledger.

USAID has been under scrutiny from the Trump administration since the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. DOGE has in the past proposed the use of blockchain technology to boost efficiency. The president froze USAID payments in a Jan. 20 executive order.</p></b>

                <p>South Korean financial authorities are planning sanctions against crypto exchanges who are operating illegally in the country, business newspaper Hankyung reported on Friday.

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) classified a number of exchanges who are not registered as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) as targets for sanctions, according to the report.

The exchanges targeted - BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix and KCEX - have been found to be operating Korean-language websites without reporting to FIU. For that reason, they are classed as illegal businesses, as per the country's regulations.

"We are currently reviewing blocking access to unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors through consultation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission," an FIU official said, accordinh to the report.

"We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between authorities, and we expect to see tangible measures taken within this year."

BitMEX, KuCoin and CoinW did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Last month, South Korean crypto exchange Upbit was prohibited from allowing new customers to transfer assets to its platform for three months due to non-compliance with its obligations as a regulated provider.

                <p>The German financial supervisory authority BaFin said it identified "serious deficiencies" in Ethena's USDe token, which the company calls a synthetic dollar, and forbade the issuer from offering it to the public with immediate effect.

The European Union's Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations for issuers of stablecoins, tokens whose value is tied to another asset, took effect on June 30 last year. Ethena GmbH has been issuing USDe since June 28, according to BaFin. Companies were allowed to continue issuing their tokens while applying for a MiCA license, unless ordered to stop.

"During the ongoing licensing process, BaFin has identified, among other things, serious deficiencies in the bank's business organization and violations of MiCAR requirements, such as those regarding asset reserves and compliance with capital requirements," the regulator said.

USDe counts as an asset-referenced token because it is "a crypto asset whose value stability is to be maintained by reference to other assets, rights, or currencies," BaFin said.

Ethena is the yield-generating protocol that markets the $5.4 billion token as a "synthetic dollar" with its price anchored at $1. The token uses cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short perpetual futures positions on various exchanges.

The strategy generates income for the protocol when perpetual funding rates are positive and passes on some of the income as yield to those who stake USDe (sUSDe). The protocol also issues the USDtb stablecoin, backed by BlackRock's tokenized Treasury bill fund.

"BaFin also has reasonable grounds to suspect that Ethena GmbH is publicly offering securities in Germany in the form of 'sUSDe' tokens of Ethena OpCo. Ltd. without the required securities prospectus," the regulator said.

Ethena said on X that it will "continue to evaluate alternative frameworks," after being notified that the "application under the MiCAR regulatory framework will not be approved."

Ethena's governance token, ENA, had dropped 6.5% in the past 24 hours, extending losses following the announcement, according to CoinMarketCap data.

                <p>The Lazarus Group, a hacking group closely associated with North Korean, holds more bitcoin (BTC) than Tesla (TSLA), the electric car manufacturer led by Elon Musk, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.

At press time, Lazarus held 13,441 BTC worth $1.14 billion, according to data source Arkham Intelligence. That's 16% more than Tesla's bitcoin stash of 11,509 BTC.

Lazarus Group's bitcoin holdings (Arkham Intelligence)

Last month, Lazarus Group struck crypto exchange Bybit, draining $1.4 billion in ether (ETH) from the platform. Recently, some of the stolen funds have been converted into bitcoin, with 12,836 BTC distributed across 9,117 unique wallets, as Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou confirmed.

Tesla acquired its bitcoin stash four years ago and has been HODLing ever since, making it the world's fourth-largest publicly listed company in terms of BTC holdings.

The striking contrast between Tesla and Lazarus Group emerged even as President Donald Trump's positive stance on cryptocurrency has sparked calls for accelerated BTC adoption among corporations and sovereign nations worldwide.

On Thursday, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to making the U.S. the "undisputed Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world." Against this backdrop, it will be interesting to see if Tesla and other U.S. corporations respond to being overshadowed by a North Korean hacker.

Meanwhile, the U.S. government holds 198,109 BTC worth over $16 billion, representing coins seized in enforcement actions. Trump recently announced the same as the strategic reserve.

                <p>Strategy (MSTR) will likely soon be in the market for additional sizable bitcoin purchases after pricing an upsized sale of its latest preferred stock issue.

The company sold 8.5M shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock at price of $85 each, raising roughly $711.2M. Strategy initially had hoped to raise $500M.

The latest series of preferred stock differs from the original STRK in that it comes with a higher coupon (10% versus 8%) and has no common share conversion provision.

The company at last check owned more than 499,200 bitcoin, so this coming fresh round of purchases should take the Strategy stack well above 500,000 tokens.

MSTR shares are down marginally in premarket action to just under $300. Bitcoin is steady at $84,000.</p></b>

                <p>The U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions watchdog removed Tornado Cash from its global blacklist Friday.

The crypto mixing tool has been accused of helping North Korea's Lazarus Group launder stolen funds from its various hacks and thefts, and the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control sanctioned it — meaning no U.S. person or anyone doing business with the U.S. could engage with it financially — multiple times. However, a federal appeals court ruled last November that OFAC couldn't sanction Tornado Cash's smart contracts because they weren't the "property" of any foreign national.

"We remain deeply concerned about the significant state-sponsored hacking and money laundering campaign aimed at stealing, acquiring, and deploying digital assets for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Kim regime," a press release from the U.S. Treasury Department said.

Another release from OFAC lists over 100 Ethereum (ETH) addresses that are being removed from the Specially Designated Nationals list, which is the record Treasury uses for maintaining its blacklist.

Roman Storm, one of the co-founders of Tornado Cash, faces a criminal trial this July over his alleged role developing the smart contracts and protocols. Another developer was charged but has not yet been arrested. After the Fifth Circuit's November ruling, Storm's lawyers filed a motion requesting the court reconsider its earlier decision to deny the dismissal of charges against him. That motion was smacked down in February, with Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) arguing that, whether or not Tornado Cash itself was subject to sanctions "does not affect the sanctions Defendant allegedly conspired to violate (those on the Lazarus Group)."

Storm's lawyer, Brian Klein of Waymaker LLP, told CoinDesk that he was "very pleased" to see the sanctions against Tornado Cash removed.

"Now the SDNY prosecutors should similarly reconsider their unfortunate decision to charge our client, and dismiss their case against him," Klein added.

In a statement, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. needs to "secure the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors."

In a Monday court filing, referenced by the Treasury in Friday's statement, the Treasury Department suggested it might not go so far as to remove the sanctions entirely.

"Vacating the designation of Tornado Cash in its entirety could have significantly 'disruptive consequences' for national security and law enforcement," the filing said.

The TORN token jumped 40% in the minutes after Treasury's statement.

Parker made $6.8 million on one position after going long on BTC just before Donald Trump's weekend announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve, per ZachXBT. He then turned around and made another $9 million going short BTC as the price pump quickly reversed.

All of his positions used 50x leverage - a high risk strategy as it means the liquidation price of a position is close to the entry point.

And it seems as though high risk gambling was this particular trader's speciality, as on-chain data suggests the wallet frequently interacted with Roobet, Gamdom, Shuffle, BC Game, & Metawin accounts - all crypto-based online casinos.

It turns out that the wallet connected to the trades was set as the drainer fee receiver on a phishing website in January, receiving $17.1K from a phishing draining customer in the same month, ZachXBT revealed.

The investigation then dives into a Solana wallet that was the first to interact with the trader's wallet. This SOL wallet made withdrawals from four casinos following an input validation exploit on a casino game. ZachXBT reached out to these casinos which provided him with a Telegram account of the user.

That Telegram account yielded verification that the trader was active on-chain at the same time as posting in derivatives trading chats on Telegram.

ZachXBT went one step further — finding a payment sent by the trader to an unnamed person on the HyperLiquid exchange. That transaction led to the uncovering of a phone number linked to a person called William Parker.

Parker last year was convicted and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail in Finland for stealing $1 million from two casinos in 2023 . He was served time in 2010 in the U.K. for multiple fraud charges related to hacking and gambling.</p></b>

                <p>WASHINGTON, DC-The US Securities Commission team has finally embraced the opportunity to work with the crypto industry to define a digital asset transaction supervision policy, Hester Peirce, chief of the agency's crypto task force, said.

The Securities Regulator is ready "to seriously find a viable structure," Peirce said at the agency meeting. First round table focused on cryptocurrency Friday. "I think we're ready for the spring to come," she said, referring to the event title of the day, "Spring Sprint Toward Crypt Clarity."

The task, according to Peirce: "Can we translate the characteristics of a title into a simple taxonomy that will cover the many different types of crypto that exist today and can exist in the future?"

Mark Uyeda, interim president of the agency, told reporters that despite the recent SEC policy statements that certain areas of the crypture sector are subject to securities laws - meme and mining currencies, so far - is a "definitive possibility" that others are defined as titles.

"We are advancing on several trails here," he said in response to a question from Coindesk. Each statement issued so far "is ultimately a team statement" that T has legal backing, but he said the round table represents the entire commission - currently three members - analyzing how a "potential interpretation of the commission may seem."

In his opening speech at the event, Uyeda, who was appointed by President Donald Trump as SEC awaits Paul Atkins's confirmation by the Senate, argued that the agency should have been more willing in recent years to make such public interpretations.

"When judicial opinions created the uncertainties of our participants in the past, the commission and their team intervened to provide guidance," said Uyeda. "This approach to using common rules to explain the commission process or releases, instead of execution actions, should have been considered to classify crypto assets under federal security laws."

Discussion

The discussion panel was attended by a dozen securities lawyers in the crypto industry that evaluated specific issues that observed when advising companies.

"What is the biggest question you face when trying to deal with this issue?" Asked moderator Troy Paredes, a former SEC councilor who now runs the consulting firm Strategies, Sarah Brennan, a legal consultant at Delphi Ventures and one of the 11 panelists.

"The spectrum of the application of securities laws made early -stage projects on the market take a very similar direction to the [initial public offers], where they remain deprived longer," she replied.

"These assets in the traditional model are designed to have a wide and wide distribution, and most of the market is protecting this based on the application of securities laws, so it looks a lot like traditional markets, where people will organize to a bag listing without this wide dissemination or price support or really launch technology."

The panel was attended by critics of the sector, as well as lawyers who worked to develop the sector.

"It doesn't matter if you're talking about performance farms, ostriches or orange orchards, the purpose of securities regulation was to involve all this in a very large, wide and principle-based regulation," said Sec John Reed Stark. Its concern is that even in 2025, much of the market is useless.

"If it was all over tomorrow and you were speculating, you would matter," he said.

Legislator questions

Before the round table, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep Jake Achincloss, both Massachusetts Democrats, wrote an open letter to Uyeda asking about the team's secdeclaration about Memecoinse as developed.

The letter wondered if someone at SEC communicated with the White House about the statement, whether the White House's Crypto Working Group had advised SEC to do something and why the team's statement was not included in formal regulation.

Warren and Achinclloss also asked SEC to explain how she would specifically define memecoins as distinct from "general cryptocurrency", how she would distinguish between real memecoins and memecoins that attend the team's statement and which memecoins to analyze when writing her team statement.</p></b>

                <p>The crypto industry’s Fairshake political action committee is flooding Republican candidates with last-minute money in special congressional elections in Florida.

Two U.S. House of Representatives seats had been opened by resignations when their occupants were tapped for posts in President Donald Trump’s administration, including that of Matt Gaetz, the politician Trump sought for the attorney general job who was tied to accusations of sex with a minor and drug abuse. The open seats are pivotal for Republicans' control of their tight margin in their House majority, so Democrats have devoted tremendous money and attention to them.

An affiliate of the Fairshake super PAC, which is set up to devote money to candidate advertising independent of campaigns' involvement, had already weighed in during the primary there to tap crypto-friendly candidates. Now it's spending another $1.2 million to support state Senator Randy Fine, who is seeking the seat vacated by Trump's national security advisor, Michael Waltz, according to PAC spokesman Josh Vlasto. And it's putting about $345,000 toward the state's chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, to fill Gaetz' seat.

Both Republican candidates in the April 1 special election check Fairshake's primary box: They support digital assets. Early voting is set to begin this weekend, and Democrats have also devoted money. However, the seats have leaned significantly Republican in recent voting.

Overall, the House is short four members, because two Democrat members from Texas and Arizona died this month. If Democrats managed to win all four seats, Republicans would be left with a single-vote majority.</p></b>

                <p>The US Treasury Department Sanction Regulator removed the tornado cash from its global black list on Friday.

The crypto mixing tool has been accused of helping North Korea Lazarus Group to wash funds stolen from its various hacks and theft, and the US Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control has sanctioned it - which means no US person or anyone who does business with the US could be financially involved with them - several times. However, a Federal Court of Appeals ruled last November that the OFAC T could sanction the tornado cash intelligent contracts because they were "property" of no foreign citizen.

"We are still deeply concerned about the significant state -sponsored hacking and money laundering campaign to steal, purchase and implement digital assets for the Korea Democratic Republic (RPDC) and the Kim regime," a US Treasury Department press release.

Another OFAC release lists more than 100 Ethhereum (ETH) addresses that are being removed from the list of specially designated citizens, which is the record that the treasure uses to keep its black list.

Roman Storm, one of the co -founders of Tornado Cash, faces a criminal trial in July for his supposed role in developing intelligent contracts and protocols. Another developer was accused, but has not yet been arrested. Following the decision of the fifth circuit in November, Storm's lawyers filed a motion requesting the court to reconsider his previous decision to deny the rejection of the accusations against him. This motion was rejected in February, with Judge Katherine Polk Failla from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) arguing that whether or not the tornado cash was subject to sanctions "does not affect the sanctions that the defendant supposedly conspired to violate (those of Lazarus Group)".

Storm's lawyer Brian Klein of Waymaker LLP told Coindesk that he was "very pleased" to see the sanctions against tornado cash removed.

"Now SDNY promoters should reconsider their unfortunate decision to accuse our client and reject the case against them," Klein added.

In a statement, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US needs to "protect the digital asset industry from North Korea abuse and other illicit actors."

In a Monday's lawsuit, referenced by the Treasury in Friday's statement, the Treasury Department suggested that it may not go so far as to remove sanctions completely.

"Nullifying the designation of Tornado Cash in its entirety could have 'significantly disturbing consequences' for national security and law enforcement," the document says.

Token made it jumped 40% minutes after the Treasury statement.

                <p>Strategy (MSTR) will probably be soon in the market for considerable additional purchases of Bitcoin after pricing a higher sale of its last issuance of preferred shares.

The company sold8.5 million shares of its 10% Series to perpetual Strife Preferred Stock at a price of US $ 85 each, raising approximately $ 711.2 million. Strategy initially expected to raise $ 500 million.

The latest series of preferred actions differs from original STRK because it comes with a higher coupon (10% versus 8%) and has no willingness to convert ordinary actions.

In the last check, the company had over 499,200 bitcoin, so this new purchase round should take the Strategy pile well above 500,000 tokens.

MSTR's shares have fallen marginally in the pre-market action to just under $ 300. Bitcoin is stable at $ 84,000.</p></b>

                <p>The German financial supervisory authority BaFin said it identified "serious deficiencies" in Ethena's USDe token, which the company calls a synthetic dollar, and forbade the issuer from offering it to the public with immediate effect.

The European Union's Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations for issuers of stablecoins, tokens whose value is tied to another asset, took effect on June 30 last year. Ethena GmbH has been issuing USDe since June 28, according to BaFin. Companies were allowed to continue issuing their tokens while applying for a MiCA license, unless ordered to stop.

"During the ongoing licensing process, BaFin has identified, among other things, serious deficiencies in the bank's business organization and violations of MiCAR requirements, such as those regarding asset reserves and compliance with capital requirements," the regulator said.

USDe counts as an asset-referenced token because it is "a crypto asset whose value stability is to be maintained by reference to other assets, rights, or currencies," BaFin said.

Ethena is the yield-generating protocol that markets the $5.4 billion token as a "synthetic dollar" with its price anchored at $1. The token uses cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short perpetual futures positions on various exchanges.

The strategy generates income for the protocol when perpetual funding rates are positive and passes on some of the income as yield to those who stake USDe (sUSDe). The protocol also issues the USDtb stablecoin, backed by BlackRock's tokenized Treasury bill fund.

"BaFin also has reasonable grounds to suspect that Ethena GmbH is publicly offering securities in Germany in the form of 'sUSDe' tokens of Ethena OpCo. Ltd. without the required securities prospectus," the regulator said.

Ethena said on X that it will "continue to evaluate alternative frameworks," after being notified that the "application under the MiCAR regulatory framework will not be approved."

Ethena's governance token, ENA, had dropped 6.5% in the past 24 hours, extending losses following the announcement, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Parker made $6.8 million on one position after going long on BTC just before Donald Trump's weekend announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve, per ZachXBT. He then turned around and made another $9 million going short BTC as the price pump quickly reversed.

All of his positions used 50x leverage - a high risk strategy as it means the liquidation price of a position is close to the entry point.

And it seems as though high risk gambling was this particular trader's speciality, as on-chain data suggests the wallet frequently interacted with Roobet, Gamdom, Shuffle, BC Game, & Metawin accounts - all crypto-based online casinos.

It turns out that the wallet connected to the trades was set as the drainer fee receiver on a phishing website in January, receiving $17.1K from a phishing draining customer in the same month, ZachXBT revealed.

The investigation then dives into a Solana wallet that was the first to interact with the trader's wallet. This SOL wallet made withdrawals from four casinos following an input validation exploit on a casino game. ZachXBT reached out to these casinos which provided him with a Telegram account of the user.

That Telegram account yielded verification that the trader was active on-chain at the same time as posting in derivatives trading chats on Telegram.

ZachXBT went one step further — finding a payment sent by the trader to an unnamed person on the HyperLiquid exchange. That transaction led to the uncovering of a phone number linked to a person called William Parker.

Parker last year was convicted and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail in Finland for stealing $1 million from two casinos in 2023 . He was served time in 2010 in the U.K. for multiple fraud charges related to hacking and gambling.</p></b>

                <p>South Korean financial authorities are planning sanctions against crypto exchanges who are operating illegally in the country, business newspaper Hankyung reported on Friday.

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) classified a number of exchanges who are not registered as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) as targets for sanctions, according to the report.

The exchanges targeted - BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix and KCEX - have been found to be operating Korean-language websites without reporting to FIU. For that reason, they are classed as illegal businesses, as per the country's regulations.

"We are currently reviewing blocking access to unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors through consultation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission," an FIU official said, accordinh to the report.

"We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between authorities, and we expect to see tangible measures taken within this year."

BitMEX, KuCoin and CoinW did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Last month, South Korean crypto exchange Upbit was prohibited from allowing new customers to transfer assets to its platform for three months due to non-compliance with its obligations as a regulated provider.

                <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. — The staff at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has embraced the chance to finally work with the crypto industry to hash out policy for overseeing digital assets transactions, said Commissioner Hester Peirce, the head of the agency's crypto task force.

The securities regulator is ready "to seek earnestly to find a workable framework," Peirce said at the agency's first crypto-focused roundtable on Friday. "I think we're ready for the spring ahead," she said, referring to the title of the day's event, the "Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity."

The task, according to Peirce: "Can we translate the characteristics of a security into a simple taxonomy that will cover the many different types of crypto assets that exist today and may exist in the future?"

Mark Uyeda, the agency's acting chairman, told reporters that despite recent SEC policy statements that certain areas of the crypto sector aren't subject to securities laws — memecoins and mining, so far — it's a "definitely possibility" that others will be defined as securities.

"We're moving on multiple tracks here," he said in answer to a question from CoinDesk. Each statement issued so far "ultimately is a staff statement" that doesn't have legal backing, but he said the roundtable represents the entire commission — currently three members — looking at what a "potential commission interpretation might look like."

In his opening remarks at the event, Uyeda, who was appointed by President Donald Trump as the SEC awaits a Senate confirmation of Paul Atkins, argued that the agency should have been more willing in recent years to make such interpretations public.

"When judicial opinions have created uncertainty from our participants in the past, the commission and its staff have stepped in to provide guidance," Uyeda said. "This approach of using common rulemaking for explaining the commission's process or releases rather than enforcement actions, should have been considered for classifying crypto assets under the federal security laws."

Panel discussion

The panel discussion saw a dozen securities attorneys in the crypto sector weigh in on the specific issues they saw as they advised companies.

"What's the biggest question that you face in trying to wrestle with this question?," moderator Troy Paredes, a former SEC commissioner who now runs consulting firm Paredes Strategies, asked Sarah Brennan, the general counsel at Delphi Ventures and one of the 11 panelists.

"The specter of the application of securities laws has moved early-stage projects in the market to sort of take an arc very similar to [initial public offerings], where they stay private longer," she replied.

"These assets in the traditional model are designed to have wide, broad early distribution and most of the market is hedging that on the application of securities laws, so it ends up looking a lot like your traditional markets where people will marshal their way to an exchange listing without that broad dissemination or price support or actually fully launching the technology."

The panel featured critics of the industry alongside attorneys who have worked to develop the sector.

"Whether you're talking yield farms or ostrich farms or orange groves, the whole point of securities regulation was to wrap that all up into a very big, broad, principles-based regulation," former SEC attorney John Reed Stark said. His concern is that, even in 2025, much of the market lacks utility.

"If it all went away tomorrow and you weren't speculating in it, you wouldn't care," he said.

Legislator questions

Ahead of the roundtable, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Jake Auchincloss, both Massachusetts Democrats, wrote an open letter to Uyeda asking about the SEC's staff statement on memecoins and how it was developed.

The letter asked whether anyone at the SEC communicated with the White House about the statement, whether the White House's crypto working group had directed the SEC to do anything and why the staff statement was not built into formal rulemaking.

Warren and Auchincloss also asked the SEC to explain how it would specifically define memecoins as distinct from "general cryptocurrency," how it would distinguish between actual memecoins and memecoins that don't meet the staff statement, and which memecoins the SEC analyzed in drafting its staff statement.

NFTs next?

Peirce told reporters on the event's sidelines that a next possibility for another agency crypto policy statement (following recent statements for memecoins and mining) could be non-fungible tokens. She said NFTs could probably benefit from clarity on the agency's thinking.

"I think we'll see that we could do it on NFTs, as well," she told reporters on the sidelines of the agency's crypto roundtable on Friday. "We could have done that a long time ago."

When asked by CoinDesk whether non-binding, unofficial staff statements are the way to approach policy signals from the agency, she said this is a response to recent years in which the agency was reticent to talk about any of it.

"There is certainly a role for notice-and-comment rulemaking. but I think not when you're just saying, 'This is how we're looking at the law,'" she said. "You don't need that."

She also addressed reports that federal budget slashing will lead to a cut of SEC staff of hundreds of people.

"It's always sad to me when you lose someone with a lot of experience, but people do come and go from the SEC," she said. "They do retire, and so we have to have a deep bench."
