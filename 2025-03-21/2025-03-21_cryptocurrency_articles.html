The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is holding its first crypto regulation roundtable, focusing on defining the security status of crypto assets.

The event marks the beginning of a series of discussions by the SEC's newly formed crypto task force, which could have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.

According to CNBC's Tanaya Macheel, the SEC's efforts aim to provide clearer guidelines on whether certain crypto assets should be classified as securities, an issue that has created tension between the SEC and the crypto industry.

“The former administration's SEC targeted many companies for their involvement with crypto, alleging most coins were unregistered securities but failing to give clear guidelines to follow to avoid being targeted,” Macheel said.

Today's roundtable could also have implications for Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds. While the SEC recently stated that meme coins are not considered securities, the agency has yet to clarify its stance on staking services linked to crypto ETFs, a factor that could affect future growth in the market.

“The appetite for ETH ETFs has been tepid compared to Bitcoin ETFs, and one of the big reasons is the inability to earn a staking yield on those funds,” Macheel said. “If the SEC can iron out some of the uncertainties about those services being potential unregistered securities, it could change the outlook for ETH ETFs.”

Despite the regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stable in recent weeks. Macheel noted that Bitcoin is trading around its 200-day moving average near $84,000, which traders see as a key technical support level.

“If it can hold the 200-day, that's great,” she said. “Longer term, Ethereum to me is more peculiar. It's just been left for dead. There are some big short positions with hedge funds, but Bitcoin has clearly outperformed.”

Ethereum's underperformance relative to Bitcoin has been a notable trend. While Bitcoin has held steady, Ethereum has struggled to gain momentum despite increasing institutional interest in ETH-based financial products.

Macheel also pointed out that the broader crypto market has seen relatively subdued activity compared to other asset classes like gold.

“Gold broke $3,000 this year while Bitcoin's been sitting in the low $80,000 range,” she said. “Sometimes the most boring assets are the biggest winners.”

Investors are watching closely to see if the SEC's roundtable will provide clarity on staking and the broader regulatory framework for crypto assets. A more defined regulatory environment could pave the way for increased adoption and new financial products tied to crypto assets.

Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency “mixer” designed to make it more difficult to track cryptocurrency transactions, was sanctioned by the Biden administration and made illegal due to its usage in facilitating some significant laundering schemes. But Donald Trump, the crypto president, has brought it back. The United States Treasury Department announced Friday that it will lift sanctions against Tornado Cash, allowing it to be used again to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions.

Here's the quick and dirty back story on Tornado Cash: The protocol was launched in 2019 as a way for cryptocurrency users to obscure ownership over currency. You take “tainted” money (i.e., coins that have been identified and associated with a person), run it through Tornado Cash where it gets split up, mixed into a larger pool, and moved around until it is effectively “clean” and unidentifiable. By 2022, it was taking heat from the Department of the Treasury because it was allegedly used by malicious actors to launder cryptocurrency stolen as part of a hack.

Once Biden's Treasury Department got around to issuing its sanctions in August 2022, it accused Tornado Cash of laundering more than $7 billion, including nearly $500 million that the agency claimed had been stolen by the North Korean-sponsored hacking collective the Lazarus Group. By sanctioning the protocol and its founder, the Biden administration basically made it illegal to use Tornado Cash in the United States.

It seems, though, that the sanctions may not have been all that effective (and, according to a federal court, not all that legal). A study found that usage of Tornado Cash continued to climb despite its placement on the blacklist. And last year, a federal appeals court ruled that the Treasury overstepped its legal authority by sanctioning the protocol—an outcome that was arrived at because the blacklist is designed to punish foreign entities, and Tornado Cash, which runs autonomously via self-executing smart contracts, is not owned or operated by a foreign national.

This brings us to today, when the Trump administration is officially lifting the restrictions on Tornado Cash, allowing it to once again function in the United States. Crypto people are certainly celebrating the move, calling it a win for “privacy.”  Others, like Democratic Congressman Sean Casten, called it “one of the most dangerous and irresponsible things coming out of the Trump White House.”

Casten might be going a little hard there; typically, additional privacy is a good thing even if it means that some people might use it maliciously, like encrypted messaging. Of course, there's an argument that the average person has use for encrypted messaging and a crypto tumbler is basically only useful for criminal activity. But there's a world in which it doesn't really matter either way—tools for tracing on-chain activity, even those that go through efforts to hide the details, are becoming more sophisticated and some experts believe transactions on Tornado Cash are already traceable with enough effort.

According to Balaji (@balajis), Tornado Cash has been declared legal, suggesting a significant development in privacy-focused cryptocurrency trading platforms. The legal status could potentially lead to increased usage and confidence in privacy-centric crypto transactions, impacting market dynamics. This decision may influence traders who prioritize anonymity and could lead to a reassessment of risk management strategies in crypto trading portfolios.

Robbie Mitchnick isn't buying all the scepticism around Ethereum. 

It's true: When the crypto market surged following the election of Donald Trump as president last November, Ether was the only major cryptocurrency not to hit an all-time high. 

But Mitchnik, BlackRock's head of digital assets, said concern surrounding the Ethereum blockchain has been “overdone.”

“There's a lot to be optimistic about,” Mitchnick said Thursday at Blockworks' Digital Asset Summit in New York.

“When you look at our experience, take BUIDL as an example, there was no question that the blockchain that we would start our tokenisation on would be Ethereum.”

Mitchnik was referring to BUIDL, a tokenised treasuries product on Ethereum that topped $1 billion in assets under management last week.

It was a quiet win for the second most valuable blockchain network. 

And to hear Mitchnik tell it, Ethereum could notch another win should US regulators approve staked exchange-traded-funds.

BlackRock's influence shouldn't be underestimated. 

As the world's largest investment firm with $10 trillion in assets, the New York-based firm changed crypto investing when it cannonballed into the pool last January. 

That month, BlackRock, launched an exchange traded funds, or ETFs, for Bitcoin. In July, it launched its Ethereum ETF, ETHA. 

The company's Bitcoin ETF, with more than $51 billion net assets, helped usher in a new era for crypto investing. 

And BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been an avid booster of tokenisation, putting securities like stocks and bonds onchain. 

Yet Ethereum has been struggling in recent months.

The blockchain has been roiled by discontent among investors who bought its Ether cryptocurrency.

It has plunged further than Bitcoin amid a broader market slump triggered by Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policies. Ether was recently trading under $2,000 for the first time since November 2023.

That has prompted soul-searching among prominent Ethereum developers and calls for restructuring at the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit run by the blockchain's most prominent co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.

‘There's a bit of a misconception out there that ETH ETFs have been meh.'

BlackRock began its crypto experiment in 2020 with a private, company-run blockchain, according to Mitchnick.

“One of the very clear takeaways from that work was that public blockchains were actually where the future would be in this space. So we made a pretty decisive pivot,” he said.

“That decision appears to have been the right one.”

He also defended Ethereum ETFs, which have disappointed some investors in light of the record-setting debut of Bitcoin ETFs.

As of Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs were on track to record their first weekly gains since the beginning of February, according to analysts at JPMorgan. 

Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, had shed $84 million since Monday.

“There's a bit of a misconception out there that ETH ETFs have been meh,” Mitchnick said.

He added that ETHA saw $6 billion in inflows in its first six months. 

“The number of ETFs historically who have had more than that is a very short list,” he continued.

“But when you compare it to IBIT and the Bitcoin ETF complex generally, it doesn't look that amazing. When you compare it to the actual ETF universe, it's actually been incredibly successful.” 

Nevertheless, Ether ETFs would benefit immensely from adding staking, Mitchnick said.

Staking is an Ethereum feature that allows users to lock up their tokens in return for a modest annual yield. 

With the Ether backing ETHA and other ETFs sitting dormant, it could be staked to drive additional value to investors — if only regulators would let them.

In February, NYSE Arca filed a proposed rule change to allow the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Mini Trust — ETHE and EZET respectively — to stake their Ether holdings.

Industry advocates have pushed for staking in ETFs. 

They argue that “including staking as a feature in certain ETPs will benefit investors, more accurately reflect the benefits of native network assets.

It would also permit issuers to support the security of the networks in which the assets operate, according to a memorandum submitted by Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital to the SEC Crypto Task Force.

“There's obviously a next phase in the potential evolution of this,” Mitchnick said.

“There's no question it's less perfect for ETH today without staking. Staking yield is a meaningful part of how you can generate investment return in this space.”

 “If it's budget neutral and doesn't cost the taxpayer a dime, we'll see whatever creative ideas we can come up with,” said Hines. 

The Trump administration appears poised to grow its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after the White House's crypto council head suggested budget-neutral ways for acquiring the digital asset. 

“There's been countless ideas” about how the government can acquire more Bitcoin (BTC), Bo Hines, executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said in an interview with the Crypto in America podcast.

Perhaps the best way of doing so would be to realize the gains on the government's gold certificates, which are priced far less than bullion is actually worth today. 

“I'll actually point you to Senator [Cynthia] Lummis' Bitcoin Act of 2025, in which she believes that we can identify the real true value of some of these gold certificates,” Hines said. 

“If we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin,” he said.

As the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis explains, all gold certificates held at Fed banks are “computed at a statutory price of $42.22 per troy ounce.” By comparison, spot gold is currently valued at more than $3,000 an ounce.

Senator Cynthia Lummis' proposed BITCOIN Act of 2025 lists “Federal Reserve System gold certificates” as one source of funding for Bitcoin purchases. 

The bill requires that Fed banks “tender all outstanding gold certificates in their custody to the Treasury Secretary” so that the secretary can issue new certificates “that reflect the fair market value price of the gold held against such certificates by the Treasury.”

Hines said he's open to any ideas about how to grow the reserve, so long as it “doesn't cost the taxpayer a dime.” That's the crux of budget-neutral strategies for acquiring Bitcoin laid out in President Donald Trump's March 6 executive order. 

The US government currently holds roughly 207,000 BTC seized in criminal and civil proceedings. By default, this makes America the largest known Bitcoin holder among nation-states.

During the interview, Hines reiterated Bitcoin's special status, suggesting that the White House crypto council was treating the strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile very differently. 

“The reason we structured the [Strategic Bitcoin Reserve] the way we did is because Bitcoin is different. It's unique; it's a commodity, not a security,” said Hines, adding:

The White House rushed to defend Bitcoin's special status shortly after President Trump announced plans for a digital asset stockpile, which included a smattering of large-cap altcoins. Even Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that Bitcoin would be treated differently from the rest of the altcoins listed.

In addition to its Bitcoin acquisition targets, the Trump administration is making significant headway on cryptocurrency legislation through bipartisan cooperation. 

According to Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, Congress should be able to pass a stablecoin bill and crypto market structure bill this year.

Major cryptocurrency Bitcoin BTCUSD may be on the verge of a substantial price collapse, according to popular technical analysis indicator Bollinger Bands. 

Represented by the 20-day moving average and deviations out of it - one up and one down - the indicator forms a sort of price range in which investors can estimate what the current bias for the asset is, - if it is oversold or overbought. 

And for Bitcoin, the Bollinger Bands paint quite a grim picture.TradingView">

Following all the price perturbations of late, the price of the biggest cryptocurrency found itself under the middle band on the daily price chart. It is all simple now for BTC to be honest; if the daily candle closes there, then the possibility of the price falling to a lower band increases. 

This may mean an almost 7% downward movement from current levels, right below $78,000 for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin BTCUSD price scenarios

If the price of the leading cryptocurrency manages to pull above the 20-day moving average, it will be a powerful signal about the bullish intentions of traders regarding BTC and will change the bias for Bitcoin to reach the upper band. That one is currently at $92,150 - up almost 10%.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves because, as history often teaches, price movements rarely happen in isolation, and a single indicator never tells the full story. There are market sentiment, macroeconomic context and liquidity levels. 

Short squeezes, unexpected news catalysts or even a sudden surge in retail buying could push Bitcoin back above the middle band, invalidating the bearish outlook entirely.

And yet, if BTC does slide below that lower band, well, it would not be the first time the market witnessed an aggressive downturn that sent leveraged traders scrambling to cover their positions. A cascade of liquidations? Not out of the question.

Strategy's robust fundraising highlights investor attraction to yield, but its Bitcoin strategy challenges liquidity.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, revealed that it secured over $700 million from a recent preferred stock offering designed to purchase more Bitcoin.

On March 21, the firm confirmed the sale of 8.5 million shares of its Series A Perpetual STRF Preferred Stock. Each share was priced at $85 and offered a 10% annual dividend.

Strategy's STRF aimed initially to raise $500 million, but it surpassed the target by over 40% by raising $711 million.

This latest issue does not allow conversion into common shares, unlike the company's previous STRK offering, which came with an 8% yield and conversion rights.

Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, pointed out that investor appetite for STRF was driven by fixed income rather than exposure to Strategy's volatile stock.

He noted that the higher yield and improved pricing terms contributed to the stronger response, which contributed to STRF raising more funds than STRK.

While the capital raise boosts Strategy's buying power, concerns about the company's ability to manage long-term obligations are growing.

Strategy holds over 499,000 BTC—worth over $40 billion—and has built its corporate identity around aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. However, its decision to avoid selling holdings has left the company with limited liquidity.

Bitwise pointed out that this situation has led to a drop in liquidity ratios. Its cash ratio has fallen from 2.10 in 2019 to just 0.11 in 2024.

However, Bitwise maintains that bankruptcy risk remains low. Even under a severe scenario—Bitcoin dropping to $30,000 by September 2027—the company would only need to liquidate about 7.3% of its Bitcoin to meet a $1.1 billion bond obligation.

Nevertheless, Bitwise has suggested new strategies to strengthen the firm's cash flow. One recommendation involves lending half of its Bitcoin at a 4% annual return, which could generate enough income to cover interest payments and dividends.

Another approach includes covered call options, a method already adopted by firms like Japan's Metaplanet.

Bitwise concluded that the recent implementation of FASB would allow Strategy to report its BTC holdings at their fair market value, which would:

“Enable the company to reflect its Bitcoin holdings more accurately, leading to a higher reported book value and more transparent financials. As a result, Strategy's earnings volatility will decrease, better aligning its financial statements with its long-term Bitcoin strategy.”

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto has been on a wild ride since President Donald Trump's presidential election win in November. Prices surged as investors got excited about the Trump administration's friendly approach toward digital currency. However, weak economic data and an intense market sell-off during the past month has spilled into the cryptocurrency sector, sending prices way down from recent highs.

Crypto has really only been around for a little more than 15 years, so the investment community still has a lot to learn about digital assets. But the sector has often traded in a fashion similar to high-flying tech stocks, so it can't be a complete surprise to see it sell off with the broader market.

Still, the perennial bull Michael Saylor, who co-founded Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, in 1989, and is still its executive chairman, recommends investors buy one top cryptocurrency that he thinks can soar 15,810% over time.

If you know who Saylor is and have been following him during the past five years, then you know that the token he is referring to is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. In 2020, when Strategy, which used to primarily be a data intelligence company, was struggling, Saylor chose to take most of the company's remaining cash and start purchasing hoards of the crypto. It hasn't stopped since and has seen its stock surge, along with Bitcoin's price.

Interestingly, Strategy's stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. The big reason is that the company has been able to tap the capital markets to access funding that it can use to purchase the crypto, essentially making it a levered play on the coin. Strategy now owns about 2% of all bitcoins outstanding.

Last year, Saylor made a bold call, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $13 million by 2045, which implies 15,810% upside from current prices (as of March 18). He said: "My long-term forecast is 21 years, 29% ARR (annual rate of return). Right now we're 60% ARR, it will decelerate toward 20% ARR over the next 21 years, and the volatility will decelerate."

Another reason Saylor thinks that Bitcoin can explode is that it makes up such a small fraction of global wealth (0.1% when it traded at $65,000). However, he sees this share increasing. At $13 million, Bitcoin would make up 7% of global wealth, which he views as a plausible scenario.

Like many other Bitcoin bulls, Saylor also believes the Trump administration is a huge catalyst for the sector. So far, the administration has taken a much more pro-crypto approach than former President Joe Biden's administration. Trump has placed pro-crypto officials in his cabinet and has pro-crypto advisors. We've already seen the Securities and Exchange Commission put its lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance on hold and move to drop a lawsuit against Coinbase.

Trump also issued an executive order to create a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. Although most of the tokens that will go into these stockpiles will come from cryptocurrencies seized by the Treasury Department, the Bitcoin reserve will be able to buy additional coins, as long as the purchases are at no cost to the American taxpayers and are budget-neutral.

While Bitcoin has fallen from a peak of more than $109,000 this year into the low $80,000s as of this writing, Saylor has held firm. In late February, he wrote on X, "Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin." Strategy has also continued to buy more Bitcoin and is looking to raise more capital to buy still more.

Will it hit $13 million? It's impossible to know. Although Saylor has been right during the past five years and continued to buy Bitcoin as its price has soared, his thesis looks like napkin math at best. That's not to say that it won't continue to climb. I am bullish long term on the digital coin because of its potential to hedge inflation with its finite supply of 21 million tokens.

However, as I mentioned above, it's not only a fairly new asset but also extremely volatile, so while I think it's a good asset to have exposure to, I see no reason to be as aggressive as Saylor and Strategy.

Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes around $84,000 at the time of writing on Friday after recovering nearly 2% so far this week. The recent announcement by the United States (US) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining rewards are not securities could boost BTC investors' confidence. 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision to keep interest rates unchanged and maintain its rate cut forecast for the year, along with a net inflow of $661.20 million from the US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), have supported Bitcoin's mild recovery this week.

The US SEC announced on Thursday that the PoW mining rewards are not securities. The statement revealed that both solo mining and mining pools do not fall under US securities laws as they do not require the efforts of a central entity or entrepreneurial figure to generate profits.

This announcement provides Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with regulatory clarity, reduces legal risks, boosts investor and miner confidence, reinforces its commodity status, and could potentially drive price and market growth.

JUST IN:  SEC confirms Bitcoin & crypto mining does not violate securities laws.

This week, the institutional demand for Bitcoin showed signs of recovery. According to Coinglass data, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $661.20 million until Thursday, halting the sell-off seen over the past weeks. Bitcoin's price could recover further if this inflow continues and intensifies, indicating a reduction in sell-side pressure.

Bitcoin's price recovered nearly 5% on Wednesday, reaching a high of $87,000, bolstered by the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged and maintain its rate cut forecast for the year. 

However, Fed officials trimmed their growth forecast for the year amid the growing uncertainty over the impact of US President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies on economic activity. Since February, President Trump has imposed a flat 25% duty on steel and aluminum and threatened to impose reciprocal and sectoral tariffs taking effect on April 2, fueling worries about a global trade war. 

On the same day, Donald Trump posted on the Truth Social platform, calling on the Fed to lower interest rates as tariffs start to hurt the economy.

Trump posted: “ The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!”



In addition to supporting macroeconomic data this week, global uncertainty also eases slightly. Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in the Ukraine war. 

Moreover, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Trump agreed to work together to end the protracted Russia-Ukraine war, further boosting investors' confidence toward risky assets like Bitcoin.

However, traders should also keep an eye on the rising tension in Gaza. The Israeli military said that it launched a limited ground incursion into Gaza a day after an aerial bombardment of the Strip that shattered the two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas. Moreover, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of fierce war expansion, which could hinder investors' confidence and lead to a risk-off sentiment in the crypto market.

The Blockworks Digital Asset Summit on Thursday made history as the first sitting US President, Donald Trump, spoke at the event. During his speech, Trump called for US dollar dominance and vowed to make America a crypto superpower.

In an exclusive interview ahead of the summit, Bitfinex Analysts told FXStreet, “President Donald Trump's address at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City marks a significant milestone, as it will be the first time a sitting US president has spoken at a cryptocurrency conference.”

The analyst continued, “Historically, political endorsements have influenced Bitcoin's market dynamics. For instance, following President Trump's announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve, Bitcoin experienced a 7.2% surge intra-day. Similarly, his re-election in 2024, accompanied by pro-crypto sentiments, propelled Bitcoin to surpass the $100,000 mark.”

“Broader macroeconomic factors, such as trade policies and ongoing tariff negotiations, will play a far more significant role in shaping the long-term impact on digital asset markets. While Blockworks' involvement suggests a well-organized media event, the fundamental outlook for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remains unchanged,” Bitfinex Analysts told FXStreet.

Moreover, the US SEC's Crypto Task Force holds the first-ever roundtable on crypto asset regulation on Friday. This roundtable aims to discuss regulatory approaches for crypto assets, building on the SEC's efforts to foster innovation while protecting investors. The roundtable will also be open to the public.

Bitcoin's price broke and closed above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on Wednesday, reaching a high of $87,000 that day. However, it failed to find support and declined 3% on Thursday, closing below it. At the time of writing on Friday, it continues to edge lower, around $84,000.

If BTC continues its correction, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $78,258.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 45 after being rejected from its neutral level of 50 on Wednesday, indicating rising bearish momentum. If the RSI continues to slide, Bitcoin's price could fall sharply.

However, if BTC recovers, breaks, and finds support around the 200-day EMA at $85,508, it could extend the recovery to retest its key psychological level of $90,000.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Businesses can benefit from implementing cryptocurrency in their blockchain applications in several ways:

Overall, implementing cryptocurrency in blockchain applications can provide businesses with cost savings, efficiency improvements, security enhancements, and access to new markets, making it a valuable addition to their operations.

Cryptocurrency development faces several challenges and risks, primarily related to security, scalability, regulatory compliance, and community acceptance. Security is a major concern, as cryptocurrencies are often targeted by hackers due to the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions.

Ensuring the robustness of the underlying blockchain technology and implementing strong security measures is crucial to protect against theft and fraud. Scalability is another challenge, as blockchain networks must be able to handle a high volume of transactions to be viable for mainstream use. Developing solutions that can increase transaction throughput without compromising decentralisation or security is a significant technical challenge.

Additionally, navigating the complex regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies poses risks for developers, as regulatory changes can impact the legality and viability of their projects. Finally, gaining acceptance and adoption from the broader community is essential for the success of a cryptocurrency, and developers must work to build trust and confidence among users, investors, and regulators alike.

Future trends in cryptocurrency development are expected to focus on improving scalability, interoperability, and privacy while enhancing user experience and regulatory compliance. Scalability solutions, such as sharding, layer 2 protocols, and novel consensus mechanisms, will likely be further developed to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees.

Interoperability efforts will aim to create seamless connections between different blockchain networks, enabling the transfer of assets and data across platforms. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and protocols will continue to evolve to address concerns over data protection and anonymity.

User experience enhancements, including easier wallet management and intuitive interfaces, will be prioritised to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the general public. Additionally, regulatory compliance tools and standards will be developed to ensure that cryptocurrencies can coexist with existing financial systems and meet regulatory requirements.

Overall, future trends in cryptocurrency development are expected to drive innovation and adoption, making cryptocurrencies more efficient, secure, and user-friendly.

In conclusion, cryptocurrency development is essential for blockchain applications as it underpins their core functionalities and value propositions. Cryptocurrencies serve as the lifeblood of decentralised ecosystems, enabling secure and efficient peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. By integrating cryptocurrencies, blockchain applications can achieve greater transparency, immutability, and decentralisation, key characteristics that set them apart from traditional systems.

Additionally, cryptocurrency development company enables the creation of custom tokens, which can represent various assets, rights, or utilities within a blockchain network, opening up new possibilities for decentralised applications and smart contracts. Moreover, cryptocurrencies incentivise network participants, such as miners or validators, through rewards or transaction fees, ensuring the security and integrity of the network.

Overall, cryptocurrency development is not only essential for the technical functioning of blockchain applications but also for driving innovation, enabling new business models, and fostering the growth of decentralised ecosystems

Macro guru and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal is leaning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) as the flagship crypto asset hovers around 22% below the all-time high reached in January.

Pal tells his 219,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that the “next part of the year” will be “very strong” for Bitcoin.

According to the macro guru, Bitcoin's future price action is likely to mirror the bullish cycle that occurred after the second halving.

“2017, those of you who remember was an amazing year. And I think we'll see something very similar. Bitcoin priced in those financial conditions which were leading by three months. Bitcoin's already priced it all in. So it's the worst news is in. My guess, probably up only.”

On the timelines for a bullish reversal for Bitcoin, Pal says,

“Basically, we're turning the corner and we should start to see higher prices. And the higher prices will come quick. And the higher prices should take us all the way back to the highs pretty soon. Not soon like in a week or two, but soon like in a couple of months.

So I think what you've all had to go through is a boring sideways consolidation pattern, with a slight down-bias.

Your altcoins have been nuked, but nothing out of the ordinary. We saw this in 2017, we've seen it now and we are very very close to the turnaround.”

According to the macro guru, the crypto market's bullish cycle is still at an early stage.

“We've barely started the cycle. So I know we all say it's so early, nothing's really happened yet. It hasn't. We had phase one of the banana zone, which was the breakout of that consolidation range. This is the consolidation phase two, then we will get into the much more important banana zone phase two. It is all coming.”

A banana zone is a phase in the crypto markets where there are parabolic price moves that present opportunities for out-sized gains, according to Pal.

Bitcoin is trading at $85,201 at time of writing.
