Leading global certification body DNV has validated that Flocean's desalination approach can achieve 30-50% energy savings compared to conventional systems once site-specific engineering is completed.

Conventional desalination capacity is set to double by 2032, addressing critical water shortages while risking a massive surge in carbon emissions.

Current plants already generate over 400 million tons of CO2 annually—a figure that could double as tens of billion in new projects come online within the next 10 years.

Energy is the critical cost driver in desalination, accounting for one-third to over half of total operational expenses. In Cyprus, where desalination supplies most freshwater, the process generates 2% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions and consumes 5% of its power.

To verify these results in real-world conditions, the Flocean Zero project launched in November 2024. Initial data analysis confirmed that the deep ocean environment provides optimal conditions for high-efficiency desalination while dramatically reducing energy requirements. 

Efficiency gains are achieved through two advantages, natural pressure utilization and superior water quality.

By placing reverse osmosis systems at 400-600 meters depth, Flocean harnesses natural hydrostatic pressure to drive filtration without energy-intensive pumping systems.

Deep ocean water contains significantly less life than surface water, dramatically reducing pre-treatment requirements and virtually eliminating biofouling—a persistent efficiency drain in conventional plants.

With freshwater demand projected to exceed supply by 40% by 2030, countries worldwide need solutions that address water security without compromising climate commitments.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Wang Xing, CEO of China's largest food delivery firm Meituan, said on Friday in a post-earnings call that the company is pouring "billions" into chips used to train AI models, with more investment planned this year.

The escalated spending and promise of further increases aligns with similar large-scale AI investments by China's other tech giants. E-commerce conglomerate Alibaba announced in February that it would allocated at least 380 billion yuan toward cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years.

Feedback

Nvidia is making bold strides into the quantum computing realm with plans to establish a dedicated research lab in Boston, where it will collaborate with top scientists from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The announcement was made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the company's annual software developer conference held in San Jose, California on Thursday.

The planned research lab signifies Nvidia's growing interest in quantum computing, an area where the company sees potential for dramatic advancements in computational power. The Boston lab will focus on developing new quantum algorithms and enhancing quantum hardware to further accelerate research in this evolving field.

The announcement comes less than a year after Huang made comments suggesting that useful quantum computers were at least 20 years away. However, during Thursday's event, he sought to revise that timeline, acknowledging the rapid progress being made by various quantum firms.

“This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” Huang joked, acknowledging the accelerated pace of development in quantum technology.

The conference also featured discussions with executives from leading quantum computing companies, underscoring Nvidia's intention to position itself as a pivotal player in the quantum computing landscape.

By teaming up with Harvard and MIT, Nvidia aims to leverage the cutting-edge research capabilities of these prestigious institutions. The collaboration will focus on creating practical applications for quantum computing, as well as integrating classical computing technologies with quantum systems.

Nvidia's commitment to the research lab reflects its belief that quantum computing, while still in its infancy, could soon transform industries ranging from pharmaceuticals and cryptography to material science and artificial intelligence.

The company has already made headlines with its AI advancements, but quantum computing could represent the next frontier of technological innovation. Nvidia's new lab will work on building scalable quantum hardware, optimising software tools, and developing algorithms capable of harnessing quantum systems for real-world applications.

As the United States recalibrates its trade policies to combat what the Trump administration sees as “unfair” treatment by other countries, two significant industries have complained to US regulators about their treatment in Australia.

The tech industry – particularly Big Tech platforms such as Google and Meta – says it is being “coerced” into handing cash to Australian media companies. And the pharmaceutical industry is upset about low prices and delays in getting new treatments into the Australian market. 

Why are we hearing about these complaints now? And what will they mean for Australia?

In February, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) invited comments from the public to help it review and identify any unfair trade practices by other countries. The call was made “pursuant to the America First Trade Policy Presidential Memorandum and the Presidential Memorandum on Reciprocal Trade and Tariffs”.

The aim was to use this consultation to investigate potential harm to the US from any non-reciprocal trade arrangements. The consultation was designed to help the USTR recommend appropriate actions to remedy any such practices.

Essentially, it was an invitation to complain about any and all countries, including Australia. All the relevant industry associations have taken up this opportunity with a high degree of enthusiasm. 

There have been 766 submissions.

A tech industry group called the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) made a submission raising concerns about the digital policies of several countries, including Australia.

The submission emphasised policies with what it calls “extractionary and redistributive characteristics” that force one set of market participants to subsidise the economic activities of another.

The association's Australian concern focuses on the News Media Bargaining Code. This requires tech companies to pay for news that appears on their platforms.

The CCIA characterises the News Bargaining Code as:

a coercive and discriminatory tax that requires US technology companies to subsidise Australian media companies.

The CCIA argued that the financial burden imposed by the code is substantial. It said that two companies (Google and Meta, although the CCIA does not name them) pay A$250 million annually in deals “coerced through the threat of this law”. It also mentioned the planned “news bargaining incentive”, which aims to encourage platforms to do deals with media companies.

The CCIA is also concerned about changes in competition law that will lead to platforms being regulated by default. That is, like telecommunications and electricity companies, designated platforms will be assumed to have a substantial degree of market power. (This was a finding made by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in 2019.)

The industry group argued that Australia's regulatory regime is modelled on the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA). In fact, Australia is likely to look closely at both the EU and UK regimes. 

The CCIA says this default regulation would target specified US companies with discriminatory obligations. 

However, any business that is “designated” – regardless of its host country – would have these obligations. The proposed approach does not target or discriminate against US businesses. 

It is true the proposed approach will have heavy penalties for breach, and the CCIA complains about these “significant fines”. The CCIA correctly identifies that the regulations would empower the government to impose restrictions on how platforms use customers' data, and whether they can preference their own products. 

The CCIA says it is concerned that these measures, like similar ones in other jurisdictions, disproportionately target US companies. It says they would also impose significant compliance costs, and may serve as a backdoor for industrial policy designed to advantage local competitors. They argue that such rules can require changes to operating procedures and services, and that non-compliance can result in hefty fines.

The submission also addresses Australia's proposed requirements for US online video providers, such as Netflix, to fund the development and production of Australian content, which could require these providers to allocate 10–20% of their local expenditure to Australian content. It does not note that the same is true for Australian streaming platforms.

Big Pharma, via the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) industry association, has also complained about various countries. Gripes about Australia include low prices under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and delays to approval of new treatments.

Medicines Australia – a local organisation that represents pharmaceutical companies –  agrees about the delays, citing a PBS review published last year. 

The critical submissions should come as no surprise. Any industry group that passes up such a golden opportunity to complain on behalf of its members is arguably not doing its job.

In the case of both Big Tech and Big Pharma, Australia was only one of the targets.  Yet the potential impacts are high. 

The USTR is looking at treating any regulatory barriers faced by US companies as if they were tariffs. At least one Australian industry association is joining the pile-on.

How will the USTR respond? Given the White House's current approach to trade, there is a significant risk it will recommend retaliatory tariffs on yet more Australian products.
