That was the case for me. In September 2018, I went in for a routine physical. I was overweight, experiencing heartburn, and had a blood pressure reading of 136/80. My doctor recommended dietary changes, but I brushed it off.

Sadly, my lab results confirmed that I had high cholesterol and pre-diabetes. By April 2019, my condition worsened—my A1C had climbed to 7%, putting me officially in the diabetic range. I had gained even more weight, my BMI was at an unhealthy 38.5, and my blood pressure remained high. I also started to have occasional blurred vision to the point where I had to change eyeglass prescriptions several times within a short period of time.

I had ignored the warning signs and continued with the same unhealthy habits that led me to this point. It wasn’t until I made a conscious decision to change my lifestyle that I was able to reverse the damage and improve my health.",webmd

Introduction

Groundbreaking research is now transforming our understanding of this debilitating disease, offering new hope through innovative therapies and cutting-edge medical advancements.

Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease that affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide, leading to symptoms such as pelvic pain, infertility, and organ dysfunction.1

Despite its significant impact on health and quality of life, treatment options remained limited, often requiring surgical intervention or long-term hormone therapy with variable efficacy and side effects.

However, recent advancements in endometriosis research are reshaping our understanding of the disease, offering novel therapeutic approaches that range from pharmacological interventions to regenerative medicine and microbiome-based therapies. These breakthroughs not only aim to manage symptoms but also address the root causes of endometriosis, with a focus on inflammation, immune dysregulation, and tissue remodeling.1-4

This article reviews the key advancements in non-surgical treatments, innovative surgical techniques, regenerative medicine, gut microbiome research, and personalized medicine in endometriosis management.

Non-surgical interventions

Hormonal therapy remains the mainstay of non-surgical treatment for endometriosis. Recent studies have explored new pharmacological agents targeting estrogen synthesis, inflammation, and immune modulation.2

Among these, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists, such as elagolix, have demonstrated promising results by effectively reducing pain symptoms while minimizing estrogen deprivation-related side effects.3

Another promising development is the use of aromatase inhibitors, which inhibit local estrogen production within endometriotic lesions. Off-label aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole have shown efficacy in reducing lesion size and pain severity, particularly in cases resistant to conventional hormonal therapies.3

Additionally, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have also been investigated for their ability to modulate estrogen activity while preserving bone health, a common concern with long-term hormonal therapies.4

Immunomodulatory therapies are also gaining attention, given the role of immune dysregulation in endometriosis pathophysiology. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) agents and regulatory T-cell therapies are being investigated for their potential to modulate inflammatory pathways associated with endometriosis progression.5

Furthermore, recent findings suggest that progesterone plays a crucial anti-inflammatory role in endometriosis management, as it modulates immune responses and reduces inflammation through specific molecular pathways.6

Innovative surgical approaches

Surgical excision remains a critical intervention for advanced endometriosis, particularly in cases of deep infiltrating endometriosis. Advances in minimally invasive techniques, including robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, have improved precision and outcomes for patients requiring excision of extensive lesions.1

Compared to traditional laparoscopy, robotic-assisted surgery allows for enhanced visualization, improved dexterity, and reduced surgeon fatigue, leading to lower complication rates and faster recovery times.

A recent meta-analysis comparing robotic-assisted and conventional laparoscopic surgery for deep endometriosis found that while robotic surgery does not significantly reduce intraoperative or postoperative complications, it offers improved surgical precision and is particularly beneficial for complex cases involving delicate anatomical structures.7

Additionally, novel intraoperative imaging techniques, such as fluorescence-guided surgery, are being developed to enhance the identification of microscopic endometriotic implants and improve the completeness of excision.3

Moreover, advancements in nerve-sparing techniques are also being incorporated into laparoscopic and robotic-assisted procedures to minimize the risk of postoperative complications such as neuropathic pain and organ dysfunction.7 These techniques are particularly valuable for cases where lesions infiltrate the critical pelvic nerves.

Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality in surgical planning and execution is an emerging area that promises to enhance surgical outcomes by providing real-time visualization and predictive analytics during procedures.8

These advancements are paving the way for more precise, patient-tailored surgical interventions that maximize effectiveness while reducing recurrence rates.

Regenerative medicine

Regenerative medicine is emerging as a potential game-changer in endometriosis treatment. Stem cell therapy is being extensively explored for its ability to repair endometrial tissue damage, restore fertility, and alleviate chronic pain.

Recent studies suggest that menstrual blood-derived stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells possess immunomodulatory properties and the ability to regenerate functional endometrial tissue.9

Additionally, tissue engineering approaches, including bioengineered endometrial grafts, are under investigation as potential alternatives to traditional hormone therapies and surgical interventions. These techniques aim to restore normal uterine function while minimizing recurrence rates.9

Moreover, exosome-based therapies are gaining traction as potential non-invasive regenerative treatments for endometriosis.

Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are released by most cells in the body, and these therapies leverage the ability of naturally occurring, small vesicles to deliver therapies, modulate immune responses, and promote tissue repair.8

Gut microbiome and endometriosis

Recent research has highlighted the role of the gut microbiome in endometriosis pathogenesis and symptom severity. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, has been linked to increased inflammation, altered estrogen metabolism, and immune dysfunction in women with endometriosis.10

Several studies have identified a reduction in beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus species, and an increase in pro-inflammatory bacterial strains in endometriosis patients. This altered microbiome composition may contribute to chronic inflammation and estrogen recycling, exacerbating disease progression.11

Microbiome-targeted therapies, including supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics, as well as fecal microbiota transplantation, are being explored as potential adjunct treatments for endometriosis management.

Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that specific bacterial metabolites may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of endometriosis progression.8

Furthermore, bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been found to regulate immune function and estrogen metabolism, presenting new therapeutic opportunities.11

Personalized medicine and biomarkers

Personalized medicine is becoming increasingly relevant in endometriosis management, with extensive research focusing on genetic and molecular biomarkers to guide individualized treatment strategies. Advances in genomic studies have identified estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes, particularly ERβ, as potential therapeutic targets in endometriosis.12

Furthermore, predictive biomarkers, such as the expression of CYP19A1, the gene encoding the enzyme aromatase involved in the biosynthesis of estrogens from androgens, may also help identify patients who would benefit from estrogen-suppressive therapies. At the same time, progesterone receptor (PR) profiling could predict resistance to progestin-based treatments.4

These insights could lead to precision medicine approaches that tailor treatments to individual patient profiles, improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing adverse effects.

Recent studies have also highlighted the role of epigenetic modifications, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and histone modifications, in endometriosis pathogenesis.8

These findings suggest that targeting epigenetic mechanisms could offer new therapeutic options, particularly for patients who do not respond to conventional hormonal treatments.

Additionally, the use of multi-omics approaches — combining genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics — holds promise for identifying novel biomarkers that can predict disease progression and treatment response.7

Future advancements in AI and machine learning may further enhance the ability to develop individualized treatment plans by analyzing large-scale patient data and optimizing therapeutic strategies.

As research progresses, integrating these cutting-edge technologies into clinical practice will be crucial in improving outcomes for patients with endometriosis.

Study: Dance and stress regulation: A multidisciplinary narrative review. Image Credit: Miljan Zivkovic/Shutterstock.com

A recent narrative review in Psychology of Sport and Exercise offers fresh insight into the role of dance in stress regulation.

Introduction

Chronic stress can negatively affect both physical and mental health. While physical exercise (PE) is a widely recommended strategy for managing anxiety, different types of exercise may work through distinct mechanisms.

Emerging evidence suggests that dance may offer unique benefits for managing stress and enhancing cognitive and mental well-being—benefits that traditional forms of PE may not fully capture.

Some researchers have even described dance as a “stress vaccine.” Yet, our understanding of how dance achieves these effects remains limited.

Most studies to date have focused primarily on the intensity of dance compared to other aerobic activities. But intensity is only one piece of the puzzle.

Stress regulation itself is a homeostatic process, relying on two key factors: coping and resilience. It’s about restoring balance—reducing stress to manageable levels and helping the body adapt to the physiological challenges that stress brings. Exercise is a well-established coping strategy and can also help build resilience over time.

This review zeroes in on how recreational (as opposed to competitive, professional, or religious) dance helps regulate stress and explores the underlying psychological, physiological, and social pathways that might explain these effects.

Dance characteristics

When viewed as a recreational activity, dance is far more than just physical movement. It blends music, rhythm, and expressive, often beautiful, communication with others. It's a form of creative expression that combines synchronized movement with shared social experience.

Dance also provides opportunities for social touch, emotional release, and uninhibited physical expression.

It engages the mind, body, and culture simultaneously—creating a rich experience that fosters optimism and builds resilience, both mentally and physically.

Neurobiology of dance-mediated stress regulation

Music and rhythm are central to the dance experience. Music with engaging, rhythmic patterns can activate the brain’s reward circuits and ease stress. It also helps reduce anxiety, creates a calming effect, and facilitates a state of “flow”—especially when paired with movement. This flow state is linked to greater life satisfaction and emotional resilience.

The neurobiology behind dance’s stress-reducing effects draws on the combined power of music, social interaction, and movement.

These stimuli influence various brain chemicals, including oxytocin (associated with bonding), dopamine (linked to motivation and pleasure), and β-endorphins (natural “feel-good” compounds). These neurochemicals contribute to healthy coping strategies and emotional resilience.

Sociocultural aspects of dance

Dance holds a special place in human culture as a near-universal form of emotional expression. It communicates feeling in ways that transcend language and can be understood across cultures.

It also creates a shared space where people can bond, process emotional trauma, and develop coping strategies together. Unlike many other forms of PE, dance doesn’t serve a utilitarian function—it exists for its own aesthetic and expressive purposes.

This makes it especially effective at promoting social cohesion and emotional support within groups.

Social contact and partnering in dance

Partner dancing brings people into close, coordinated contact. Dancing in synchrony with a partner creates a sense of connection and shared rhythm. This social touch activates neural systems involved in bonding, largely mediated by oxytocin and endorphins.

Studies have shown that support from a close partner is more effective at reducing stress than support from a stranger—for example, men supported by female partners or women receiving physical support from male partners.

Dance enables and reinforces these types of emotionally supportive interactions, fostering a deeper sense of connection and resilience.

Interestingly, brain imaging studies (using fMRI) show distinct neural activation in dance partners: the “leading” partner tends to display internally focused activity, while the “follower” shows externally oriented patterns. This suggests complex coordination between social and motor systems during partner dance.

Physical activity and movement in dance

Although dance involves physical exertion, it differs from other types of PE in important ways. People are often more motivated to dance than to engage in traditional exercise routines. Dance relieves tension, improves mood, and supports emotional well-being, while also enhancing cognitive function.

As with other forms of PE, dance increases the release of dopamine and endorphins. Group dancing, in particular, combines movement with rhythm and social interaction, which can improve motor function, gait, and balance—especially in people with conditions like Parkinson’s disease.

Social dancing also boosts self-confidence and provides a powerful outlet for personal expression.

Conclusions

This review is the first to take a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating dance’s role in stress regulation. The findings suggest that dance can play a meaningful role in developing coping strategies and resilience.

To date, much of the research has centered on dance’s physical intensity. But dance offers far more than fitness—it’s an experience that directly supports stress relief, boosts psychological well-being, and fosters healthier coping mechanisms.

It has the potential to reduce acute stress responses and enhance overall health in a unique, socially connected, and emotionally expressive way.",news-medical
