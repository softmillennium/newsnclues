Aubrey Plaza asked for a welfare check on her late husband, Jeff Baena, months before his death. According to the medical examiner’s report obtained by Us Weekly, Plaza, 40, said she had a friend check on Baena’s well-being in October 2024, one month after they quietly separated. (Plaza confirmed to the examiner that she and Baena separated in September 2024.) The report also stated that Plaza had been in contact with Baena on the day of his death, as he sent her a text message that morning.

While TV was once seen as second-rate in comparison to Hollywood blockbusters, the 1990s changed everything with the dawn of mega-sitcoms that commanded huge price tags for their A-list stars. The rise of streaming has only bolstered budgets for TV, meaning stars such as Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are making record-breaking fees for their latest projects. After running for six seasons, the HBO series wrapped in 2004. The costars went on to reprise their roles four years later: Sarah […] Sarah Jessica Parker’s promotion to executive producer of Sex and the City, as well as being its lead star, for the final three seasons boosted her salary significantly. Kristin and Cynthia went in the light, they became those two ladies, they understood it was Sarah Jessica’s name, look at the posters.” It was reported in 2019 Apple was spending $15 million per episode as part of an overall $300 million deal to produce the first two seasons. Apple’s huge spending on The Morning Show paid off as it received 27 Emmy Award nominations and became the streamer’s second-most-watched series, behind Ted Lasso. “There seemed to be a resentment, as if we weren’t worth it or it was bothersome, and I thought, ‘Why is that bothersome?’” she recalled. Does it bother people when Kobe Bryant or LeBron James make their contract?” Charlie Sheen’s hefty $2 million-per episode contract for CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men made it all the more shocking when he went to war with the series’ cocreator, Chuck Lorre, in 2011. ​​Ashton Kutcher was hired to replace Sheen for Two and a Half Men’s remaining four seasons. Sheen admitted to Deadline in 2023 that Two and a Half Men could have continued for another decade if he hadn’t “f—ed everything up.” After the March 2025 premiere of Denise Richards and Her Wild Things, fans have been granted a rare look inside her family life and the friendships she continues to maintain. During the March 4 episode, Denise casually invited Brooke Mueller to enjoy her family’s […] “So they say, don’t live in regret, but you have to honor it. When Everybody Loves Raymond aired its last two seasons between 2003 and 2005, Ray Romano became the highest-paid actor on TV with a salary of $1.8 million per episode, or nearly $40 million per season. Romano topped the previous record-holder, Kelsey Grammer, making $1.6 million per episode for Frasier. He added, “My agent called me a week later [saying], ‘Did you tell Jason Katims you would work for less money?’ And I go, ‘Yes, I did.’ I wasn’t doing it for the money at that time. Grammer was once the highest-paid actor on TV by commanding a $1.6 million-per episode contract for Cheers spinoff Frasier. “That’s sort of a knock-on-wood statement, I suppose,” he admitted. Unfortunately for Grammer, Paramount canceled the Frasier revival in January 2025. He has since campaigned for another streaming service to save the show. “There’s a better home for it,” Grammer told The New York Post in March 2025. I mean, obviously, they didn’t really promote or spend much time on it.” Pratt is also receiving an impressive pay check for his Prime Video streaming series The Terminal List. Variety reported in August 2021 that Pratt was earning a jaw-dropping $1.4 million for every episode of the action thriller series. Amazon has doubled down on its investment in The Terminal List by renewing it for a second season in February 2023 and commissioning a prequel series based around Taylor Kitsch’s character. Tim Allen made $1.25 million for playing Tim “The Tool Man” Taylor in Home Improvement’s final season, but it was his lofty salary that ultimately contributed to the show ending. Richardson admitted she was ready for Home Improvement to end, so she forced ABC ‘s hand by demanding the same money as Allen to return. “I’d been there all this time, and they never even paid me a third of what Tim was making, and I was working my ass off. ABC declined to meet Richardson’s pay demands and Home Improvement ended in 1999. Jerry Seinfeld was one of the few TV stars to walk away from a hit show at the peak of its success, after making $1 million an episode. Seinfeld told The Howard Stern Show in 2013 that NBC was so desperate for him to return for a 10th season that he was offered $110 million. Seinfeld’s final episode, “The Finale,” was watched by a staggering 75 million viewers May 14, 1998. Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer each were paid $1 million an episode for the final two seasons of Friends between 2002 and 2004. Related: 'Friends' Most Memorable Guest Stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer rose to massive fame during Friends, which aired on NBC for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004. I thought it was the most important thing — as we all did — that we all were equal in every single way,” Cox agreed. I think it was scary, probably, for productions after that.” Like the Friends cast before them, Big Bang’s Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco negotiated together in 2014 to make $1 million per half-hour episode for seasons 8 through 10. When it came time for the trio to re-up with CBS in 2017, the stars and castmates Kunal Nayyar and Simon Helberg all agreed to take $100,000 salary cuts per episode so their costars Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch could get substantial raises. While The Big Bang Theory ended in 2019, the franchise has lived on with prequel Young Sheldon and its spinoff Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage, as well as an upcoming companion show Stuart Fails to Save the Universe with BBT cast members Kevin Sussman, Lauren Lapkus and Brian Posehn returning. It was reported in 2021 that Sudeikis negotiated a major pay increase, to $1 million per episode, for the third season of Apple TV+’s sports comedy Ted Lasso. That’s the word,” he revealed to host Travis Kelce. Matt Chernis, Apple TV+’s head of programming, subsequently announced, “Ted Lasso has been nothing short of a juggernaut, inspiring a passionate fanbase all over the world, and delivering endless joy and laughter, all while spreading kindness, compassion and unwavering belief. Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Norwegian director Gunnar Hall Jensen has made a trademark of his playful and quirky self-portraits in which his reflections on life often find a universal echo. Three weeks before filming was to have wrapped, he heard that his son had been killed. The highly personal documentary is a heartfelt and raw story of a middle-aged control-freak father, who struggles to connect with his defiant son. As Jonathan turns into a defiant self-confident young man, testing his own limits, Gunnar gets confused, like any parent with kids from Gen Z would, but also because Gunnar’s own father – a captain on a cruise ship in the Caribbean – was never there for him. The young man disappears for weeks, after having emptied his saving accounts. When Gunnar finally finds him, Jonathan is living a completely different life in Brazil with a male social media influencer with over 10 million followers. Jonathan, at the age of 21, has been fatally attacked. A period of grief, and reconstruction follows, as Gunnar – who had separated from Jonathan’s mom – gets back together with her. Speaking to Variety about his experience, Hall Jensen says: “Three weeks before filming was completed [in November 2023] I got the message parents fear the most: Jonathan – 21 years old – was killed. After the shocking news, I really just wanted to die myself. Jonathan’s beautiful nature had been cut, taken out of the world at a young age. “Something in me had been broken that could not be fixed. “Firstly, it is representative of the love between a son and a father, how difficult and rewarding it can be. How easy it is for a young man to get lost in today’s chaotic world with twisted ideas of how to succeed and become rich, promoted problematically by today’s gurus, coaches, influencers on the internet. “Thirdly, we have an overload of books and films around mother/daughter relationships, but very few authentic stories about fathers and sons.” I forced myself to be professional telling a story in the best way possible. Two people were crucial in helping Hall Jensen structure his narrative and find the right tone: his long-time editor Erlend Haarr Eriksson, and BBC Storyville’s commissioning editor Lucie Kon, who had boarded the project at an early stage via the film’s sales agent DR Sales. “It was hard for me to change the film from an artistically playful and light-footed documentary into a more explanatory work, but Lucy helped a lot, both in taking out scenes that now seemed irrelevant, with sharpening the story in a more explanatory way and with going heavily into the voice-over narration. She helped lift the film to a level I could not have done myself.” Hall Jensen says long discussions on the subject were had with Haarr Eriksson and Kon. That said, as the director points out, the film is “in no way some kind of true crime story” as it’s first and foremost “a story about a father and son, trying to connect.” “Being a decent father is a tough ride,” says Hall Jensen, who recalls his son as “an unstoppable force of nature.” “I don’t have solutions, but I hope this father and son story will resonate with the audience. Kim Christiansen, executive producer, in charge of documentaries and co-production at DR Sales, praises Hall Jensen’s achievement. Despite the tragic outcome, it is important to state that this is the most beautiful father and son love story I have ever came across, in any genre.” The film is produced by Norway’s top banner Upnorth Film, credited for Hall Jensen’s previous film “Oh, It Hertz!“ (CPH:DOX, 2021), Håvard Bustnes’ festival hits “Phantoms of the Sierra Madre,” and “Two Raging Grannies.” Jan Rofekamp and Freddy Neumann serve as executive producers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Paramount Global, Verizon and any other companies trying to gain the government’s blessing for mergers should eliminate policies aimed at promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. That was the blunt message from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr in an interview with Bloomberg. “Any businesses that are looking for FCC approval, I would encourage them to get busy ending any sort of their invidious forms of DEI discrimination,” Carr told the news outlet Friday. Carr said the commission’s review of deals would include looking for “illegal” DEI policies. That stance is consistent with the Donald Trump Administration’s broader efforts to stamp out DEI (which the president even blamed, without proof, for causing a fatal plane crash in Washington, D.C. in January), Paramount last month joined the list, with its Co-CEOs telling employees that the company would no longer measure “success in progress on companywide DEI initiatives, including aspirational representation goals.” Last summer, Paramount announced a long-in-the-works $8 billion deal to combine with Skydance Media, telling investors it expected to close the transaction by the end of June. After a conservative group filed a “news distortion” complaint about varying edits of an interview of former Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, Carr has said the matter would factor into the merger review. Trump, meanwhile, has sued Paramount and CBS News over the interview edits. Lawyers for CBS and Paramount earlier this month filed a motion to dismiss the suit, calling it an “affront to the First Amendment.” Just as Disney opted to pay a $15 million settlement over a Trump claim against ABC News rather than risk further Trump-led scrutiny, Paramount has held internal discussions about settling the Harris interview suit.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Earlier this week, actor, director, and Saturday Night Live alum Kyle Mooney teased the release of a new project in an Instagram video. “It’s who I am, it’s the real me, and I want to be okay with showing this side of myself and not caring what people might think or they might say,” he said. ), and it does indeed shed a revealing light on the previously opaque public figure. For example, it would have been impossible to know prior to this that Mooney, now going by Kyle M, is into musical genres as diverse as “rock and roll, country, dance, and R&B.” That’s according to his official artist biography on Spotify, which also notes, “His debut album, The Real Me, is considered incredibly creative and poetic.” The poetry and creativity are apparent from the album’s introductory track, in which Kyle M tees up what listeners are about to hear by playing both sides of a conversation: And oh the places that journey takes us — from Kyle M’s ’50s-style ode to his “Blue Car” that will make you want to do the twist like Chubby Checker, to his four-on-the-floor banger “I Gotta Dance Tonight,” about how movement can liberate us from the pressures of capitalism. “Boss is a jerk, always yells at me / I need a break from all the monotony / Where can I go to let it all out? After all, the comedian has a long reputation of playing comedic bits extremely straight without winking, and this project feels apiece with that. To those people, Mooney offers a rejoinder on the album’s closing track, “The Real Me,” sung over campfire guitar strums: “I know I come off as a clown / But I’m telling you now / There’s a real me deep down.” It only took 18 years in the public light, but Mooney finally feels comfortable sharing that “real” version of himself now, and we applaud his courage and vulnerability.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The most popular show on Netflix right now isn’t the latest season of Love Is Blind or yet another salacious true crime documentary — it’s a series about a baby-faced teenage murderer. This weekend, treat yourself to a lavish remake of a classic 1963 movie, one of the best crime shows on TV right now, and an under-the-radar show about life after the world as we know has ended. It’s hard to believe a big-budget show based on a classic movie qualifies as underrated, but The Leopard has been oddly ignored by audiences and most critics since it premiered earlier this month. Related: 3 Underrated Movies on Netflix to Stream This Weekend (March 14-16) The Oscars are long over, spring is almost here, and your weekend social calendar is wide open. Or maybe you’re in the mood for a cool, sexy spy thriller like Black Bag starring Michael […] The show focuses on one aristocratic family and, in particular, Don Fabrizio Corbera (Kim Rossi Stuart). He’s the elder patriarch who wields massive social and political influence in his hometown of Salina. But as Sicily’s old ways disappear and a new social order emerges, Don Fabrizio realizes he has to make some sacrifices for his family to survive. Will he do what it takes to ensure his daughters will have all the comforts they’ve been accustomed to in life even if it means breaking one of their hearts? That’s still rare to see on TV nowadays, but Dark Winds is also just a damn good police procedural with a lead protagonist who is always fascinating to watch. It seems like there’s a new postapocalyptic show debuting each week, but most of them aren’t as unique as The Rain. As a deadly virus spreads around the world via rainfall, scientist Frederick Anderson (Lars Simonsen) hides his two children, Simone (Alba August) and Rasmus (Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen), in a bunker to save them. But the virus is still present, and the two siblings will have to team up with other survivors to find their missing father. The Rain takes place in Scandinavia, so expect a lot of lush green forests and beautiful scenery. The plot is intriguing enough for you to watch all of its three seasons, and the show’s depiction of its post-pandemic world has some interesting parallels to life immediately after COVID-19.

Hulu‘s Prison Break reboot, which got a pilot order three months ago, is really starting to take shape — with the casting of another four main roles.

Mayans MC showrunner Elgin James is writing this new Prison Break, and will executive-produce alongside Prison Break creator Paul Scheuring and the original series’ executive producers Dawn Olmstead, Marty Adelstein and Neal Moritz. Specific plot details have yet to be disclosed, but the project will tell a new story set in the same universe as the original series.

Previously, TVLine confirmed that Drake Rodger (The Winchesters) will play Tommy, an inmate at one of the deadliest prisons in America, who has already served 10 years; Aussie Emily Browning (American Gods, The Affair) will fill the role of Cassidy, an ex-soldier turned corrections officer who takes a job at the aforementioned, co-ed prison; and Lukas Gage (YOU, Dead Boy Detectives) will play Jackson, a politician from a well-to-do background who’s in the midst of his first congressional campaign.

The made-for-Hulu reboot, announced in mid-December, is also expected to cast the series regular role of a very pregnant inmate whose baby daddy is locked up just a floor away.

Fox’s Prison Break originally ran for four seasons from August 2005 to May 2009 (The Final Break wrap-up movie included), and then returned with a nine-episode revival run in Spring 2017. Yet whereas that fifth season on Fox brought back series leads Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell and Sarah Wayne Callies, among others, the prospective Hulu series is not expected to do the same.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce turned heads with their coordinated outfits and PDA-filled appearance at the 2024 men’s US Open final. Over at Super Bowl LIX, Tom Brady stole the show — not for his commentary debut but for rocking a jaw-dropping $740K diamond-studded watch, while Kendrick Lamar dazzled with nearly $1M in sparkling jewelry during the halftime show.

As for the basketball scene, the 2024 WNBA Finals had star power courtside, with Aubrey Plaza, Spike Lee and even Rick Ross supporting the action-packed games. Celebrities aren’t just taking in the sports — they’re bringing glamour and making moments you simply can’t miss.

It’s been a quiet week, all considered, with no additional legal mishegoss from the ongoing It Ends With Us lawsuit pile-on and then … wait … no … Justin Baldoni and Jennifer Abel, his current publicist, are suing his former publicist Stephanie Jones in the midst of also suing Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the New York Times. Have these guys run out of all the possible lawsuit permutations by now? This has been going on for nearly three months. What is one more lawsuit going to do exactly? Per Variety, Baldoni set his sights on Jones, with his lawyer, Bryan Freedman, claiming that she leaked private communications to Leslie Sloane, Lively’s PR. During the premiere of It Ends With Us last summer, Jones was working with Abel at her company Jonesworks, the two of them collaborating on Baldoni’s behalf. Abel announced to Jones that she was leaving the firm to start her own company in August of 2024, which Baldoni’s newest legal complaint alleges led Jones to turn on him. “In turning over these materials to Lively, Jones knew full well that the blowback would engulf not only Abel but also her clients, Wayfarer, and Baldoni,” the complaint alleges. So, to follow the logical thread here, just in case you’re lost with all the Spider-Man-pointing meme going on here: The new complaint alleges that Baldoni’s team hired Jones and Abel, fired Jones, then Jones went to Sloane with confidential texts, who then took those texts to Lively and the Times. Better get at least one more in there, just to be safe.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It’s based upon one of the most popular Broadway musicals ever, and it’s a prequel to The Wizard of Oz, a perennial favorite across several generations. Crazy Rich Asians director Jon M. Chu brought together Tony Award-winning actress Cynthia Erivo and music sensation Ariana Grande to portray Wicked’s iconic duo, Elphaba Thropp and Galinda Upland, in the years before they became the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good, respectively. The theatrical version of Wicked will be joined by a new sing-along version as well, if you just can’t resist belting out a few show tunes. There’s also bonus content on Peacock that would have ordinarily been saved for the Blu-ray and HD release. Related: How Do ‘Wicked’ and ‘The Wizard of Oz’ Connect? If you don’t have Peacock, and you’re willing to wait a few more months, Wicked will eventually show up on Amazon Prime Video. Once Wicked heads to Prime Video, it will be removed from Peacock for the duration of its stay. When will ‘Wicked: For Good’ be available to stream? That film has a November 21 release date, and it’s likely to be just as big in 2025 as its predecessor was last year. But now that Universal and Peacock have set the timetable for the first Wicked’s streaming premiere, it seems likely that Wicked: For Good will be available to stream by this time next year.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/severance-season-2-finale-mark-scout-meets-mark-s-scene-explained.html'>Severance Talks to Itself</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 19:09:54 <p>
One sublime finale scene cuts through all the season’s noise. Spoilers follow for Severance season two, episode ten, “Cold Harbor.” To this point, the show has maintained a nearly impervious wall between grief-stricken widower Mark Scout and his alternate self, imprisoned Lumon Innie Mark S. They are intimately linked; each Mark’s existence relies on the continued participation of the other. At last, though, Ms. Cobel and Mark’s sister, Devon, realize they can scale that divide by taking Mark to the remote birthing cabins, first introduced in season one, where women escape the pain of childbirth by transitioning to an Innie self. The trio is working on a plan to free Mark Scout’s wife, Gemma, from somewhere deep inside the Lumon facility, and they need Mark S.’s participation. I created you as a prisoner and an escape,” Outie Mark says. Compared with Severance’s usual storytelling mode in season two, where any explicit plot point is buried in layers of ambiguity, vagueness, and artful indirection, the conversation between the Marks is immediately, beautifully blunt. There’s just Mark Scout and his Innie having a straightforward conversation about what they both want, how they want to get it, and what the stakes are for both of them. It’s a shocking scene, all the more effective and upsetting because of how fuzzily low-rent it feels — Mark’s face is partially cut off on a tiny, high-contrast camcorder screen — compared with Severance’s typical moody, stark landscapes and queasily clean fluorescent interiors. The Cold Harbor completion rate has sat just short of 100 percent for way too long. Much of season two’s discoveries, especially in the later half, loop back to the past, with time spent learning about Cobel’s childhood and understanding where Gemma has been all this time. They’re talking about their real lives and real futures, sure, but it’s through a very heady, very abstract conversation about what it is to be a self, how much value an unseen laborer’s life can possibly have, how much Mark Scout is culpable for the tragedy of Mark S.’s existence, and what responsibility these two men have toward each other. Taken as a whole, the conversation proves that these are, in fact, two different men. If his Innie will only help him find Gemma and get her out of Lumon, then he can offer Innie Mark a form of escape as well. They’ll reintegrate, and Innie Mark will no longer be trapped in what is essentially a form of slavery. It’s not that he wants to hurt his Innie. Adam Scott does remarkable work as the dual Marks; his performance elevates the scene from a stark philosophical discussion into something palpable and tragic and infuriating. Because the performance is so striking, in fact, it’s suddenly clear how much has been lost on the way to arriving at this point. In the service of emotional spectacle and visual style, Severance season two often sacrificed storytelling logic for what looks really cool. How does it make sense to use resources for a marching band but not adequate security staff? Why does it take so long for anyone to intervene once Mark starts sprinting around the building? Despite Severance’s growing attempts to court Easter egg–level readings, with its cluelike names for all of Gemma’s different Innie rooms and its perpetual hinting at further mysteries to unravel, the show cannot sustain the detail-level logic. When its visual panache is harnessed in the service of the show’s core questions rather than following cars as they wind endlessly through winter landscapes, Severance is incredibly compelling. It has built two whole seasons of TV to arrive at this moment between the two Marks, this very plausible and unbearably sad proof that even its own protagonist cannot see his Innie’s humanity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett would prefer if the biggest nights in Hollywood were kept within the industry. Blanchett said during Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang‘s “Las Culturistas” podcast that she would prefer to go “back to the day” when awards shows weren’t televised to the public. That way, those nominated and attending could instead focus on being part of a “great party” and not dealing with photographers and lip readers on social media. “There’s so few spaces that you can go now where you are private,” Blanchett said. “That’s what I loved about the late ’80s, going to all of the dance parties in Sydney for Mardi Gras. The “Black Bag” and “Disclaimer” star continued, “I mean, I say, I know it’s blasphemy, go back to the day when it wasn’t televised. I mean, the industry is so scattered and at such a point…which I think potentially could be exciting or could really be depressing, but it’s at a pivot point, and so we need to gather together and celebrate what it is that we do, without it having to have any public-facing. I mean, the fashion is great, and all of that stuff. As for the so-called “lip readers” online that try to decipher what stars are saying to each other at these ceremonies, Blanchett doubted their accuracy. Learn Ikebana or something, like a skill that’s actually beautiful,” Blanchett said. Blanchett won the best supporting actress Oscar in 2005 for “The Aviator” and best lead actress in 2014 for “Blue Jasmine.” She also was nominated for six other Oscars.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The inherent spiritual (and mortal) paradox of American life. It’s not only easy but nigh on downright justifiable to consider your criminal deeds for the greater good when you and yours are a ragtag few in dire need of an inhabitable life. Dope Thief’s third chapter is mostly a utilitarian one, in a good way — filling out the scale and scope of the world and mortal stakes for the characters while massaging an urban-western-type vibe into the proceedings, culminating in a good old-fashioned head-in-a-box routine for your trouble. Business as usual, other than the mysterious, immediate big-time drug-dealing threat on his life and the life of everyone he knows. Two days have passed since the robbery, and Manny is still nowhere to be found. “Everybody you get close to is in the crosshairs with you,” Son tells him under the bridge along his morning jog. But it isn’t just the heat closing in that’s keeping Ray around. Not much time to argue his point though, seeing how Manny is hiding up in his attic room and Theresa just got a call from prison saying Bart’s been stabbed. Manny’s in a relapsed panic, and Theresa is frantic about getting to the prison in time to be with her lover on his deathbed. So, with at least the knowledge that Manny is alive and relatively in one piece, Ray drives Theresa to prison with every intention of hanging back in the car. A flash of black-and-white memories of being rousted out of bed and abused by prison guards reminds us that Ray is even more familiar with the hell behind U.S. prison bars than even his father. A-plus acting that serves a thrilling and dramatic purpose in equal measure. However, it seems like Ray’s luck has run out after a heavy confrontation with Bart in the infirmary. It turns out Bart was stabbed as bait to bring Ray out of hiding, and a whole platoon of bikers is waiting for Ray just outside the prison gates. So when he steps onto the other side of those prison gates and the DEA swoops in and saves him from what was surely set to be a Sergio Leone–style criminal execution (the timing strains credibility a bit here, even for a show that mixes straight drama with pulp like this one does — nevertheless, kick-ass spaghetti-western LARP-ing shit), Ray takes his second chance at life to make all the amends he can — parlay a lifetime of bad decisions into priceless nuggets of love. A big old unjust pile of shit to fall on any small–time Robin Hood when every day feels more and more like it’s a crime to be alive.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It’s great to see talented actors like Fiennes and Chastain embody characters with such sketchy morals. Distraught, Mully steals the cash and jumps into a seemingly empty taxi. After he drives off, he is surprised to discover two passengers in the back: Joy (Olivia Colman), a forty-something lawyer, and her newborn baby.

Joy isn’t so sure she’s the best person to raise a child while Mully doesn’t believe his father cares enough to raise him. Joyride won’t win any awards, but it’s a solid drama that features another great performance by Colman.

For all the miracles of digital cinematography, non-linear editing software, and the unseen wizardry that goes into something as small as sky replacement, they do open up a treacherous thought for audiences: “It’s fake. The haunting contained tension of Jamie and psychologist Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty) in Episode 3 stands in contrast to the mazelike chaos that detectives Bascombe (Ashley Walters) and Frank (Faye Marsay) wade through when they look for the motive and the murder weapon at Jamie’s school in Episode 2. But for every episode, Barantini told IndieWire that an extensive rehearsal process was key. During tech, background artists would join the run-throughs, and Barantini would fine-tune the kind of detail work that might only get picked up on a second watch. In the case of working with the nearly 300 children used for Episode 2, that meant making sure they had their mobile phones throughout and costuming assistant directors as teachers. They could give directions on camera and be listened to — or, with warning in advance, ignored — as the scene called for it. All told, the opening scene [in Episode 1] needed to be 11 minutes long so that the full exchange before, during, and after Owen is in the police van can be delivered,” Barantini said. For Lewis and his camera team, achieving that kind of movement through space with precise timing required a staggering amount of planning, tracking vehicles, and handoffs. In the sequence in Episode 2 where Ryan (Kaine Davis) jumps through a ground-level window and tries to run from Bascombe before he’s arrested, Lewis wanted to make sure the camera kept up with the runners without the shot feeling like something out of “Call of Duty.” The camera needed to get ahead of them to grab frontal, more three-dimensional views of the chase. Lewis, meanwhile, bolted behind the school building to hop onto a waiting vehicle. “There’s a couple fairly spicy handoffs in that little sequence,” Lewis said. We convene, and he passes the camera back to me as I start going up the road, and he’s still running up the road as well. The camera then had to fly a full field over to the murder location, where Jamie’s dad Eddie (Stephen Graham) is leaving flowers. “[The drone] grabs really quietly without any sort of movement change. I actually change some settings on the camera on the side before I step away — I change the follow mode so that it’s just controlled on wheels, basically. Then I step away, the drone spins up, the grips walk forward, and they let go of it exactly when they feel it’s being pulled out their hands,” Lewis said. “Like, why did we think that was a normal thing to do?” “Not every genre is suited to a single take, but when it does work, the audience is thrown into it, and it’s live, they’re in this world,” Barantini said. When someone told them that they couldn’t as we’d filmed it in one take, they hadn’t realized — which was a sign that we’d all done our jobs right! It’s like Scorsese’s line on editing: Everyone thinks it’s good editing if you notice the cuts, but great editing is also when you don’t see it.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/selena-and-bennys-newlywed-game-won-late-night-this-week.html'>Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco’s Newlywed Game Won Late Night This Week</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 17:44:11 <p>
Approximately half of late-night TV was off this week, which means Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert, and Taylor Tomlinson were all spared from having to feign shock and dismay over the vandalism of Teslas. On multiple shows this week, hosts started a monologue segment about the … let’s call them “direct actions” at Tesla dealerships this week, which the audience applauded uproariously. Then the hosts had to do a legally obligated “Hey now, destruction of property isn’t cool, guys” preamble before going in harder on Elon Musk and what the The Daily Show termed his “Nazi cum.” And destruction of property is also what many in the legal profession are calling “technically a crime.” But if one believes America is being taken over by fascists, then one will eventually have to endorse the crime of resisting fascism. It’s something late-night hosts of the ’60s and ’70s didn’t have to contend with, since they weren’t really trying to be anything other than the Establishment. Johnny Carson never had to contend with an audience whoo-ing the burning of draft cards. Or they can retreat into apolitical Carsonland; that is an option, too. Now for the funniest bits on late night this week. Last Week Tonight had a great one during its episode about online gambling. It’s a double subversion, in that reading is far more tame than what you’re expecting, and then porno is, frankly, exactly what you were expecting. John Mulaney and Ben Stiller trying to wrangle a live caller is important television. Everybody’s Live is now, and probably forever shall be, a work in progress. He’s fighting against his nature with this show, and isn’t that one of the big nine plots? During the cruise-ship episode, Mulaney and crew (shout-out Ben Stiller for having the best follow-up questions) spoke to former boat worker Oren, who once stored a dead body in a state room. This was, by far, the best call Everybody’s Live has gotten. More corpse talk in the coming weeks, please. Any time Katt Williams goes on the record, it’s an event. This time, he was on The Tonight Show, explaining that he was nice to an up-and-coming Jimmy Fallon not out of the goodness in his soul but because Fallon had the energy of a guy who was going to rise to the top. Williams told a lot of crazy-yet-true tall tales about himself and explained how golf saved his life. It was a slightly wider-appeal Katt Williams than you’ll get on a podcast, but it’s still Katt. You have to salute the sheer audacity of this bit between Jordan Klepper and Troy Iwata, which presupposes that being disappointed in Donald Trump is fatal to sick children. Let’s back up: Earlier in the week, Trump said Biden’s pardons weren’t legit because they used something called an autopen. Every moment of this True Confessions segment on The Tonight Show is absurd and delightful. The whole premise falls apart if the players are engaged to be wed and hopefully know quite a lot about each other. Benny doesn’t know who Millie Bobby Brown is, nobody knows she got married, and Selena doesn’t know about Fallon’s stand-up past. You’ve always got to keep an eye out for Selener.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pascal and Heyman are just in talks at the moment, as the deal reported last month between Amazon MGM and the Broccolis is still being finalized. Amazon MGM on February 20 announced it was forming a new joint venture to house the James Bond IP, with the studio obtaining creative control of the franchise. Broccoli has been the main caretaker of the franchise’s direction for decades, along with her half-brother Wilson. The last Bond film to hit the screen was “No Time to Die” in 2021, the final entry starring Daniel Craig, who only made five Bond films but had the longest tenure as Bond, dating all the way back to 2006 with “Casino Royale.” Amazon purchased MGM in 2022 for $8.5 billion, acquiring all the IP and library rights to over 4,000 films and 17,000 shows, but the crown jewel of that library, 007, had remained in limbo. More eyebrows were raised in the wake of the news when Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked fans online who they wanted to see cast as 007. Pascal, since leaving Sony in 2015, has become one of the most successful franchise producers in Hollywood. She’s produced Sony’s “Spider-Verse” animated films, the Tom Holland “Spider-Man” MCU films, and critical darlings like “Little Women” and last year’s “Challengers.” While at Sony, she also oversaw the release of the most commercially successful Bond film to date, 2012’s “Skyfall.” He produced all the “Harry Potter” films and the “Fantastic Beasts” follow-ups and has the “Potter” series reboot at HBO, and some of his other box office hits have included “Gravity,” “Paddington 2,” “Once Upon a Time …i n Hollywood,” and “Barbie.” He’s also a producer on the Matthew McConaughey film “The Rivals of Amziah King,” which just premiered at SXSW and is seeking distribution. When Scott Stuber left Netflix to relaunch United Artists under Amazon MGM, there was the feeling that he could be in line to shepherd Bond considering the label’s history with the 007 franchise. Puck first reported the news of Pascal and Heyman’s involvement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

King and Newman got married in 2007, nearly 13 years before they went their separate ways. Us Weekly confirmed in May 2020 that the former Heart of Dixie actress filed for divorce and requested a temporary restraining order against Newman. (Newman shares son Etienne and daughter Beatrix with wife Cyn, whom he married in 2023.) While King has not addressed the allegations, court docs obtained by Us revealed that she is allowed supervised visits with her kids. Related: Jaime King's Ex Kyle Given Sole Physical Custody of Sons Amid Rehab Order Jaime King’s custody agreement with ex-husband Kyle Newman has been changed after she allegedly didn’t complete a rehabilitation program. Newman, 49, has been awarded sole physical custody of their two sons, James, 11, and Leo, 9, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly on Monday, March 17. Keep scrolling for a timeline of King and Newman’s divorce: Along with her divorce petition, King asked the court for a temporary restraining order against Newman. King also sought sole legal and physical custody of their sons, alleging that she felt Newman “systematically made [her] feel inadequate, insecure, unsafe and traumatized” during their marriage. “Kyle was deeply saddened by Jaime’s attempt to obtain court orders based solely on false claims without providing him any opportunity to respond,” a spokesperson for Newman told Us. Newman filed new documents claiming that King “emptied and closed” their joint bank accounts. He asked that King pay for all of his legal fees, arguing that he’s a stay-at-home father and cannot easily cover the $150,000 costs already incurred. Newman also requested primary custody of James and Leo, which King shot down in her November filing. “[He] called at least one of the executives on Black Summer after midnight demanding information about me. [He] had a third party call various people who worked on the show demanding that some action be taken before I ‘killed myself’ with drugs or alcohol. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard finalized their divorce in 2017, but their relationship drama continued on with a nasty court battle after they’ve both accused each other of verbal and […] “It was an emotional day at the courthouse yesterday, as Jaime and Kyle sat down in a room and hammered out the details of their settlement, putting their two children first,” Newman’s lawyer, Garry M. Gekht, said in a statement to Us. In April, King submitted an emergency request to stop paying Newman child and spousal support and claimed that she “lacks the ability to pay” the funds. In response, Newman filed his own paperwork alleging that King had “been out of compliance with the court’s child and spousal support orders for well over a year.” According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly on Monday, April 15, King, 44, claimed she “lacks the ability to pay the support.” (King and Newman, 48, share sons James, 10, and Theo, 8.) He and King still have joint legal custody, though Newman has a “tie-breaking authority” on any disputes.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/being-maria-movie-review-schneider-last-tango-1235110513/'>‘Being Maria’ Review: Maria Schneider’s Horrific ‘Last Tango’ Experience Is Only One Facet of This Compelling Portrait</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 16:30:00 <p>
Toward the end of Jessica Palud’s “Being Maria,” an uneven but poignantly restorative portrait of “Last Tango in Paris” star Maria Schneider (played here by “Happening” breakout Anamaria Vartolomei), the actress sits for an interview in which she reflects on her recent experience shooting Jacques Rivette’s self-disowned “Merry-Go-Round.” With a warm smile on her face, Schneider describes the serendipity of the film’s premise, which revolves around a boy and a girl who cross paths in Paris after being summoned there by someone neither of them can find: “It’s about two people who meet because the person they were supposed to meet doesn’t show up.” It’s an ethos that “Being Maria” embodies in spite of itself, as Palud is much sharper in depicting Schneider’s trauma on the set of “Last Tango” than she is in detailing the psychic fallout of shooting Bernardo Bertolucci’s erotic drama — particularly the butter-lubricated scene of anal rape, which was sprung on the actress and her character alike. Palud’s spare and elliptical script (co-written with Laurette Polmanss, and based on a second-person memoir written by Schneider’s cousin Vanessa) is the furthest thing from the work of Jacques Rivette, and yet it too could be seen as a story about two people who meet because the person they were supposed to meet doesn’t show up. To that end, it’s helpful that Palud’s film — which starts three years before “Last Tango” was shot in 1972, and ends roughly decade later — frames Schneider’s encounter with Bertolucci as the defining episode of a life that extended far off-screen in both directions. We meet Maria as a doe-eyed teen who’s been newly reacquainted with her actor dad (Yvan Attal as Daniel Gélin), a leading man who conceived her at the height of an affair with a 17-year-old model — and then, for the sake of his marriage refused to recognize her as his daughter. “Actors don’t choose roles,” Maria is told, “roles choose actors,” and so it goes that she finds herself sitting across from a yassified Bertolucci (Giuseppe Maggio, playing the director as a pretentious young himbo), who looks at the fresh-faced girl sitting across from him and declares that “there’s something wounded about you.” It’s a wound that he’s eager to exploit. The next thing she knows, Maria is acting against the great Marlon Brando (Matt Dillon, in a nuanced performance that creates mystique without mimicry), and awing at his ability to make his character’s emotions seem real. Locked into Maria’s perspective at all times, Palud shoots the making of “Last Tango” with a gauzy sense of remove — as though it were the most surreal experience imaginable, and also just work to be done. Maria couldn’t be more enmeshed with her co-star on set, and yet she’s blithely left out of Brando’s impassioned conversations with their director; she is a prop for these men to use as they see fit, and it never occurs to them to ask for her thoughts on a given scene. So far as Bertolucci is concerned, his actors are merely an obstacle between their characters and the truth — a truth that he insists upon achieving by any means necessary (Bertolucci never comes off well, but nothing we see on screen is as damning as the fact that Palud was an intern on “The Dreamers,” and saw the director at work first-hand). But what use is the truth of that moment if it doesn’t belong to Jeanne? And if the truth were created as a result of such extreme manipulation, would it not be the exact kind of artificial construction that Bertolucci was so determined to avoid? There’s little ambiguity as to how “Being Maria” would answer those questions, but the indignities visited upon Maria speak for themselves, and Palud’s disinterest in judging the artistic quality of “Last Tango” is almost matched by her disinterest in limiting Schneider’s life to the stuff of a proto-#MeToo screed. While the film observes that her public image would continue to be molded by a series of male directors, it fails to meaningfully explore how that tension manifested itself in Schneider’s post-“Tango” performances. “Do your job as an actress, no more.” By inviting Vartolomei to play Schneider in a biopic so attuned to the difference between creation and destruction, “Being Maria” movingly reaffirms that Schneider was doing her job as an actress — right up until the moment when Bertolucci and Brando forced her to stop.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/stephen-collins-is-dating-fan-40-years-younger-after-child-sex-scandal/'>Stephen Collins Is Dating Fan 40 Years Younger After Child Sex Scandal</a></h2><b>Source:</b> usmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 16:00:23 <p>
“Stephen Collins now lives with a woman who is 40 years younger than him,” Dr. Drew Pinsky claimed in the special. Dr. Drew speculated on Collins’ relationship with Nagel, 37, adding, “The age difference — given what we know about his history — certainly raises an eyebrow. Let’s hope he can commit to this woman and not perpetrate on others.” Related: Inside Stephen Collins‘ Child Sexual Abuse Drama — Including Where He Is Now Stephen Collins‘ child sexual abuse scandal ended his career but where is the 7th Heaven alum now? Collins was a household name for his role as Reverend Eric Camden on 7th Heaven. Collins did not participate in the ID special and producers reached out to “more than 100 contacts” of Collins’ and “nearly everyone declined to participate or did not respond.” (A producer in a voiceover claimed that only men agreed to speak with them about their experience with Collins.) After his acting career came to an end, Collins was spotted on multiple occasions with Nagel, in Fairfield, Iowa, where they currently live. The outlet also reported that Nagel posted about Collins’ hit show 7th Heaven years before they got together. Collins made headlines seven years after 7th Heaven ended when TMZ published an audio recording from a marriage counseling session with his then-wife, actress Faye Grant, where he admitted to sexually abusing three underage girls. “I’m a flawed person,” Collins said in an interview with Katie Couric at the time. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department later released a statement confirming they could not “substantiate the allegation” against Collins and no charges were brought against him. Catherine Hicks, who played his onscreen wife Annie, previously didn’t rule out a 7th Heaven reunion — under one condition. “It’s all up to the networks and those types of things. Creator Brenda Hampton addressed Hicks’ comments about a reunion, telling Life & Style in 2017, “I would include him. I think all the actors would like to do a reunion show.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/television-academy-second-annual-ai-summit-recap-1235110255/'>The Television Academy’s Second Annual AI Summit Pushed Calm — and Concern</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 16:00:00 <p>
Remember that time in your life when being forced to consume broccoli felt like a death sentence? The audience was left in a drowsy state, perfect for force-feeding “facts” that may have caused uproar or distress from more caffeinated individuals. Opening the event, senior marketing manager at Adobe, member of the TV Academy’s AI Task Force, and chair of the AI Summit, Kylie Pena said, “Our industry is embracing AI tools, experimenting boldly, and proceeding with a healthy amount of caution. The landscape has rapidly evolved, shaped by innovation, breakthroughs, and importantly, significant questions about ethics, creativity, and our responsibilities to creative and technical professionals across all of the TV Academy’s peer groups, many of which are represented here on stage today.” There are 31 peer groups across the entire Television Academy including Casting Directors, Writers, Costume Design & Supervision, Stunts, Lighting, Camera, & Technical Arts, and many more who might have something to say about the use of AI in film and television, but not one of these groups were represented in the morning’s conversations. Doing so only served to remind this writer that the insistence on its implementation is not a product of its usefulness, but our usefulness to it. Shamlin doesn’t believe this is something to question however, instead pushing the notion of opportunity. “For decades, the one thing studios controlled was access to high-end production, budgets that determined talent, crew, location, and scale. This was roughly how it was pitched in the first panel, “The Real Talk on Embracing Change.” Moderated by AI & media tech investor Seth Hallen, the panel featured chief content officer & EVP of Production at Metaphysic.ai, Ed Ulbrich, and longtime media executive and filmmaker Barbara Ford Grant. We didn’t call it AI, but machine learning, computer vision — that is not new. Ulbrich also pointed out that we’ve been scanning actors for 25 years to fill out crowd scenes, but only in the last few years has there been any pushback on it. Again, there is a little bit of selective presentation in this pronouncement, as Ulbrich didn’t acknowledge that this pushback comes from the new intent of modern machine learning, which — to a certain extent — is to replace actors by training AI on past work. For instance, Robert Zemeckis’ 2024 drama “Here” was able to de-age stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright in-camera as they were shooting, a process that years ago, might’ve taken weeks and millions more in the budget. “I look at it this way: People are like, ‘You’re eliminating jobs.’ Well, there’s a whole bunch of people who got to make that movie that wouldn’t have otherwise,” said Ulbrich. Ed Ulbrich, Barbara Ford Grant, and Seth Hallen Invision for the Television Academy Following “Real Talk,” the AI Summit attempted to answer these questions by bringing out a slew of legal experts including Loyola Law School professor Julie Shapiro, Protege Media’s Dave Davis, Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz’s Andrew Folks, and Covington & Burlington’s Robyn Polashuk. Moderated by chief client engagement officer for Screen Engine/ASI, Holly Leff-Pressman, the panel acted as a “Legal Ask Me Anything,” with attendees encouraged to text in questions for them all to answer. “The laws have not been prepared to address these technologies,” said Folks. Folks went on to share some of the regulatory action that has been put in place, such as the EU and Colorado AI Acts, as well as legislation in Virginia and Texas that “address AI from a comprehensive point-of-view.” He also discussed how existing law, such as copyright, can be “tweaked” to include AI, a concept that’s being litigated right now. OpenAI and Google have opposed this, recently arguing in an official U.S. government proposal that fair use protections be applied to all copyrighted material used for AI purposes. Immediately, a slew of over 400 A-list Hollywood power players condemned such an action. Considering AI was such a hot button issue for the WGA and SAG-AFTRA during the 2023 strikes, these two guilds have more protections than most when it comes to both utilizing the technology and preventing their materials being used for training models said Shapiro. The notion of regulation, particularly in Hollywood and Washington D.C., tends to make many balk. “I believe the Copyright Office — because it’s federal law — has been very cautious in terms of making a statement whether or not they need to rewrite certain sections or build in certain sections of the Copyright Act for this very purpose,” Shapiro said. Davis believes that ultimately, the fairest way to handle the use of copyrighted material is some kind of “licensing marketplace for AI training” that he believes companies in Silicon Valley are already preparing for. Ghen Laraya Long, Esq., Eric Weaver, Ben Sheffner Invision for the Television Academy Other horror stories related to the AI industry were shared in the next panel, “Evaluating AI Tools,” which featured a chat between Motion Picture Association SVP & associate general counsel Ben Sheffner and head of Virtual & Adaptive Production at USC’s Entertainment Technology Center Eric Weaver. One of the main topics of discussion included a real-word anecdote that speaks to the caution companies and individuals must take in handling this new technology. Copyright Office has said, and I know the previous panel touched on this, is that simply entering prompts into an AI system that produces an output is not copyrightable material.” Even if someone were to create hundreds of prompts before finally landing on their final product, the U.S. But politics aside, both Sheffner and Weaver counseled caution when it comes to downloading any AI tool and to make sure they’re from reputable sources. In terms of applying these tools, founder & chief creative officer of Secret Level Jason Zada presented two examples of work he and his company have done over the last year to show just how far the tech has advanced in that time. This is one of the big problems with current AI models and why many companies are seeking out more data for training. However, Zada did illustrate a good point in breaking down his workflow in that using the tech to build a vision for your project can often put many filmmakers ahead of the curve. “ChikaBOOM,” an animated project boasting the voice talents of Yara Shahidi, Daveed Diggs, and Natasha Lyonne, was also discussed by one of the show’s coordinators, Alyssa Katalyna. Applied to animation, AI tools are a little better hidden and do seem to be a more natural extension of traditional CGI, itself an advancement of 2D animation. Even so, it’s difficult not to consider where the use of this AI might lead. Is AI just a tool or do companies want it to replace human artistry, thereby helping their financial bottom lines? Ultimately, the Television Academy’s second annual AI Summit, though informative and well-curated, was too prioritized with the growth of this technology to offer space for those who question certain elements of its necessity. Putting up such blinders in pursuit of continued application and advancement certainly won’t help convince people to use it, but only serves to garner further distrust.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In a new interview, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh details his outrageous comedy film that never was. The “Presence” and “Black Bag” director told Men’s Health that he had a “frustrating” experience trying to get a script greenlit that was akin to “Team America” and “Blazing Saddles” in terms of being a “completely batshit crazy” story. And all the people that read it that could potentially pay for it, whether it be companies or wealthy individuals, said, ‘This is too hot.’ So, that was a bummer.” He continued, “I was really interested in making something that was like a full-on comedy, like ‘Blazing Saddles.’ Not a subtle comedy. But I like the idea of trying to make what would be the equivalent now of ‘Team America’ or ‘Blazing Saddles.’ Just something completely batshit crazy. … I want it to be outrageous, and to have people laughing at it, and other people going like, ‘I’m not sure you’re allowed to do that.’ That kind of thing.” But there is no question that ‘The Good German’ remains the most reviled thing I’ve ever made, which I’m kind of baffled by,” he said. And it was just odd, because of all the things I’ve done, that might have been the closest I got to getting what I saw in my imagination, you know? Soderbergh added, “Other stuff I’ve made — stuff that when it came out people were unhappy with —almost everything else has gone through a kind of cycle. Nobody has ever said, ‘Hey, I watched “The Good German” again. Soderbergh knows that modern younger audiences are more director-driven when it comes to their movie picks: “Here’s what I know from talking to Focus Features [which distributed ‘Black Bag’], and people at A24, and Neon: Young people, 25 and under, are going to the movies, and are very director-oriented.” Soderbergh previously told IndieWire in 2024 that, after publicly retiring in 2013, he had to realize how Hollywood has changed before returning to filmmaking. And so I announced that ‘Behind the Candelabra’ was going to be my last film for a period. I’m going to pursue something that I’ve been doing on the side, which is painting, and I’m going to get serious about that, and spend however many years I need to spend to get better at that.’”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/inside-the-fight-to-censor-miami-beachs-o-cinema.html'>The Miami Mayor’s Fight to Control a Movie Theater Isn’t Over Yet</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 15:10:33 <p>
An image from No Other Land, the Oscar-winning documentary by a Palestinian-Israeli activist collective. Mayor Steve Meiner looked almost apologetic on Wednesday at Miami Beach’s City Hall as he declared he would withdraw his own proposal, which threatened to terminate the arthouse theater O Cinema’s current lease and grant funding because it had screened the Oscar-winning Palestinian-Israeli documentary No Other Land. The proposal had been announced in an email newsletter sent on March 11, in which Meiner accused the film — which shows harrowing on-the-ground footage of the destruction of a West Bank village by Israeli soldiers between 2019 and 2023 — of being “egregiously antisemitic.” He claimed that his proposed legislation was intended for the city, which currently rents space to the theater at South Beach’s Historic City Hall, to “move on from O Cinema, as permitted by our contract, and seek a cultural partner that better aligns with our community values.” A woman who drove down from Broward County jokingly excused the pink rollers in her hair and pronounced that “Miami Beach sucks now.” O Cinema, she said, “is the only reason” she ever comes by anymore. Mountains filmmaker Monica Sorelle took her allotted minute to quote a statement from No Other Land co-director Yuval Abraham, and referenced a recent hate crime in which a Jewish Miami Beach resident shot two Israeli tourists because he believed they were Palestinians — an example of how hatred spreads blindly. One man compared No Other Land to D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation. But he also deferred a vote on a second resolution, which would “encourage” the theater to show films that “highlight a fair and balanced viewpoint of the current war.” An email from O Cinema went out Friday afternoon, addressed to friends and supporters, vowing to “remain in conversation with the city until it is resolved.” Dangling threads didn’t seem to dampen the mood after the meeting on Wednesday, however, as commissioner Joseph Magazine encouraged everyone present to take a photo together as a “sign of unity.” Only one, commissioner David Suarez, refused. (During the meeting, Suarez had called No Other Land “a megaphone for Hamas sympathizers” and declared that “most of the people here would be the first victims of Hamas.” He also went into graphic detail about how “women would be sexually mutilated, thrown off rooftops, and stoned to death.”) We’ve been within the city of Miami Beach for ten years,” Marthell added. O Cinema was the first theater in South Florida to screen No Other Land. This is far from the first attempt by South Florida politicians at interfering with film programming. Other forms of Palestinian art have been pulled elsewhere in Miami amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Tabsch and Marthell sound relieved that O Cinema has so far evaded the same fate as Tower Theater. But they are careful not to speak ill of those who threatened them. “Having good relationships with our elected officials is important,” Tabsch said, “and I hope that this is a bump in the road and we can get back to the great relationship we had going forward.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We also debate the merits of Disney’s controversial live-action “Snow White” and ask why Warner Bros. has it in for animation. As of March 16, the studio has removed the Looney Tunes cartoon shorts library (released 1930-1969), starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig, and Wile E. Coyote from streaming service Max. “Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav will do anything to save a dime.” Under his direction, the studio hasn’t been kind to animation. The “Looney Tunes” live-action hybrid film “Coyote vs. Acme” was scrapped by WBD in 2023 before the film was set to start streaming on Max, taking a $30 million tax write-off instead. WBD’s decision followed the similarly scrapped films “Batgirl” and animated feature “Scoob! Holiday Haunt.” It looks like, finally, indie distributor Ketchup Entertainment is in talks to release the film. And there was actually some good news this week from Florida, where the city of Miami backed off of trying to control what local arthouse O Cinema could show. On the Sundance front, this week Ryan, Brian Welk, and I each took one of the three cities that Sundance must choose as its new home when their Park City deal runs out in 2026. Park City has outgrown the festival by offering too few theaters and skyrocketing costs. One option is 45 minutes away at the major Delta Airlines hub Salt Lake City, home to major sports teams and plenty of venues, which has long played Sundance programming and has a lively film community. Salt Lake would seem a perfect fit, except for one thing: Republican Governor Cox is weighing whether to keep the festival’s revenues instate or sign a bill forbidding the flying of certain flags on state buildings and schools, including the Pride flag. Ryan and Anne both admire an extraordinary new hit Netflix series, “Adolescence,” from Plan B. The British series stars burly character actor Steven Graham, who gives an Emmy-worthy performance as a working-class father trying to do better than his parents ever did, but must now face the idea that his 13-year-old son may have killed a fellow student. Mike White’s “The White Lotus,” after treading water for an episode or two, has picked up the pace as the three women pals go into party mode, and Walton Goggins’ character heads for Bangkok to see an old friend, played by Sam Rockwell, who tells a riveting story about what he’s been up to, as Goggins reacts.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/snow-white-2025-lingering-questions.html'>What’s the New ‘Snow White’ Live-Action About? Lingering Qs</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 14:47:18 <p>
If there’s one truth about our world it’s that when a beloved Disney cartoon becomes a maligned Disney live-action remake, there’s always a lore drop. Sometimes this takes the form of a villain backstory — consider the spinoff films Maleficent or Cruella, or the detail that Gaston is a “war veteran” (which war?) Never has the encroaching specter of lore been more apparent than this weekend’s Snow White. Already maligned with controversy surrounding both stars Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler, the studio’s latest introduces a number of aggressively irrelevant details to further complicate its new take on an unimpeachable classic. In an attempt to better understand Snow White — who’d have thought we needed that? — some lingering questions about the film’s convoluted backstory. Where is this supposed to be set? Obviously, this isn’t really clear — we have no country name nor made-up map to look at — but Snow White makes reference to the wars “in the south.” Oh, Mary voice: “The south of what?” There’s also an area called the “Western Vale” (which is a region in Guild Wars 2, though that’s surely a coincidence). Wait, what are they at war over? It’s about an evil queen and dwarves, not military strategy. How does the government in Snow White function? We’re dealing with a mostly straightforward monarchy, with Snow White’s (Rachel Zegler) birth parents ruling until their untimely deaths and her stepmother (Gal Gadot) taking her throne in their absence. Under Snow White’s parents’ rule, everything seemed like an agrarian paradise, a loosely medieval kingdom where everyone is always eating fruit and/or pies and/or fruit pies. Whether or not they have a functioning trade system remains to be seen. What happened when the Evil Queen took over? The Evil Queen doesn’t care about pie; she cares about being the fairest of them all and jewels. She forced a number of the farmers to become guards or soldiers in her army — again, to fight what war? So the prince comes from another kingdom to rescue Snow White? Wait, so the prince is a pro-monarchist bandit? Yeah, there seems to be affection for the original line of royalty who were all about sharing resources, even though communism, or even socialism, is at odds with monarchy. The Evil Queen is bad, however, because she hoards resources. It’s not clear where the Evil Queen’s jewels and gems come from, nor do we know where the dwarves’ mining lodes are going. The dwarves tell Snow White they haven’t encountered a human in hundreds of years. They seem to be really old not-friends who all live in the same house. When you’re making a cartoon 87 years ago, you don’t have to explain how and why seven guys all live in the same house. In 2025, for whatever reason, that otherwise simple setup starts to feel a bit strange, like, are they friends or cousins or what? Does that power come into play during a climactic scene? Just to double back for a second, why does the Evil Queen’s policy shift from a pie-based economy to a gem-based send Snow White’s kingdom into economic depression? Did she make all the farmers and bakers become miners? No, it’s not really clear where her gems are coming from, just that she’s got a lot of them and doesn’t care about anything else. Mostly it seems like the people in the kingdom have just been starving and not farming during her reign of terror, though if she’s so focused on jewels, why does she care if anyone is farming? Do the pies look good at least?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/severance-season-3-renewal-1235110481/'>‘Severance’ Has Been Renewed for Season 3</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 14:00:00 <p>
“Making ‘Severance’ has been one of the most creatively exciting experiences I’ve ever been a part of,” executive producer and director Ben Stiller said in an official statement. “While I have no memory of this, I’m told making Season 3 will be equally enjoyable, though any recollection of these future events will be forever and irrevocably wiped from my memory as well.” Stiller helped announce the renewal by tweeting, “So some fans are asking for Season 3 of ‘Severance.’ What do you say, Tim Cook?” Apple CEO Tim Cook replied, “Season 3 of ‘Severance’ is available upon request.” “I can’t wait to continue spreading woe, frolic, dread, and malice with these truly incredible people.” Oh hey also — not a huge deal — but if you see my Innie, please don’t mention any of this to him. In “Severance,” Mark Scout (Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a “severance: procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. “Severance” Season 2 was also executive produced by John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Sam Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz, and Nicholas Weinstock. Stiller recently told IndieWire that Season 2 was “taking some chances” with the storytelling. What are we going to do for the next finale? … I feel like this finale, hopefully, is more of a standalone episode in its own way. It’s just its own thing, a little bit more, hopefully.” “No, the plan is not to [wait three years],” Stiller said during Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast ahead of the Season 2 finale. “Hopefully we’ll be announcing what the plan is very soon.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

First, people took issue with her heritage, because Snow White (a fictional character) is “canonically” white; then, she took flak for talking about the dated nature of the original film; and late last year, she apologized for anti-Trump statements she made on her Instagram. A rival studio executive told Vulture, “The reality is Rachel Zegler should not be playing Snow White.” It had multiple opportunities to defend Zegler against trolls who took issue with her casting, for racist reasons or otherwise, but did not. And her apology to Trump voters reeked of corporate cajoling. We’ve long known she can really sing (in West Side Story, sure, but have you seen her do “Gimme Gimme”? ) Her Snow White feels like a self-aware heroine in conversation with the Disney-princess mythos, far more skeptical than swooning, as well as gentle enough to appeal to children. (Like a presidential candidate, Zegler has turned much of her press tour into an exercise in baby-holding.) She has that princess-y spark that’s so necessary to these movies, and puts the “action” in live action: always looking, listening, responding to the environment around her. Her rendition of “Whistle While You Work” may be the movie’s big showstopper, a lively dance sequence in which Zegler is the only thing that feels alive. She moves and twirls as though this really is a lot of fun, and for a few minutes, all the baggage this movie carries with it washes away. There’s a dedicated earnestness to her approach to Snow White — she moves not as if she believes Snow White is “real” but as if she knows who is watching the movie (children, mostly) and what they want to get out of it (a nice time). Right now it stands as an artifact, mostly, of ideas that probably felt wiser many years ago, the whole thing now burdened by bizarre politics and overstuffed lore. In lieu of a Prince Charming, the love interest, is just a guy named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap) who advocates for Snow White to fight for herself … but also winds up saving her at the end of the day. Amid the mess, Zegler emerges as the singular force who summons actual magic in her performance, and is perhaps the only person who ought to come out of all this unscathed (except for Andrew Barth Feldman who “voices” Dopey — he’s fine). That the actor has yet to sign on to any new big-screen projects is not a huge surprise after the year she’s had, but that doesn’t mean Zegler is going away.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/live-action-disney-remakes-ranked.html'>Every Live-Action Disney Remake, Ranked</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 14:00:00 <p>
However, Disney’s commitment to mining past IP for fresh, nostalgia-fueled dollars means that we must continue to update this list every several months for the foreseeable future. The latest classic to meet this fate is Snow White. When, at the height of the so-called Disney Renaissance in 1994, the studio that was producing a string of animated hits decided to revisit an old favorite in a new way, no one could have predicted what a gigantic industry Disney’s live-action versions of its own animated movies would become. There were sporadic live-action adaptations in the years following that initial remake of The Jungle Book, including a stretch of movies like Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland that offered alternate, reimagined spins on classic films. That has often resulted in hermetically sealed reenactments designed only to remind viewers of something they’re already familiar with. In recent years, Disney has been mining its animated past more aggressively than ever before, and this week’s theatrical release of the long-delayed Snow White comes just a few months after prequel/sequel Mufasa: The Lion King and a few months before Lilo & Stitch. Along the way, Disney has stretched the definition of “live action” to encompass photorealistic CGI productions that include little to no actual live-action footage. Those movies are included in this ranking, though, since Disney has successfully sold them as something different from animation. Every movie adapted from a Disney animated feature film is here, from the semi-clever variations to the straightforward re-creations, all carefully prepackaged for easy, unchallenging consumption. Future Disney Channel star Brandon Baker plays Mowgli, in a cloying, awkward performance that fits with the hacky sitcom writing. The “jungle” looks like a low-rent animal-encounter attraction, and director Nick Marck places hyperactive voice-over dialogue alongside mostly static shots of real animals shuffling around uncomfortably, not moving their mouths. There’s no sense of adventure, just an annoying kid staring at various captive creatures while bored B-list actors recite bad jokes on the soundtrack. Cruella spends the first part of the movie supposedly reformed, thanks to some Jason Bourne–style government reprogramming, before reverting back to her evil ways. Mia Wasikowska’s Alice is adrift in her own story, mostly just reactive as she travels back in time ostensibly to save the doomed family of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Depp overloads on his irritating brand of wide-eyed whimsy, and a miscast Sacha Baron Cohen inexplicably sounds like Werner Herzog as the personification of Time. With his frequent fixation on technological advancements at the expense of storytelling, director Robert Zemeckis is a perfect fit for the current era of Disney remakes, as he proves in this unsettling, disastrous take on one of Disney’s earliest animated classics. Let’s be clear: This is not a live-action movie, no matter what Disney calls it. It’s also entirely stiff and lifeless, sacrificing the expressiveness of a cartoon for something that looks like it would play on TVs at Best Buy to demonstrate a horrifying new type of motion smoothing. His childhood animal playmates return to remind him about what matters in life, basically harassing him into becoming a better person. “Was it always this gloomy?” Christopher Robin asks when he returns to the magical Hundred Acre Wood, a relevant question about both the tone and visual style of such a dismal, hectoring movie. Bill Murray and Christopher Walken bring some charisma to their respective voice performances as Baloo the bear and King Louie the orangutan, but their half-hearted delivery of a couple of songs from the animated movie is pretty feeble, a reminder of how much more vibrant and memorable their cartoon counterparts are. The rest of this remake of Disney’s first-ever animated feature is simply underwhelming, with both Zegler and Gadot barely measuring up to costumed theme-park workers. Zegler has a lovely singing voice, but the slick, uninspired new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul sit awkwardly next to the old-timey originals. The hoodie-wearing rebel replacement for Prince Charming (Andrew Burnap) is smarmy and condescending, and the half-hearted attempts to give Snow White more agency are just meaningless padding. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson — in a hairstyle that makes her look exactly like Princess Diana — play the bland lovebirds whose pet Dalmatians inspire Cruella’s envy, and their scenes are dull and treacly, with weird patriarchal overtones. Screenwriter John Hughes cribs from his own Home Alone for the silly sequences of animals thwarting criminals, but these dogs have nothing on Kevin McCallister, especially since they never get to speak. Director Barry Jenkins’s slightly more elegant follow-up to the stilted Lion King remake has big prequel energy (it includes origins for both a rock and a stick), but no particular reason for existing beyond Disney’s insatiable hunger for brand extension. The framing story features annoying meta-commentary from Timon and Pumbaa, as flashbacks recount the early friendship between lions Mufasa (Aaron Pierre) and Scar (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), then known as Taka. It’s one thing to retell a famous fairy tale from an alternate perspective, but it’s another thing to figure out how to keep that new story going, whether it’s warranted or not. The studio demand for a follow-up to 2014 hit Maleficent doesn’t translate into an engaging narrative now that Sleeping Beauty villain Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) has been thoroughly rehabilitated. New conflict comes from Michelle Pfeiffer as a scheming queen whose son is set to marry Maleficent’s goddaughter Aurora (Elle Fanning), but the simplicity of the original fable is replaced with muddled lessons, ugly special effects, and a confusing metaphor for the displacement of native peoples. Tim Burton’s second Disney live-action remake is a poorer fit for his sensibilities than Alice in Wonderland, and he struggles to integrate his creepy-cute style with the basic, episodic structure of the animated classic. Bill Condon’s adaptation of the first animated movie ever to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture is also the first live-action remake to incorporate all of the songs from its source material. The casting of Halle Bailey as Ariel shows what a difference it makes when Disney recruits actual singers for roles that involve lots of singing, but she doesn’t do much more than smile beatifically when she’s not belting out musical numbers. The star-crossed romance between mermaid Ariel and human prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) is mostly a dud, although screenwriter David Magee attempts to give Eric some extra depth so that the connection is based on more than love at first sight. Bailey’s fantastic voice only takes the movie so far. The genie from the original Aladdin is a remarkable example of animators and a voice performer coming together to create something unique and brilliant, so there’s no way for a CGI-enhanced Will Smith to live up to Robin Williams’s legacy. Director Guy Ritchie adds unnecessary action scenes and a perfunctory solo song for Jasmine, but it all comes back to Smith’s desperate, attention-grabbing antics. This Disney+ original, which was a high-profile launch title for the streaming service, gets points for casting real-life rescue dogs rather than relying solely on antiseptic CGI replicas. The dogs are cute, although even with special-effects augmentations, they’re still far more inert than their animated equivalents. The iconic spaghetti-strand kiss barely registers in this version. It’s pleasant but forgettable, serving as the first of many reminders that, on Disney+, it’s just as easy to watch the earlier, better movie instead. Director Kenneth Branagh’s Cinderella is often elegant and opulent, and if nothing else, it scales back on the title character’s grating, obtrusive little mouse friends. Lily James’s Cinderella doesn’t have much more personality than the simplistic animated version, although she gets to have a few more substantive conversations with Prince Kit (Richard Madden) before becoming the object of his obsession. Cate Blanchett is relatively subdued as Cinderella’s wicked stepmother, with her shrieking stepsisters picking up most of the slack. Burton has spent the last 25 years or so adding his goth-lite aesthetic to various existing properties, often giving Johnny Depp a prominent role. It would be easy to dismiss all of those efforts as equally hollow, but it’s clear that Burton doesn’t have the same level of artistic engagement on all these projects. Depp is only mildly annoying as the Mad Hatter, and Mia Wasikowska brings a fierce indomitability to Alice that’s missing in the sequel. Jolie’s first go-round as the misunderstood Sleeping Beauty villain is much more successful than the second, although it still never quite justifies its independent existence. The villain role shifts to Sharlto Copley’s power-hungry King Stefan, but he never seems like much of a threat compared to the majestic Maleficent. There’s an added genuine human touch to director David Lowery’s Disney remakes, although this take on the story of Peter Pan isn’t as successful as his earlier version of Pete’s Dragon. Still, Lowery puts care and consideration into his characters, especially the adolescent Wendy Darling (Ever Anderson), whose reluctance to grow up leads her to Neverland along with her younger brothers. Jude Law’s Captain Hook becomes a more melancholy character thanks to revelations that tie his past to Peter’s, and his villain rehabilitation is more effective than certain flashier Disney efforts in that area. It’s a lower-tier example, but Nicolas Cage is having fun as an ancient sorcerer who’s frustrated by his clueless college-age apprentice (Jay Baruchel), and Alfred Molina relishes the role of the evil wizard out to destroy the world. It may be a somewhat empty pastiche of more subversive films, but director Craig Gillespie’s origin for 101 Dalmatians antagonist Cruella de Vil (Emma Stone) is still gorgeous to look at. Taking its cues from the previous live-action movies, Cruella is set in the fashion world of 1970s London, with both Stone and Emma Thompson (as Cruella’s rival the Baroness) channeling aspects of Glenn Close’s indelible performance. The faux-gritty Cruella is a sprawling mess of a movie that never quite figures out its tone or narrative approach, but it features fabulously creative costume design and enjoyably nasty performances from the two leading Emmas. Author Rudyard Kipling gets a possessive credit, but director and co-writer Stephen Sommers deviates substantially from both Kipling’s source material and the Disney animated film. Sommers is not working under the weight of decades of Disney remakes, so he’s free to make a rollicking pulp-adventure movie starring Jason Scott Lee as an adult Mowgli, returning to so-called civilization after growing up in the wild. Fans of Sommers’s retro action classic The Mummy will find plenty to enjoy, as a reluctant Mowgli leads a dastardly British captain (Cary Elwes) into various elaborate traps in search of hidden treasure. Director Niki Caro jettisons the songs and almost all of the humor from one of Disney’s weaker Renaissance-era animated films, depicting the Chinese legend of strong-willed female warrior Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) as a sweeping wuxia epic. It’s a rousing, immersive blockbuster action movie, with excellent fight sequences and a mesmerizing performance from Gong Li as the shapeshifting witch Xianniang. It’s a remarkably successful reinvention that stands confidently on its own. Even so, Lowery crafts a lovely, heartfelt coming-of-age movie in the vein of a 1980s Amblin Entertainment production, infused with compassion and tenderness. There’s some danger for feral boy Pete (Oakes Fegley) and his furry green dragon friend Elliot after they’re discovered living in the forest outside an idyllic small town, but Lowery’s film keeps its gentle rhythm even through the finale’s perilous bridge collapse. Robert Redford delivers folksy wisdom as a local eccentric who once had his own dragon encounter, and even Karl Urban’s greedy logger is more of a nuisance than an outright villain. Lowery demonstrates the best approach to a remake, by keeping only what’s useful and using what’s left for his own personal vision.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Severance” Season 2, Episode 10, “Cold Harbor.”] Of the many twists and turns lurking within the corridors of “Severance‘s” Season 2 finale, no fan should be surprised when, waiting behind the episode’s final bend, is Ben Stiller’s name. Officially the director and executive producer but unofficially the “conjurer” of Apple’s acclaimed corporate thriller (as dubbed by Adam Scott), Stiller’s “directed by” credit has graced 11 of the show’s 19 total episodes so far. “What I was attracted to in the second season was taking some chances,” Stiller said in an interview with IndieWire. “Woe’s Hollow” follows the MDR team on their first corporate retreat, and “Sweet Vitriol” visits the tiny town where Harmony grew up. Stiller himself described “Cold Harbor” as a “standalone episode.” “That was fun to go off on location and do those things, but it’s also interesting when you watch the whole season because every episode kind of has its own personality,” Stiller said. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. IndieWire: I love that Season 2 starts with Mark running into the office, looking for Gemma, and then it ends with him running back into the office, leaving her behind. In fact, I’d say it’s probably the first thing that we came up with. Knowing where you’re going, obviously, is very important. On this show, it’s always clear where we’re going, but the creative process — it’s different getting there. In the beginning, when we first thought about it, we didn’t know if we were going to go as far as him going with Helly all the way, but then as we were going along, we felt like we really should go that far because I didn’t want to do another cliffhanger type of ending where you didn’t know what he was going to do. I felt like, “OK, let’s go a little further with this because this makes sense,” and it also sets up a new reality for going forward in the show. How did you land on that freeze-frame for the final shot? For me, that image was just in my head from the beginning — when we said, OK, we’re going to go this far and this is where we’re going to take it. You don’t see freeze-frames at the end of movies that often these days, but it used to be done a lot more. It’s just kind of this moment in time where you’re like, “Oh, wow, this is the end of the movie, but it’s going to keep going. We just don’t know where it’s going to go.” You marinate in this moment. It reminded me of movies that I watched growing up. This slow zoom in on the freeze-frame reminded me of ’70s movies a little bit. I think it’s kind of signaling, “Hey, we’re going into a different tone here now. We are going into a different reality for these people.” When I first saw it, my brain immediately went to “The Graduate,” even though that doesn’t end on a freeze-frame. Now what?” And it’s the rest of your life, you know? Because Season 1’s closing shot is so striking — a feeling that only intensified as people waited for Season 2 to come out — did you feel any extra pressure to produce another indelible image this time? Something people will really remember while they wait for Season 3? [Laughs] What are we going to do for the next finale? And the only thing that was in our head, really, was just like, “Well, let’s just not do the same thing.” I don’t want to do the same thing, but I do want to have something that’s hopefully memorable and stays with you and feels visceral. I think the reason why that finale works for people is that it’s tying up all these loose ends from the season, and I feel like this finale, hopefully, is more of a standalone episode in its own way. It’s just its own thing, a little bit more, hopefully. As much as some people want to say, “Work is just what I do, it’s not who I am,” that’s not necessarily true — not when you’re devoting so much of your time to a job, to a place, to the people who work there. I thought that was a really worthwhile thing to explore. To me, his storyline is much more kind of personal in that way. But the Milchick one is most indicative of how you navigate within a company and when you advocate for yourself or not, and all this corporate kind of crap that you have to deal with. The other layer to it is when you work at Lumon, it’s not just you’re working for the company. Zach Cherry and Tramell Tillman in ‘Severance’ Courtesy of Jon Pack / Apple TV+ How did prepare for that scene as a director? And every time we would rehearse it, or there would be a draft of it that Dan [Erickson] would write, we’d have these discussions about it — Adam and Dan and myself and Beau Willmon — we were all talking about, like, what is this conversation? How is Innie Mark going to take it in? So there was the content of it, which we kept rewriting every time we rehearsed it, and then there was the question I was thinking about as a director: How are we going to do this that’s going to make it interesting visually because it’s a long-ish scene? You can’t just show it in real time. The scene would go on forever and be so boring. Once we finally rehearsed it on set, Jessica [Lee Gagné] and I just came up with very simple rules [for shooting it]. Then the blocking of it, figuring it out with Adam: When would he stand up, if he stood up? And it felt like, well, he’s the same person, so when he stands up as his Outie, his Innie is going to get pissed off and he’ll stand up too because they kind of have the same instincts? How exacting did you end up getting with Adam in terms of blocking out those movements? Having worked with Adam on the show for the last almost five years or whatever — it’s crazy we started doing it that long ago — I feel like I know him well enough, and he knows me. The way we’ll approach working on a scene is I want to hear what his instincts are as an actor. So part of me is like, “Oh, this would be easier if nobody ever stands up and we’re just in one place all the time, but is that right for the scene?” Then he’s like, “No, I think I might be walking around.” “So what point would you get up?” “Well, probably when he gets upset here.” So we work it out together and I make sure he feels comfortable. So I can’t give enough credit to Adam in a scene like that because he’s having to play two characters. He was like, “Hey, I think I have to be trying to manipulate him a little bit.” And Innie Mark picks up on that. That made a huge difference in the scene, too. When [the editor] Geoff Richman said, “Yeah, I have a first cut of it. It’s like 18 minutes long,” I was like, “Oh, shit!” [laughs] But I have to say, when we would go in the editing room and start watching, even the long cut of it, I would get caught up in the conversation. So when I first started watching it, I thought, “OK, I think that’s a good sign as someone who’s read it and shot it, that I’m getting caught up in the conversation that Adam’s having, the writing is making sense.” So that was a clue that, OK, this could be working well.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Erin Simkin/Netflix, Walt Disney Studios, Apple TV+, PBS The in-theater selections are between a Disney princess (who doesn’t sing “Someday My Prince Will Come”) and two Robert De Niros, while the at-home streaming options are at least a few whodunnits. When the White House’s chief usher (Giancarlo Esposito) dies under mysterious circumstances during a State Dinner, world-famous eccentric detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba) is on the case with a bumbling FBI special agent (Randall Park) as her ad hoc assistant, just trying to keep up. Everyone living and working in the president’s residence is a suspect, including Ken Marino, Jason Lee, Jane Curtin, and Susan Kelechi Watson. ➽ So, how many whodunnit tropes does The Residence pull? As an adaptation of the Disney classic, Snow White feels like it dislikes its source material, eschewing most of the 1937 film’s memorable tunes for some new forgettable pop songs. That’s due to Rachel Zegler, who shines as a Disney princess as she acts and sings circles around the rest of the cast, including Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen, who rules over the kingdom, sure, but she seems way more concerned with having gems and looking good at all times. ➽ After a long and controversial road to release, this movie can finally breathe. This cozy British mystery comedy has finally arrived Stateside. David Mitchell (Peep Show) plays John, a socially awkward puzzle-maker, who is thrust out of his comfortable, quiet life when his identical twin, James, a detective, goes missing. John’s investigation gets derailed by a new murder each episode, but wouldn’t you know it, his puzzle skills prove him quite adept at solving whodunnits. Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis return as Thomas Cromwell and Henry VIII in a continuing adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s stunning trilogy. The performances are the chief reason to watch, especially Rylance’s Cromwell, but there’s at least one other draw: great hats. The Barnetts, most likely inspired by the 2009 film Orphan, became paranoid that their new daughter, Natalie Grace, wasn’t actually a young girl. They claimed she was 22 years old and essentially abandoned her. There are a lot of questions that we hope Severance will answer by its season-two finale, but one we’re sure it’ll never address is pay. It’s a touchy subject, but really, how much is brain surgery worth? Well, thankfully, Nic Juarez dived into that crucial Severance mystery for us here. You’ve got the season’s darling, Anora, on Hulu, which won Best Picture, and Best Actress for Mikey Madison, and notched filmmaker Sean Baker a record-breaking collection of four Oscars. And who can forget about Wicked, now holding space on Peacock.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Jack Harlow’s new music video for his track with Doja Cat, “Just Us,” features some delightfully random celebrity cameos. Set in a star-studded restaurant, the video sees Harlow in full skeezeball mode with Doja, rapping “I wish it was just us in this bitch / but they can’t trust us in this bitch / ’cause I’m trying to bust nuts in this bitch” in front of dork-at-large Nicholas Braun; John Mayer, who is very deep in conversation with somebody (probably Andy Cohen); and a sullen solo Matt Damon sitting at the bar. But he does order two drinks, so maybe Ben Affleck isn’t far. Elsewhere in the video, Doja Cat and Jack Harlow touch up on each other without kissing in various restaurant locations, including the kitchen. Plus, Pinkpantheress and sports journalist Taylor Rooks make cameos. Does their presence distract from a hook about hooking up with Jack Harlow?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/yellowjackets-recap-season-3-episode-7.html'>Yellowjackets Recap: Where the Wild Things Are</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 10:00:17 <p>
“Croak” is available to stream now via Paramount+; it will make its Showtime network premiere on Sunday. The episode opens with a single perfect frog. It hops around for a moment before settling down, puffing its slimy sac out, and then opening its mouth to release an otherworldly screech. The camera pulls out to reveal dozens, if not hundreds, of these little creatures scuttling in a pond, screaming and mating and screaming some more. Sometimes, the things we perceive as threats or horrors are just a bunch of animals in the wilderness, trying to get their evolution on; every organism is simply trying to survive. Every time the show introduces a potential supernatural element, it’s negated. These girls have had an entire spring and summer to figure out how to hike out of there, and they just haven’t tried. The wilderness isn’t keeping them there; it’s their own collective inertia. And as for Lottie, their spiritual leader, well, she becomes the very first Yellowjacket to kill in cold blood. But let’s backtrack to the beginning of this episode. Apparently, these little creatures hibernate for years, only to emerge and have a “summerlong frog orgy” to repopulate their species. Researchers Edwin (Nelson Franklin) and Hannah (Ashley Sutton) are smitten with one another, with Edwin following Hannah on her journey to record the eerie mating sounds. Along with them is a hiking guide named Kodi. The amazing and hilarious Joel McHale plays Kodi. The role of mysterious military heavy feels a little off for McHale, but he did recently play a soulless restaurant owner in The Bear, so the man is proving that he has range. The group gets caught in a rainstorm one day, so they decide to smoke a joint and listen to Sugar Ray’s “Fly.” Fun times. But then a fully baked Hannah decides that she wants to call Miss Cleo from the satellite phone. Then, Edwin’s suspicions of Kodi go from bad to worse as they continue on their mission. So, when they hear (and smell) something the next night, Edwin is encouraged to investigate. It’s unclear whether or not the encounter with the frog people will lead to an active rescue, but as we only have two-three more months left in the wilderness timeline, it feels like these new people provide a catalyst for rescue in some way. They have become stealth animals, and watching them operate on collective instinct to locate and capture two innocent humans is invigorating. We’ve gotten teases of it with the group’s pursuit of Travis in season one and their attempt to hunt Natalie in season two, but this time the girls are a team, hunting strangers that pose a threat to their livelihood. Hannah hides in an old tree stump and dictates a message to her daughter on her DAT recorder while Kodi tries to run out of danger and instead finds himself corralled by Akilah, Travis, and Misty (of all people). She talks to Jeff about it, but he’s still in denial mode. And they seem to be gearing up for yet another murder as Shauna, Van, Tai, and Misty head off on a road trip to Virginia in Shauna’s clunker of a van. Having all the survivors back together in one place is fun, and watching these four actresses play off of one another is always a treat. They still lean on their old high school dynamics, with Tai and Van chatting with Misty about her Walter situationship, and haggling over who pays for gas. Instead, she tells Van that she will follow the whims of the universe if it keeps her love alive. These women are still so scared of Shauna, and it’s hilarious. But then a fresh new hell arises as Van starts vomiting blood. She was her wilderness wife, so I guess there’s that. It’s feeling more and more like Tai is not herself and that she has been taken over by her dark half, but to what end? Shauna does some performative huffing, says she’s going to go get a Coke, and then ditches her entire crew at the hospital without a word. For what it’s worth, though, I don’t think she killed Lottie. I see no clear motive for Callie, but it would match up with the DNA evidence, and perhaps there’s a twist in store for us down the line? Callie hasn’t done much but whine about her suspension and yearn for a more meaningful connection with her mom this season, so a surprise killer role might shake things up for her storyline. She watches, giant knife at her side, as people flutter behind the windows. However, it’s interesting to note that we have not seen Shauna kill anyone in the wilderness timeline. In a disturbing image, she babbles to Edwin’s bashed-in skull, anointing herself with his blood as she whispers to the wilderness. The rest of the Yellowjackets kind of just shrug off her behavior, like, “Oh, that’s just our kooky oracle, doing kooky oracle things; what are ya gonna do?” They’re annoyed with her, but they don’t judge. Meanwhile, Shauna and Van return to camp with Hannah in tow. I’m Hannah.” Oh man, this woman is doomed. • Love how Misty snipes at Shauna about asking for help cleaning up Adam’s murder. She says that she’ll probably need her help for whatever she’s planning to do to Hannah’s daughter, too, saying, “If past is prologue, you will.” But to be completely honest, Misty didn’t do such a great job of cleaning up Adam’s murder either. • Shauna says she doesn’t deserve Jeff, and I nearly screamed at my TV that she does not, indeed, deserve him. I agree with her sentiment in the season three premiere that he would flourish as a widower.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/is-the-pitt-realistic-real-er-doctor-comparison.html'>A Real-Life ER Doctor Examines The Pitt</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 10:00:00 <p>
“I’m constantly saying, ‘That’s what we do! That’s the thing I told you about!’ And my wife is constantly saying, ‘Hey, can you quit pausing?’” Photo: Warrick Page/Max Read Noah Wyle’s take on episode 12, “6:00 P.M.,” here. Watching The Pitt often feels like navigating an anxiety attack: You’re overwhelmed with a wave of doom, you work through it, then you deal with however things shake out … just as the next wave hits again. Max’s spiritual successor to ER — though it’s legally complicated to call it that — follows a shift in the life of a busy emergency room in Pittsburgh. Visceral, grisly, and exceedingly stressful, The Pitt draws a lot of its stickiness from its real-time structure: Taking a page out of 24, the 15-episode season tracks the goings-on of one entire 15-hour shift. To kick the tires on these plaudits, Vulture reached out to a medical professional who is a fan of the show: Dr. Lukas Ramcharran of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. and an M.B.A. from New York University, Ramcharran serves as an attending physician and assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins. In other words, he’s a real-life comp for Dr. Robby. We spoke earlier this week ahead of The Pitt’s eighth episode, as he was enjoying an off day doing administrative tasks on his computer. I’ve heard some people say that The Pitt is the most realistic depiction of emergency medicine on television, perhaps ever. My wife and I are not huge consumers of television, because we have a 10-month-old at home and we have another due in a month. She’s working full-time, and I’ve got ER shifts. Years ago, I watched ER, and I loved that show at the start when it was really about the medicine, but less so as the show understandably had to create more plotlines and become more dramatized. But what really turned me on to it was seeing social-media chatter from the educational side of things. EM:RAP endorsed it, which is a national education platform for emergency medicine that creates a lot of content we use for learning about the specialty. It’s a wonderful resource outside of the more traditional lectures and things we do in the formal residency-training program. Then I saw some promotional clips with Noah Wyle and physicians who were consulting on the show talking about the medical boot camp they had put the actors through to get them to portray this as accurately as they could, and that really got me interested. But surely you still went into the show with some skepticism. A lot of us in the field, regardless of speciality, like to poke fun at how inaccurate things are depicted on television. My wife, who’s not in medicine, and I have been together since college, and she’s seen me go through the entire educational pipeline to become an attending physician. I’ve always told her I would love for our family to see what we do on a daily basis — to see the specialty that I love and have dedicated my life to. Of course, because of HIPAA and patient-privacy needs, we can’t ever have family members stop by on a workday, so my primary motivation was seeing if this show could show her that. I’m constantly pausing and saying, “That’s what we do! “This would actually be more bloody” and so on. And she is constantly saying, “Hey, can you quit pausing?” You have the medicine, but you also have all these other non-medicine things that pull at your attention: your team members, your hospital, the trials and tribulations of working with people who come to you on their worst day. Unlike other shows, it doesn’t linger in long dramatic plotlines. You’re trying to do the medicine, but you’re also there for the education of your medical residents. He’s constantly dropping into things, seeing where he can help out a learner, giving them a little bit of autonomy, giving them some leash, trusting his senior residents and empowering them to take on the next stage of their career. You have the social worker, who’s probably one of my favorite characters; they are the unsung heroes in many ways. They are the ones who are trying to look at systematic and operational issues, asking, “How can we take care of more patients?” How many times per day do administrators actually visit an emergency department? The idea of an administrator coming down in the actual shift and engaging with you in real time … that’s not realistic. You can imagine how that would be an incredible disruption to patient care. Those sentiments are true, but it isn’t necessarily felt on an individual-to-individual level. We all feel the stresses of a strained hospital system: congested waiting rooms, the patients who are admitted but not yet upstairs. It isn’t typically expressed as interpersonal conflict. I understand why they do that for the show, but in real life, it tends to be more collaborative. There’s a lot of us saying, “How do we get better?” It’s certainly not an excuse for prolonged wait times, but my hope is that if a patient sees a show like this, there’s exposure to an issue we’re trying to remedy. But he is very skilled in terms of his clinical ability. It’s the family members who you’re trying to help understand the poor prognosis, or intubating someone whose family is revoking those goals of care in real time. There’s a case in the show where a mom intentionally gets herself into the hospital to draw attention to her son who may be having thoughts of hurting people in school. So she threatens the patient, who’s in a vulnerable state. I thought that one was a little dramatized.” Photo: Max Those cases really illustrate how complex things can get. Sometimes we see female patients who are victims of domestic violence, and the decision to report is ultimately theirs. There’s that case on the show where a mother has been giving her husband medication to curb his libido, but giving that medication is illegal and highly dangerous and may result in death. In real life, we would partner with the mom and the social worker, we would have a discussion, we would ask permission to engage with the daughter and find out if there’s probable cause where we can start involving the authorities. There are things that can medically and legally emancipate a minor from their parents’ care, but this is one where you have no reason to believe the mother is also abusing the child. Then, the series shows a doctor overstepping ethical bounds and taking justice into her own hands. What’s interesting, of course, is how they’re indicating that this character (Dr. Trinity Santos, played by Isa Briones), who’s already a bit of a loose cannon, has a troubled past that somehow overlaps with the situation. So she threatens the patient, who’s in a vulnerable state. I thought that one was a little dramatized. I’ve never met a physician who’d do that. There are so many of these moral conundrums in this one shift. If things were like this every day, the burnout would be hard to overcome. I have a technical question: In the hub area, the physicians choose their next patients off what appears to be a Google doc. That’s the track board of electronic medical records. We use Epic, which is the main electronic-medical-record system used around the country that shows you patient information: vital signs, age, sex, different color codes telling you different levels of acuity. It might look like a Google doc from afar. What The Pitt demonstrates is a very common model, where physicians are constantly looking at a central screen figuring out what’s next, and the charge nurse is calling out what emergencies are coming through next. We don’t have a central screen, and our charge nurses are managing who goes into what rooms. Once, but it was not in front of a patient. In this case, it was a mix of hours of training and dehydration, and it all caught up to them. You might have a medical student who’s not going into emergency medicine, for whom this is their first emergency-medicine experience, and it’s quite overwhelming. I’ve had observers in the ER from our medical school and from our undergraduate campus get lightheaded and have to sit down or exit the room. But in terms of fully passing out, just one. What happens to Dr. Whitaker (Gerran Howell) is deeply accurate. We’ve all gotten multiple types of body fluids on us. We certainly don’t eat in the clinical area. It’s what we call a JCAHO violation, which is a violation in terms of patient safety and hospital operations. We also don’t eat in front of patients, because a lot of patients are not allowed to eat if they’re awaiting surgery. A lot of emergency-medical clinicians just don’t eat. I personally do a lot of protein shakes and liquid calories, so I don’t ever have to sit down to eat on a shift and I can walk around with them. You don’t really get a mandated break for meals. We all have our different tricks on how to take care of ourselves. And the bio breaks — bathroom breaks — look, we’ve all been there where you walk toward the bathroom and a gunshot victim comes in and you just have to hold it. What’s your favorite procedure depicted on the show so far? We also do dual defibrillation, which is what you see the two residents use: Two defibrillation pads are used to try to overwhelm the electrical system and get that heart out of rhythm. It’s much more complicated in real life, but seeing the cardiothoracic surgeons come down, seeing them cannulate, putting those large lines to the patient, seeing a resident explaining to a medical student but almost explaining it to the audience — I got really excited about that. How common is it to have a super-young resident? I’ve certainly never had a child prodigy. We’ve had international trainees from Europe and Canada where they might be a year or maybe two years younger than the average. But I’ve never had somebody that young. I imagine it’s not impossible, but they still would need all these years of premed training in college and then medical school. I think every attending will probably say Dr. Robby. While I don’t see a lot of myself in him, I sympathize with the plight and what he’s grappling with. As I said, there are things he could do better, and we’ll see what happens as the show goes on, but I appreciate that he gives his colleagues and his support staff his best. [Laughs] I think if you talk to any spouse of a clinician, who themselves are not in medicine, they’ll wholeheartedly agree with the fact that when they get around their friends, all they do is talk medicine. It’s a huge part of our purpose in life. I would not be in an academic setting if I did not believe in buying into the mission of training the next generation. So this kind of stuff doesn’t stress me.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For those of us who have spent our lives in women’s sports, the current moment of hype and excitement has required us to straddle two realities at once. On the one hand, things are changing in a real and substantial way. Despite losing Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese to the WNBA, viewership of this year’s women’s college basketball season was up on ESPN, with a record 15 games drawing over 500,000 viewers, setting us up for what could be another blockbuster March Madness, starting today. A paradigm shift is clearly underway, as investors start to see the business opportunity women’s sports represent. And yet, most athletes aren’t feeling this change. They’re seeing the spike in interest, hype and franchise valuations, but their bank accounts aren’t getting any bigger. Angel City FC might have sold for a quarter of a billion dollars last year, but the average NWSL salary is $117,000 (compared to $594,390 for the MLS). Almost all of these teams still operate at a loss, and no franchise is close to cracking the world’s 100 most valuable, all of which are worth $2 billion or more. In the past, you could point to a lack of broadcast deals as hindering the growth of women’s sports, but this accessibility problem has mostly been solved. Yes, you might need a variety of subscriptions to make it happen, but today, for the first time in history, a majority of women’s sports events are just a few clicks away—the same as men’s sports. So if the investment is there, the games are available and women’s sports have never been more popular—why are athletes still struggling? What’s actually stopping us from unlocking this space? The problem is they are never these platforms’ main priority. So even as they’re smashing viewership records, women’s sports are still fighting for scraps when it comes to coverage, promotion and shoulder programming. Many of these platforms use a sub-brand to cover women’s sports, itself an implicit confession that their flagship IP will always prioritize men’s. These sub-brands are essentially side projects, run by talented people with good intentions, but never given the actual resources to thrive. In theory, these platforms could cover women’s sports. But in practice, doing so would put them in conflict with their core business, which is, and will continue to be, men’s sports. The broadcast platforms they partner with have significantly larger deals with men’s leagues like the NFL and NBA, and so that’s where they’re going to focus their resources, because they need to make the most of those rights. This content outside the games isn’t just important for driving tune-in. It’s what creates the immersive world of sports, giving fans common touchpoints and conversations to join at any time. This lack of coverage and content outside of the games is what allowed us to launch and grow Just Women’s Sports (JWS) from a single Instagram account to a multi-platform brand reaching 105 million fans a month. Our mission is to make women’s sports huge. Women’s March Madness rights, sold as part of a package deal, run through 2032. Two things can be true at once: These deals are a significant source of revenue, but leagues can’t rely only on their broadcast partners to provide the comprehensive coverage that will transform women’s sports from a series of isolated events into 24/7, year-round entertainment. We have to look elsewhere to build an ecosystem where the lights never turn off, where coverage doesn’t stop after the final whistle, where highlights, analysis and storytelling are available every day, and where fans don’t just tune in to the occasional event—they engage and connect in real-time, around-the-clock. Without such a media ecosystem, women’s sports will stay stuck where they currently are, with only a handful of prominent athletes breaking through, while the rest struggle to pay their bills. A previous version reported $56,000, which is the league minimum.)

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/michelle-zauner-japanese-breakfast-for-melancholy-brunettes.html'>Michelle Zauner’s Success Nearly Destroyed Her</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 09:00:00 <p>
‘That was sad for me because I had achieved this dream of mine, and parts of it were difficult.’ Photo: Marco Giannavola/ Japanese Breakfast’s new album is out now. Chew on For Melancholy Brunettes (and Sad Women) while you devour our interview with the band’s front woman, originally published on March 11, 2025. It was 2021, and she had just released an acclaimed record with her band Japanese Breakfast followed by an even more acclaimed memoir, Crying in H Mart. But the success of both was wreaking havoc on her body. “I was just keeled over with stomach pain before every show,” she says. People are going to find out that I am an awful singer.” By the end of 2023, she had moved to South Korea to start work on her second book — and recuperate. The trip was a long time coming: For nearly a decade, Zauner has been mastering the art of turning personal lore into indie-rock and literary gold. Psychopomp, her first studio album as Japanese Breakfast, emerged in 2016 and chronicled the immediate fallout of her mother’s death; in 2018, Zauner expanded on those memories and her sense of Korean American identity with an essay in The New Yorker titled “Crying in H Mart.” When her full-length memoir arrived in 2021, shortly before the band’s third studio album, Jubilee, the book spent more than a year atop the New York Times’ best-seller list. Taken together, it felt like a genuine celebration: One could finish paging through Zauner’s heart-wrenching story and then witness her bouncing across the stage in a puff of taffeta at Radio City or on SNL with what looked like an inarguably hard-won joy. I recently met Zauner over lunch in New York, where she’s back after spending the past year abroad. It’s clear that her time in Korea not only gave her some professional breathing room, but also a wider perspective on the decisions she’s made. She’s now gearing up for her public return as Japanese Breakfast with the March 21 release of a previously shelved record, For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women). The project touches on her recent artistic success, though its storytelling is both subtler and meatier than what fans accustomed to her popularized first-person register might expect. Instead, she writes vignettes of muddy, moody characters who insist on playing with fire. It’s new lore for a new era, but Zauner remains firmly herself: “All of my ghosts are real,” she sings, almost with a sigh of relief. Looking back, it’s wild that Crying in H Mart and Jubilee came out within two months of each other. I was like, Two months is enough for them to be considered separate entities. A lot of the press I was doing combined them; they almost felt like simultaneous releases. I was initially very afraid that something in the book was going to paint my album in a negative light because it was just so open, and I felt that it put the record in a vulnerable position. I was able to get a lot of opportunities that I wouldn’t have if they were separate, like Late Night or SNL. I’m not sure, if we just had a record out, I would have been considered a large enough artist to be given that kind of opportunity. Did its success change your relationship with the public? Were fans stopping you on the street and doing drive-by trauma dumps? I’m at a very cozy level of notoriety where that doesn’t happen very often, and when it does, it’s always a really sweet thing. I almost feel like I’ve been so open with my life and my person that no one wants to know any more. That’s heartening in light of how so many female artists have been talking about their experience with the parasocial element of fame. Last year, Mitski compared fame to “the shittiest exclusive club in the world … where strangers think you belong to them.” Chappell Roan likened it to “the vibe of an abusive ex.” But it doesn’t sound like that’s been your experience. What both of those women have said about fame is completely valid to their experience. I can totally see why they feel that way. I know Mitski is a very private person, and there are just experiences that she’s had that I haven’t. I get wild asks from the press sometimes. I’ve had a publication ask for photos of my mother when she was sick, which I found to be really cruel. You’ve described For Melancholy Brunettes as a response to the period when you had this breakthrough album and a best-selling novel — everything an artist could ever want. But you also felt a sense of doom. I come from a DIY background where I’ve been playing music since I was 16 years old, booking shows, promoting myself, touring the country in vans, sleeping on floors, carrying my amp down rickety stairs. I have to keep going at this clip. When we first went on tour after the pandemic, we were doing six days on for six weeks. It might’ve been right when we were playing shows again. You have to remember that this was right after the pandemic. Can you imagine having gone from a year of not seeing anyone to then playing the biggest concerts of your life? That whole cycle was very scary for me; I had all of these skin and stomach issues. It was just stress — and not sleeping enough. I was honestly living on anxiety medication for the last three years in order to sleep. We were flying a lot; it was really hard on the body, and I remember reading about Jim Croce dying in a plane crash on the way to do a performance. It’s so fun and amazing to travel the world and play shows, but it requires a lot of being absent from your life. And I think that was sad for me because I had achieved this dream of mine, and parts of it were difficult. I think that was part of what made it really challenging. The book afforded me financial security in a way that made me question it: Do I need to go so hard? But it’s tough because there are ten people who are in the band and crew who I feel a responsibility of taking care of. It seems like touring is only getting more expensive, too. If I get sick, I have people’s salaries and a bus to pay for during the seven-to-ten-day recovery time it takes for me to get back to playing. You just become so obsessed with your health and body, but it’s hard to take care of it when you’re sleeping in a bus and you can’t cook for yourself. Also, I used to drink a fair amount before playing shows, and I was quickly realizing that that was not sustainable. But how do you throw a party every single day just completely sober when that’s not something that you’ve done before? When did you start thinking about taking a year off and going to Korea? My publisher said, “We will support your next book. We can’t wait for your next one.” And the only idea I had for it was what my mom used to say to me: “If you lived in Korea for a year, I think you would become fluent in the language.” And I was kind of curious to put that to the test. I loved the idea of a project that forced me to focus on one thing and to live a quieter, humbler life in one place. They were all supportive, but I felt very, very guilty before telling them that that was what I wanted to do. How did it feel to be in the motherland? Within the Asian diaspora, that kind of homecoming is a famously fraught experience. Yeah, I may be guilty of seeing it through rose-colored glasses because the things that are problematic about Korean culture, I felt a bit protected from. It was the first time that I returned to Korea feeling like a successful woman. Even the etiquette and the rules of certain mannerisms would’ve been uncomfortable for me when I was younger, but it was kind of a fun challenge for me to understand. When people say, “But you’re not Korean,” I’m not so bristly about it because I understand what that really means. I have this joke with friends where it’s like you go back and think it’s going to feel like, Now this is where I belong! But the mindfuck is that turns out you don’t really belong there, either. Not all Korean people are like this, but I’ve had some Korean people say to me, “I don’t understand why Korean Americans are so obsessed with our culture.” I feel like it’s so judgmental and unfair because any time a Korean person is trying to stake out a position or find themselves, at least in the U.S., I’m always rooting for them. I didn’t listen to any English music with English lyrics; I didn’t watch any TV or movies. I just wanted to be completely immersed in Korean content. I learned a lot about Korean cinema and watched K-dramas. I’m just obsessed with how this record is being perceived. It’s a very self-absorbed thing, but I would love to get offline. What is the scariest place to search for yourself? After SNL and every live performance, I try to not read those. Has your approach to promoting yourself on social media changed this time around? Now that you’ve returned and are gearing up to tour for it, does the album itself feel differently to you? I’m not sure how people will receive it. It’s less of an obvious record and a slower burn. I hope that people take their time with it. I was inspired by this Kenny Rogers song called “Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town,” which is about a war veteran who is pleading with his lover. My producer, Blake Mills, and I knew for a long time that this was going to be a good opportunity for a cameo feature, and we passed back different ideas for who could play this role, who had sort of a lower-register voice. Blake had played on a record of Jeff Bridges’s and played me a song of his called “Nothing Yet,” which I thought was so beautiful. So Blake texted him, and Jeff video-called us out of the blue 30 minutes later. After I did Conan O’Brien’s podcast, Conan sent me a typewritten letter, from the typewriter, with a little drawing on his own stationery. How does that experience compare to releasing a personal album, where you can cloak details in music and metaphor? It’s interesting having that experience with the book; it’s so rooted in actual moments that you just don’t have the real estate for in songs. But I wrote the song “Orlando in Love,” and I made a video that was very clear to me what was happening. And then when I was doing an interview, the journalist asked me if it was about the pressures of being an ideal woman, because that’s one of the lyrics, and it blew my mind that someone could have that interpretation when it seemed to me so clearly just a fictional story about this man. So it was interesting to me that writing Crying in H Mart was the first time that people really understood. There are certain songs that I think are easier to understand than others, but one thing that I really love about writing music is the freedom to dip in and out of fiction and nonfiction, how you can jump from song to song to a different topic and then you find this narrative thread between them. And yeah, I think that this narrative thread is going to be a little bit more challenging than the one before for some people. What did it feel like to wrestle with the idea that you were ceding control to a new narrator or other storytellers? I would love to have the opportunity to do it again with something that’s a little bit less touchy for me, obviously, because I think that so much of making a film is you have to listen to a lot of people, and that can be a really positive collaborative experience. But I was honestly very defensive and guarded because it’s an extremely difficult, personal story. With music, I’ve always been on an indie label, and they’ve never told me what to do in terms of the creative work; I’ve never been given notes. What kind of notes were you getting on the adapted screenplay? I worried about changing the order of certain events and how it might shed a negative light on certain characters. In a recent interview, you mentioned that the Crying in H Mart movie is now on hold indefinitely after director Will Sharpe stepped away from the project. We were waiting to get green-lit and then during the writers strike, the director felt that this movie wasn’t going to get made. I had a very big meltdown in Hamburg, Germany, when he called and let me know, because it was a year of my life that felt completely down the drain. But I think, if anything, perspective makes the best work. I was going to say: You’ve directed a few of your music videos. I’m still working with my producers about a long-term plan to see that to fruition, but I’d rather it not be a movie than a bad movie. So I don’t want to take it on until it’s something that I feel ready to do.

Or is that one actually more straightforward than all the others? I don’t know how difficult it will be for me, but so much of this record is fixated with this kind of anticipatory grief of the artistic life that I may have to leave behind in some capacity. Or it might change in a great way. I think of these incredible women like Dolly Parton and Stevie Nicks, who never made that sacrifice for their work. I mean, who knows why they decided not to have children. But I think there’s a part of me that feels like, Well, my artistic work is my child. I know a lot of working-women mothers who are doing an incredible job, but it’s an enormous loss of time and physical ability to bring a child into the world. So looking ahead to the tour: How are you doing it differently this time? We’re not doing six days on anymore, right? It used to be so fun for me. I mean, even when it is difficult, there are times when the adrenaline kicks in and it’s fun. It’s just physically demanding and difficult, but I think that I’ve learned about some boundaries that will make it easier for me to be able to meet those demands. I also went through some growing pains on this last record around becoming a bigger band: not being able to just be a young person drinking and sounding like shit and instead realizing that there’s a certain responsibility that comes with playing larger rooms and charging higher ticket prices. You have to approach it with a certain professionalism. Because, suddenly, I had people in my band who were classically trained, and I felt very inferior and self-conscious around them. I feel like people always talk about impostor syndrome being this really awful challenge that we have to rid ourselves of. Karen Chee actually has a joke about this — about how most people are not really good at things naturally. I feel more comfortable now that I have more time to put in the work than when I had to figure it out on the road at that time.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Lumon has spoken with the shareholders, and Severance is now officially renewed for season three, as confirmed by Apple’s Tim Cook himself on Twitter. At least Ben Stiller didn’t get sent to the break room. “Making Severance has been one of the most creatively exciting experiences I’ve ever been a part of,” Stiller shared in a press release. “While I have no memory of this, I’m told making season three will be equally enjoyable, though any recollection of these future events will be forever and irrevocably wiped from my memory as well.”

Season 3 of Severance is available upon request.

Thankfully, the gap between seasons will be way shorter than three years, as Stiller promised the plan is “definitely not” to wait so long to find out what happened to Mark S and the Macrodata Refinement department. Stiller confirmed to THR last month that a season-three writers’ room is already back to work.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/britt-lower-severance-season-two-interview.html'>Britt Lower Explains ‘Severance’ Season 2, Helly vs. Helena</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 07:00:33 <p>
Spoiler alert: This story contains major character and plot details. Britt Lower faced a nesting doll of an acting challenge in Severance’s second season by portraying disparate characters: Helena Eagan, the cold, calculating heiress to the Lumon corporation, and her defiant Innie, Helly R. You get the sense that Helly — who possesses free will, acerbic wit, and close bonds with her colleagues in macrodata refinement — is someone Helena could have become if she hadn’t been groomed by her father, Jame, to take over the family empire. (“Think of hell,” Lower cracks about the name’s phonetics.) In the combustible finale, directed by Ben Stiller and written by showrunner Dan Erickson, both Mark S. (Adam Scott) and Helly make drastic choices that will inevitably set off further hostilities between the Innies and the Outies: After succeeding in an escape attempt to free his Outie’s captive wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman), Mark S. remains and runs hand-in-hand through the severed floor with his redheaded love. And Helly unionizes another department against Lumon’s severed-worker practice, reminding everyone how they’re all treated like “fucking machines” that can be turned on and off at the will of the company. (“They give us half a life,” she spits, “and think we won’t fight for it.”) “She’s waging a war inside of herself within the same body,” the actor tells me during a recent makeshift art session on a bench at the Pratt Institute Sculpture Park, adding touches of paint and marker to our shared canvas. Were you told Helly’s entire arc before the season? I knew the whole of season two going in. We filmed out of order, as we did with the first, so it was necessary for me to know what was going on from the start. That was a lot of season two, especially with the Outie, like how Helena moving through the world is so dictated by her father. She doesn’t seem to have many females in her life. Did anything genuinely surprise you about Helena’s development this season? I was really moved by getting to see Helly’s perspective through her eyeballs. And then, by contrast, Helena’s scenes with her father are so sterile. I tried to come at both sides of them with empathy for being trapped inside the same company in very different ways. Do you interpret her longing as romantic love, friendship, or any type of general human connection? In the first four episodes, if you’re doing a rewatch, you can see how much she’s enjoying getting to be Helly. So she wasn’t putting up a front? There are so many masks she has to wear. There’s a longing, I think, for something she hasn’t had access to: connection. It was something we had a lot of conversations about. Ben, Dan, the other directors, and I were always trying to decide how obvious it was. Even on set sometimes, the other actors would forget. I, the actor, felt sad for Helly that her friends were being deceived. Then I felt a sense of sorrow for Helena, too, that she’s getting to experience this. It’s like the organic version of reintegration. And Helena has gotten to experience Helly’s “chosen family” within the office world. They still have a lot to learn from one another. We all have those parts of ourselves: the inner child that’s doodling and then the inner critic that’s like, This isn’t art! Just based on Michael Siberry’s incredible performance — the way he moves through space and the way he’s treated by her. And she has to wear a mask in front of the other women employees, too. It’s like a Russian doll of masks. Do you think Helena wants to be CEO? I don’t think she would even be able to answer that. There’s just no choice in a family structure like that. I was recently watching Orlando with Tilda Swinton. I was thinking about that kind of lone, princely figure. Seeing this other version of herself has really rattled her. Helly has her own different version of that toward Helena. But Helly is much more on the journey of This isn’t fucking ethical. Initially, Helly is like, “Get me the hell out of here at all costs.” But then it turned into “Get us out of here.” To her surprise, she realizes this is her family. They have opposing objectives within their little family unit, which is so real. Moving through that together is what makes a family grow, deepen, and help define itself. A big hole that we don’t know about Helena is, as you said, the identity of her mother. I’m going to leave that one a mystery. What else have you filled in for yourself about the character to inform your portrayal? For Helena, it’s these sweeping classical arrangements. I can imagine that’s been the case her whole life. The cool thing about playing Helly in season one is I got to walk around Lumon and be like, “What the fuck are you guys doing? Ms. Cobel and Mr. Milchick, why do you talk like that?” Now, I get to be in the position of someone who walks around and talks like that. Still, you don’t see Helena alone very much, except for that scene when she’s watching the security footage of Mark and Helly. When Helena, pretending to be Helly, sleeps with Mark, she tells him afterward, “I didn’t like who I was on the outside. That was mean of me.” There’s a really tender scene that was cut for, I think, plot purposes between Dylan and who we now understand was Helena on the outdoor retreat. Dylan says, “I don’t like the outside.” It’s a beautiful scene that Zach Cherry is so present in. I know there were quite a bit of rewrites and delays this season. We had a break due to the strikes and came back with a fresh set of scripts for the ending. It’s like a giant puzzle that we’re all building and solving at the same time. But, of course, much like the fans, we as actors have a vivid imagination of what might be happening that’s not seen. Some of those questions are answered by the end. Have Helena’s beliefs about Innies softened a bit? And look, Helly has taken over Helena’s body at the end of season one. The question of autonomy is really at full volume in these episodes — and certainly consent. We dealt with those scenes delicately and had a lot of conversations about what Mark and Helly would be going through. And then, it’s interesting again, after Mark and Helly share that intimacy under the makeshift tent, it’s directly after that when Helena goes to see Mark at the Chinese restaurant. That scene seemed like a test arranged by Helena. They have a kind of chemistry that’s different in each iteration. So far, the only versions of them that haven’t met yet are Outie Mark and Innie Helly. It’s that scene where Helly’s like, “I think we should kill Mark and I should wear his face.” Mark picks up on the joke and bats it back. They’re finding levity in an environment that’s quite intense. It starts by Helly wanting Mark, at least, to survive. That’s his chance of surviving if he gets out and saves Ms. Casey in the process. I don’t know what she’s after except maybe to see him one more time. Do you read Mark and Helly’s stampede more optimistically? The script direction said they were just running. The moment that was important to me that stayed in the edit, which I’m proud of, is Helly seeing Gemma. That moment is really essential for what comes next. The whole scene is a reckoning for all of them. Again, maybe Helly is just coming to look at him one more time. Looking at this other woman who he doesn’t know, making a choice for him. And then he’s weighing, Was my Outie being truthful? Is he going to hold up his end of the bargain? How will this reckoning reflect what we see in the third season? All of the Innies are waking up to their own humanity and free will. Helly’s just like, “Maybe we have more people on our side than we think, and maybe there’s a chance for us down here to figure out something.” It’s almost like the duality of Helena and Helly gives you an ever-expanding terrain. It’s so relatable to be at odds with parts of oneself. I think it’s interesting that in this project, those parts of the same person get to be fully actualized and have this discourse with each other to see what it’s like to walk around in someone else’s shoes. Hopefully, that creates empathy and understanding, particularly for the head of this company that has some questionable things going on. For someone to have inside of her a really strong rebellion, how does that affect the company for the greater good? On a personal level, how does the wilder, fiercer, and freer part of this woman — which she has lost touch with — affect her moving forward? What does she have to learn from that? I don’t know if there’s an answer to that, but there are two separate consciousnesses with a shared body. I wholeheartedly believe Helly has more freedom trapped on the MDR floor as an Innie than Helena does in her life as an Outie. In the world of Lumon, you can’t. There’s a way that things are done. Helly is just the total antithesis of that. She really was the catalyst in season one for waking all of them up. They all start to be like, “Wait, what?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

[Editor’s note: The following review contains spoilers for “Severance” Season 2, Episode 10, “Cold Harbor.” For coverage of earlier episodes, read our previous reviews.] About halfway through his conversation with himself, Mark Scout has had enough. Mark’s Outie (Adam Scott) started the camcorder-assisted back-and-forth with a well-intentioned apology, but really, his opening concession was just the framework for a favor. One man’s “I am so sorry — I created you as a prisoner and as an escape,” is another man’s “I am so sorry you were ever born.” And that other man is Mark’s Innie (also played by Adam Scott, who’s outstanding throughout an emotionally turbulent finale), who knows exactly what his Outie is asking of him. He knew it before they started swapping video messages. “You want me to give my life?,” Mark’s Innie says. Devon (Jen Tullock) is caught off-guard by Mark’s Innie’s interpretation of events and quickly initiates his chat with Mark’s Outie, hoping the man of two minds can sort it out instead. She, like Mark’s Outie, has been focused on saving Gemma (Dichen Lachman) and punishing Lumon. They haven’t thought about Mark’s Innie beyond imagining his nightmarish working conditions, and I doubt even those daydreams paid much heed to the other Innies toiling away beside him. “Look,” his Outie says, shifting tone from sensitive to superior. I hid all of her stuff in my basement because it was easier pretending that she never existed.” He may even realize that hiding from pain by shutting his brain off (chemically, by drinking, and literally via severance) doesn’t work. He still doesn’t see Mark’s Innie as anything more than a rogue part of his own greater being. “Severance” Season 2 ends with a paradoxical wallop, both inevitable and breathtaking. The Marks lead a daring escape through the bowels of Lumon Industries, switching between Innie and Outie on every floor in order to rescue Gemma from her 25(!) torture rooms and return her to the real world. But to us, Mark’s reasoning is painfully clear. Mark’s Innie did the right thing by saving Gemma, an innocent victim. We still don’t know how, exactly, she ended up in Lumon’s sub-basement, nor why Lumon chose to conduct its advanced severance procedures on her, but we do know Gemma was being held against her will. Mark’s Innie recognizes as much and, after a pep talk from Helly, goes through with the plan to free her, despite the risks. What he doesn’t do is free Mark’s Outie. Instead of blindly trusting his above-ground alter ego to do what he promises — “If you help me, I won’t abandon you,” Mark’s Outie says — Mark’s Innie chooses to stay behind. He (rightly) deduces from Mark’s Outie’s struggle to explain how reintegration actually works that he’s better off looking out for himself, at least until more definitive answers can be found. It’s a “head over heart” decision — save for the charming asterisk that Mark’s Innie is following his heart, too. First of all, Season 2’s climactic conclusion isn’t a cliffhanger. It pulls us back from the brink, offering a platform to stand on, even if we’re still waiting near the edge to see what happens next. It asks us consider what we would do in the same situation. People don’t typically respond to reason in the same way they respond to feelings, and “Cold Harbor” evokes a bevy of conflicting feelings. While it’s jarring in the moment to be denied one of our primary couples’ long-sought reunions, Mark’s Innie makes a choice. Reactions will depend on if the viewer is ‘shipping Mark and Gemma or Mark and Helly; they’ll depend on who sees Innies like Mark’s Outie sees them (as a part of Mark) and who sees them like Innies do (as distinct people); they’ll depend on how satisfied theorists are with the answers provided about Cold Harbor, the mysterious numbers, and Lumon’s overall mission. Heck, some viewers will certainly be disappointed that Harmony (Patricia Arquette) didn’t get more to do than deliver exposition (though she is the perfect person to break the big news, considering she invented severance and her creepy yet authoritative stature). Others will be anguishing over Irving (John Turturro) and Burt (Christopher Walken), whose respective and collective fates weren’t addressed at all. Plenty more will simply be bummed their predictions didn’t pan out. In the first episode, Mark saves his fellow Innies and then they choose to stay at Lumon. There’s the twist with Helena pretending to be Helly, which calls attention to how polar opposite people can exist in the same body; there’s the disconnect between Dylan’s Innie (a “self-assured badass”) and his Outie (who we find out is kind of a loser); there’s a similar disconnect between Burt’s severed selves, with his Outie seeking redemption for his seedy life through his Innie’s newborn innocence. Even splitting the first two episodes between Innies and Outies works to illustrate not only that these people are living in separate worlds, but that they’re both alive. One can’t be written off to benefit the other, just like all those hours we spend toiling away at work can’t simply be written off like they didn’t impact (or even dictate) our lives. Lumon’s goal, whether through the severance procedure or cult-like devotion, is compliance. What Lumon does to Gemma reveals the vile vision for extending that goal: For a time, Lumon was satisfied with exploiting half of each worker. But if they can sever each employee 25 times, how will those people ever know it’s time to go home? What’s to stop them from moving from one room to the next, working on different projects, for an endless amount of time? And that’s without considering what it means that they kidnapped Gemma and, until now, got away with it? What’s to stop them from doing that on a wide scale? Or what’s to stop them from breeding workers who never see the light of day and never think to ask? These aren’t new questions, necessarily, but “Cold Harbor” offers a resounding rebuttal to anyone who thinks shutting Lumon down fixes all the problems the company has created, and it does so by forcing Mark’s Innie and Outie to acknowledge one another. His comments are echoed later on, when Helly is rallying the Choreography and Merriment marching band. “They’re going to turn us off like fucking machines,” Helly shouts. “They give us half a life and think we won’t fight for it?” • From her opening slight to Jame Eagan (Michael Siberry) — “You’re so fucking weird” — to her Norma Rae moment with the marching band and running off with Mark S. to end the season, Helly had a helluva day. • That said, I don’t know what to make of Jame’s preference for Helly over Helena. • Speaking of who Jame’s acknowledged, his comment about “siring others in the shadows” helps explain how Harmony got Mark and Devon into the birthing suite. Are they severed, as their dear ol’ dad seems to prefer, and… (ick) how many times? But his reappearance also reminds us that Irving is still gone — will he be the new wild card in Season 3? Emerging from expulsion to save the day, much like Harmony did in Season 2? • Playing the Michael Jordan-era Chicago Bulls’ intro music to kick off Lumon’s historic celebration for completing Cold Harbor is… too perfect. You won’t be missed, but here’s hoping we see plenty more of Darri Ólafsson, the actor who gave him such brutish, calculating menace. If you want to see his range, flip over to HBO’s “Somebody Somewhere,” where he plays the exact opposite character. • God, I hope Milchick defects to the rebels in Season 3. He’s too damn cool to be a bad guy, as much as I enjoy watching him wrestle with his personal pride and his loyalty to Lumon. Bring that vending machine toppling muscle over to Team MDR.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For more on Severance, sign up for Severance Club, our subscriber-exclusive newsletter obsessing over, dissecting, and debating everything about season two. Spoilers ahead for Severance season two through the finale, “Cold Harbor.” Severance never states what year it’s taking place. In fact, it deliberately obscures the matter by mashing up televisions, cars, and phones of past technological eras with a futuristic procedure that can separate a person’s home and work life. “But occasionally you have to say, okay, here’s a reference point in this world,” says director and executive producer Ben Stiller. “And, for me, I just wanted to use a Stone Roses song because I thought the lyrics were interesting.” “Love Spreads,” from 1994, may be a personal reference point for Stiller and Harmony Cobel alike, but it still won’t clue you in to the show’s time period — nor will the rest of the second season’s playfully reverent needle drops, which defy both genre and decade. A random sampling includes the Alan Parsons Project, Billie Holiday, and Canadian legend Gordon Lightfoot, choices mostly sourced from the Spotify playlist Stiller constantly updates with songs that he feels are Severance-worthy. He wants to stress, though, that this decision-making is a bit more arbitrary than what viewers may expect. “Especially in a show like this, because our score is such an incredibly important element to the tone. The depth of investigation to which people analyze it is something I never could have imagined. So I never want to say, Oh, something is or isn’t here for a specific reason. It’s fun to let people have their ideas and thoughts.” Sometimes, these decisions were determined by Stiller’s love of a particular artist. Others came from simply hearing a cool tune on the radio, adding it to the playlist, and seeing if an opportunity arose to utilize it later. With Severance’s explosive season-two finale now released, Stiller went into further detail about how he landed on six key songs, crescendoing to a velvet fog with the final moment of Mark S. and Helly R. (Adam Scott and Britt Lower) running hand in hand through the Lumon hallways. “It’s always just what feels right.” And this time, Mel Tormé was the perfect fit. Our four Lumon pals are reunited at their cubicles and get back to work after the tumultuous events of the season-one finale. Our music supervisor, George Drakoulis, and I go back a million years. He was like, Oh yeah, I’ll call the Metallica guys and see if we can get a deal. If I’m reaching out for an idea about something, he’ll send me incredible playlists. Episode one was weird because we’re trying to reset and restart but also follow up on the end of this big cliffhanger from the previous season. We had this idea for a circular dolly shot around the group where we see them reconnect with one another and get back into their work groove. This Allergies song came up on my Spotify feed, I’m not sure how, but I heard it and really liked it. The song also featured prominently in a season-two trailer. I grew up in the ’70s and ’80s and remember this was one of the Who’s biggest hits after Keith Moon died. It has that thing where it builds up and then kicks in, which was exactly like the sequence we were trying. There’s a list of songs that I would keep trying for certain moments. If I’m in my car and listening to a song and like it, I’ll add it to a playlist for “end song for episode three.” Because she has all the electronic equipment and reintegration stuff, it started to feather into that drum hit and fill, which has such a kick of energy. At first, I was like, Oh, it’s going to be in the show, too. But then I realized, well, why not use it? Sometimes, it can take months of thinking about it or trying things out, and then all of a sudden the right song clicks in. In one of the drafts of the seventh episode, there was a reference to this song that Dr. Mauer makes, but we cut it. The idea was this was going to be a signature and eerie tune that we hear for Dr. Mauer, and we played into that. Everything else beyond that, I’ll let people theorize. Irving leaves Burt’s home after a somewhat uncomfortable dinner with his husband, Fields. Burt watches, with a hardened expression, as Irving walks to his car. It was never going to be the Cream version. When you take a deeper look at it, this is an episode about relationships and love. That would have called for a different ending song. But when we looked at it in the edit room, we thought it was more interesting to end on Burt. You know on some level that Mark is going through something, but it would be crazy if Mark — with all the tension of what’s going to happen — actually died in that moment. As an audience, that would be a huge thing. Because next time we see Burt, that’s going to play into it. “Sunshine of Your Love” isn’t really romantic. I was like, Oh my God, this is crazy. It felt like this could thematically be a perfect dark yet romantic cue for the end. Devon calls Harmony and tells her that Mark has been reintegrated. Harmony previously listened to “Love Spreads” by the Stone Roses in episode three, showing a rare bit of insight into the character’s personality. The big discussion was figuring out how to kick us off into where we’re going for the next episode. Cobel has got a lot inside of her and we felt it — it really was like she’s a “fire woman” after what she just experienced with Sissy. After a brief internal battle, he chooses not to follow Gemma out but instead stays inside with Helly R. They run through the hallways holding hands, and a freeze-frame of the couple ends the season. This was obviously the biggest music cue for the show, where it’s like, What are you going to go out on? But in this hellish prison of these hallways, where are they going to? It was interesting and kind of unexpected, but you don’t want to be too cute. “As Tears Go By” by Nancy Sinatra was also a strong contender, but it didn’t make as much thematic sense. “The Windmills of Your Mind” is weird both with its lyrics and sound. Because, really, that’s what this whole show is about. Teddy was like, “Oh, by the way, I hope you keep that Mel Tormé song.” And I was like, “Yeah, it’s kind of great.” Then we found “Work Song” by Bobby Darin for the end titles.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/severance-finale-season-2-cold-habor-ending-questions-s3-theories.html'>Is That What You Expected? And Other Severance Questions</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 03:00:17 <p>
For more on Severance, sign up for Severance Club, our subscriber-exclusive newsletter obsessing over, dissecting, and debating everything about season two. “Seven Severance Questions” is a weekly attempt to digest the events of one of television’s twistiest shows by highlighting the weirdest, most confusing, and most important unresolved issues after this week’s season-two finale, “Cold Harbor.” There will be theories. Want to know how Mark’s innie and outie handle the Helly-Gemma situation? Want to know what Cold Harbor was all about? They can also make you shout a little. This show can twist you into a pretzel. Below, please find our final round of questions about this season. But these feel like a good place to start … Are you rooting for the outies to find the happiness that was so elusive to them that they sought refuge through brain surgery that could segment off an entire chunk of their life? Are you rooting for the innies to experience something like a full life instead of just being drones created in a fit of hopeless desperation? Those are the things we all were trying to process as Mark’s innie was standing in that hallway between Gemma and Helly. It’s kind of what he was processing too. You can see why he made the choice he did, even beyond the selfish reasons, even beyond “I love the redhead and don’t even really know that other woman.” There are issues of trust at play here that were planted at the beginning of the episode, when Mark’s innie and outie were having that conversation via camcorder that went sideways almost immediately. Mark’s innie did not appreciate how dismissive his outie was of the life the innies built inside Lumon. He got very prickly when his outie mispronounced Helly’s name as “Heleny” in a tone that scanned as Aw, it’s cute you think you have a little girlfriend, buddy. He didn’t particularly love how his outie just kind of expected him to be onboard with this plan that would essentially kill his friends and rest his own existence on a promise from the guy who put him there in the first place. Mark’s innie has been through a lot. I’m not sure Cobel’s being there helped a lot. There’s also the issue of … I mean, why would his innie think his outie deserves any of this? His outie is a depressed mess with no friends who has now subjected their body to two experimental brain procedures in the hope of digging out of a rut. Yes, getting Gemma back might solve some of that, but Mark’s innie has no real knowledge of what their life was like before. All he knows is that he has friends and a purpose and is in love, and this guy who has gone years without any of that is asking him to give it all up for something uncertain at best. Mark’s and Helly’s innies got their Butch & Sundance moment, running down the hallways as the alarm blared, ending on a freeze-frame that, if we didn’t know better, would read as a finale-finale and not just the final moments of this season. If Mark’s innie leaves the severed floor even for a second, his outie is never going back. Drummond is dead in a large Icelandic lump outside the elevator. (If you know anyone who went to law school, please do not ask them whether Mark’s innie or outie is responsible for the murder. The Cold Harbor project was working until it didn’t. It’s messy on the severed floor in a number of ways. Jame just straight-up admitted he likes Helly R. more than his own daughter, Helena. We could be looking at a world where he tries to keep her severed full time, which would in theory save the severed floor, corpses and all, and could keep Mark’s innie down there too. The only guarantee is that things are going to get weird. Lumon will have to somehow keep all or most of it quiet. My theory earlier in the season was that it was after some sort of immortality hack, a way to sever memories and move them from vessel to vessel in perpetuity. I thought this for a bunch of reasons, some having to do with Miss Huang (clones???? ), and some with the thing where rich weirdos always seem to be after immortality (Jame Eagan is nothing if not a rich weirdo). But then we learned Miss Huang was just a regular kid who had been part of Lumon’s long-standing tradition of child labor. And then we learned the goats are just being raised as sacrifices to be buried with dead test subjects and guide their souls to the afterlife. Then we heard about Kier’s “eternal war against pain” and saw that Gemma’s final test in Cold Harbor involved taking apart the same baby crib from back when she and Mark were struggling to conceive. And then I remembered that the only thing rich weirdos love as much as immortality is the idea of a technology-assisted utopia. That’s why I think Mark and Gemma were so important to the project: This was a couple experiencing pain. If Lumon could separate them and sever the parts of their brain that remember that pain, they could — their theory here, not mine — be on the path to ending suffering. Mark saw Ms. Casey without triggering his Gemma trauma. Gemma was run through a series of stressful situations, culminating in one that would be downright cruel if it didn’t work, to see if they could sever the memories out individually. All of that could be pointing toward a world in which everyone gets a chip placed in their head at birth, and you go to the doctor every time you experience something unpleasant, and the doctor punches a few buttons and bloops the bad vibes out of existence forever — a society of pleasant zombies who feel nothing and never have to learn lessons. Cold Harbor didn’t pass the ultimate test, though, which turns out to be “your blood-soaked husband rushes into the room and tells you to come with him.” Gotta refine a lot more macrodata to account for that one. It’s not necessarily back to square one on the whole plan now, but it’s probably back to a single-digit square somewhere. — I did not foresee a scenario in which Dylan’s outie denied the resignation request. But it’s kind of sweet, in a way, that his loser outie is taking all of this as a wake-up call and motivation to become a better man. — This entire piece could easily have been questions about the marching band. Did their innies have to be trained from the start because they came in with no knowledge of music? Do you think one of them is a drummer on the outside but when he got down there they needed someone on the trumpet so he had to switch? You can see how this quickly spins out of hand. It is my hope that next season begins with Dylan covered in war paint and the band marching behind him with its brass instruments sharpened into pointy weapons. You cannot take this away from me. I thought he was going to take Lumon down after a season of slights and long hours and the company taking him for granted. I really thought we were headed there after his little zinger about Kier’s height. Maybe that’s how he works out his frustration. Maybe it’s in his contract: “Must let Seth dance once a month.” It does seem to make him happy. I was sad when Miss Huang got shipped off last week. She had just been humanized, and I was starting to like her, and I wanted to see her get to play her theremin a little bit more. After all of this, though, after the murder and the blaring alarms and the uprooting of everything she was working on, I’m glad she got out when she did. Miss Huang did not need to be part of this. And I did not need to spend the whole episode worrying about the safety of a child I just got attached to. It would have been very stressful for both of us.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Donald Trump may not leave the White House at the end of his term -- so says Steve Bannon -- and it triggered a fairly furious argument on our "2 Angry Men" podcast.

Harvey got into it with former Utah congressman and current FOX news contributor Jason Chaffetz and cohost Mark Geragos over Bannon's comments on NewsNation, telling Chris Cuomo that Trump will run again in 2028 and win, despite the 22nd Amendment, which limits him to 2 terms. Cuomo pressed Bannon on how that could happen ... but Bannon was evasive.

Harvey dismissed repealing the 22nd Amendment, which would take a 2/3 vote in Congress ratified by 3/4 of the states. He theorizes Trump might declare martial law, suspend the election, and say for the good of the country, he's staying.

This got Chaffetz going, who called it a "wild hypothetical," and then went after the various judges who he says are trying to dismantle Trump's agenda. And that started a whole other argument.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Christina Ricci is putting her home on the market ... and it's all because of a family member who lost their home in the Los Angeles wildfires.

Real estate sources tell TMZ ... the actress is listing her Silver Lake estate Saturday for $4,175,000.

We're told Christina is saying goodbye to her place because she has a family member who was displaced in the January fires and she needs to find a new home where they can all live comfortably.

Christina's Silver Lake pad is 3,396 square feet with 3 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms ... so it sounds like she could use some more space to accommodate her new roomies.

The estate sits above the Silver Lake Reservoir and offers breathtaking views of Downtown L.A. and the mountains ... thanks to floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors opening up to a private deck and rooftop terrace.

Christina's pad has all the bells and whistles ... including a pool and spa overlooking the city. The primary suite is decked out with a fireplace, walk-in closet and a spa-inspired bath.

Smith said he was "very impressed" with Bronny's contribution in the Lakers' loss to the Bucks ... as he looked like someone who belonged.

"I might've been wrong," Smith said. "Are you listening, LeBron James? Are you listening James family? Are you listening Rich Paul? Are you listening, all you people?"

Smith understands it's going to take a lot more than one game to determine his true value in the Association ... but if he strings together more games like Thursday, his timeline will be sped up in his opinion.

As for his face-to-face feud with King James, Smith said yet again he wasn't being disrespectful with his commentary on Bronny's career ... calling it a "lie" to say he didn't have a future in the league.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Justin Baldoni's PR rep Jennifer Abel is firing back at her former boss, Stephanie Jones, with her own lawsuit ... after being sued by SJ in December. Abel has hired Baldoni's powerhouse lawyer Bryan Freedman, who accuses Stephanie of triggering the whole legal drama between Justin and Blake Lively involving their film, "It Ends with Us." In a statement, Freedman tells TMZ ... "It is undeniable that Stephanie Jones initiated this catastrophic sequence of events by violating the most basic of privacy rights, as well as any remaining trust her clients held." Leslie, of course, is Blake's PR rep, who has also been sued by Baldoni. Freedman goes on to say Lively "walked right into Ms. Jones’ ploy of bitter revenge against her most-trusted employee at the expense of her own long-term client." The attorney ended with ... "We will not stop until our clients are cleared of all wrongdoing and compensated for the vast damages that they have incurred." As you know ... Baldoni has filed a few major lawsuits in recent months -- including the massive $400 million lawsuit he and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, filed against Blake, Ryan Reynolds and Leslie Sloane. Lively filed suit first against Baldoni in December, claiming he sexually harassed her on the movie set and later embarked on a targeted smear campaign against her in the media. Kristin Tahler, partner at Quinn Emmanuel, who's representing Jones, tells TMZ ... “Ms. These facts are backed up by dozens of messages provided in the suit we filed month ago and cannot be credibly disputed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Former Dodgers star Julio Urias has just been suspended for roughly half the 2025 season ... after the MLB announced the pitcher violated its domestic violence policy.

"The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball has completed its investigation into allegations that free agent pitcher Julio Urías violated Major League Baseball’s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy," the commish said in a statement.

"Having reviewed all of the available evidence, I have concluded that Mr. Urías violated our Policy and that discipline is appropriate."

Urias -- who sat out all of the 2024 season -- will be allowed to be reinstated from the restricted list on July 17, Manfred said.

Urias was ultimately hit with five misdemeanor charges stemming from the September 2023 incident with his wife. He went on to plead no contest to one count of misdemeanor domestic battery in May 2024 ... and the other four charges he was facing were dropped.

A rapper with former ties to Big U is happy the Rollin' 60s Neighborhood Crips leader has been locked up on murder and conspiracy charges ... and wants him put UNDER the jail ... she's claiming to be one of his victims!!!

TMZ Hip Hop recently ran into SKG, a former Death Row artist -- whose name stands for "Suge Knight Girl" -- out this week and she's packing a lot of opinions regarding the Big U RICO charges.

SKG tells us Big U was a literal monster to her and the Crenshaw community for years, by allegedly using brute force to extort local businesses.

She also claims Big U beat her in the presence of Nipsey Hussle while she was pregnant!!!

She's been telling the story for years ... Nipsey and his late friend Stephen Jiles "Fatts" Donelson allegedly set her up to be ambushed and beaten by Big U after he was embarrassed by the way he was presented during a meeting with L.A. radio station KDAY.

SKG says she has no sympathy for Big U, but her heart yearns for the family of Rayshawn Williams, the 21-year-old aspiring rapper who federal agents allege Big U murdered in Las Vegas back in 2021.

SKG spoke to Williamson's family and even got backed up by Wack 100 -- another one of Big U's archenemies -- but tells us she feels safer since he's been arrested.

And despite her rocky past with the late Nipsey, SKG wants everyone to be on the lookout for Big U to be implicated in the rap legend's murder.

Big U turned himself in on Tuesday while denying all the internet gossip allegations against his character.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Owen Hayes, the college baseball player who cops say beat the crap out of an 84-year-old man at a California bar, is no longer enrolled at his university.

Hayes was playing baseball at The Master's University in Santa Clarita, CA up until this week, when he surrendered to authorities at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station and was booked on a charge of felony assault.

In a statement to TMZ, the school says ... "The individual in question no longer attends The Master's University. The University takes all violations of its standards and biblical convictions seriously."

TMU is a private, non-denominational Christian school and the University adds ... "When violations occur, we follow established procedures to ensure appropriate action is decisively taken. We are thankful that such behavior is exceedingly rare among our students, who come to TMU because they desire to honor the Lord."

Hayes is obviously no longer playing college baseball for TMU after leaving the school and his player profile from the TMU baseball online roster has been removed.

As we reported ... video from inside a Santa Clarita dive bar Doc's Inn, shows a man -- who cops say is Hayes -- rushing up behind a geriatric customer and knocking him to the floor with a punch.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Anna Wintour's Met Gala guest list just took a hit -- Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds won’t be gracing the red carpet this year, TMZ has learned.

A source close to the couple tells TMZ ... Blake and Ryan are skipping the gala this year -- but before you jump to conclusions, it’s got nothing to do with their legal war against Justin Baldoni, 'cause the decision to pass on the May event was made way before that drama unfolded.

Blake has become iconic over the years when it comes to the Met Gala, with her themed red carpet looks always making a huge impact -- but she and Ryan don’t always show up, and they actually skipped last year, too!

Still, when it’s Met Gala season -- the event is scheduled for May 5 -- you can usually count on them being there more often than not.

If they were to show up this year, Blake and Ryan would definitely steal the spotlight ... just like they did at their latest public appearance at Feb's "SNL 50." Their appearance had everyone buzzing -- some loved how they laughed off the JB drama, but the display also had critics bashing the moment.
