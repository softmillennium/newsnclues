                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) found that certain lipids, or fats, in obesity-causing foods also cause asthma-like lung inflammation. The findings suggest that in addition to modifying dietary choices, certain existing drugs could be repurposed to help treat this type of asthma. The study was prompted by researchers noticing an association between childhood obesity and neutrophilic asthma, a non-allergic type of asthma triggered by microbial and bacterial proteins. To study this in more detail, researchers focused on lung macrophages, which are specialized white blood cells that coordinate immune function during inflammation. While metabolic stress can alter macrophage function, the effects of specific dietary components were unclear. However, we were observing neutrophilic asthma in children who weren't obese, which is why we suspected there might be another mechanism. What we found in both preclinical work and studies in children was that diets containing certain saturated long chain fatty acids can cause neutrophilic asthma independent from obesity." David A. Hill, MD, PhD, senior study author, attending physician, Division of Allergy and Immunology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia The researchers first explored a high fat diet in a preclinical animal model, where they found that lung macrophages accumulated a saturated long chain fatty acid called stearic acid, which is often found in animal fat and processed foods. Notably, dietary stearic acid worsened airway inflammation without causing obesity. The researchers also found that blocking the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β or inhibiting the protein IRE1⍺ – both of which are found in increased levels in neutrophilic asthma – protected against stearic acid-driven lung inflammation. "While there are many risk factors and triggers that are associated with asthma, this study provides evidence about how specific dietary components are linked to a particularly difficult-to-treat form of asthma. These findings are encouraging because they provide new treatment strategies and suggest that targeted dietary modifications may help prevent this asthma type." McCright, S. J., et al. (2025) Dietary saturated fatty acids promote lung myeloid cell inflammasome activation and IL-1β-mediated inflammation in mice and humans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elder abuse is any action — or lack of appropriate action — occurring in a relationship where there is an expectation of trust that causes harm or distress to an older person, according to the World Health Organization. One sixth of community-dwelling older adults are affected by elder abuse, with rates climbing in the United States and globally. The ramifications are alarming, says Ecler Jaqua, MD, MBA, associate professor, family and geriatric medicine and medical director, San Antonio Regional Hospital Center of Aging, Rancho Cucamonga, California. “This is unfortunate because we're the main ‘point people,' often the first or only professionals, in a position to detect and maybe intervene,” Jaqua told Medscape Medical News. Other risk factors include difficult family dynamics, diminished community support, challenging behaviors (resisting care, aggression, or agitation), mental illness, substance abuse, lower income, frailty, trauma, or past abuse. Older women, minorities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender individuals are also at higher risk. Among community-dwelling older adults, the most common perpetrators of elder abuse are family members. “Having a high index of suspicion is very helpful,” Amy Shaw, MD, a geriatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, told Medscape Medical News. Begin with observing potential red flags in the patient-caregiver interaction, Shaw and Rosen advised. Rosen recommended looking for unexplained bruises not found over bony prominences, burns, fractures, infected areas of open wounds, soiled diapers, long fingernails or toenails with dirt underneath, poor hygiene, and signs of malnutrition. Concerning findings suggesting sexual abuse include difficulty walking/sitting, genital pain/itching, vaginal/anal bleeding, and damaged/bloody underclothing. Dehydration, failure to thrive, unexplained weight loss, and repeated falls may signal neglect. But remember, certain conditions can mimic neglect or abuse in elders. For example, poor wound healing can be associated with diabetes. The US Preventive Services Task Force doesn't recommend routine screening of all older adults for elder abuse. Nevertheless, Jaqua screens her older patients because elder abuse is so common. It's certainly important to screen if you suspect elder abuse. Jaqua starts with open-ended questions such as, “Has anyone ever hurt or threatened you? Although several tools are available, Jaqua uses the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI), validated for family physicians in an ambulatory setting in older adults with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of ≥23. “Explain to patients why you're asking these questions,” Shaw advised. “You can say, ‘Some older adults are mistreated, so we ask these questions routinely. '” A positive screen doesn't definitively confirm elder abuse but suggests follow-up is indicated. Some patients may not want to disclose elder abuse, Jaqua noted. They may not want to get their caregiver in trouble — especially a family member like a spouse, child, or grandchild.” Reassure the patient you're interested in their safety and want them to be able to live with dignity, “and there are people (such as social workers) who can help make that happen.” Concerns should be thoroughly documented, including the history, complete physical exam, and results of any screening tests. In some cases, it may be necessary to call not only APS but also law enforcement.” “While CPS [Child Protective Services] must step in immediately after a report, APS typically has 72 hours to initiate an investigation. That's why law enforcement might need to be involved, especially in life-threatening situations.” Physicians treating older patients outside a hospital or health system should develop a relationship with geriatric social workers and case managers in the community. Rosen recommended findhelp.org, which offers a guide to community-based resources. “Even rural communities may have more resources than you realize.” Information about reporting elder abuse can be found at these websites:. Physicians can play an important role in detecting financial abuse. According to the FBI, older individuals seem “disproportionately” affected by fraud, including cryptocurrency and tech support scams. Victims may be unwilling to disclose exploitation because of embarrassment, so use a nonjudgmental tone, Jaqua advised. Rosen advised recommending organizations that provide information and support for caregivers. “You'll need to rely more heavily on your own observations, physical exam, interactions with the caregiver, and other clues not provided verbally by the patient.” It's challenging when a patient with dementia describes being abused by a caregiver but no evidence corroborates that abuse and you don't see concerning behaviors on the caregiver's part, Jaqua noted. The time available during a primary care appointment is compressed, with many other issues to address. For example, members of the team might help the patient qualify for Medicaid, involve non-abusive family members, and increase homecare hours, which might help with neglect. Rosen receives funding from the National Institutes of Health. She is a regular contributor to numerous medical publications, including Medscape and WebMD, and is the author of several consumer-oriented health books as well as Behind the Burqa: Our Life in Afghanistan and How We Escaped to Freedom (a memoir of two brave Afghan sisters).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Positive topline results from two phase 3 trials reported this week may expand the treatment landscape for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG), a rare autoimmune disease marked by debilitating muscle weakness. Monotherapy with the investigational drug cemdisiran for acetylcholine receptor (AChR)-antibody-positive gMG met the primary and key secondary endpoints in the phase 3 NIMBLE study, including a 2.3-point placebo-adjusted improvement in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score, manufacturer Regeneron announced. Meanwhile, argenx reported positive topline results from its phase 3 ADAPT SERON study of efgartigimod (Vyvgart) in patients with AChR-antibody-negative gMG, a group that represents about 20% of the population and has historically lacked effective treatments. The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in MG-ADL total scores compared to placebo. Cemdisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that reduces circulating levels of complement factor 5 (C5), was evaluated in adults with symptomatic AChR-antibody-positive gMG, the most common form of gMG. In the NIMBLE trial, 190 patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous administrations of cemdisiran (600 mg) every 12 weeks; cemdisiran (200 mg) with the C5 antibody pozelimab (200 mg) every 4 weeks; or placebo every 4 weeks. Standard-of-care immunosuppressants were allowed, based on the investigator's discretion. The corresponding percentage of patients achieving at least a 5-point improvement on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score — a physician-administered assessment evaluating vision, speaking/swallowing, breathing, and limb function — was 48%, 36%, and 19%, respectively. The most common TEAEs (≥ 5% of patients) were worsening of MG, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, headache, rash, injection-site reaction, diarrhea, arthralgia, extremity pain, cough, and pruritus. During an extension period, one death due to pneumonia occurred in the cemdisiran group, and one death due to septic shock occurred in the combination group; both deaths occurred in patients who were on concomitant immunosuppressive therapies. There were no meningococcal infections in any patient and no treatment discontinuations due to adverse events through 24 weeks in the cemdisiran monotherapy group. Detailed results from the NIMBLE trial will be reported at an upcoming medical meeting. The trial included 119 patients with AChR-antibody-negative gMG and had two parts. In the first part, patients received four once-weekly infusions of efgartigimod IV or placebo, followed by a 5-week follow-up and primary analysis. The second part of the study was an open-label extension in which patients received two fixed cycles of four once-weekly efgartigimod infusions (4-week interval between cycles). The study met its primary endpoint (P =.0068), with patients treated with efgartigimod achieving a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in MG-ADL total score compared to placebo. Safety findings were consistent with the established profile of the drug, argenx reported, including increased risk for infection, most commonly urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. “The results of the ADAPT SERON study, the largest study to date of AChR-Ab seronegative gMG, confirm that Vyvgart now has the potential to be a targeted, effective, safe, and necessary treatment for patients living with gMG, regardless of autoantibody status,” James F. Howard Jr., MD, Department of Neurology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and principal investigator for the ADAPT SERON trial, said in a statement. Detailed results from the ADAPT SERON study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. The FDA first approved efgartigimod for adults with anti-AChR antibody positive gMG in 2021.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the great challenges faced by families coping with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia is learning how to communicate effectively with the person impacted by the disease while also upholding their personhood, or sense of personal value. A new study from UConn researcher Amanda Cooper – published in time for World Alzheimer's Month in September and World Alzheimer's Day on Sept. 21 - offers concrete recommendations on what to do and what not to do to support personhood for a family member living with dementia. These recommendations can help families maintain meaningful connections with a parent or grandparent living with dementia and support a positive sense of self and quality of life for people living with dementia." Amanda Cooper, assistant professor of interpersonal communication at UConn First, she says, remind the person of who they are and who they were earlier in their life by reminiscing with them, telling them stories of their past, and pointing out their positive traits. "Pay attention to how they respond and adjust your approach as needed," she advises. Second, cultivate relational connection by saying "I love you," giving a hug or a kiss, making the person laugh, expressing gratitude for their role in your life, or reminiscing about moments you shared in the past, she adds. If they cannot remember moments from the past, do not test their memory by continually asking them to remember. "Supporting personhood requires adjusting your communication to the person's current capabilities," she says. This latest study, "Finding the Communication Sweet Spot: Strategies Promoting Personhood in Conversations Between Individuals with Dementia and Their Family Members," was published in the Journal of Family Communication in July. She and her team used data from StoryCorps, a nonprofit that shares stories and conversations of everyday people to analyze conversations between people with dementia and their family members to isolate successful strategies employed to promote personhood in family members with dementia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A nationwide genomic study shows that while Salmonella Dublin looks genetically uniform, it hides powerful resistance traits that threaten cattle, people, and the food supply alike. The foodborne pathogen Salmonella Dublin shows increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A recent paper published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology explored biosurveillance data for S. Dublin to understand how it changes in various human and non-human hosts. S. Dublin is a zoonotic microbe that has adapted well to cattle. Its scientific name is Salmonella enterica subsp. It is the most common strain obtained from clinical cattle case submissions, and the second-most common from non-clinical cattle submissions, rather than all clinical infections. S. Dublin contaminates other cattle or humans primarily via the feco-oral route but can also be carried through saliva or milk. Infected calves become severely ill. A high proportion develop septicemia and respiratory disease, leading to death. Survivors may become healthy carriers and shed the microbe at intervals later in life. Mature cattle develop gastroenteritis following infection, decreasing lactational milk production. Their calves are more likely to be infected and develop septicemia. Thus, S. Dublin has a documented impact on dairy and beef production. Raw milk, soft cheeses, and contaminated beef are the primary sources of foodborne S. Dublin outbreaks and contact with infected cattle. It forms an occupational hazard for veterinarians and cattle workers. The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) monitors AMR in this and other pathogens known to infect humans across the USA, especially using whole-genome sequence (WGS) techniques. This has produced a large amount of publicly available data, which has provided insights into the prevalence or rise of AMR by species, regions, or time periods, singly or in combination. The current study focused on S. Dublin AMR and virulence using public genomic data within the One Health framework. The study included data on 2,150 strains of S. Dublin collected from various parts of the USA between 2002 and 2023. They assessed phylogenetic relationships using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences to compare the genomes. Bovine, human, and environmental samples displayed distinctive features, displaying variations in the AMR potential and the genomic constitution. There were 116 genes that determined various aspects of bacterial virulence. Most of these genes (99) were present in 99% or more strains. Two genes were common to almost all strains. Interestingly, unlike the global picture, S. Dublin shows a higher AMR potential in the USA, especially in bovine samples collected from clinically infected cattle. S. Dublin strains from overtly infected cattle had the highest prevalence of AMR genes specific to various drugs. This includes resistance to a critical cephalosporin class used to treat invasive and severe diseases in children and calves. Quinolone resistance was most prevalent in environmental strains, likely linked to food supply chain contamination and indirect selective pressures, but not directly attributed to adult human drug use. Strains from infected cattle also had the highest levels of multidrug resistance plasmid IncA/C2, and the most significant diversity of genes. Moreover, plasmid acquisition mandates exposure to diverse plasmid-harboring environments and microbial communities. Thus, a less diverse environmental exposure could explain these differences between bovine and other sources. This is supported by environmental sources having a higher proportion of core genes and fewer accessory (shell and cloud) genes than clinical strains. Environmental, human, and bovine strains had distinctive features, such as a high proportion of core genes for the environmental vs the least proportion for the bovine strains. The reverse was true of cloud and shell genes. Most functional genes were shared across all strains, irrespective of the source. This suggests that clinical disease-causing strains are more adaptable. Conversely, less adaptable environmental strains from apparently healthy cattle may more easily contaminate post-harvest food supply chains. This could indicate adequate S. Dublin adaptation to cause invasive human disease after non-human transmission. Alternatively, they could represent the strains more likely to cause symptomatic illness, as others may have escaped recognition. Surprisingly, 72% of the strains closely resembled one or more other strains with less than 20 SNP differences, irrespective of the source, period, or geographic location. Thus, the microbe shows high cross-reservoir genomic similarity, but the study does not establish direct transmission directionally between humans, cattle, and environmental reservoirs. This “underscores the importance of considering strain source when assessing and monitoring antimicrobial resistance.” The study also highlights the need to improve publicly available databases for better phylogenetic and functional analysis. “Our analyses of Salmonella Dublin reveal a striking degree of genomic similarity among strains circulating in U.S. cattle, human, and environmental reservoirs. However, this apparent homogeneity masks differences in genomic stability and antimicrobial resistance elements, highlighting distinct evolutionary trajectories within each reservoir.” Antimicrobial stewardship policies must be uniformly applied to human and animal health practices. Ensuring food safety and biosecurity remains an important field of public health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite their low cost and health benefits, pulses remain under-consumed in the U.S., but new data reveal who eats them, why they are essential for health, and how small changes could close the gap with national dietary goals. Study: Pulse consumption trends in the US in the context of 2025–30 Dietary Guidelines for Americans: analyses of NHANES data for 1999–2018. The 2025–30 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee has recommended listing pulses before meat, poultry, and eggs in the Protein Food Group as a potential protein source. However, a recent study published in Frontiers in Nutrition indicates that, except for Mexican Americans, overall pulse intake is low in the United States and that sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics significantly influence pulse intake trends. Pulses, including beans, lentils, chickpeas, and dried peas, are good sources of plant proteins, dietary fibers, and micronutrients. To promote plant-based diets in the United States, the 2025–30 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee has recommended moving pulses from the Vegetable Food Group to the Protein Food Group and placing them above meat, eggs, and poultry as potentially healthier plant protein sources. An accurate analysis of existing pulse intake patterns in the United States is essential in determining public acceptance and adherence to the current dietary guidelines. Previous studies have estimated population-level pulse intake using short-term data and reported significant variations by education and ethnicity. The study analyzed dietary intake data collected from 10 cycles (approximately 5000 participants per cycle) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The participants were stratified by sex, age, income-to-poverty ratio (IPR), education, and ethnicity. Pulses were separated into beans, chickpeas, peas, and lentils. The dietary analysis over 20 years revealed that only 17% of the study participants consumed pulses on a given day. The highest prevalence of pulse intake was observed among Mexican Americans, and the lowest was observed among non-Hispanic Black adults, with non-Hispanic White adults also low. The most commonly consumed pulses were beans, followed by lentils and chickpeas. The intake of chickpeas has increased significantly since 1999. However, the increase in lentils was not statistically significant. In contrast to beans, intakes of both lentils and chickpeas were associated with higher socioeconomic status. The lowest pulse intake was observed among older adults aged over 70. Among different pulses, beans were consumed mainly by participants with lower socioeconomic status. These participants minimally consumed lentils, chickpeas, and peas throughout the study period. In contrast, participants with higher socioeconomic status mostly consumed lentils and chickpeas. The study finds a low prevalence of pulse intake among U.S. adults, except for Mexican Americans. The average pulse intake by U.S. adults is estimated to be 0.68 cups per week, substantially lower than the recommended 2.5 cups per week. However, the average intake by pulse consumers is estimated to be more than 3.9 cups per week, which exceeds the current dietary recommendations. In 2017-2018, only 19.9% of adults met the 1.5 cups per week target, and just 10.9% met the 2.5 cups per week target. In 2000, the study found a drop in pulse intake, which the authors suggest may be due to increased acculturation of Latino and Asian immigrant groups and younger age groups' adoption of Western dietary patterns. Cultural and economic forces, including food price inflation and a growing interest in plant-based proteins, may drive the recent increase in pulse intake. The study reveals that U.S. adults with lower educational and socioeconomic status consume higher amounts of pulses. Pulses are inexpensive, shelf-stable, and can be bought in bulk, dried, or canned. These factors may explain the observed socioeconomic differences in pulse intake trends. However, the study also notes that income and education did not significantly predict whether someone consumed pulses, only the amounts consumed among those who did. One strategy would be to promote chickpeas and lentils to higher-income consumers and ethnic groups with fewer cultural or structural barriers regarding plant-based foods. The second strategy would be to popularize pulse-based snacks and breakfast products among Americans, especially among children and adolescents. Increasing public awareness about the affordability, convenience, and health benefits of pulses would be an important step towards successfully implementing the current dietary guidelines. The study authors also caution that their analysis relies on one-day dietary recalls, which estimate group averages but may not reflect usual individual intake.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chronic liver cirrhosis (LC) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are interconnected hepatic disorders associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite their distinct clinical characteristics, both conditions share common pathogenic pathways that remain inadequately understood. This study aimed to identify shared gene signatures and elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we employed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis to explore transcriptomic data from the Gene Expression Omnibus for LC and ACLF. Key co-expression modules enriched with genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways were identified, implicating metabolic dysfunction as a central feature in both conditions. Furthermore, microRNA analysis revealed that hsa-miR-122 and hsa-miR-194 play pivotal roles in regulating these metabolic pathways, potentially contributing to immune dysregulation. This association is mediated by miR-122 and miR-194, along with their corresponding signaling pathways. These findings highlight novel therapeutic targets that warrant further in-depth exploration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Osaka Metropolitan University have found that changing the timing of fertility drugs to match the follicle maturity period significantly increases the number of ovulated oocytes-the cells that develop into eggs-during artificial fertilization, even in rats that typically produce few oocytes. Their findings add to research on maximizing the number of oocytes. Increasing their number in rat models usually involves hormone-based treatments, consisting of two hormones, eCG and hCG, that are administered with a 48-hour interval. In rats, eCG is often used to prime the follicles before administering hCG to induce ovulation. On the other hand, less responsive rats like Brown-Norway (BN) rats release only seven oocytes, making them useful models for understanding why some animals do not respond to artificial fertilization. Professor Takehito Kaneko and Dr. Yuki Nakagawa at Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Veterinary Science successfully increased the number of oocytes retrieved following ovulation induction in BN rats by changing the timing of treatment. They discovered that the follicles responsible for developing oocytes were not sufficiently mature at this time. Strains with low ovulation rates typically respond poorly to artificial fertilization methods, but our findings suggest that it is not that they respond poorly, but rather that follicle development is insufficient, resulting in delayed oocyte development and fewer oocytes being ovulated. We believe that the results of this study can be applied to the treatment of infertility in humans and the artificial reproduction of endangered species with low birth rates."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belgian scientists have uncovered new details about how the immune system responds to vaccines. Dendritic cells, which are key immune messengers that help kick-start the body's defenses, show specific responses to lipid nanoparticles. These findings, published in Cell Reports, could lead to safer and more effective vaccines. Dendritic cells are among the first to detect viruses, bacteria, or other immune challenges. These cells help coordinate the immune system's response by alerting T cells, the immune system's soldiers trained to eliminate threats. But dendritic cells don't always respond in the same way. Until now, little was known about what determines these different responses, especially when dendritic cells encounter vaccines. Using cutting-edge methods like CITE-sequencing and flow cytometry, the researchers discovered that LNPs can influence dendritic cells to adopt either a calm, homeostatic role or an activated, immunogenic one. We found that empty LNPs don't strongly activate the immune system. That's good news, because it means they can deliver vaccine components without triggering unintended inflammation. For example, LNPs carrying antigens encoded as mRNA molecules prompted dendritic cells to take on an immunogenic role: activating T cells and driving protection. Dr. Victor Bosteels (VIB-UGent), co-first author, adds, "Our work might lay the groundwork for 'calming' vaccines for autoimmune diseases by encouraging a healthy immune system instead of inflammation." "Overall," says Prof. Janssens (VIB-UGent), "mapping how dendritic cells respond to different vaccine elements allows us to target the immune system more precisely and safely, which can lead to the next generation of vaccines."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Psychotherapy leads to measurable changes in brain structure. Researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and the University of Münster have demonstrated this for the first time in a study in "Translational Psychiatry" by using cognitive behavioral therapy. After therapy, most of them showed changes in areas responsible for processing emotions. The observed effects are similar to those already known from studies on medication. Around 280 million people suffer from severe depression worldwide. In psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established method for treating depression. CBT leads to positive changes in thought patterns, emotions and behavior. We assume that this process is also linked to functional and structural changes in the brain. The effect has already been demonstrated with therapy involving medication or electrostimulation, but has not yet been proven for psychotherapy in general." Professor Ronny Redlich, Head, Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology at MLU Now researchers at MLU and the University of Münster have succeeded in demonstrating this in an extensive study involving 30 people suffering from acute depression. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to examine the participants' brains before and after 20 sessions of therapy. "MRI scans provide information about the size, shape and location of tissue," explains psychologist Esther Zwiky from MLU. The study provided clear results: 19 of the 30 patients were found to have hardly any acute depressive symptoms after therapy. The researchers found a clear connection to the symptoms: individuals with a greater increase in grey matter in the amygdala also showed a stronger reduction in their emotional dysregulation. "Cognitive behavioral therapy was already known to work. Now, for the first time, we have a reliable biomarker for the effect of psychotherapy on brain structure. Put simply, psychotherapy changes the brain," explains Ronny Redlich. However, Redlich stresses that there is no fundamentally better or worse treatment – medication works better for some people, while electrostimulation works very well for others; for others, CBT can be most helpful. "It is therefore all the more encouraging that we were able to show in our study that psychotherapy is an equally effective alternative from a medical and scientific standpoint," says Redlich.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 80% of US neurologists prescribing drugs for multiple sclerosis (MS) received at least one pharma industry payment, with higher volume prescribers more likely to be beneficiaries, finds a 5 year analysis of Medicare database payments, published in the open access journal BMJ Open. And those in receipt of these payments were more likely to prescribe that company's drugs, especially if the sums involved were larger, sustained, and recent, the findings indicate. Because of the lifelong nature of MS, effective therapies are usually continued indefinitely unless a patient's clinical response changes, explain the researchers. And MS drug prescriptions are Medicare's largest neurological drug expense despite making up a relatively small portion of total claims, they add. While previously published research indicates that industry payments are associated with increased prescribing of marketed products, none of these studies focused on a market as competitive as the MS drugs market, say the researchers. They therefore set out to characterise industry payments to neurologists prescribing MS drugs and find out if the receipt of such payments might be associated with the likelihood of the preferential prescribing of that company's drugs. They used publicly available data on payments made by pharma companies to doctors from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) Open Payments platform from 2015 to 2019. The researchers focused on general payments to neurologists, linking these to Medicare Part D data, which covers prescription drugs, using National Provider Identification numbers and drug names. Their analysis included 7401 neurologists who had prescribed disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for at least 1 year, issuing a minimum of 11 prescriptions, and 20 DMTs manufactured by 10 companies. In all, 5809 (78.5%) neurologists received 626,290 distinct industry payments from at least one drug company, totalling US$163.6 million between 2015 and 2019; 4999 (67.5%) neurologists received payments from two or more companies. Higher prescription volumes were associated with a greater likelihood of receiving any payment type, particularly for consulting services, non-consulting services, such as speaking at an event, and travel/accommodation; the highest number of discrete payments was made for food and drink. The amount received was positively associated with prescription volume. Compared with those who received no payments from a company, those who did, were 13% more likely to prescribe that company's drugs. The strongest association between industry payment and prescribing tendencies was observed for non-consulting services. These neurologists were 53% more likely to prescribe that company's drugs. The recency of payments also seemed to be influential. And the researchers acknowledge that their study was limited to the prescribing of Part D drugs, and couldn't establish the appropriateness of prescribing, nor for which patients more expensive brand-name drugs were most suitable. A doctor's decision to prescribe is informed by many different factors, including national guidelines and/or institutional protocols, insurance cover, and patient preferences. "Promotional efforts to influence prescribing are especially concerning given the drugs' substantial costs, particularly if more expensive brand-name drugs are being prescribed instead of appropriate, effective, generically available alternatives," they point out. "However, it remains unclear whether increased transparency has mitigated these conflicts of interest and their impact on prescribing behaviour, or simply given the public greater insight into the large scale of industry payments made to prescribers," they conclude.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weight-loss drugs like semaglutide may melt fat, but at the cost of muscle mass. A new review reveals how to protect your strength while reaping the benefits. Study: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and muscle mass effects. A recent study published in the journal Pharmacological Research reviewed evidence on the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) on skeletal muscle (SM) mass, quality, and function. Obesity changes your muscle 'engine type': Excess weight shifts muscle fiber composition, reducing efficient, fat-burning Type I fibers and increasing less efficient, fatigue-prone Type IIx fibers, worsening metabolic flexibility. SM accounts for about 40% of body mass in healthy adults. This proportion alters with aging and in disease states. While age-related changes are characterized by a slow, progressive loss of muscle mass, this decline could lead to sarcopenia, frailty syndrome, and cachexia in more severe cases. Obesity has an even greater impact on SM function and composition. SM accounts for up to 70% of glucose uptake in the postprandial state and is considered a vital regulator of energy and metabolism. Additionally, insulin has anabolic effects on muscle by inhibiting proteolysis and promoting protein synthesis. Insulin resistance (IR), commonly associated with obesity, disrupts these processes. Conventional anti-obesity medications are limited to short-term use and have adverse effects, which have contributed to the rise of GLP-1 RAs, e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide. GLP-1 RAs offer multiple beneficial effects and have a favorable safety profile. However, concerns exist regarding the impact of GLP-1 RAs on lean mass, particularly with respect to true skeletal muscle mass. GLP-1 RAs are primarily used for the treatment of chronic weight management and type 2 diabetes (T2D). GLP-1 RAs bind to the G protein-coupled GLP-1 receptor, whose activation results in insulin synthesis and release by pancreatic beta cells. Women face a double-edged sword with GLP-1s: While women often lose more total weight on these drugs, this also means they tend to lose more absolute muscle mass compared to men, raising specific concerns for this group. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a myokine produced in response to physical activity. It facilitates muscle glucose uptake and also exerts systemic effects. Preclinical studies report that IL-6 may promote GLP-1 release from intestinal L-cells. However, the role of IL-6 in human GLP-1 regulation is debated. Irisin is another myokine produced in response to exercise, and regulates energy metabolism. While the physiological relevance of irisin in humans is under investigation, growing preclinical evidence suggests its role in lipid metabolism, browning of white adipose tissue, and glucose uptake. Obesity leads to significant SM changes; it impairs SM microcirculation, lipid oxidation, mitochondrial activity, and glucose metabolism, which might aggravate metabolic dysfunction and IR. In obesity, the proportion of type I muscle fibers decreases while that of type IIx muscle fibers increases. Fat hiding inside your muscle is a stealth health risk: Every 1% increase in muscle fat content (myosteatosis) is linked to a 7% higher risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of overall body fat. Physiological weight loss can help decrease metabolic risk factors and is effective in managing several diseases. The loss of muscle mass is particularly relevant for patients with metabolic diseases and older people, for whom muscle mass loss expedites sarcopenia development. Experimental studies have uncovered numerous benefits of GLP-1 RAs on SM. In obese mice, semaglutide was found to reduce intramuscular fat accumulation and body weight, stimulate protein synthesis in muscle, and promote an increase in the relative proportion of SM. Clinical data also indicate beneficial molecular effects of GLP-1 RAs, despite their potential to reduce muscle mass. It has been hypothesized that GLP-1 RA effects may be adaptive, and improved IS may contribute to enhanced muscle function. GLP-1 RA treatment has been reported to increase irisin levels in patients with obesity and T2D. A recent study reported a decrease in muscle fat content with liraglutide in obese or overweight adults without diabetes. Muscle talks to your gut during exercise: Physical activity triggers muscle release of IL-6 and other signals that actually boost GLP-1 production in the intestines, creating a natural feedback loop that supports metabolism. Given concerns about muscle mass reduction with GLP-1 RAs, the reviewed paper emphasizes strategies to preserve or restore muscle health. Resistance training and higher dietary protein intake are strongly recommended to counteract sarcopenic effects. These interventions have shown promise in maintaining muscle mass and function during pharmacologically induced weight loss. Moreover, emerging therapeutic agents are under investigation. Bimagrumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting activin type II receptors, has shown potential to increase lean mass while reducing fat mass. Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, may also offer more favorable muscle preservation profiles, although further studies are needed. The authors emphasize the importance of standardized assessments in clinical trials, including objective measures of muscle strength (e.g., grip strength) and physical function (e.g., gait speed), as well as the use of advanced imaging techniques beyond DXA and BIA (e.g., MRI or CT) to evaluate muscle quality and composition. However, increasing data suggest that the pronounced weight loss with GLP-1 RAs may be accompanied by a decrease in SM mass. This may increase the risk of sarcopenic obesity, particularly in older individuals. Integrating exercise, adequate protein intake, and potentially adjunctive pharmacotherapies is essential to mitigate this risk. As the clinical use of GLP-1 RAs continues to grow, it is necessary to better understand their long-term effects and optimize their use to preserve the muscle health, functional status, and quality of life of patients.
