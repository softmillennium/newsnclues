                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Donald Trump has declared war on the Federal Reserve's independence. Cook, an economist appointed by Joe Biden, holds one of the 12 votes that determine whether the Fed will raise or lower interest rates. Trump wants a central bank that will do his bidding. But he cannot legally replace Federal Reserve governors before their terms are up, unless they commit acts of neglect or malfeasance. So, his administration launched an investigation into Cook with the aim of generating a pretext for her ouster. They settled on the allegation that Cook once falsified records when applying for a mortgage. To many liberals, Trump's attempted removal of Cook is of a piece with his broader assault on America's democratic institutions: Trump wants every federal agency to put his personal interests above their public responsibilities. His Justice Department does not seek to impartially enforce the law, but to reward Trump's allies and harass his enemies. With his assault on Fed independence, Trump is seeking to corrupt yet another institution, so as to further consolidate his authoritarian regime. To them, Trump's attack on the Fed is categorically different from his perversion of other federal agencies, or efforts to harass and intimidate America's other power centers. In this view, the idea that the Federal Reserve should be free to make monetary policy without political interference is itself anti-democratic. The great historian Adam Tooze endorses this general perspective, in a rejoinder to Wessel and Krugman. Faced with Trump's subversion of Fed independence, Tooze argues that Democrats should not defend that anti-democratic institution, but rather, pursue a “democratic politics of central banking.” Progressive critics of the Fed make some valid points. This skewed composition — combined with the Fed's political independence — risks giving monied interests veto power over economic policy: By threatening to punish deficit spending with interest rate hikes, the central bank can theoretically discourage Congress from pursuing economic policies that Wall Street does not like. The central bank's core objectives are set by Americans' elected representatives: Congress has instructed the Fed to set monetary policy with an eye towards maximum employment and stable prices. This operational independence is assured largely by the fact that Fed's governors serve 14-year terms and can only be removed for cause. This insulates the body's key decision-makers from shifts in partisan politics. The justification for such insulation is simple: The benefits of ill-advised rate cuts are immediate while their costs typically take many months to materialize. Once the Fed lowers rates, consumers and businesses quickly enjoy lower borrowing costs. In theory, these dynamics encourage politicians to cut interest rates in the run-up to Election Day, even if such a policy is unsound. In 1972, Richard Nixon successfully pressured the Fed to cut interest rates ahead of his reelection campaign, interference that plausibly contributed to the ensuing surge of inflation. It's true then that Fed independence is founded on an analysis of electoral democracy's potential dysfunctions. As recent years have amply demonstrated, voters really do value price stability. And the electorate surely has clearer views on what monetary policy should achieve — such as low inflation and strong growth — than about precisely how the central bank should promote those goals. Congress's decision to delegate these technical decisions to a politically insulated body, while mandating certain objectives and conducting oversight, might therefore best advance the public's preferences. And indeed, there is evidence that central bank independence does yield lower rates of inflation. Notably, this arrangement — in which Congress mandates goals but delegates authority over means to politically protected bureaucrats — is not unique to the Fed. And in some other contexts, progressives recognize its basic legitimacy. And it insulated the agency's leader from political interference by providing them with a five year-term, which could only be terminated for cause. It was progressives who defended the democratic legitimacy of this arrangement, on the grounds that some insulation from industry lobbying and short-term political pressures would enable the CFPB to better fulfill its mandate. Conservatives disputed this and ultimately ended the CFPB administrator's political independence through judicial challenge. My point is just that Congress giving a federal agency a degree of administrative autonomy is not inherently contrary to democracy. The central bank's existing prerogatives — including its governors' protection from termination except for cause — reflect the decision-making of democratically elected officials. Democracy depends on the executive's fealty to established laws. And Trump's actions are also potentially anti-democratic in their substantive implications: He is arguably trying to force the Fed to subordinate the electorate's long-term material interests to his own short-term political ones. Further, Congress's dysfunctional and anti-majoritarian character undermines the Fed's democratic legitimacy. What's more, due to the super-abundance of veto points in America's legislative process, amending existing laws is often practically infeasible. Thus, Congress might be practically incapable of changing the Fed's priorities and structure, even if there were a strong democratic will for such reform. These realities are partly responsible for the steady aggrandizement of presidential power, and (small-d) democrats' growing comfort with it. Nevertheless, Trump trying to lawlessly impose his will on the Fed does not bring us closer to a democratic system of economic governance. Rather, it brings us closer to a personalist authoritarian regime. Liberals can reasonably condemn it on those terms. Trump is seizing on a flimsy pretext to fire one of the Fed's seven governors.﻿ Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness. If Trump doesn't like you, Bill Pulte may be looking into your mortgage soon. Latino voters will be crucial to either party's gerrymandering plans.</p>

Fifth-grader Weston Halsne told reporters he ducked for the pews, covering his head, shielded by a friend who was lying on top of him. “I was super-scared for him, but I think now he's okay,” the 10-year-old said, adding that he was praying for the other hospitalized children and adults. Halsne's grandfather, Michael Simpson, said the violence during Mass on the third day of school left him wondering whether God was watching over. “I don't know where He is,” Simpson said. A person walks out of the Annunciation Church's school as police respond to a reported mass shooting, Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025, in Minneapolis. The police chief said the shooter was in their early 20s, did not have an extensive known criminal history and is believed to have acted alone, but did not release the name or information on possible connections to the school. That official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. The police chief said a wooden plank was placed to barricade some of the side doors, and that authorities found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,” O'Hara said at a news conference as church bells rang out. A parent hugs her son during an active shooter situation at the Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, Minn., Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. “Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” Frey said. Westman's uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob Heleringer, said he did not know the accused shooter well and was confounded by the violence: “It's an unspeakable tragedy.” “We're praying for my sister and her other children and also, obviously, for these poor, poor children,” Heleringer said by phone. Bienemann's daughter, Alexandra, said she was an alumna of the kindergarten-to-eighth-grade school, and it made her sick to her stomach to think she might know some of those who were injured. “It doesn't make me feel safe at all in this community that I have been in for so long,” she said. Law enforcement officers gather outside the Annunciation Church's school in response to a reported mass shooting, Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025, in Minneapolis. Amid a heavy uniformed law enforcement presence later Wednesday morning, children in dark green uniforms trickled out of the school with adults, giving lingering hugs and wiping away tears. Aubrey Pannhoff, a 16-year-old student at a different Catholic school, rushed to Annunciation after her own school's lockdown and prayer service, and she said she was asking God: “Why?” “It's just really hard for me to take in.” Tim Walz called the violence “horrific” and said his state is heartbroken in posts on X. The governor was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last year's election against Trump's running mate, now Vice President JD Vance, a Republican. From the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV sent a telegram of condolences. Democratic officials from around country were meeting in Minneapolis, and Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told the gathering what was happening and said it was “a tragic day.” U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat who represents the area around the school, visited the scene. Hennepin Healthcare, the main trauma hospital in Minneapolis, said it received 10 patients, including eight children — aged 6 through 14 — and two adults. Seven were considered to be in critical condition. Monday had been the first day of the school year at Annunciation, a 102-year-old school in a leafy residential and commercial neighborhood about 5 miles (8 kilometers) south of downtown Minneapolis. Karin Cebulla, who said she had worked as a learning specialist at Annuciation and sent her two now-college-aged daughters there, described the school as an accepting, caring community. “Everyone felt safe here, and I just pray that it continues to be a place where people feel safe,” she said. One person was killed and six others were hurt in a shooting Tuesday afternoon outside a high school in Minneapolis. O'Hara, the police chief, said the Annunciation shooting does not appear to be related to other recent violence. Wednesday's school shooting also followed a spate of hoax calls about purported shootings on at least a dozen U.S. college campuses.</p>

San Bernardino County Detective Eduardo Badillo, lefr, speaks on the phone alongside a Riverside County Sheriff's officer outside the home of Rebecca and Jake Haro, parents of missing 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, on Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Cabazon, Calif. (Anjali Sharif-Paul/The Orange County Register via AP) A 7-month-old baby likely died from abuse by his parents before they made a false report that he was abducted, authorities said Wednesday. Southern California prosecutors and sheriff's authorities said they believe Emmanuel Haro was abused by his father Jake Haro, 32; and mother, Rebecca Haro, 41, who were arrested last week and have been charged with his murder. It began after Rebecca Haro reported on Aug. 14 that she was assaulted and left unconscious while changing her son's diaper outside a store in the San Bernardino County community of Yucaipa. “The filing in this case reflects our belief that baby Emmanuel was abused, a victim of child abuse over time, and that eventually, because of that abuse, he succumbed to those injuries,” Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin told reporters. The couple is being held on $1 million bail each. They are scheduled to be arraigned next week. Messages seeking comment were left Tuesday for the lawyer listed as representing them in online court records. Authorities said they found inconsistencies in the mother's account. Over the weekend, sheriff's deputies searched for the boy's remains in a field by a freeway in the presence of Jake Haro, who authorities said provided some cooperation. The girl suffered rib and skull fractures, a brain hemorrhage and other injuries that caused permanent damage, Hestrin said. He said the prosecution asked the judge to sentence Haro to prison at that time, but instead he was allowed to serve 180 days of work release, plus probation. “It was an outrageous error in judgment by this judge,” Hestrin said. A message seeking comment about the earlier case against Haro was left for Riverside County Superior Court.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. A shooting was reported Wednesday at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. Covered by: Greg Norman, Rachel Wolf, Stephen Sorace, Alex Miller, Elizabeth Elkind, Stepheny Price, Greg Wehner, David Spunt, Anders Hagstrom and Michael Ruiz Brian O'Hara, Minneapolis Police Chief, confirms 2 children, aged 8 and 10, died in Annunciation Catholic Church shooting as they sat in pews 17 people, including 14 children, were injured in mass shooting on Wednesday O'Hara told reporters during a press conference Wednesday that police believe the shooter used three weapons, a rifle, shotgun and pistol The suspect, later identified as Robin Westman and Robert Westman, took their own life in rear of church, police said Suspect took own life in rear of church, O'Hara said By subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy. Westman is accused of fatally shooting two children and injuring 17 others at Annunciation Catholic School on Wednesday morning. Police confirmed Westman is deceased, likely of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI is investigating the shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school mass as an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime in a post on X. “The FBI is investigating this shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics,” Patel wrote. Pope Leo XIV sent his condolences to Archbishop Bernard Hebda of Minneapolis after the deadly shooting at Annunciation church during a Mass with school students. So we really didn't know what to do. We just got into the pews and he shot through the stained glass windows," a 10-year-old student said, referring to shooting drills. “As a Church, we are following the tragic news from Annunciation School in Minneapolis with heartbreaking sadness,” the archbishop said. “Whenever one part of the Body of Christ is wounded, we feel the pain as if it were our very own children. “I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations,” he added. "The Minnesota Twins are heartbroken by today's tragic and senseless mass shooting at Annunciation Church and School in south Minneapolis. The taking of innocent lives in a place of learning and worship is incomprehensible," the MLB team wrote on X. "Alongside our community, we mourn this tragedy and yearn for a future where such violence no longer shatters lives." "We are devastated by the horrific violence that took place at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis this morning. Our hearts are broken for the victims, their families and all who have been impacted by this senseless and cowardly act," a post from the Minnesota Vikings read. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy condemned the Wednesday shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school as an "unthinkable crime." "I cannot imagine what the families at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis are going through." “This information is for investigative partners only and will not be released to the public.” “This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshiping. A school safety expert said while most school safety discussions focus on public schools, Catholic schools face a unique risk. Ken Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, told Fox News Digital that this scenario is unique because you not only have the staff and students attending mass, but some parents and other adult parishioners from the community as well. “In Catholic schools, an all-school Mass brings hundreds of students, staff, parents and parishioners together—creating safety challenges rarely seen in public schools,” Trump explained. “Who will monitor entrances while staff are in the Mass? How will you lock down or evacuate a church full of students?” he continued. Regarding the Minnesota Catholic school shooting, he said, law enforcement officers may have to assess motives tied to grievances against the church, individual staff or even ideological and religious influences. “Catholic schools cannot afford to rely on tradition and trust alone,” Trump said. “They must train, plan and invest in safety like every other school.” Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she was "beyond heartbroken" in a post on X following the shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school in her congressional district. I am praying for all the families impacted by this horrific tragedy. I will continue to closely monitor the situation and provide updates." Omar later spoke with reporters, saying it was not the right time to have a "national conversation" about stopping school shootings. "We know that once this investigation is done, once these families are made whole, then we can have the national conversation that is necessary to stop school shootings like this from taking place in our communities and devastating families all over this country." “Officers entered the building not knowing what they would face,” Jason Pack told Fox News Digital.Pack added that “those first minutes are confusion and noise, but training takes over.” Officials in Minneapolis confirmed that the shooter was dead and took his own life. He added that investigators will also look at the suspect's past to understand warning signs and whether others were involved.“The main question they are answering, ‘Why would someone do this? Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin interrupted his party's summer meeting Wednesday in Minneapolis to announce the mass shooting in the same city. I'm not trying to startle or shock any of you. There is an active shooter, here in Minneapolis. Right now, an unknown amount of victims at a church and school,” Martin, who is from Minneapolis himself, told the audience. It seems to be a fairly significant shooting,” he added. Police later said two children were killed and 17 other people – including 14 children – were injured in the shooting during a mass at the Annunciation Catholic School. Nine of the children injured in a shooting at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Wednesday were being treated at a hospital, with four requiring surgeries, a hospital official told reporters. Tom Wyatt, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Hennepin Healthcare said 11 patients were brought to the Hennepin County Medical Center, including two adults and nine children aged between 6 and 14. There were no fatalities among the 11 patients being treated there as of Wednesday afternoon, he said, adding that several of the children were in critical condition and four required surgery. “I can't get into specifics, but we are dealing with gunshot wound injuries from apparently a high velocity weapon,” Wyatt said. Bienemann told Fox News he could hear the “sporadic” gunfire. Police have confirmed that two children were killed in the shooting and 17 other individuals were injured, including 14 children and three adults. The shooter is dead, likely from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though police have not conclusively stated his cause of death. "The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible," O'Hara said while addressing reporters. Additionally, O'Hara said police believe the assailant took his own life. There was a smoke bomb found at the scene. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer listens as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) speaks, during a press conference addressing the appropriations process at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on July 22, 2025. “I'm horrified by the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis and closely monitoring the situation,” Schumer wrote on X. Students and teachers should not be putting their lives on the line just by going back to school. We must do more to stop gun violence in America.” Jeffries similarly called the Catholic school shooting “horrifying.” “Praying for the children, families and first responders during this moment of terror and unimaginable grief,” he wrote on X, in part. “Weapons of war have no place in our neighborhoods, streets or schools.” A federal source on the ground in Minneapolis confirmed to Fox News that an estimated 15 to 20 people were injured in a shooting at the Annunciation Catholic School. It was not immediately clear whether there were any fatalities. Walz wrote on X that "I've been briefed on a shooting at Annunciation Catholic School" and "I'm praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence." Sources told Fox 9 that the suspect – who has not been publicly identified – is deceased. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Fox News contributor Ted Williams discusses the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on ‘The Faulkner Focus.' Police responded to a mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Wednesday, where they said two children were killed and 17 people injured. The suspected shooter of a group of Minneapolis Catholic school students at morning Mass Wednesday has been identified as Robert or Robin Westman, according to law enforcement sources. Court records show that a Minneapolis juvenile named Robert Westman had their name legally changed to Robin in 2019, and FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed that the shooter was born Robert and later identified as Robin. "Minor child [redacted] identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification," she wrote at the time. She could not immediately be reached for comment. Disturbing videos posted by a person using the name Robin Westman were deleted from YouTube after the shooting, showing handwritten pages of a notebook, weapons with messages painted on them, and commentary from whoever filmed them. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara confirmed that police were "aware of a manifesto the shooter had timed to be released on YouTube." "[It] appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writing," the chief said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announces his department is taking control of Union Station, the main transportation hub in Washington, away from Amtrak. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is escorted to board the NextGen Acela high-speed rail service, at Union Station in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy boards the NextGen Acela high-speed rail service en route to Boston, at Union Station in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration is taking management of Union Station away from Amtrak in the latest example of the federal government exerting its power over the nation's capital. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the takeover Wednesday alongside Amtrak President Roger Harris at Washington's main transportation hub during the launch of an updated version of the rail service's Acela train. Union Station, in walking distance from the Capitol, has “fallen into disrepair” when it should be a “point of pride” for the District of Columbia, Duffy said. He said the Republican administration's move would help beautify the landmark in an economical way and was in line with Trump's vision. “He wants Union Station to be beautiful again. And he wants our nation's capital to be great again. And today is part of that,” Duffy said. It's Trump's latest attempt to put the city under his control. In recent weeks, Trump has increased the number of federal law enforcement and immigration agents on city streets while also taking over the Metropolitan Police Department and activating thousands of National Guard members. Last week, Trump said he wants $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington. Duffy said the federal government can do a better job managing the train station and attract more tenants and generate more revenue that will be spent on upgrading the station, which opened in 1907. National Guard troops have patrolled in and around Union Station ever since Trump announced the anti-crime effort this month. Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were shouted down by opponents of the federal intervention when they visited with troops there last week. Duffy had pressed Amtrak about crime at the station in a March letter to its chief operating officer and requested an updated plan on how it intended to improve public safety there. The deputy transportation secretary, Steve Bradbury, cited a new roof and new public restrooms among $170 million in upgrades that he said are needed at the station. Amtrak's new high-speed train, the NextGen Acela, will start serving the Northeast Corridor on Thursday, said Harris, Amtrak's president. The trains can travel at speeds of up to 160 mph, about 10 mph faster than the high-speed train it is replacing. The station was closed for five years for renovation and President Ronald Reagan signed the Union Station Redevelopment Act to help fund and organize its comeback. Foot traffic plummeted after passengers shunned mass transit while multiple shops closed at the station. The station has occasionally been a magnet for homeless individuals seeking shelter inside or camping in tents on Columbus Circle in front of the building.

The Department of Transportation is planning to reclaim management over Washington, DC's, Union Station to “restore it as a transportation hub that benefits our nation's capital,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNN. Safe & Beautiful Again, and under Secretary Duffy's leadership, the Department of Transportation is taking historic action to reinvest in Union Station and restore it as a transportation hub that befits our nation's capital,” he added. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke Wednesday with his German, French, and British counterparts ahead of the looming decision by the European countries on whether to trigger snapback sanctions on Iran. On the call, “all reiterated their commitment to ensuring that Iran never develops or obtains a nuclear weapon,” according to a brief State Department readout. Officials from the E3 met with Iran in Geneva on Tuesday. A source said the meeting did not yield significant progress. President Donald Trump said this morning that he has been briefed on the shooting at a Catholic school in south Minneapolis, adding that he will continue to monitor the “terrible situation.” “I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation. Tim Walz this morning, a White House official said. Follow live updates on the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis here. Two new polls find a broad partisan divide over whether the federal government should be involved in fighting crime in America's cities, even as a large share say they see crime in urban areas as a major problem. A Reuters/Ipsos poll finds just 36% of Americans support “federal officials bringing the Washington, DC local police under federal control citing a public safety emergency,” while 38% support “deploying National Guard troops from other states to Washington, DC for law enforcement efforts.” But an AP-NORC poll finds most (55%) view it as acceptable for the government to “use the US military and National Guard to assist local police.” Fewer (32%) feel that way about the federal government taking “control of local police departments.” He added that Cook is a “partisan,” claiming she shows an allegiance to the Democratic party. Earlier, when asked if Trump's firing of Cook — a Fed policymaker appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2022 — poses any risk to the political independence of the Fed, Hassett told CNN's John Berman that he disagreed. A federal judge is planning to have Trump administration officials testify in early October about the government's efforts to re-deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia and is prohibiting his removal from the US for several more weeks. US District Judge Paula Xinis on Wednesday set an evidentiary hearing for October 6. President Donald Trump accused George Soros and his son of supporting “violent protests” and called for racketeering to be brought against them without providing any evidence for his claims. “George Soros, and his wonderful Radical Left son, should be charged with RICO because of their support of Violent Protests, and much more, all throughout the United States of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Officials with Soros' Open Society Foundations network denied that it pays people to protest, saying in a statement that some of the groups it supports undertake “peaceful civic engagement, which is critical to the strength of our democracy.” But the Soros network does “not pay people to protest or directly train or coordinate protesters,” it added. Part of his justification for the extraordinary mobilization of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles in June was his often baseless claim that demonstrators were paid. Trump's latest threat against his perceived political enemies comes after he threatened to investigate former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over a decade-old political scandal, earlier this week. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday reiterated his call to review the Federal Reserve as an institution just days after President Donald Trump fired Governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud. “I've encouraged Chair Powell to do this on an internal basis before there is an external review,” Bessent told Fox Business on Wednesday. In a letter posted on social media Monday, Trump said he has determined there is enough cause to fire Cook, who was appointed to the Fed's Board of Governors in 2022 by former President Joe Biden. Trump said “I do not have such confidence in your integrity.” The Justice Department has said it plans to investigate the allegations of mortgage fraud, first raised by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, but so far, Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing. “The Fed is an unaccountable institution, and its relationship with the American people depends on a high level of trust, and incidents like this puncture that trust.” Bessent has previously called for a review of the Fed. It's unclear what that would entail specifically — whether it would include an audit or a review of the central bank's policy decisions. In an interview with CNN's John Berman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that the federal government's $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, announced earlier this week, means American taxpayers are “going to have a stake (in) their future success.” “This is something that's very, very common in governments around the world,” Hassett said, pointing to US stock investments made by Norway's sovereign wealth fund. Trump's India tariffs: When asked about the massive new tariffs on India — which went into effect Wednesday, doubling levies to 50% — Hassett said trade talks with the country's leaders “haven't been particularly productive.” Trump has said the tariff hikes on India seek to punish the country for importing Russian oil and indirectly financing Russia's war with Ukraine. President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has worried some top economists. Hear Justin Wolfers, University of Michigan Professor of Public Policy and Economics, explain how recent events in Turkey can show just how bad things can get for everyday citizens when politics mix with monetary policy. “By reclaiming station management, we will help make this city safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost.” If you missed yesterday's top headlines, here's a quick recap to start your day. President Donald Trump made good on his threat to double tariffs on imports from India to 50%, a move that could endanger relations with one of America's most important trading partners and send consumer prices higher. This comes just weeks after Trump instituted a new 25% baseline tariff on Indian goods. The latest round of tariffs on India seeks to punish the country for importing Russian oil and helping Russia finance its war with Ukraine, Trump has previously said. The US leader recently held separate meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help broker a deal to end their years-long war. American firms — and, more recently, consumers — are already seeing higher costs resulting from Trump's tariff campaign while the health of the labor market has deteriorated. The ramped-up levies on Indian goods could worsen both effects. New Delhi signaled it would retaliate against Trump's tariffs earlier this month, when Trump initially vowed to impose what he referred to as “secondary sanctions.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's public schedule shows that he will meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar at the State Department today. Also today, the White House is expected to hold a “large meeting” on Gaza, chaired by President Donald Trump, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News yesterday. In addition to meeting with Rubio, Sa'ar is also slated to meet with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was in Israel in May following the murder of Israeli embassy employees Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgram. President Donald Trump is expected to hold a meeting at the White House today on the war in Gaza, envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News last night. “We've got a large meeting in the White House tomorrow, chaired by the president, and it's a very comprehensive plan we're putting together on the next day that I think many people are going to be, they're going to see how robust it is and how well meaning it is, and it reflects President Trump's humanitarian motives here,” Witkoff said. At least 20 people were killed in the attacks, including five journalists. When asked for his reaction, Trump said he had not heard about the strike, but that he was “not happy about it.” The president's meeting also comes after Israelis held a nationwide day of protest Tuesday, blocking highways and burning tires as they called for a Gaza ceasefire deal that would secure the release of hostages.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mary Beard on history, myth, and the empire's real lessons. Plus: the reemergence of fascism in America. Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Pocket Casts He argues that fascism, once thought to have been buried by the Second World War, has reemerged in modern forms, thriving on the endless hunt for enemies, stoking culture wars, and exploiting new technologies. Then David is joined by Mary Beard, one of the world's foremost scholars of Rome and the author of the New York Times best seller Emperor of Rome, for a conversation about what the ancient world can teach us about current politics. They discuss how Roman emperors wielded power, why excess and corruption were baked into the system, and how fragile even the strongest-seeming regimes can be. Beard explains why myths about Roman grandeur persist, what daily life actually looked like under the empire, and what lessons modern democracies should (and should not) draw from Rome's rise and fall. I'm David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. There's a lot of discussion of history in the podcast world, but this show is unusual in that my guest is not some self-taught crackpot, not some professor of chemistry somewhere who has some thoughts about Jews. Today's guest will be Dame Mary Beard, who is Great Britain's leading classicist and expert on the history of Rome and the ancient world. So you're going to be talking to somebody, or hearing from someone, who knows what she's talking about, and that's a little different from what often happens in discussions of history on the internet. Walter Lippmann, a century ago, in his book Public Opinion, wrote, “The really important thing is to try and make opinion increasingly responsible to the facts. There can be no liberty for a community which lacks the information by which to detect lies.” Now, we live in a very peculiar, perverse modern world where no one lacks information. You can have not only everything that's available to you on the internet, but thanks to the internet and thanks to internet commerce, you can have books, the best books, delivered to you instantly, tomorrow. And not just today's books, but the classics. Anything that's out of print—somewhere on planet Earth, it exists somewhere, and it can be brought to your very door within 24, 48 hours, or a few more days than that. The problem that we have is one unanticipated by Walter Lippmann, where there's an abundance of information, but people consistently choose bad information so often, and that is especially true in the realm of the use and abuse of history. Why is it, in particular, that we are hearing so much defense of fascism and defense of [Adolf] Hitler, literally, as our introduction to historical study in so much of the online world. Well, part of it is that, look—just as the internet has made it possible to create ever more specialized forms of pornography for people with ever more specialized forms of kink, so rarer and rarer segments of opinion get more and more material delivered to them. And back in the old days when we had that legacy media monopoly—CBS, ABC, NBC, and the others would collectively agree, Look—even though we could make a little extra money by serving a Nazi market, we're just not going to do it. We're going to leave those dollars on the table and collect all the other dollars. So there's something of that going on. For a long time we've used the terms Nazi and fascists as kind of epithets—jokey or not-so-jokey forms of insult. Now, socialist can be used as an insult too. President [Donald] Trump and the people around him use socialist as an insult, even as they are nationalizing the means of production and taking over companies and making the state the arbiter of what is said on television and what forms of technology get made and whether or not U.S. Steel can have its headquarters in Pittsburgh or some other city. But we also recognize that even though socialism is used—or socialist—as an insult, it's an analytic category that we can understand. And we can make nonpejorative, noninsulting descriptive statements about them. Fascism before the Second World War was something similar. You could use it as an analytic category. Because of the complete and proper discrediting of fascism during the war—and because it was so badly defeated during the war—it has tended to drop out of use as an analytic category, even by the fascists themselves. Ernest Hemingway wrote, in one of his novels about the Spanish Civil War, “There are many fascists in my country; they just don't know it yet. They're actually more international than any liberal movement. They have formed a kind of network, and the internet is their binding form. They want to re-litigate that as part of a larger project to rehabilitate the thing they don't yet dare call fascism, but which is fascism. I want to maybe pause here to think about what fascism as an analytic category should look like. Not as an epithet, not as an insult, and not as a joke, but as a way, really, to describe a growing group of people in many countries who are cooperating together in the pursuit of influence and power. Socialism as an analytic category exists, even though not everybody agrees on what the definition of socialism is, even though not everybody agrees on where the lines are, and even though not everybody agrees on who fits into which box within those lines. We can all agree the concept is there—although applying the concept can often, in practice, be a little complicated or uncertain. Well, I think the same is true for fascism. It is a system of thought and belief. Now, because fascism did in the past and does today emphasize action and feeling over reason, because it's not as doctrinaire as socialism, it's a little harder to write down what its contents are. You see a yearning for authoritarian leadership—and not authoritarian leadership by some committee, but authoritarian leadership by the cult of the individual leader who is represented as more manly, more masculine, more physically fit, more virile than other men. Fascism always rejects formal methods for ascertaining what the will of the people is, what public opinion is. It prefers an emotional and informal silent bond between this cult of the charismatic, virile national leader and his followers. There are many forms of authoritarianism that aren't fascist, because they're backward; they're traditional. If you meet, in some remote part of the world, a tribal chief, and people obey him because they feel the gods wish them to, that can be pretty authoritarian, but it's not fascist, because it's backward-looking. Indeed, fascists are often better and faster at adapting these new technologies than their more tradition-minded adversaries. But the most important quality of fascism, I think the thing that is the test of whether it's there or not, is what makes it go. Socialism is inspired by the ideal of equality. Liberalism is inspired by the ideal of liberty or freedom. And whenever you see people with a strong “friend-versus-enemy” way of thinking—allies versus adversaries, insiders versus outsiders—what you're seeing is the emotional juice on which fascism feeds. That's why I'm going to take seriously for a moment this recent absurd outburst—it's recent on the day I recorded it; there may be a little lag before you see it—about the changing of the branding of the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain. Now, Cracker Barrel, as those of you who have driven America's highways know, is a popular restaurant in many of America's rural places. Unfortunately for the shareholders and employees of Cracker Barrel, it's decreasingly popular. It's lost a lot of market share over the past decade. Cracker Barrel's stock and trade is nostalgia. And the nostalgia that it has been offering is nostalgia that people don't remember anymore. And people who feel nostalgia want the product that reminds them of their own childhood. So Cracker Barrel has, in an effort to hold on to or reverse its declining market share, rebranded itself. This has become a culture-war flashpoint of a kind that we've seen so often, and it seems of all the ones we have seen, maybe the most crazy, the most absurd. But it's not absurd because what it is—it's a part of the process of the endless hunt to identify enemies. You may not have heard of Carl Schmitt, I don't recommend him to you, but he is the central text of many in the new modern fascist movement. He's been read and admired by many who are very close to the Trump White House, and you can hear echoes of his language and above all his idea that the power to govern is the power to identify people as enemies of the state. And that's what's going on with this Cracker Barrel story. It's just a way to flush out who the enemies are and to identify who the friends are. Now, Cracker Barrel also offers a glimpse of what our hope is. And because liberty and equality go more naturally together than the fascist ideas, there is a reason why social democrats have often been a resource for liberals in the fight against fascism. Because liberals and socialists are not animated by the same thing, but they can recognize there is a kind of more cousinly kinship between the ideals of equality and liberty than there is between either of those and the endless hunt for internal and external enemies to persecute and punish. But we can stand for those ideals and we can uphold the institutions of law, the institutions of legality, the institutions of democracy. He ended with an uplifting message of universal brotherhood. And as you confront people trying to find group enemies and group allies by complaining about the rebranding of Cracker Barrel, you realize they're teetering on the precipice of absurdity, and comedy is the push that can topple them over and discredit them, not with horror—although that is certainly deserved—but with laughter. And studying both the past and the present is part of the intellectual armament to stand up against it, and that's why I'm so grateful today, Mary Beard—we're going to talk about very different things, of a very different historical era, but understanding the passage of time and the way we are connected to what came before and what we are connected to, what will come next, is our way to belong to a greater human community that insists on the universality of the best ideals and the antagonism of universal ideals to the brutal particularism that is what fascism is all about. Before I go on to my dialogue with Mary Beard, however, I'm going to ask you a little favor. And so we want to ask you a few questions. What do you think of the show? So we put together a short survey. We'll have a link in the show notes as well. And as a thank-you, the first 100 respondents to the survey will get a $20 gift card. And now my dialogue with Mary Beard. Frum: Mary Beard is Great Britain's leading scholar of the classical world. An ordinary introduction cannot do justice to the breadth and depth of Mary Beard's published works. Her most recent is Emperor of Rome: Ruling the [Ancient] Roman World. SPQR: A History of [Ancient] Rome has become a massive and enduring best seller on both sides of the Atlantic. The book of hers that exerts special hold on me is The Roman Triumph, a disconcertingly original study of the Roman genius at inventing traditions and then insisting that those traditions had always been there all along. Mary Beard will shortly, at the end of August, launch a podcast of her own, Instant Classics, and that will be must-listening for everyone who cares about the Roman world. Mary Beard, welcome to The David Frum Show. Mary Beard: Great to be with you, David. Frum: So it's the month of August as we record, a month that honors a Roman emperor dead more than 2,000 years. So this seems—not timely (that may not be the right word but apposite, appropriate. I know this is something you have warned about. Can we start by talking about that? I think that's what Rome has done for the West ever since it ceased to be Rome, really. It was there as a kind of way of judging yourself, comparing yourself, finding lessons. I mean, I don't see how anybody could live within United States politics and not constantly have half an eye on Rome. I mean, my issue is I want them to be better comparisons, better analogies, and I'm particularly allergic to the idea that somehow ancient Rome offers a kind of supermarket shelf from which we can pick whatever comparison is convenient to us at the time and somehow justify our own foolishness. Frum: Well, you are right about the American propensity, and the comparisons we like to make are often very moralistic ones. So if you think that the world is too licentious, you say, Aha, and then you scrabble through for some real or invented classical quotation that shows that licentiousness was the problem. If you think immigrants are the problem, again, scrabble through the ancient world for some ancient real or invented quotation. And we shouldn't be too self-flagellatory about this. I think, you know, we are not the first generation to have done this. You know, you go back to the 19th century, and you can find some of the vastest and most popular paintings in the whole of the Western world are both—well, they're a funny mixture of decrying and secretly celebrating Roman licentiousness. So, you know, this has been on the agenda for centuries. Well, the decrying, that's a favorite of tabloids and tabloid television on both sides of the Atlantic. Stay tuned for more shocking photographs of semi-clad women. We condemn these shocking, these semi-clad photographs, which we are about to show even more of after the break. I thought that we all sit there, tut-tut, and say how appalling it is that the Romans could have taken pleasure in the slaughtering of other human beings. And we get a certain sense of moral superiority. Now, you might say, But it's not real. But the boundary between seeing someone really decapitated and seeing someone decapitated so realistically that you don't know it's not real is a very odd one. Frum: Would you take a minute here? Could you just walk us through why those two things are different? When we talk about the fall of the republic, what we are talking about is the end of the sort of democratic society—and sort of is very much underlined there—under which Rome had lived and been governed by from about 500 B.C.E. And Caesar in taking over the state and essentially imposing—he was not actually emperor, but imposing some form, very briefly, of one-man rule is usually seen as the end of the republic when the institutions of popular power and control give way to what is never called a monarchy in Rome, but is essentially that. : That's when autocracy comes to rule in Rome rather than a power-sharing system you had before. The fall of the Roman empire is much more diffuse, much more hard to describe, much more hard to date, actually, and it is marked, in a sense, for many historians—but there are very many different ways of thinking about this—when the Roman empire, in terms of the territorial extent of the Roman empire, is no longer, in a sense, controlled centrally from Rome, but is split into different parts, is sometimes split into two with another capital at Constantinople in what is now Turkey. But there are all sorts of mini-capitals around, which is somehow breaking down the unity of the Roman empire as a political structure. You no longer always have a single emperor. There's a lot of snobbishness in Roman writers about the nouveau riche who are now running the show. Rome's boundaries, which had, for centuries, in a sense, been, not inviolable, but by and large with the most limited and very containable amounts of military struggle at the edges—they become more and more vulnerable. But it is a huge issue, which is really, really hard to describe, even, let alone to explain, but has—since [the British historian Edward] Gibbon and before Gibbon, with The [History of the] Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire—it has somehow been one of those historical big problems that we kind of want everybody to be able to say, Right. This is when the Roman Empire stopped being the Roman Empire, and this is why. The lack of virtue, by which he means not Christian behavior, because the Christians are the enemy in his book, but manly behavior, military behavior. And the Romans somehow become less military over time, and that's why the empire falls. But for Gibbon—and this has never been entirely overthrown as an idea, though it's been hugely complexified—for Gibbon, the Roman empire cannot sustain the revolution into Christianity. I want to take you through some of our most contemporary uses of Rome because I think a lot of us have these habits and they're unexamined, and they've actually become very intense in the United States in recent years. Historically, I think it's fair to say, traditionally, Roman comparisons are something that conservatives do because conservatives are worried about moral dissolution, and they appeal to Rome. And although I don't know that emperors ever really did eat grapes reclining on couches, that we have the sense of. But in recent times—the past two or three years—this is an argument that is spread up on the left. And this is an implicit comparison of unpopular politicians, particularly Donald Trump, to Roman emperors or to the Roman strongmen of the late republic, and say, Aha! What happened to the end of the Roman Republic, that's what's happening to us with Donald Trump. So we don't need to talk about Donald Trump, good or bad. Well, I think you're partly right, and I think that most people would follow you, David, in saying that if you think now about comparisons with Rome and the idea of Roman values, you'd think of it, by and large—not entirely, but by and large—as the rhetoric of conservative commentators. I think it was Marx who said that the French Revolution took place in Roman dress. So I don't think it's ever restricted to a particular political point of view. I think one of the things that is sort of startling to realize is the Romans—there's a dispute whether the Romans even had maps, whether they knew what their empire physically looked like. But we know they didn't have statistics. It's not clear they had a budget. It's not clear that the emperor knew how much revenue he had or how much he was spending. Or even whether policy, in our terms, was possible. Even whether a kind of sense of, Where do I want this polity that I'm governing to be in 10 years' time and how might I get there? That idea of prediction combined with action is something that we tend to retroject onto the Romans, and we imagine them in a hugely modernizing way. We imagine Nero sitting there and saying, Oh my goodness me. Is it a good idea to conquer the Parthians or not? But what you have is a vast knowledge deficit, a strategic-knowledge deficit, in Rome, which makes it completely different from us. Now, there are very smart scientists in the ancient world who try to envisage what the globe looks like. There are all kinds of gazetteer route maps, which say to you, Look—if you want to go from Rome to Constantinople, how do you do it? But if you say to many people, I think, in any time of ancient Roman history, who are living in, let's say, the Apennines, in the middle of Italy, Do you know you are living on a peninsula? And do you know how your landmass connects to the other landmasses, which you might be able to reach because you would follow the road, but how can you envisage what your geographical world is? Frum: It's like if you had Google Maps, the text function but not the visual function. But you don't have the picture that goes with it. Beard: You don't have the picture. And so how you envisage the world in which you operate is very, very hazy. Now, there are some maps—we do have one partly surviving city plan of the city of Rome. So it is not as if that sense of how you might envisage a geographical place in two dimensions—it's not as if that's completely unknown, but on the large scale, it is the “Google Maps without the picture” version that they're dealing with. And if you start to think about that and what difference it makes to your planning, even before you add in the problem about statistics, the problem about the economy—I mean, we are so used to ideas of the economy as an isolatable sphere of activity. Now, you will not find a more dogmatic opponent of price controls than me, but this is often cited, and there's a famous conservative book The Way the World Works, written in the late 1970s. It cites this control, this edict of Diocletian, as an example of what happens when you impose prices and how it goes wrong. And you wonder, Did anyone in the Roman world even know that the Emperor Diocletian had done this? Did Diocletian know what anything cost anywhere in the Roman world? Beard: A very few did know what Diocletian was doing. But like so many of the things that grab our attention about Rome, the price edict of Diocletian is so much more about a claim to power, to say, I can control this, rather than—he hasn't got a backroom of boffins wondering what the effect would be of putting the price of shoes up in Lydia, right? I mean, in a very simple way, we kind of think about roads as being built by the Romans for communication. And that does turn out to be one of the uses. Roads are also—well, they're partly about getting the army around. They're not about getting you and me on a convenient trip to Brindisi. I am putting a road across Germany. Frum: Let me ask you about barbarians. And were they immigrants in any way that we would recognize? Beard: Not in a way that we would recognize. I mean, I think that, you know, the concept of barbarism is a deeply problematic one. I identify others as barbarians, and they probably identify me as the barbarian, or whatever their word for it is. And I think we all ought to be careful before, as quite a few people do, we somehow think there is a sort of natural divide between barbarians and the, quote, “civilized world.” But I think that in Rome, it's even more complicated and fluid and fuzzy than that. First of all, Rome's unique selling point has always been—some people would say for better, some people would say for worse—an incorporative selling point. And some of those probably didn't look—for people like me, this is a rather cheering thing, but others have a different view—they wouldn't have come up with the same cultural baggage or looked like a Roman that was born and bred in Italy. But the other thing is that Romans are always quite consciously using barbarians. There isn't like what we see on our maps. We look at a map of the Roman empire at its greatest extent under Trajan, and there's a very neat line all around it. At the very most, what you find at the edge of the Roman empire, and even with Hadrian's Wall, I'd venture to say, it's almost universally kind of a set of border zones, where people kind of feel more or less included or more or less part of being Roman. By the time you get to the period when modern historians get very worried about the barbarians getting in, are a people who are kind of like Rome. The key example here is the Vandals in Vandal Africa—you know, poor things have given their name to a particular form of definitely barbaric behavior in the modern world—but if you go back to Vandal Africa in the 5th century C.E., what you discover: They're all talking Latin, and they're codifying Roman law and writing Latin poetry. Frum: Well, I want to ask you about a particular Roman trope or myth that I think has a lot of impact to this day on decisions we make, which is: Roman writers were aware that many of their favorite luxury goods—silks, perfumes—were imported from outside the empire. And they didn't always quite know what they were selling in return, but they did notice that the Roman empire had mines, and often, products from the mines flowed out to pay for the perfumes and the silks. And there's a literature of Romans complaining about this, blaming the women for it, that influences economic policy to this day, that Well, we give away our hard-earned, our hard-toiled gold and silver—which are obviously really valuable—for these worthless fripperies of silk and perfume. Beard: They're complicated origins, and the Romans were not entirely wrong to think that some wealth—some real, hard-earned wealth—was flowing outwards. A numismatist, a coin expert, once said to me—and this does sound too good to be true, literally, but I suspect it's not far from the case—that, leaving aside the museums in Italy itself, the museums in the world that are filled with most locally excavated Roman coins are museums in India. So there's millions in the British Museum, but they're acquired somewhere else. I think it goes back a very long way. in the republic had been really concerned that what was going to drag Rome down—and this was largely, they saw it, morally, but not always—was luxury. And one of their versions of understanding the Greek world in the eastern Mediterranean was to see it as a place where people had already been enervated by luxury, and it's also a very feminine luxury. And yes, both stink, but in different ways. Frum: I want to ask you about this. One of the things that I think is a mistake, that continues to have consequences towards our understanding of later periods in history, and what I always beseech people to understand is: Until the modern era, one of the great drivers of world economic activity was that China never produced enough silver to meet the demands of the Chinese economy. So China—and, to a lesser extent, India—they need silver, and they will give you anything. So all you have to do is go into the ground and get a rock of a certain color, and the Chinese will give you silks. They'll give you—the perfumes didn't come from China, but the silks came from China—and all they're asking in return are these rocks of which they don't produce nearly enough. And if you can get a silk for a rock, you are not being abused. But the motive of this is: This is not Roman (or in the 1600s, European) self-indulgence. It is China's desperate need for more silver to create a currency base. That China is the center of the story, and we're all living in their world and supplying their ultimate need for a cash economy. Beard: And, I mean, if you think about that importance of metal in Rome, one of the things I think it's very easy to forget is quite how important Spain was in the whole economy and geopolitics of the Roman empire because Spain was the absolute center of the mining industry. and a little bit earlier—Rome is getting its ore, its metal ore. And I think it's somehow, when we think of the Roman empire, we think of Rome itself. But in some ways, we ought to be thinking: Spain. And one of the most extraordinary, environmental scientific analyses done recently has been in the Arctic ice cap and taking long, deep bores into the Arctic ice cap. And what they claim—I have to believe what I'm told here—what it is claimed you can detect is the industrial pollution in the Arctic ice cap traceable to the mines in Spain. Beard: Yeah, not seen again for centuries. Frum: Can I ask you about diseases and climate changes? So there's an important book by a historian named Kyle Harper, whom I'll be talking to next month on a slightly different subject, who makes a very modern argument that Rome suffers two terrible rounds of plagues—one in the 200s and then again the 500s, the one in the 500s amplified by a sudden cooling of the Earth's climate. And that if you want to understand—I mean, the Romans are just living, like all premodern peoples, on their fingertips, on an often-unfriendly planet. And I think that people like Kyle Harper have, I think, very usefully put that back on the map so that now, when people think about the decline and fall of the Roman empire—although this had never been entirely out of the picture before, the idea that that there was, for start, devastating plague—most historians now, I think, even if they don't say, Oh, well, that's the answer, they think there's something much more significant about pandemic. And I'm afraid this got a huge boost over COVID, where people started really seriously to live through what it was like to live through plague. I mean, I think the problem is that we are still a bit kind of in hock to Gibbon's desires of saying, So what is the one thing that can help us see, explain, and pin on the history of the Roman empire too? And I'm afraid it's more complicated than either lead in the water pipes—which is what we used to be told—immigration, Christianity, or climate change. Frum: Let me round up by asking you about one more book, which I'm sure you've read. And for sure, I think it was very violent. We can see: The population collapses; people in Britain lose the ability to make, even, pottery; there's this great step backward—we're not supposed to call it “toward a more primitive culture.” We're supposed to call it a “more simple culture.” But I'm sorry—if you had a pot before, and you don't have a pot now, that's a real loss. Frum: But once you're through this traumatic event, there are historians who argue, a lot of what happens later in Europe is the good things happen. Unlike what happens in China, unlike what happens in India, when the empire is cracked, it never gets put back together again. And so you get a world of competing power centers. That has one consequence: It makes these competing power centers very good at war, compared to—these small European countries are able to beat the mighty Chinese empire when they encounter each other, because they've been fighting battles against each other for 500 years, and they've acquired a huge edge in being good at that. The Chinese don't have to be so good at it. But it also means a great gift for freedom, because if you're publishing something that your local king or ruler doesn't like, you can just go 20 miles across a border, and there's a king who doesn't care and maybe even welcomes you insulting the king 20 miles away. Beard: Yeah, I mean, I think we are very still under the thrall of the Roman empire. And even if we've been brought up as kind of left wing, anti-imperialist, there's still something about the Roman empire which we still half-think was a good thing. I mean, more people joined together in a single polity than ever before or since in Western Europe. And I think where you spot that, and I spot that even with very radical students, is in the adjectives we use about them. And I'm always struck by how people say things like Julius Caesar was the greatest Roman conqueror. And I say, Well, do you think conquerors are great then? And suddenly, the very feisty, lefty students, they've convicted themselves from their own mouth. So I think you've always got to be on the lookout for the way you have been brought up, sort of deep down, to think about that. But I think that in some ways, I'm a very bad person to ask this to, because when I was a student, when I was first really studying the, quote, “decline and fall of the Roman empire,” now, I was coming in at the first generation where what we were being told was, in a sense, what you've just said. Look—you know, it's decline in some people's book. But what happens to the way you understand that process if you say it was transformation or a revolutionary reimagining of the world, an atomization, a devolution of power? I mean, I don't think one can ever—you're never going to get a right answer here. And I often think when I look at some of the, in some ways, very fashionable works of art produced in what we used to call the Dark Ages, there was a sense always that people were saying, Look—these people can't do the Roman stuff anymore. And you almost want to say, That might be true, but what if they were just absolutely refusing to do it that way? What if this was a willed desire to see the human body differently, to represent the world differently? Frum: Well, there's a passage in Evelyn Waugh's novel Helena where the Emperor Constantine calls his artists together to ask them to build a triumphal arc just the way they did it in the olden days, 200 years before. That's just not how we do things anymore. You want to look like your great grandfather? Be our guest, but our modern vision—and Constantine says to them, Okay, I hear everything you say, but if you had to do it, could you do it? They all stare at their shoes and mumble No. And that's the double bind in which we are caught. And it was hugely influential on me, although I now find it very reparative—I remember watching when I was a teenager Kenneth Clark's famous series Civilization, which was probably more popular in the U.S. than it was in the U.K. And I remember watching the first episode of it, which had been kind of about the Dark Ages, and I still can see Clark standing there saying, Civilization survived only by the skin of its teeth. And we're all waiting for the Renaissance to come along. Frum: I had many professors in college, and after, who made a big impression on me, but there's one line from one professor—someone you may have known, Roberto Lopez, who was a great medievalist. But he had a saying, which was, History never repeats itself; it only appears to do so to those who don't pay attention to the details. And it was one of those things, you know, because I had a glib enough understanding of history at that phase in my academic career to be making comparisons all the time. And it was like a bucket of water in the face: Just stop doing this. Beard: I would like to come back with my favorite quote, which I heard much more recently, and it appeared to be entirely extemporary. I was doing a discussion with the Spanish novelist Antonio Muñoz Molina, and we were both on stage in Spain. And somebody in the audience at the Q&A said, What can we learn from history? We can think about things differently, but we have to be careful about drawing too many kinds of direct comparisons. And Antonio, when it came to him, he said what was totally obviously true. Beard: I thought, That put me in my place. Frum: And as this month of August reminds us, the Romans are news that stays news. I always wonder how many people are out there who date their whatevers—either July or August—without thinking, Ah, that's off to Julius Caesar and Augustus. We are still living under the star sign of Julius Caesar and Augustus. But I like to think of those emperors up there, you know? It's like this is Augustus's month, so we need to know a bit about him. And we need to know that as we cope with our modern problems, it's good to know about the past. As you say, it's all we've got. And when you're thinking about Donald Trump, you need to think about him in the American context. And while ancient comparisons can give you a literary motive, a literary inspiration, they don't really solve the problems, because the worlds are so very different. Beard: The question I'm most asked by anybody is which Roman emperor is Donald Trump most like. And to explain that can be fun as a parlor game, but actually, it's not going to get you anywhere, asking that question.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Dairy farms are often portrayed as quaint and bucolic. This was made painfully, tragically clear when last week, six workers — five adults and one teenager — were killed at a Colorado dairy farm 45 miles northeast of Denver. Four were part of an extended family, including a father and two sons. According to two unnamed dairy industry sources who spoke with Denver's ABC affiliate, a contractor working on an underground manure pit accidentally turned on a valve or pump that released hydrogen sulfide, a gas that is formed by decomposing animal manure. In an attempt to rescue him, five other workers at the farm, called Prospect Valley Dairy, entered the underground manure pit and met the same fate (a supervisor had reportedly warned them against doing so). Breathing in high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide can cause rapid unconsciousness and “nearly instant death,” according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is now investigating the Colorado deaths. Agriculture is already one of the most dangerous industries to work in, OSHA reports, and dairy work ranks among the most dangerous jobs within that sector. Yet farms aren't held to the same labor safety standards as other industries. Incidents like the recent Colorado tragedy aren't exactly uncommon on farms. Sometimes workers or farm family members fall into a manure pit, and others jump in to save them, creating a deadly and horrifying chain reaction, similar to what happened in Colorado. In 2007, methane — another toxic gas, separate from hydrogen sulfide — emanating from a pipe in a manure pit at a Virginia dairy killed four family members and one worker. A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us. And carveouts in labor regulations designed to benefit agribusiness make incidents like what happened in Colorado and elsewhere more likely to occur. OSHA's standards for “confined spaces” — spaces where workers perform certain tasks, sometimes dangerous ones, and have limited entries and exits — do not cover agriculture. And farms are exempt from requirements to train workers on air monitoring, emergency response, and safe rescue, according to Jordan Barab, a former OSHA official. A dairy industry veteran who's worked on a number of farms for almost two decades and spoke with me on condition of anonymity told me there are “no rules” on the big dairies he's worked, and little concern for safety. “OSHA goes on farms very rarely, they hardly do any inspections,” Debbie Berkowitz, who served as a chief of staff and senior policy adviser at OSHA under President Barack Obama, told me. These regulatory gaps amount to “agricultural exceptionalism” — a doctrine that characterizes US farming policy, allowing the agricultural industry to play by a different set of rules than other industries. Another example: In the US, you must be 18 years old to work a job deemed hazardous, but on farms, 16-year-olds are permitted to work these jobs; the teenager who died at the Colorado farm was just 17 years old. And because of exceptions passed by Congress, small farms are exempt from OSHA enforcement altogether. “The farm industry — through Big Ag, through their trade associations like the Farm Bureau — lobby extensively to prevent any worker safety requirements imposed to them by the government,” Berkowitz said. Until Congress recognizes these operations as highly dangerous workplaces and closes the agricultural industry's labor law exemptions — and better funds OSHA — more tragedies like what took place in Colorado are inevitable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The fact that a police department would hire an illegal alien and unlawfully issue him a firearm while on duty would be comical if it weren't so tragic,” an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said in a statement. But the Trump administration said a green light from E-Verify was not enough. “The Old Orchard Beach Police Department's reckless reliance on E-Verify to justify arming an illegal alien, Jon Luke Evans violates federal law, and does not absolve them of their failure to conduct basic background checks to verify legal status,” said Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. “I was very, very surprised by that,” said Alexandra LaCombe, who is a partner at the Fisher Phillips law firm and specializes in immigration law. “I counsel folks that we can rely on these systems. After starting as a pilot program under President Bill Clinton, E-Verify went nationwide in 2004 and got its name when President George W. Bush was still pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. The government should help employers make immigration background checks on job applicants more reliable, he said. “We can't ask our employers to verify somebody here unless we help them,” Bush said at a roundtable with business leaders. While comprehensive immigration reform fell apart in response to strong pushback from conservatives, the verification program was one measure to remain in place. Ten states have since made it mandatory for all or most employers, according to Equifax, but it continues to be optional for most private American companies. “E-Verify operates with speed and accuracy,” the site says. “E-Verify is the only free, fast, online service of its kind that electronically confirms an employee's information against millions of government records and provides results within as little as three to five seconds.” Employers have been relying on that promise to comply with immigration laws. “It doesn't eliminate all potential fraud and false IDs and things like that, but the employer should be safe in taking the government's word at its face that the person is authorized to work.” When federal agents conducted a high-profile raid on a meatpacking plant in Nebraska earlier this summer, the company that owns it also protested that it uses E-Verify. And you're raiding me because your system is broken?” said Glen Valley Foods President Chad Hartmann. “I was shocked to hear the federal government admit E-Verify doesn't work well enough to be reliable,” said Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Critics of E-Verify have been complaining for years that the system is more of a roadblock to legitimate workers than it is a deterrent to illegal immigration. That means employers must do more than simply putting information into the E-Verify database and crossing their fingers, according to an immigration attorney who says businesses need to be trained on how to spot fake driver's licenses and Social Security cards. “It's the employer's job to ensure that they're not accepting fraudulent documents, but they are not expected to be document detectives,” said Dawn Lurie, senior counsel on immigration law for Seyfarth Shaw LLP. Lunch bags left behind: The ICE raid in Nebraska that shocked officials and split families “You don't want to go overboard where you're potentially discriminating against someone (by) asking for more or different documents,” said Lurie. More than 98% of people checked by E-Verify during the most recent 12 months for which figures are available were confirmed to be eligible to work within 24 hours, the DHS says. Eligible workers in the US lost out on about 130,000 jobs over a 10-year period because they were incorrectly flagged by E-Verify, a 2017 Cato study based on government data estimated. False positives have dropped substantially since then, according to Lurie. “I will say E-Verify has improved tremendously in the past 10 years,” she said. But it would be impossible to substantially improve the program now without a national ID card with biometric information to prove your legal status, Nowrasteh argues – something he believes no one really wants. The system must be reauthorized every two years, but Republicans have regularly proposed making the program permanent and requiring all employers to use it. Americans aren't yet sure what to make of Trump's immigration crackdown “E-Verify is a proven, cost-effective way to ensure businesses are following our laws and a tool to deter illegal immigration,” Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa said when the latest version of the proposal was introduced in March. Similar bills in Texas – a state whose governor, Greg Abbott, has made illegal immigration such a cornerstone issue that he ordered saw blade-covered barricades placed in the Rio Grande to deter border crossings – have died in multiple sessions of the legislature. “Do you want to go to a restaurant and use paper plates because no one will wash dishes?” Bill Hammond asked. A CNN poll earlier this summer showed the percentage of people who believe Trump deportation efforts have gone “too far” rising by 10 points in five months. Nowrasteh – who opposes mass deportation of undocumented migrants – isn't concerned that E-Verify has problems. “The best thing about E-Verify is that it doesn't work well,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Dominique Thornhill tried to get a loan to launch a child-care center in 2020, every conventional bank she approached glanced at her thick business plan and slim finances, then turned her away. “I thought that's what small-business loans were supposed to support, but I didn't receive that support at all,” the former Pittsburgh-public-school teacher told me. “Instead, it was Come back to us when you're already established.” Five years later, Thornhill now runs three child-care locations—her ascent made possible by a little-known, federally backed lending program that President Donald Trump is trying to shut down. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, part of the Treasury Department, is under threat from Trump's Office of Management and Budget, even as Republicans and Democrats in Congress fight to ensure that its dollars continue to flow to communities where the traditional banking system is often out of reach. Behind the scenes, a power struggle has broken out. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has publicly defended CDFIs, while OMB, led by Russell Vought, has slammed their work as “anti-white” and representative of the kind of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies that Trump has pledged to root out of American life. A disproportionate share has flowed to rural areas—the kinds of places where Trump flags fly even when it's not campaign season. Read: Medicaid cuts will be a disaster for ERs The outcome could help determine how much power the White House has to block congressionally mandated spending, according to current and former Treasury Department officials I spoke with, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Is it the agency head that should be making these decisions? First launched more than three decades ago, the CDFI Fund had long enjoyed bipartisan support and sparked quiet but exponential growth in the community-banking sector. The fund supports grants, capital, and other forms of aid to local banks, credit unions, and similar lenders whose mission is community development rather than profit generation. Many of the government grants are paired with private-sector investments and donations. Invest PGH, the Pittsburgh-based CDFI that helped Thornhill start her child-care business, provided a $20,000 microloan at 3 percent interest, and a $25,000 forgivable loan. Trump's executive order calling for an end to such programs sparked a rush of group calls and text chains among leaders of many of the 1,400 CDFIs across the country, one former Treasury Department official told me. The following week, Bessent responded by telling OMB that the entire CDFI Fund was “performing its statutory functions as required by law,” suggesting that it would not be dismantled. In the ensuing months, Vought began publicly embracing a legally untested maneuver called a “pocket rescission,” which could allow the administration to overrule Congress and cancel billions of dollars in federal spending. (The Government Accountability Office has declared pocket rescissions illegal.) Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, told me that he and his colleagues have been trying to convince the administration of the important work being done by the CDFI Fund, including in Trump-friendly areas. For every federal dollar of investment, CDFIs generate $8 in private funds, he said, citing figures often touted by the Treasury Department and industry groups. “Treasury is still supportive of the funding going out,” Warner told me. “We've still got a hurdle to overcome at OMB.” Along with Republican Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, Warner sent a letter last month to Vought calling on OMB to release the funds that benefit “our most underserved rural and urban communities” and “deliver new capital to America's forgotten communities.” It was signed by 26 senators, including Republicans from states such as Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama. In a separate statement, Senator Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Republican, complained that “red tape” was keeping the funds from flowing to his state. “These funds have been approved for months, and every day they sit unused is a missed opportunity for communities that need them most,” he wrote. “The CDFI Fund has been used to funnel taxpayer money to politically connected, far-left activists who advance a radical and discriminatory DEI agenda,” an OMB spokesperson told me in a statement. “Many CDFI institutions espouse anti-white, anti-American, and even anti-capitalist rhetoric, in one case decrying a ‘white monopoly on capital.' The Treasury Department did not respond to my requests for comment. Donna Gambrell, who led the CDFI Fund from 2007 to 2013, told me she rarely had trouble persuading Republicans to support community banks. “Oftentimes, when I went to Congress as the CDFI Fund director, I could point to a map in a congressional leader's office, and his or her district would be shown on that map, and I would be able to point out the actual projects that were happening in their districts because of CDFIs,” said Gambrell, who is now the executive director of Appalachian Community Capital, a nonprofit CDFI. Today, such a map would show the program's funds flowing disproportionately to red states. In rural areas, that often means providing banking services to communities and clients for whom major banks are far away or unavailable. But many CDFIs in urban areas explicitly tout the support they provide to minority populations, which have traditionally suffered from discriminatory lending practices. Invest PGH, for example, celebrates the fact that 84 percent of its forgivable loans for new child-care businesses have gone to women- and minority-owned enterprises. Thornhill, who is Black, said she was motivated to start a day care in part because she wanted to provide a culturally sensitive learning environment for Black and brown students in the Pittsburgh area. Read: Why the White House backed down from its first big education cuts Trump officials—who have complained without evidence that his supporters have routinely been “debanked” because of their political beliefs—have been open about their goal of blocking such diversity measures and remaking community banking into a more partisan exercise. Trump's 2026 budget proposal suggests canceling $296 million from the CDFI Fund's discretionary-grant program and replacing it with a $100 million “Rural Finance Award Program” to “spur economic development in rural America.” The proposal accuses the CDFI Fund of supporting grantees who focused too much on race and “framed American society as inherently oppressive rather than fostering unity.” That plan has received a chilly reception in Congress, where Warner told me the bipartisan caucus he formed with Crapo in 2022 to back CDFIs has grown to 28 members. “It's an even number of Democrats and Republicans,” he said. “They're going to say: If your application says DEI or anything that is racially oriented, take it out,” the former official said. “People are afraid that it's not going to exist.” In the five years since she launched her first child-care facility, known as Each One Teach One Childcare and Learning Center, she has hired 45 people to staff its three locations. When we spoke recently, she was taking her students to see a new bus that she had purchased to pick them up from their homes and drop them off at the end of the day. Rebecca Davidson-Wagner, the president of Invest PGH, the Pittsburgh-based CDFI that helped Thornhill, touts Thornhill as a success story showcasing how CDFIs can provide transformative assistance to nontraditional borrowers. She told me she is eager to offer more loans to aspiring business owners but isn't sure that will be possible if the White House permanently blocks the grant money. “If they don't release the funding that's out there, we're going to have to make decisions about whether we can continue as a CDFI,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you follow the Mississippi River to where it meets the ocean, you will be in Plaquemines, Louisiana's southernmost parish. Known for its seafood and offshore oil and gas, Plaquemines is also where an unknown rose withstood the brutal force of Hurricane Katrina. The genesis of this climbing rose bush, which becomes covered with delicate bursts of pink flowers every spring, is still murky. “In 1989, it was given to me by a friend,” Martin said of the rose. That friend told Martin she received the flower from her mother-in-law, and though Martin has spent years researching and traveling trying to find out its true origin, the plant's lineage beyond that remains a mystery. But we can't find out … positively,” she told CNN. Martin said it was the only one among 450 antique roses in her garden to have made it through the storm. Dr. William C. Welch, professor and extension landscape horticulturist emeritus at Texas A&M University and author of several books on antique roses and heirloom gardening, was also unable to identify the rose when he examined it while visiting the area to speak at a New Orleans Old Garden Rose Society gathering in 2003. He took cuttings from Martin's home and began growing the flower at his own property before eventually becoming entwined in its broader post-Katrina path. The plant's miraculous feat of survival may seem as enigmatic as its ancestry, but the two are likely connected, according to Welch's colleague Dr. Greg Grant, the Smith County horticulturist for Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service. “It's all about genetics, because it's just from really, really tough genetic stock,” said Grant, who with Welch also cowrote “The Rose Rustlers,” which features Martin's story. “There's no way to say specifically why that exact specimen survived, but it really does have to do with genetics.” These varieties tend to have a reputation for being fussy, requiring constant attention. And a lot of that has been breeding; to breed these perfect flowers, but they bred out characteristics that made the rose easy to grow in our backyards,” said Mike Shoup, president of the Heritage Rose Foundation and author of “Empress of the Garden.” It has endured thousands of pests and thousands of … problems, and it still is considered man's favorite flower,” Shoup added. Martin's many rose plants had their grit tested after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005, near Grand Isle, Louisiana, about 28 miles (45 kilometers) south of her home in Phoenix. Martin and her husband, MJ, were no strangers to evacuating when a hurricane approached. The water remained, unable to escape, until a levee was broken. Martin's parents, Rosalie and Pivon Dupuy — who lived next to the couple and chose not to evacuate — died amid the storm's destruction. She remembers the ruins as “black sticks and gray ash.” And then as I was walking past my mother's house and to the back where our house was, I saw these long, green, dark canes hanging off the tractor shed.” Charles Shi, a botanical horticulturalist specializing in wild roses at Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in the United Kingdom said the sturdy plant is likely “an heirloom rambler with broad climatic tolerance.” The mystery flower is not a modern hybrid tea rose, “but closer in character to old climbing roses and hardy species relatives,” Shi said. Shi hasn't studied Martin's rose but said he is confident based on the flower's appearance that it has “an amount” of Rosa banksiae in its genes, referring to a species collected from China in the early 1800s and brought to Kew. Rosa banksiae is now a yellow climbing rose popular among gardeners. “You can see the petal structure is quite similar. So another word we call that are the heirloom roses, so bred relatively early on before the mass breeding of roses.” Most likely, he said it was a “chance seedling” that originated in a garden. He identified three traits that could have helped such a specimen survive the ravages of Katrina: a rugged nature and a low-oxygen metabolism that allowed it to rely on stored reserves of sugars; an ability to cope with salt stress from being inundated with seawater — either by excluding salts at the roots or compartmentalizing them inside its cells; and the ability to quickly regenerate, rapidly resprouting buds and forming roots from its existing stems. It is difficult to establish with certainty exactly how many days the rose remained submerged. The estimated range is “anywhere from two weeks to a month after Katrina” said Matt Rowe, spokesman for New Orleans district Army Corps of Engineers, who noted the deluge likely could have included a mix of rain, storm surge from the nearby ocean and water from the wetlands. Unwatered is a term used by the Army Corps of Engineers to describe the removal of water where it shouldn't be. “I was adamant about getting these roses out on the market,” Welch said. “He said, do I have your permission to name this rose the Peggy Martin rose?” Martin recalled about her conversation with Welch. “You know, at that time, I'm like a zombie. “I started being asked to speak, and I traveled all over this country for quite a few years,” she said. Makes me feel so good that everybody loves it.” Now some 20 years later, the rose that withstood the brutal force of Hurricane Katrina has become a fixture in gardens and a symbol of strength and resilience. There is even a hashtag — #ShowUsYourPeggy — where owners of the rose display their blooms. “I considered it to be the great beginners rose, because anybody that bought that rose from us was going to be successful,” he said. “And that's not always the case when you're buying roses.” A local nursery in Dothan, Alabama, did an Instagram live in spring of 2020 about the Peggy Martin rose, capturing a lot of attention during a critical time for the garden center — as Covid-19 lockdowns were starting and their biggest sales quarter seemed in jeopardy. After the post, “we started getting all these messages about — do you have a Peggy Martin?” said John David Boone, owner of Dothan Nurseries Greenhouse, Gardens and Gifts. Boone's nursery continued to sell the rose, and due to its popularity, it began hosting an annual “Peggy Palooza.” He said around “a couple thousand people” attended the weeklong event in April. Scientists traced roses' thorny origins and solved a 400 million-year-old mystery While it's hard to pin down exactly how many roses that bear the name “Peggy Martin” currently exist — Grant estimates there could be anywhere from hundreds of thousands to millions — all of them started as cuttings Welch took from Martin's garden. “The spring boom is one that is awe-inspiring, and that's why it has gained a lot of popularity,” and a significant internet presence, he added. While theories about the Peggy Martin plant's origins continue to swirl, uncovering the original name of the rose before it was lost to commerce will continue to prove difficult, Shoup said. And the only thing we can compare it to are other roses that are also out in the industry right now, and there has not been one that … matches up with her.” CNN's Katie Hunt contributed reporting to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Transgender bathroom policies and their precipitating controversies in two Virginia public school districts are taking center stage in the contentious gubernatorial faceoff between GOP Lt. Gov. The school policy in Arlington County, an affluent northern Virginia area, allowed a serial sex offender, who identifies as transgender, to access the girls' locker rooms repeatedly and allegedly expose himself to children. In neighboring Loudoun County, the school district's transgender policy led to a female student secretly filming three male classmates inside the boys' locker room. Amid recent outcry over both incidents, Earle-Sears appeared at protests last week in support of concerned parents opposing the counties' transgender policies, a move that could shake up the governor's race as this crucial issue captures attention from all corners of the commonwealth. 58-year-old Richard Kenneth Cox, a transgender felon from Alexandria, Virginia, was charged with exposing his genitals inside the girls' locker rooms at Washington-Liberty High School and Wakefield High School, both of which house publicly accessible pools managed by Arlington Public Schools. APS's non-discrimination policy permits open usage of sex-segregated school facilities depending on self-declared gender identity. In a string of offenses from June to December 2024, Cox allegedly flashed women and children on multiple occasions in the high school girls' locker rooms. According to court documents, in one instance, a mother and her five-year-old child had seen Cox standing in a shower stall with his erect penis out at the Washington-Liberty aquatics center. For context on everything happening in Arlington County, Virginia tonight: The school board allowed this man, who was a convicted sex offender, to use a high school girl's locker room because he claimed he was trans. A parent told WJLA-TV that she previously warned the Washington-Liberty pool director about Cox after her nine-year-old daughter had witnessed him fully naked in the girls' locker room on Sept. 9. Cox, who was once on the state's most wanted list, has a lengthy criminal history of preying upon children. In 2007, Cox was convicted on child pornography charges for possessing obscene material depicting the sexual abuse of children. VADOC MOST WANTED:  Richard Kenneth Cox is a registered sex offender from Alexandria, VA with outstanding warrants. In a districtwide message addressing the Cox case, Superintendent Dr. Francisco Durán said, “Arlington Public Schools will continue to foster an inclusive community for all, including those who identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community.” “APS is responsible for ignoring verbal complaints [about Cox],” the mother said. This month, Loudoun County Public Schools suspended two boys on Title IX sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination charges after a female student illicitly filmed them changing clothes while discussing among themselves being uncomfortable with her using the boys' locker room. Both boys will be high school juniors this fall, which is when students that age typically start applying for colleges. A state-level investigation scrutinizing how the school system handled the case found “troubling evidence” of Title IX abuses, unlawful retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, and suppression of student expression. “At no time would LCPS suspend a student simply because they express discomfort,” an LPS public information officer told the Washington Examiner in a follow-up statement. And punishing young men for speaking up about their discomfort is not normal. There, she said schools should not be weaponizing Title IX against students who don't want to share private spaces with members of the opposite sex. “I cannot believe that this is what we're finding in America,” said Earle-Sears. “And with me as governor, it's not going to continue. APS and LCPS are two of five northern Virginia school districts refusing to scrap their respective transgender policies, which permit access to school facilities on the basis of gender identity, not biology. In July, the U.S. Department of Education determined that LCPS, APS, Fairfax County Public Schools, Prince William County Public Schools, and Alexandria City Public Schools are all violating Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded educational programs. “By refusing to reverse your reckless policies, you are failing our daughters and risking losing millions of dollars in funding our children,” Earle-Sears told the APS school board Thursday. Abigail Spanberger supports the radical Loudoun School Board's push to allow boys in girls' bathrooms and locker rooms.If she cared about Virginia's parents or daughters, she'd reject this insanity and the extremists endangering our kids. That week, Earle-Sears also aired an ad targeting Spanberger's past pro-transgender stance. The off-year fight for Virginia's governorship is, so far, shaping up to be a backlash election that could return state power to Democrats after Republicans secured control of Congress and the presidency in 2024. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) win in 2021, several Virginia-based parental rights advocates told the Washington Examiner. “Governor Youngkin won in 2021 because Democrats deluded themselves into believing they could ignore parents while pushing radical leftist identity politics,” said Virginia parent Jessica Anderson, president of the Sentinel Action Fund, a right-wing super PAC aimed at growing the Republican majority. Anderson said she expects Democrats to similarly suffer at the ballot box in Virginia and into the 2026 midterms should they continue to push gender ideology. “It doesn't seem like they've learned any lessons since then. Democrats have doubled down on indoctrinating children in classrooms and refusing to protect private spaces like bathrooms and locker rooms,” Anderson told the Washington Examiner. “Virginia parents want leaders who will keep fighting the insanity they see in schools, and Winsome Sears has demonstrated she will be that champion.”[‘;p On the 2021 campaign trail, Youngkin garnered widespread support from parents, a key voting bloc, who opposed critical race theory teachings in Virginia classrooms. “Parents are tired of schools prioritizing gender ideology in policy decisions over student safety, privacy, and parental involvement.” Sarah Parshall Perry, vice president and legal fellow at Defending Education, noted that gender ideology has become a lightning rod in schools across the country. “Recent protests in Arlington and Loudoun counties have brought scrutiny to local politics, and in fact, to the perspectives of trans evangelists themselves,” Perry said, citing a sign brandished by a liberal protester at the APS school board meeting. The sign, directed at Earle-Sears, said, “Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then blacks can't share my water fountain.” In response to the racially charged sign, which made national headlines, Earle-Sears said, “This is the ‘tolerant' left Abigail Spanberger defends.” Perry pointed to Earle-Sears gaining on Spanberger in the polls. “The notion of ‘transgender rights' has Americans—and Virginians—utterly fed up with political pandering, pseudo-science, and victim hierarchies,” Perry said. The Washington Examiner contacted Earle-Sears' and Spanberger's campaigns for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Transgender bathroom policies and their precipitating controversies in two Virginia public school districts are taking center stage in the contentious gubernatorial faceoff between GOP Lt. Gov. The school policy in Arlington County, an affluent northern Virginia area, allowed a serial sex offender, who identifies as transgender, to access the girls' locker rooms repeatedly and allegedly expose himself to children. In neighboring Loudoun County, the school district's transgender policy led to a female student secretly filming three male classmates inside the boys' locker room. Amid recent outcry over both incidents, Earle-Sears appeared at protests last week in support of concerned parents opposing the counties' transgender policies, a move that could shake up the gubernatorial race as this crucial issue captures attention from all corners of the commonwealth. Fifty-eight-year-old Richard Kenneth Cox, a transgender felon from Alexandria, Virginia, was charged with exposing his genitals inside the girls' locker rooms at Washington-Liberty High School and Wakefield High School, both of which house publicly accessible pools managed by Arlington Public Schools. APS's nondiscrimination policy permits open usage of sex-segregated school facilities depending on self-declared gender identity. In a string of offenses from June to December 2024, Cox allegedly flashed women and children on multiple occasions in the high school girls' locker rooms. According to court documents, in one instance, a mother and her 5-year-old child had seen Cox standing in a shower stall with his erect penis out at the Washington-Liberty aquatics center. For context on everything happening in Arlington County, Virginia tonight: The school board allowed this man, who was a convicted sex offender, to use a high school girl's locker room because he claimed he was trans. A parent told WJLA-TV that she previously warned the Washington-Liberty pool director about Cox after her 9-year-old daughter had witnessed him fully naked in the girls' locker room on Sept. 9. Cox, who was once on the state's most wanted list, has a lengthy criminal history of preying upon children. In 2007, Cox was convicted on child pornography charges for possessing obscene material depicting the sexual abuse of children. VADOC MOST WANTED:  Richard Kenneth Cox is a registered sex offender from Alexandria, VA with outstanding warrants. In a districtwide message addressing the Cox case, Superintendent Dr. Francisco Duran said, “Arlington Public Schools will continue to foster an inclusive community for all, including those who identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community.” At a monthly APS school board meeting on Thursday, one mother lamented her young daughter having to change next to a naked Cox. “APS is responsible for ignoring verbal complaints [about Cox],” the mother said. This month, Loudoun County Public Schools suspended two boys on Title IX sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination charges after a female student illicitly filmed them changing clothes while discussing among themselves being uncomfortable with her using the boys' locker room. Both boys will be high school juniors this fall, which is when students that age typically start applying for colleges. A state-level investigation scrutinizing how the school system handled the case found “troubling evidence” of Title IX abuses, unlawful retaliation, viewpoint discrimination, and suppression of student expression. “At no time would LCPS suspend a student simply because they express discomfort,” an LPS public information officer told the Washington Examiner in a follow-up statement. And punishing young men for speaking up about their discomfort is not normal. There, she said schools should not be weaponizing Title IX against students who don't want to share private spaces with members of the opposite sex. “I cannot believe that this is what we're finding in America,” Earle-Sears said. “And with me as governor, it's not going to continue. APS and LCPS are two of five northern Virginia school districts refusing to scrap their respective transgender policies, which permit access to school facilities on the basis of gender identity, not biology. In July, the U.S. Department of Education determined that LCPS, APS, Fairfax County Public Schools, Prince William County Public Schools, and Alexandria City Public Schools are all violating Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded educational programs. “By refusing to reverse your reckless policies, you are failing our daughters and risking losing millions of dollars in funding our children,” Earle-Sears told the APS school board Thursday. Abigail Spanberger supports the radical Loudoun School Board's push to allow boys in girls' bathrooms and locker rooms.If she cared about Virginia's parents or daughters, she'd reject this insanity and the extremists endangering our kids. That week, Earle-Sears also aired an ad targeting Spanberger's past pro-transgender stance. The off-year fight for Virginia's governorship is, so far, shaping up to be a backlash election that could return state power to Democrats after Republicans secured control of Congress and the presidency in 2024. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) win in 2021, several Virginia-based parental rights advocates told the Washington Examiner. “Governor Youngkin won in 2021 because Democrats deluded themselves into believing they could ignore parents while pushing radical leftist identity politics,” said Virginia parent Jessica Anderson, president of the Sentinel Action Fund, a right-wing super PAC aimed at growing the Republican majority. Anderson said she expects Democrats to suffer similarly at the ballot box in Virginia and into the 2026 midterm elections should they continue to push gender ideology. “It doesn't seem like they've learned any lessons since then. Democrats have doubled down on indoctrinating children in classrooms and refusing to protect private spaces like bathrooms and locker rooms,” Anderson told the Washington Examiner. “Virginia parents want leaders who will keep fighting the insanity they see in schools, and Winsome Sears has demonstrated she will be that champion.” On the 2021 campaign trail, Youngkin received widespread support from parents, a key voting bloc, who opposed critical race theory teachings in Virginia classrooms. “Parents are tired of schools prioritizing gender ideology in policy decisions over student safety, privacy, and parental involvement.” Sarah Parshall Perry, vice president and legal fellow at Defending Education, noted that gender ideology has become a lightning rod in schools across the country. “Recent protests in Arlington and Loudoun counties have brought scrutiny to local politics, and in fact, to the perspectives of trans evangelists themselves,” Perry said, citing a sign brandished by a liberal protester at the APS school board meeting. The sign, directed at Earle-Sears, said, “Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then blacks can't share my water fountain.” In response to the racially charged sign, which made national headlines, Earle-Sears said, “This is the ‘tolerant' left Abigail Spanberger defends.” Perry pointed to Earle-Sears gaining on Spanberger in the polls. The Washington Examiner contacted Earle-Sears's and Spanberger's campaigns for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Menendez, 58, the wife of disgraced former New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, had an integral part in her husband's deals and schemes, according to federal prosecutors. She was convicted for her crimes in April, a year after her husband was found guilty, the Associated Press reported. The former senator had been under investigation for years over suspicions of corruption. In October 2023, then-Sen. Bob Menendez was charged with providing “sensitive U.S. Government information and [taking] other steps that secretly aided the Government of Egypt” and not registering as an “agent of a foreign government.” In 2024, federal prosecutors charged Bob Menendez with using his influence as a senator to help the government of Qatar with questionable real estate development deals in exchange for lavish gifts and other bribes. “The defendant's extensive, deliberate, and exceedingly serious criminal conduct calls out for a substantial sentence,” federal prosecutors said. “She corruptly agreed and promised that her boyfriend and then husband, a United States Senator, would use his power and his office to secretly act on behalf of the people who were lining their pockets.” The senator's wife also prospered through corrupt promises to “influence national security and foreign relations” by assuring her husband's support for billions of dollars in military aid to Egypt, according to the Associated Press. “Despite all of the Government's efforts to present her as a vixen, the reality is far from that,” Nadine Menendez's lawyer asserted. An extended sentence is not warranted, needed, or appropriate under these circumstances.” Still, federal prosecutors maintain that she played a vital role in Bob Menendez's corruption and deserves punishment accordingly.</p>
