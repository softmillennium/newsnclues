                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An invasion of small metallic orbs has been spotted hovering over the US in recent years, leaving the Pentagon scrambling to identify these mysterious UFOs. A new report from the crowdsourced platform Enigma, which allows people to report sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), reveals more than 8,000 sightings across the US between December 2022 and June 2025. Among these, 422 reports specifically describe metallic orbs, with the majority observed between 1am and 4am near military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. Eyewitnesses, including civilians, pilots, and military personnel, reported seeing the spheres hover silently before moving at extreme speeds, leaving no trace of their departure. Some of the sightings have been captured on video or radar, though many remain unexplained. 'I was walking into work when I looked up and saw two metallic liquid-like objects hovering for about two minutes,' said one witness over Brooklyn's Fort Hamilton in June 2024. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has been charged with investigating claims of UFOs and has dismissed many as natural phenomena like flocks of birds, conventional aircraft, drones, balloons, or other explainable objects. However, some cases have remained unsolved, reportedly due to a lack of data. Moreover, these tiny craft have apparently been visiting our skies for decades, with pilots during World War II reporting similar orbs over the skies of Europe. Enigma revealed that more than 360 'metallic orb' reports took place within a few miles of military bases here on US soil. These mystery orb sightings include one shocking encounter revealed by Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, the former director of AARO, which was captured on a MQ-9 Reaper drone's camera in the Middle East in 2022. Some theories have suggested these orbs could be surveillance devices from foreign powers like China or Russia. This theory exploded into rampant paranoia last year, when countless drones were spotted flying over the East Coast, including over key military sites and President Trump's property in New Jersey. As for Enigma's report, many of the orb sightings have been concentrated in Texas and Florida. In fact, visitors at Disney World's Epcot in Florida got an unexpected sight this month, when a glowing orb appeared over the amusement park. The 'Buga Sphere' has become a major topic of discussion among UFO researchers, with scientists claiming the object contains a maze of fiber-optic wires that suggest it can send and receive signals. Scientists suggested this was proof that the object produced some kind of energy field, but researchers had not attempted to forcibly cut the object open so far. The sphere has since been taken to Mexico for further analysis.</p>

This week, yet another restaurant boldly moved into 598 Guerrero St. in San Francisco, despite the Mission District location's many years of proving how cursed it is. (At the time of that departure, owner Aaron London told Eater, “It just never really hit the mass appeal to make that model make sense.”) This week, yet another restaurant boldly moved into 598 Guerrero St. in San Francisco, despite the Mission District location's many years of proving how cursed it is. (At the time of that departure, owner Aaron London told Eater, “It just never really hit the mass appeal to make that model make sense.”) Remarkably, AL's Deli wasn't even the shortest-lived restaurant to occupy 598 Guerrero. That honor belongs to Ebb & Flow, which lasted just six months in 2010. The location's longest restaurant success story was Izakaya Yuzuki, which endured from 2011 to 2019. The sheer number of restaurants that have tried and failed to make this spot work belies good sense. Situated opposite Tartine's always bustling original location, and a short walk from Delfina, Bi-Rite and other popular neighborhood spots, the repeated failures at 598 Guerrero have been perplexing. (Just a few doors down, Faye's has been going strong since 1998.) Handroll Project was a usually busy sushi joint that I believed would break the spell. I wasn't the first to think a restaurant could actually survive there. Writing about Izakaya Yuzuki for the San Francisco Chronicle in 2017, Chris Ying remained idealistic: “It turns out there are no cursed restaurants. While claims of a curse have long been pooh-poohed by skeptics (and optimistic new tenants), the answer might be just as strange as rumored. It turns out that, all the way back in 1889, 598 Guerrero was occupied by a “trance medium” and fortune teller by the name of Mrs. C. Mayo-Steers. Mayo-Steers held healing circles (“skeptics invited”), “psychometric readings,” “psychic delineations,” and claimed to provide “diagnosis of diseases.” For at least 15 years, Mayo-Steers operated out of locations all over San Francisco — Turk, Market, Oak, Grove, 24th and 17th Streets included — but 598 Guerrero was where she communed with spirits in daily “sittings,” at least for a time. As a member of the Progressive Mediums' Society, Mayo-Steers was well known in Victorian San Francisco's spookier society corners, once speaking at a meeting for Progressive Spiritualists in 1889 and appearing at the State Spiritualist Convention of 1896. In work along New Thought and psychic lines, our city is wide awake.” One employee even claimed to see a long-haired apparition in the basement break room. “It's just too crazy,” restaurant partner Geoffrey Lee said at the time. Some observers at the time attributed the paranormal activity to an incident in 2003, just three months after Central American bistro Platanos had moved into 598 Guerrero. After leaving work late one night, Platanos' executive chef Carlos Perez got into an altercation and died on Valencia near 22nd. However, Platanos' co-owner Lisa Lazarus told the newspaper, “I just saw him in the casket [and] this was not a guy hit with a couple of blows and then stopped breathing … He was beaten to death.” Lazarus sold Platanos to a new owner, Pascal Rigo, in September 2005. Nine months later, the Chronicle's Michael Bauer wrote: “The food has now taken an even more delectable turn, and customers are returning.” Within a year, Platanos was gone. That year, Hoegeman advertised the availability of a beverage at his joint called New Crow, marketed as “the California drink that makes YOU FORGET prohibition.” On Sept. 29, 1922, 598 Guerrero was raided by federal prohibition agents who hit venues all over the Mission that night. The speakeasy was forcibly closed for violating alcohol laws, and its operators at the time, Peter Jacobs and Jack Warren — as well as building owner Ellen Boardman — were charged in abatement suits by Assistant United States Attorney Garton D.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Hampshire is famous for two incidents in the 1960s involving UFOs. One is known as The Exeter Incident, when a hitchhiker and other witnesses say they saw a large flashing object in the sky. Another supposedly took place in the North Country, where Barney and Betty Hill of Portsmouth say they were abducted by aliens. The podcast is now being developed for a feature film with Demi Moore and Colman Domingo. This Thursday, he will be talking about the podcast and its transition to the big screen at Stratham's Wiggin Memorial Library. He spoke with NHPR's Rick Ganley about why the Hills' experience fascinates people to this day. Some people are familiar with the Hill story, but I just learned some Granite Staters don't know about this incident at all. Remind us who Betty and Barney Hill were. So Betty and Barney Hill were an interracial couple who lived in Portsmouth. They had gone to Niagara Falls, Toronto, Montreal. On their way back from Montreal, they passed across the border near Colebrook and ended up driving through Franconia Notch on their way back to Portsmouth. So it's interesting, at first they remembered seeing a UFO in a couple of different places in Franconia Notch and then further down by Indian Head. And it wasn't until a couple of years later when they underwent hypnosis with this psychiatrist, Doctor Benjamin Simon, down in Boston – he put them through regression, hypnosis. And Betty in particular, but Barney as well, suddenly had these memories of being sort of deflected off of the road that they were on, driving down a side road, running into a group of aliens brought aboard a flying saucer and subjected to medical exams before being returned and then continuing on their drive. So they didn't really know about that part of it for another two and a half years. But I think one of the reasons why this story has so much staying power is that there's not an easy answer to that question of what happened. In my podcast, I lay out several different factors that could have contributed to the overall sense that it had happened. People have pointed out that Jupiter was very bright. They [drove] through Franconia Notch – there's a light on top of Cannon Mountain. I don't think they were actually abducted by aliens. Why do you think these stories of UFOs have such a hold on us? The Betty and Barney Hill story – one of the things I think is really interesting about that is that it has really been sort of the template for alien abduction stories going forward. It's a lot of being taken from places that are fairly remote. The modern UFO age started in 1947 basically with a famed sighting up in Washington state, and then the Roswell supposed crash. After World War Two with the atomic bomb and other things that were going on technologically and people trying to come to terms with that, and then also desiring a sense of wonder and sort of melding those two together with the idea that these things with great technology – technology beyond our understanding – are coming to visit and ponder that there's more to the universe than what we encounter in our daily lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There were conspiracy theories about the weirdest things: Barack Obama's birth certificate, the existence of a deep state that secretly controls the federal government, Donald Trump's supposed fight against a Satanic group of child molesters. Those days are over, if they ever existed.

There were conspiracy theories about the weirdest things: Barack Obama's birth certificate, the existence of a deep state that secretly controls the federal government, Donald Trump's supposed fight against a Satanic group of child molesters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But maybe we just need to approach the search for technosignatures differently. Maybe aliens have no interest in phoning Earth, and would rather transmit message to their own probes orbiting nearby planets. Whether aliens have any desire to explore space like we do is unknown. But it is hard to believe that (if anything remotely like us exists out in the cosmos) there wouldn't be at least one form of intelligent life that would want to see what lies beyond their home turf. Whether they whiz through the void in flying saucers or starships is debatable, but they might be sending and receiving signals from their own contraptions launched into space to explore their cosmic neighborhoods—much like we do. Fan wanted to know what a hypothetical observer from a distant planet would see through their hypothetical telescope if they were tracking transmissions to and from Earth. Others, like Mars, would not block them completely—and aliens should be able to catch that. Planetary conjunctions, when two planets directly align with one another in orbit, are ideal opportunities for this. “In the case of Mars, we find a species that is able to observe the Solar System for radio emission during an Earth-Mars conjunction in the past twenty years would have had a 77% chance of observing during one of our transmissions,” Fan said in a study recently published in The Astrophysical Journal. Operated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Deep Space Network consists of three ground-based facilities in California, Spain and Australia that are capable of two-way communication with spacecraft, sending commands and receiving information. These sites were strategically chosen so there are no interruptions to communication as Earth rotates. If a spacecraft ventures too far for one site to pick up what it is doing, another site can easily receive the signal and continue communications. By poring through DSN logs, Fan and his research team were able to connect their findings to the location of a spacecraft or space telescope at a specific time so they could figure out when and in what direction radio communications were beamed from Earth. Most radio signals were aimed at spacecraft on or near Mars (which should hardly be a surprise, with all the attention the planet has been awarded since Perseverance and Ingenuity landed in 2021). If we switch around the point of view and position ourselves as observers, there should be some planets between which we have an especially high chance of intercepting transmissions. Fan is confident his research prioritizes which objects to look out for. “Our analysis underscores the value of using humanity's own DSN as a model for how an early-phase spacefaring civilization might transmit and how we might detect it.” Whether the planets we end up focusing on for SETI investigations will be the planets with other creatures on them is unknown.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pennsylvania paranormal writer Maxim Furek was supposed to interview Dan Rivera, the primary handler of the supposedly possessed Annabelle doll, on July 14. Furek later learned that Rivera, 54, passed away unexpectedly at his Gettysburg hotel room on July 13, the day before the interview was scheduled to take place. Although Furek did see Rivera in Gettysburg that weekend and discuss shared connections, including the fact that they both knew paranormal pioneers Ed and Lorraine Warren, Furek wanted to do more than just talk. That book, “The Smurl Haunting: When Ed and Lorraine Came to Town,” was published this month. What I believe the number was 1,240 people over two days, paying $40 a piece,” said Furek of the number of people who were in Gettysburg to see the doll for themselves. The paranormal community is divided over how the doll should be handled and if it should go on tour at all. Some believe that it never should have left the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut. There is also controversy because the home has recently been purchased by comedian Matt Rife and Elton Castee, who hunt ghosts and post videos about it on YouTube. When Furek saw the doll in Gettysburg, he said it was kept in a wooden box with a glass window that allowed people to view it. The box features three crosses etched into it, representing the Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. “There are a lot of people in the paranormal community who believe there was a demonic presence that caused the death of Dan Rivera,” Furek said. The tour began in May of 2025 and made its way through spooky places in West Virginia, Texas, and Louisiana. Some strange and suspicious incidents were reported in cities where the Annabelle doll was on tour, including Gettysburg. A few days after Annabelle arrived in New Orleans, the 165-year-old Nottoway Plantation, located nearby in White Castle, Louisiana, caught fire and was destroyed, sparking online conspiracy theories. Other unusual events also occurred, such as a statewide 911 outage that happened while Annabelle was in Pennsylvania. “You want to call it a strange coincidence,” Furek said. “That's fine, but I mean, it seems that there are too many strange things happening surrounding this Annabelle doll that looks like Raggedy Ann, so I certainly can't explain it. Others believe that bad luck can sometimes be a matter of chance. “Once you start a string of power of suggestion like that, it's human nature to string it all together,” said Patrick, a paranormal investigator, who also co-owns the Museum of Haunted Objects in Gettysburg. “If I had a heart attack tomorrow, I wouldn't want people to go around and say, ‘Oh, he was testing a voodoo doll from Haiti or whatever. Furek, who has written other books about paranormal events in Pennsylvania, including “Coal Region HooDoo: Paranormal Tales from Inside the Pit,” said that he believes objects can be haunted. However, Furek admits that Rivera himself wasn't afraid of the doll. “Dan was not afraid of the Annabelle doll,” Furek said. The Warrens were also Catholic, and Furek is as well. Ed Warren was a demonologist, and Lorraine Warren was a light trance medium, meaning she believed she could connect with spirits while in a trance, but she still remembered what happened afterward. James Madison University Associate Professor Lindsey Harvell-Bowman, an expert on death, death anxiety and suicide prevention, said one of the reasons people love these films so much is that they feel real. “Feeling scared makes people feel alive — I think that is why any horror film succeeds. But, specifically ‘The Conjuring' franchise offers more reality than most horror films. The original film was based on a true story,” she said. Because of that, she said, the movies can seem even scarier. “Anybody could get possessed or have a spirit take a liking to them — so, patrons can imagine themselves in these situations, which makes it all the more scary — and consequently, [they feel] all the more alive,” she said. In the films, the Annabelle doll is creepy and porcelain, but in real life, she's a plain Raggedy Ann doll. According to the story, after Donna put the doll on her bed, she noticed that it seemed to change positions. Then Donna and her roommate began finding parchment paper on the floor that had messages like “Help us, help me.” The doll reportedly started appearing in different rooms. Then, according to the story, a male friend of Donna's was taking a nap, and he woke up feeling like he was being strangled. Reportedly, the doll appeared to be staring at him, and there were scratches on its upper chest. At first, the girls thought that someone might be breaking into their apartment, moving the doll, and leaving notes, but then they began to suspect that something more sinister was at work. The girls consulted a psychic who told them that a girl named Annabelle Higgins lived there and died at the age of 7. The psychic believed that Annabelle wanted to stay with them and be loved. However, after things worsened, the Warrens were brought in. They believed the doll wasn't possessed but was being manipulated by an inhuman energy that wanted to possess a human. One of them is Chris McKinnell, the Warrens' grandson, who was vocally opposed to taking the Annabelle doll on tour. That work was never meant to be sensationalized. Some people question whether objects can be haunted at all. But Patrick, who co-owns the Museum of Haunted Objects in Gettysburg, is one of those people who thinks that they can be, though he doesn't come to that conclusion lightly. All the objects in his museum, with over 100 items, undergo rigorous testing. “And most of the time, I can figure out what it is. I got into this because people wanted a more scientific approach to it.” Patrick said he had been involved in the paranormal community for a long time and hadn't considered collecting haunted objects until he began collaborating with Johlene “Spooky” Riley, one of the museum's other co-owners. He said that about 20 years ago, Spooky started removing items from people's homes that “they deemed unwanted or were scared of or bad luck, even. And since then, I've traveled all over the world doing investigations and then housing them safely in an EM proof building.” “We don't seek the items out anymore,” he said. “What happens typically, if something is from a famous haunt or paranormal area, say, for instance, if someone called us that had an item that was in a home that had an exorcism, if it's a highly known, you know, we'll be interested in taking a look at it,” he said. However, the museum also receives calls from random individuals who believe a less well-known object is haunted. Patrick said that once the museum has an item, the team gathers as much information about it as possible. These 19 tests look for electromagnetic frequencies, temperature changes, motion sensing, and disembodied voices, he said. “We do a long list of tests on every single item, from EMF tests to recordings on multiple levels in a sterile environment,” he said. Patrick believes that it's common for dolls to be haunted. “I'm a subscriber to the belief that energy doesn't just disappear,” he said. “It goes somewhere, and if you spend a lot of energy on a person, place, or thing, when you're gone, that energy might just stay with that person, place, or thing,” he said. “Believing that, dolls are very, very special and unique to specific people, and people spend a lot of time with those items when they're young, and I do believe that a lot of that energy gets stored with them.” Patrick said he also receives numerous calls about chairs, jewelry, photographs, paintings, and urns. “Sometimes, you just get those random things that were just in a really bad place for a long time, or something that someone has altered purposely, ritualistically,” he said. Despite being around haunted objects, Patrick said he's usually not afraid. However, there was one time when he left a potentially haunted building. “I don't really get too squeamish about anything anymore,” he said. He isn't religious himself and doesn't know whether things like sage and holy water are protective, but he does work with people who think they are. “I don't use that stuff personally,” he said. “I actually tell them every time they come through the door that we make sure that nothing's going to follow them home, and, if it does, to bring it back, because it's bad for business,” he said. Our goal is not to make people feel unsafe in their homes when they go home. One object in the Museum of Haunted Objects that might make people feel unsafe is a doll, reportedly from Indonesia, that you can't look in the eye. “That doll was in a full-on Faraday cage behind another metal barrier.” However, another paranormal investigator, Jeff Santos of Virginia Paranormal Investigations, which investigates supposedly haunted places throughout Virginia as well as the surrounding states, doesn't believe the danger comes from the objects themselves. He said that, in the years of conducting paranormal investigations, he has found no evidence that objects can be haunted. “I've never found any evidence of these objects actually being haunted,” he said. Santos believes that the real danger comes from fear. “I don't think that the ghost of a living person will go into an object,” he said. “I do think that there are demons that are always around, and they're going to act [on people's vulnerability and fear]. If someone has enough faith to walk up and see that doll, I think the person will be fine.” Santos doesn't believe that things like sage and mediums work. Deliverance ministry, Santos said, involves a process of closing the doorways “that demons can use to get into your life. “Before I was born, my parents lived up in Pittston,” Santos said. When we tested that mirror, I tested that mirror with the binding attached to it.” Even bound, the mirror still gave off a 1.9 EMF rating, “which is one of the highest things we've ever had. “They were experiencing things all the way back from the seventies, such as things moving and assaults going on in there, loud noises, a dog being thrown through the wall or into the wall, doors slamming, images showing up in mirrors, and we have one of the mirrors from that home,” he said. Furek said that the Smurl House was like the Pennsylvania version of what happened in Amityville, on Long Island. Patrick said that, from what he has seen of the Smurl Haunting, including the mirror, it appears to be a legitimate haunting. “Unfortunately, the Warrens have had a lot of bad publicity over the years, and a lot of their things, people don't believe, as far as people thinking they were conning, like con artists,” he said. They presented their work in a series of lectures at colleges and universities including Bridgewater College. Like Santos, Ed Warren told people not to open the door to demons by using a Ouija Board because it could cause problems. “It's a way to share history in the local paranormal community and not just what the ghost lore is,” he said. “I would say that the majority of ghost hunters view Ouija boards as evil,” he said. I think that inherently, Ouija boards are just a device used to communicate with the dead. Well, the same ghost hunters that tell you, ‘You know Ouija boards are evil,' are also using a recorder to talk to the dead and get answers.” He said that people using recording devices to communicate with ghosts don't have any clearer idea of whom they are talking to than people playing the game. “I don't think Parker Brothers, who makes the game, has any more connection to Satan than Sony does for making the digital recorders,” he said. “So I think that the objects themselves could be haunted. I have not personally experienced that with any of the haunted objects.” She said some people come to the investigations expecting them to be fake and leave freaked out when they realize they're not. Sometimes this is because “they didn't expect any of the stuff that happens to happen,” she said. This is a feeling that Breeden can relate to because “I ran out of my house the first time I experienced a voice on my recorder.” Breeden became interested in communicating with the dead to help solve crimes, and she has done so in several cases, including the Alexa Murphy and Samantha Clark case. In both of those cases, Breeden said she told police where to find the girls' bodies even though they had been missing for more than 10 years. Breeden, who has a special ability to connect with the spirit world, said she wants to use it in a meaningful way. One of the other things she does is utilize her abilities for local ghost investigations. One of her upcoming investigations will be Elkton Town Hall's fourth annual Spook Walk, hosted by Lunar Paranormal, which will take place from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. on Oct. 25. Tickets will be available starting Monday for $35 each. She'll also do a sunset paranormal investigation at Swannanoa in Afton on Nov. 2 from 5 to 7:30 p.m. She and a frequent investigative partner, Dr. Donald Molnar, a Charlottesville-based medical doctor also known as The Haunted MD, will lead the investigation. Molnar began conducting paranormal investigations in 2012, first through Twisted Paranormal Society in Fishersville, until 2018, when he started doing them independently. Like many who are drawn to the paranormal, he says, “I've kind of had weird things happen all my life from my childhood till now.” Breeden said that the museum is more haunted than her historic home, which she also said is “pretty haunted.” Molnar agrees that the museum is likely haunted. “We have some amazing evidence from that place,” he said. In terms of her encounters with the unknown, Breeden said that she isn't afraid. “I don't choose to communicate with anything negative,” she said. “I'm a firm believer in God,” she said. “I have 100% faith that he has my back.” Breeden {!--StartFragment--}{span data-olk-copy-source=”MessageBody”}Miler-Kite Historical Society in Elkton.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon. As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved. Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959. These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural". This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years. It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media". Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon. This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart. Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation. Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail. When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls. They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path. What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli. Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis. However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction. An ominous interstellar object named 3I/Atlas is hurtling towards our solar system at astonishing speeds. What does this mean for Earth, and could it be a sign of extraterrestrial …</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last updated on Aug 26, 2025 at 5:29 PM (UTC+4) Edited by Emma Matthews This controversial Harvard scientist has doubled down on their claims that a mysterious object in space is an alien UFO and not a natural phenomenon. In July 2025, astronomers spotted a fast-moving interstellar object, which they called 3I/Atlas, and it was heading towards our solar system. It's about to fly past Jupiter, Mars, and Venus later this year. However, one particular Harvard scientist is convinced that in fact, this discovery was actually aliens rather than a comet, and this isn't the first time he's done it. Last month, astronomers named a fast-moving interstellar object in space 3I/Atlas as it was heading into our solar system. The astronomers were tracking its journey past Jupiter, Mars, and Venus, and most of the scientific community has declared 3I/Atlas is just a normal comet. And that, opposed to a comet, it's actually an alien spaceship. But actually, it was light coming from inside the alien spaceship itself. This isn't the first time Loeb has caused controversy by declaring that an unidentified flying object could be an alien rather than a piece of space detritus. Back in 2017, the astrophysicist speculated that an interstellar object named Oumuamua might have been alien technology. If Loeb is right, then it won't be long until the aliens arrive.
