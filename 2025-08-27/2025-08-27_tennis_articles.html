                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One year after her breakthrough semifinal run in New York, Emma Navarro needed only 76 minutes to dismiss fellow American Caty McNally and extend her streak of second-round wins at majors to seven. NEW YORK -- One year after her best Grand Slam result, Emma Navarro is into the third round with a clinically clean 6-2, 6-1 victory Wednesday over fellow American Caty McNally. 10 seed, who reached last year's US Open semifinals before losing to eventual champion Aryna Sabalenka, has now won seven consecutive second-round matches at Grand Slams -- this one in just 76 minutes. ‚ÄúIt was a little bit quicker than I tend to play my matches, but it wasn't easy,‚Äù Navarro said in her on-court interview. This year's path to the final four looks more difficult. Navarro, 24, is now 2-0 against McNally, who was playing on a wild card granted by the USTA. McNally, 23, was trying to equal her best Grand Slam performance; she reached the third round here five years ago. She's now gone 0-8 against Top 20 players in the PIF WTA Rankings. The match, played on a beautiful breezy day on the well-attended Grandstand Court, got off to a scratchy start, with three consecutive service breaks. But when a McNally forehand strayed long, at the 22-minute mark, it was 3-1, Navarro. There was another break in the seventh game and Navarro nailed down the first set when she converted her third set point. Confidence building üìàEmma Navarro is into the third round in New York.#USOpen pic.twitter.com/PMoYzWibJL She's 36 now and ranked outside the Top 100, but Victoria Azarenka -- a two-time Grand Slam champion -- still has some championship chops. ‚ÄúShe started really strong,‚Äù Azarenka said of Pavlyuchenkova's early 3-0 lead. Among active players, only Venus Williams (94) has appeared in more Grand Slam main draws than Azarenka (69). Azarenka broke Pavlyuchenkova five times and finished with four more winners than unforced errors, 15-11.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams has accepted a wild card into the doubles draw at the US Open, where she'll play with former singles finalist Leylah Fernandez. Venus has won the US Open doubles title twice -- first in 1999, and then in 2009, both time with her sister. NEW YORK -- She just can't quit the US Open. After losing in the revamped mixed doubles tournament with Reilly Opelka, and then dropping her first-round match against 11th-seeded Karolina Muchova -- a three-setter that saw her even the match after dropping the first -- Venus Williams will stick around in Queens for a bit longer to play doubles. She'll play Elsa Jacquemot in the second round on Wednesday.) Williams, a two-time US Open singles champion, has also won two doubles titles in Flushing Meadows -- in 1999, alongside her sister, and then again ten years later (again with Serena). "When I lost those first two games, they were just still right there with me every point. Didn't matter if I was losing and it was starting to roll fast, they were just right there with me. "I knew going into this match that people in this stadium, people in the United States, people around the world were really rooting for me, and that felt great." In Cincinnati, when the reigning Washington D.C. champion was scheduled to potentially play Venus in the third round -- that didn't end up happening, as both players lost before that -- Fernandez talked about her kinship with Williams. "Venus, she's a legend," Fernandez said earlier this summer. Growing up, when I first started playing tennis, people asked me, 'Who did you watch when you were growing up?' I always said Justine Henin and the Williams sisters. They kind of built the path for us, and if I do have the opportunity to play against her, I'm just gonna be super happy, a little kid living her dream and playing one of her idols." 30 also recalled meeting Venus back in 2020, when she first turned pro and didn't know many players. It was in August of that year, at the Top Seed Open outside of Lexington, Kentucky, and Fernandez remembers that Venus was one of the first players who wanted to practice with her, something she always appreciated and will never forget. "She encouraged me, so it was pretty cool." Venus Williams has accepted a wild card into the doubles draw at the US Open, where she'll play with former singles finalist Leylah Fernandez. Venus has won the US Open doubles title twice -- first in 1999, and then in 2009, both time with her sister.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the former University of Texas star is not the only member of his family enjoying a special week. ‚ÄúI'd say we're both trying to make pushes. The brothers would often face one another in a local club championship. [There were] some severe tantrums where our parents had to control us and had to get us all sorted after the loss,‚Äù Eliot recalled. ‚ÄúMy dad I wouldn't say pushed us, but he was adamant about us trying different things so we weren't playing each other all the time. Luckily enough Nick gravitated a little bit more to squash and I gravitated towards tennis, so we weren't playing each other as often, which was a plus.‚Äù In retrospect, Eliot would have loved if Nick played tennis. But they both have found success in their own sport. Eliot spent much of his teens traveling with coach Patrick Hirscht to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center to train, while his brother improved in squash, ultimately leading him to the University of Pennsylvania. The Spizzirri brothers are not only professional athletes, but family cheerleaders. They are one another's biggest fan and spent time together fishing just days before Nick flew to Brazil. We're always giving each other advice and most of the time we're just joking about stuff that's not tennis or squash,‚Äù Eliot said. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to it, he has a tournament or I have a tournament, we're always bouncing ideas off each other and trying to help each other get as locked in as possible, learn and try to get better.‚Äù Right before Nick flew to the Pan Am Championships, he was ‚Äúin a really bad headspace‚Äù with his squash. ‚ÄúI would've rather been at home doing anything else,‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúI spoke to my brother about it and he told me that if it were him he'd take a couple days off as I was likely burnt out. It won't affect my level nor my fitness by taking a few days off, it could help me feel more fresh for the tournament as well. I was able to defeat the World No. 34 to clinch a U.S. team win over Colombia and ultimately win a Pan Am gold later in the tournament and I believe a lot of the reason I was able to was due to Eliot's advice.‚Äù Off the court, however, Nick explained that they are actually quite different. For example, Eliot is very organised and structured in his daily life. ‚ÄúMy room has all my clothes thrown into a pile in the corner and my supplements are all over for me to have to find every morning for when I need to take them. ‚ÄúBasically I am much more laid back off the court. He's 6'4‚Äù and a little bit bigger than me. It seems to be working out for both brothers at the moment. Spizzirri will try to continue his run at the venue where he spent years training on Wednesday against 32nd seed Luciano Darderi with a potential clash against second seed Carlos Alcaraz looming in the third round. ‚ÄúI was telling someone earlier this week that despite being a wild card, I've probably spent more time on these courts than anyone else in the draw. These are the things you dream of as a kid and the reason why I train so hard to get to this level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bryan Shelton has worn a lot of hats during his life in tennis: No. 55 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, two-time ATP Tour titlist and one of the best college coaches in history among them. After leading the Georgia Institute of Technology women's team to a national title and helping the University of Florida's men's team to NCAA glory. Now Shelton has guided Ben, a member of that Florida team, to World No. ‚ÄúBut you've got staff, and you've got budgets, and you've got a lot of things to deal with, especially with the recruiting and the number of hours that you have to spend on the phone, traveling, going to see players, talking to parents. Now there is one focus: Ben and his tennis. ‚ÄúWe've got to still have a team around this that works with us, that we work with. We have agents that help with a lot of the logistical stuff. The other layer of complication is balancing life as father and coach. ‚ÄúWe've got windows when it's just my coach's hat on completely and my dad hat is completely off until the match is done and the day is done at the courts. Then we get in the car, heading home and there's really no more talk of tennis. ‚ÄúI might go back to my room at the hotel, and I might watch video or do some more work. But as far as my relationship with Ben, it's strictly dad in certain hours and it's strictly coach in other hours.‚Äù But doing so on the ATP Tour while traveling the world together is a different experience, which they have adapted to. ‚ÄúWe just have found a good rhythm of when to turn it on and when to turn it off,‚Äù Shelton said. ‚ÄúAnd he gives me all the signals as well when he really doesn't want to talk about tennis. Bryan's daughter, Emma, was in the spotlight during Wimbledon when Ben helped her sister get out of work. What many fans might not realise is that Emma was a top college player herself, completing her career at Florida. You have my daughter who's a little bit more of an introvert, and you have Ben, who's a total extrovert. One that has confidence, no matter what he does, and the other one that is very critical of herself,‚Äù Bryan said. ‚ÄúMost of the time, they would go off to a tournament and she might have a better result than him, especially early on, and come home after winning a junior event, and he lost maybe in the quarters or semi-finals. I'd ask them both the same question, ‚ÄòWhat did you do well and what could you have done better?' ‚ÄúBen had really nothing that he could have done better, in his opinion, and he just needed to grow and get stronger. And then my daughter, who'd maybe won the tournament, would have a long list of things she could have done better. Bryan enjoyed a chuckle thinking of those memories ‚Äî his disposition is more similar to that of his daughter's. One of Shelton's hangups as a professional was his confidence on court, and he has been able to use what he learned from that during his coaching career. He calls himself a ‚Äútennis nerd‚Äù who has always been inquisitive about why certain players have success and how to apply those principles to his players. ‚ÄúBen's a lefty, and so it's been fun to really dive in and see what made Nadal so great, as far as just how he carried himself, but also his tactics and patterns of play and just the things that made him really, really tough to beat out there,‚Äù Shelton said. "Then you look at Jack Draper having success and it's another lefty.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On a night when Coco Gauff ground out a near three-hour win over Ajla Tomljanovic and Naomi Osaka eased past Greet Minnen, two of the game's multi-major champions moved in tandem into the US Open's second round. NEW YORK -- Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka share striking similarities. Both are among only six active women with multiple Grand Slam singles titles, and together they've won three of the past seven US Opens. Each captured a second major at the precocious age of 21. They also share a passion for fashion -- and aren't afraid to wear it on their sleeves. This year, Gauff added a Roland Garros crown while Osaka reached the Montreal final, her best result since returning from maternity leave. And now they share one more bond: Both are into the second round. 3 Gauff needed 2 hours and 57 minutes to edge Ajla Tomljanovic 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5. ‚ÄúYeah, it was a tough match,‚Äù Gauff said in her on-court interview. ‚ÄúI had chances for it to be straight sets. ‚ÄúI'm trying, but it's an improvement from last week in Cincy.‚Äù Heading in, the larger focus was on Gauff, whose 320 double faults for the year -- which prompted that coaching change -- were a dominant storyline. CHAMPS RISE üò§Coco Gauff fends off Tomljanovic in a three set battle, 6-4, 6-7, 7-5!#USOpen pic.twitter.com/OsM6gMaz1u Tomljanovic came out confidently, winning three of the first four games. Gauff, meanwhile, was notably tentative, those double faults possibly occupying the front of her mind. While MacMillan came on to alter Gauff's serve, it appears in one week's time he's already worked on smoothing out her forehand. With Tomljanovic serving at 5-4, it looked like she'd force the match to three, but Gauff dug in, winning several long rallies and saving two set points. After she held serve at love, Tomljanovic forced a tiebreak. Perhaps that effort shouldn't have been surprising, for the 32-year-old Australian has shown an ability to produce at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The first was an athletic backhand overhead stab for a winner, the second an 88-mph ace outside -- on second serve -- for a 4-2 lead. She now has a 21-4 record in Grand Slam first-round matches and has won 21 straight major matches against players ranked outside the Top 50. She was deadlocked with Minnen at 3-all when Osaka got some advice from Wiktorowski: more topspin. Roses are red & victory is @naomiosaka'sShe defeats Minnen in straight sets 6-3, 6-4.#USOpen pic.twitter.com/eUbVhDzmDF The match ended with another break, which was appropriate. Osaka got six break-point opportunities -- and won them all. She also served well, stroking seven aces and zero double faults. Her family lived on Long Island from ages 4 to 9. ‚ÄúFor me, the US Open is an embodiment of New York, and it's very loud and busy, but it's also really special,‚Äù Osaka said. So as a little kid, I used to be in those stands. I have always wondered what it would feel like to be the one actually playing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek may have just set an Open Era record at the US Open, but the topics on her mind were Taylor Swift's engagement -- and Maria Sharapova's introduction to the Hall of Fame by Serena Williams. Iga Swiatek may have set a record Tuesday at the US Open with her 65th consecutive first-round victory in the Open Era, but afterward her thoughts were elsewhere as she spoke to reporters. As she was walking off court, Taylor Swift announced her engagement to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce on Instagram. Like all Swift fans, Swiatek has lived through the ups and downs of the singer's various relationships for over a decade. "I'm just happy for her, because she deserves the best," Swiatek said. "Obviously she had a lot of boyfriends, so we know all about that. Hopefully this one will, you know, stick forever. In truth, Swiatek is more eager for clues about Swift's upcoming 12th album, "The Life Of A Showgirl" She hasn't pre-ordered any of the various vinyl versions yet -- she intends to buy it properly when it's released in October, in a physical record shop -- but she's been wading through Swift's recent content in the hope of finding out more information. "It was a long interview," Swiatek said of Swift's appearance on Kelce's New Heights podcast. Swiatek was amused by Swift's sourdough obsession -- she listened with a friend in Cincinnati who was equally passionate about the bread -- but it's the music that's on her mind. Specifically, can Swift be trusted when she insists the album will only contain 12 songs? "I was thinking about all that stuff that she said -- the Easter eggs, you know," Swiatek said, referring to Swift's habit of dropping clues for her fans. "For example, when she was, like, 'Oh, this is going to be an album of 12 songs, that's it, no more,' I was, like, 'Girl...' Swiatek was also admiring of Swift's ability to cross over to the sporting world via Kelce, though she has little time for any detractors. "There has been some hate as well because she was on football matches and she got booed and everything. I don't get it, because she just makes our world better." Another two iconic figures who have blended the worlds of sport and pop culture have also been on everyone's lips this week: Maria Sharapova, the most recent induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and Serena Williams -- who made a surprise appearance in Newport to introduce her great rival. "It's a shame obviously that it didn't happen before when they were on tour together," she said. So Maria also deserves that, and Serena, she's great. It wasn't just a nice moment for Swiatek, but also an example for her own generation of players. "I feel like we all should be kind of united and going towards one goal as players, even though we're competing against each other," she said. Iga Swiatek may have just set an Open Era record at the US Open, but the topics on her mind were Taylor Swift's engagement -- and Maria Sharapova's introduction to the Hall of Fame by Serena Williams.</p>
