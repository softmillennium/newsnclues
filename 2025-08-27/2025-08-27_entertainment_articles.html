                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These types of copyright claims — and settlements resolving them — have become common legal headaches for celebrities. Robin Thicke has reached a private settlement to resolve a lawsuit that claimed he posted paparazzi pictures of himself on Instagram without paying to license the images. Attorneys for celebrity photo agency BackGrid USA told a federal judge in a court filing last week that they reached a “settlement in principle” with Thicke two months after suing the singer and music producer for copyright infringement. The June lawsuit took issue with two paparazzi shots Thicke posted to his Instagram in 2022. The posts, which have since been deleted, showed Thicke riding shotgun in a convertible and leaving a restaurant with his now-wife, April Love Geary. BackGrid claimed that because it owns the rights to both these photos, Thicke was required to pay for licenses before sharing them on social media. BackGrid did not specify how much money it wanted Thicke to pay, but the company said it “suffered substantial economic damage” from Thicke's alleged infringement. Thicke is far from the first celebrity to get dragged into court over paparazzi photos in social media posts. Artists including Jennifer Lopez, Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa and Justin Bieber have all faced similar lawsuits in the last few years. As in the case of Thicke, celebrities tend to settle these claims rather than fight them out. This is likely because U.S. copyright law is on the side of photographers and image licensers; being the subject of a camera lens does not give a person automatic ownership over a photograph or carte blanche to repost it for free.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a whirlwind 48 hours of major developments in the heartbreaking saga involving actor Scott Wolf and his estranged wife, Kelley Wolf, fans are hoping that healing can begin. According to TMZ, Kelley was arrested on August 26, 2025, after dozens of concerning social media posts, reviewed by EntertainmentNow, and comments from many followers urging her to seek help. Scott, a Hallmark Channel fan favorite who rose to stardom on the 90s hit “Party of Five,” and Kelley, a life coach known for her reality show appearances on MTV's “The Real World” and “The Challenge,” announced their impending divorce on June 10 after 21 years of marriage. Kelley, 48, has been placed under two involuntary holds since announcing their split. After Kelley's increasingly alarming social media posts and behavior, People reported on August 26 that a judge had issued a continuation of the custody arrangement, with supervised visitations possible for Kelley. In an Instagram Story on the evening of August 26, Kelley wrote that “police are at my house to arrest me.” She continued, “I have no idea why. According to Us Weekly, Kelley was “booked in Utah's Summit County Jail on two criminal charges” — electronic communication harassment and electronic disclosure of personal identifying information. It's not clear which of Kelley's many recent posts landed her in jail. Within a string of dozens of Instagram Stories posted over the previous 48 hours, Kelley's posts had included a private FaceTime video with Scott and his brother, Gary Wolf, and private text messages with former friends and family members, including her young daughter. She also made harsh accusations against Scott and multiple Park City business owners, sharing phone numbers in some cases. Kelley has limited comments on the posts in her Instagram feed, but many followers were able to send notes through via her Instagram Stories on August 26, urging her to seek help, including one who wrote, “Take care of yourself ❤️. On the morning of August 27, Kelley remained in jail, per People, which reported that no formal charges had been filed and bail had not been set. The outlet said it was unclear if she'd obtained legal counsel. Online buzz and concern escalated on August 25, when Kelley livestreamed a private family reunion at the home where she was staying, as Scott brought their two youngest children to give their mom hugs and deliver lunch to her. Kelley was seen sobbing as her kids hugged her on the front porch and screaming obscenities at Scott and his brother, Gary Wolf, insisting they stay near the street. Two hours before she was arrested on August 26, Kelley wrote in multiple Instagram Stories that she was going off the grid for at least six months, writing, “I love you scott. According to People, the most recent court order stipulated that Scott would continue providing Kelley with $10,000 per month and that if she agreed to check into an inpatient treatment facility, he would help pay for it out of their marital funds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's engagement is the hottest news right now, and fans are eager to learn more about the proposal. The couple announced their news in a joint Instagram post on August 26, and shared several photos from a romantic rose garden setting where the proposal took place. “I was talking to Scott Swift and Travis went to ask him for permission,” Ed said on an August 26 episode of “The Jimmy & Nath Show with Emma,” Page Six reports. He added, “And this was probably a month ago.” Scott gave his blessing, but he also encouraged Travis to propose sooner rather than later. “Scott said, ‘Oh come on, when are you gonna get this done? “Travis had these plans to do it […] before he took off for Brazil, and was gonna make a big production out of it some place. But, you know, [he] wanted to make it special.” Ed revealed that he and Scott chatted with his son and reminded him that the proposal didn't have to be some extravagant thing on a specific date. He continued, “And Scott adds on, ‘Just get it done. When Kelce asked Swift to marry him, he did it with a beautiful and special ring that he had helped design himself. The ring was in collaboration with Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry. It is a lovely piece of jewelry, and when the time came to propose, Travis led Swift to the garden, which he had arranged with flowers. “He got her out there, they were about to go out to dinner, and he said, ‘let's go out and have a glass of wine,'” Ed told “The Jimmy & Nath Show with Emma.” He added, “They got out there, and that's when he asked her, and it was beautiful.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 16-year-old who helped prepare a failed terrorist attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, Austria, last year has been convicted in Germany, reports the BBC. He was given an 18-month suspended sentence under juvenile criminal law in Berlin court yesterday (August 26). Prosecutors claimed Mohamed A was radicalized by Islamic State terrorist group propaganda online when he helped the other two would-be attackers by translating bomb-building instructions from Arabic. Concert organizers called off all three of Swift's shows at Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion last August after police were informed of a credible threat. Nearly 200,000 people had been expected to attend the concerts. Police arrested three people in connection with the alleged terror plot. Main suspect Beran A, an Austrian man who was 19 at the time of his arrest, remains in custody and an investigation into his role is ongoing. Mohamed A was the third suspect, and while he could not be held in custody because of his status as a minor, he was charged by German prosecutors back in June. But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives,” Swift said in an Instagram post after the reason for the Vienna tour dates' cancellation became public knowledge. “Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows. In cases like this one, ‘silence' is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it's right to.

(“Vertigo” icon Kim Novak will also receive one later this week.) Herzog's new film “Ghost Elephants,” about an elusive herd of the Angolan creatures, debuts in Venice this week as part of the festival's robust documentary slate, which also includes new films from Laura Poitras and Sofia Coppola. Related Stories Spike Lee's Return to Katrina Is a Poignant, Cagey Prayer for a Brighter Future That Is Still Out of Sight ‘La Grazia' Review: The President of Italy Tries to Get His Groove Back in Paolo Sorrentino's Unusually Dull and Sexless Character Study “One must celebrate that someone like him can exist,” said Coppola of Herzog, the 82-year-old documentary and fiction auteur whose films have spanned everywhere from the Caves of Lascaux in “Cave of Forgotten Dreams” to pushing a steamboat up the Andes with Klaus Kinski in “Fitzcarraldo,” or alongside conservationist Timothy Treadwell in his last days for “Grizzly Man.” I have never seen such films as these, all unique and very different from one another, and all magnificent,” said Coppola, who put up a penniless Herzog at his San Francisco house to finish the script for “Fitzcarraldo.” I was working on a play at that time, and remember introducing one of the cast members, Lena, who eventually became his wife. So when it comes down to is this: If Werner has limits, I don't know what they are. Werner's life and his very existence send a challenge to everyone out there: copy, if you can. Werner, I will eat my hat if anyone comes [along] who can do it.” “Francis has been extremely kind and generous to me,” Herzog said. I stayed at his house in San Francisco and wrote my screenplay of ‘Fitzcarraldo.' Both of us came very close to making a very big film about the conquest of Mexico together, seen from the perspective of the Aztecs, a film project that did not materialize, but it's a wonderful time when we plotted about it. And, of course, without Francis, I would not have met my wonderful wife, Lena. In fact, it is not true that we are 30 years together. Now it is to be correct: 29 years, 11 months, and nine days.” Herzog — whose “Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans” and “My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?” both played Venice in competition in 2009 — concluded, “I have always tried to strive for something that goes deeper beyond what you normally see in movie theaters. So in fact, I do believe that all this has similar reasons. I always wanted to be a good soldier of cinema.” The jury also includes filmmakers Stéphane Brizé, Maura Delpero, Cristian Mungiu, and Mohammad Rasoulof, and actors Zhao Tao and 2025 Best Actress Oscar nominee Fernanda Torres, who together will look at 21 films from the likes of Paolo Sorrentino (whose “La Grazia” opened the festival), Yorgos Lanthimos, Noah Baumbach, Park Chan-wook, Kathryn Bigelow, Guillermo del Toro, Olivier Assayas, Mona Fastvold, Benny Safdie, Jim Jarmusch, and more. “My fellow jurors and I express our great honor of being asked to serve on the jury of this year's Venice Film Festival, and we offer our greatest respect and warmest congratulations to all the superb filmmakers whose work we have the privilege of seeing with virgin eyes,” Payne said following a tribute reel montaging moments from his career, from “Sideways” to “The Descendants.” “I encourage my fellow jury members and myself to consider that we know something about cinema, but also nothing at all, to look at each movie simultaneously with the eyes of a professional but also with the eyes of a child who is perhaps seeing a film for the very first time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. “Bureaucracy is meant to be slow,” the President of Italy (Tony Servillo) explains to a member of his inner circle. “That's the point: to give people time to reflect.” But how much time is too much, and what good is reflection for a lame duck politician with six months left in his final term and a seemingly clinical inability to make any difficult choices before he leaves office? So far as we can tell at the start of Paolo Sorrentino's uncharacteristically sedate and sexless “La Grazia,” which feels like forced Catholic penance for the Neapolitan flesh parade of last year's poorly received “Parthenope,” reflection is just about the only thing the unnamed President has done for most of the last seven years. Related Stories Spike Lee's Return to Katrina Is a Poignant, Cagey Prayer for a Brighter Future That Is Still Out of Sight Coppola Champions Herzog at Venice Film Festival Opening Ceremony: ‘If Werner Has Limits, I Don't Know What They Are' The guy is so bricked up inside his own head that his nickname around the palace is “Reinforced Concrete.” Indeed, our dear leader is so oppressed by political responsibility — so weighed down by the question of how and why to live without love in his life — that he doesn't even know he has a nickname around the palace. But a storm is coming to stir up his subconscious, and it arrives on several fronts at once. The President's daughter and chief advisor Dorotea (Anna Ferzetti) hopes that her dad will sign a law permitting euthanasia despite the protestations of the Pope, his potential successor Ugo (Massimo Venturiello) urges him to pardon a woman for killing her abusive husband despite the fact of her guilt, and his close friend Coco (Milvia Marigliano) taunts him about the affair his wife had 40 years ago despite refusing to divulge the identity of Aurora's lover. “La Grazia” puts a more introspective spin on the same formula, its focus concentrated on the incongruities that can form in the ever-widening gap between a man's principles and his doubts. Over the course of this strangely muted film (a deliberate curveball from modern Italian cinema's most unbridled maximalist), that gap seems to widen further behind the camera than it does on the screen — and in far more compelling fashion. Sorrentino can't resist the temptation to introduce a few garish flourishes — along with the occasional jag of Proustian techno, and a third-act rap about “Metal Gear Solid” — into this otherwise colorless portrait of a colorless man, but his decision to confine so much of “La Grazia” to the dens, hallways, and gardens of the Quirinale feels like an act of self-denial from an artist who no longer trusts in the truth of his palette. So austere by the director's usual standards that it seems practically Bressonian when compared to the “I wonder what life is like for an insanely hot woman?” excesses of “Parthenope,” Sorrentino's latest is the work of someone who's immobilized by the disconnect between their ethos and their aesthetic; someone who's spent his entire life in search of a truth that has just slipped out of his fingers, and is naturally sympathetic to the pressures that come with trying to rediscover it in the public eye. He's spiteful but open-hearted — cloaked in a power so immense that he can hardly move under the weight of it. He is, as someone puts it, suffering from the “burden of sensibility” that jurists and soldiers hope that law and duty will spare them from having to carry on their shoulders. Servillo earns his character's lightness with a gentleness that can make it tender and touching to watch the President get his groove back, but “La Grazia” struggles to support its leading man. Freighted with Sorrentino's usual symbolism, which is clumsier and more suffocating than ever in the context of a film so claustrophobic (R.I.P. In those more exuberant movies, many of them bursting with a horniness so profound that it became rightly inextricable from the stuff of history and religion, that gaudiness could be more of a feature than a bug. Here, in an airless drama whose protagonist has long been immune to any such pleasures, and who occupies his lavish Roman palace as if he were a prisoner in need of a pardon himself, Sorrentino tries to look for the same thrill in gray skies, wounded egos, and legal debates. Style has always been the vehicle for his substance, and while it's easy to imagine why an overdone misstep like “Parthenope” might inspire Sorrentino to rein things in a bit for his next feature, it's funny that said feature turned out to be the story of a man who threatens to unravel from self-doubt at the height of his power. Perhaps bureaucracy is meant to be slow enough that people have time to reflect on the substance of the issues at hand, but a Paolo Sorrentino movie isn't. “La Grazia” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

Well, Chris, it seems like you've answered your own question: The point is that it is all going to be the same. Sure, they've hired the Oscar-winning Poor Things costume designer Holly Waddington, but the shows can't stray too far from the books (HBO is billing this as a “faithful” adaptation) and more importantly, from the film character designs that are still very much part of worldwide Harry Potter marketing. He's expressed support for the project and interest in what HBO will be able to do with the show that wasn't possible in a film. And on the podcast, he said, “It's very flattering for me, because I'm like: That's exactly the Hagrid costume that we designed. This is an ongoing problem with Hollywood's intellectual property mining and obsession with franchise expansion—something Columbus isn't much interested in. He's done two Harry Potters and two Home Alones, but he really hasn't gone back to the well all that much for someone who has made a lot of iconic, nostalgic movies. I've done that, it's time to move on. I've always had issues with the idea of franchise. My attitude then is I've done it and it's time to move on,” he said on the podcast.

Wakim revealed he was one-and-done at the long-running, late-night show in a statement posted on social media Wednesday. “I won't be returning to SNL next year. Thank u to Lorne [Michaels] for taking a chance on me and changing my life.” Wakim was one of three new cast members, along with Jane Wickline and Ashley Padilla, that SNL brought in ahead of its 50th anniversary season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two months after he was mostly cleared at his blockbuster criminal trial, the hip-hop mogul won a ruling Tuesday dismissing a civil lawsuit accusing him of drugging and sexually battering a 23-year-old man at an afterparty in 2015. A Manhattan judge said the case, lodged in February, was filed well after the statute of limitations had expired in either state that might apply: “Because the action is untimely under both New York and California law, … it must be dismissed as to all defendants.” Those civil cases were just two of dozens filed against Combs over the past two years alongside his blockbuster federal criminal case. Even after beating two of them, many others remain pending before other judges. Combs was largely acquitted last month in the criminal case, which accused him of forcing girlfriends to partake in drug-fueled sex marathons with prostitutes called “freak-offs.” Jurors found him not guilty on racketeering (RICO) and sex-trafficking charges, though they did convict him on two counts of interstate prostitution. The victim said he drifted “in and out of consciousness” after drinking a spiked drink, then awoke to find Combs groping him and believed the star “had been performing oral sex on him.” Though a law was passed in 2019 that extended the statute of limitations to 20 years, the judge said that law did not apply retroactively. “While Plaintiff contends that [the newer law] applies and affords him a 20-year period to file this action, this argument fails,” the judge wrote. “Plaintiff's claim, filed in 2025, remains untimely under New York law.” The accuser cited California state law as an alternative, arguing the state's so-called lookback window for sexual assault claims allowed him to sue. In his statement to Billboard on Wednesday, Buzbee said the ruling was “just another step in the process” and vowed to bring continue to litigate the claims against Combs in a different venue. The court in New York has answered that question,” Buzbee said. “As with many cases like this one, we will refile it in California where the alleged assault occurred.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: One of the more polarizing court cases in recent memory is about to get the Hollywood treatment. Noble has an overall deal with Warner Bros Television. Banks also will exec produce through her Brownstone banner along with her producing partner Max Handelman and Krissy Wall. Jen Sargent, Marshall Lewy, Aaron Hart and Jeni Mulein will exec produce through their Wondery banner, as will Rachel Stockman and Dan Abrams through their Law & Crime company. When a Boston police officer is found dead in the snow, all eyes are on his girlfriend, Read. The case fractures a community, with some believing she is guilty of first-degree murder, and others that she's the victim of a sweeping cover-up by state and local law enforcement. This series explores society's obsession with true crime, the allure of conspiracy and the deepening crisis of trust in our institutions. The trial became a recurring story on morning talk shows and quickly was turned into multiple news specials as well as a Netflix doc before the final verdict was even delivered. Insiders tell Deadline that Brownstone had been developing the project for some time and in recent months had started putting the package together, starting first by tapping Noble as showrunner. RELATED: Elizabeth Banks On Doing It All From Acting In ‘The Better Sister' To Hosting ‘Press Your Luck' And Directing ‘Cocaine Bear' – The Actor's Side The series marks a reunion for Banks and Prime Video, who just worked together on series The Better Sister, which earned Banks some of the best reviews of her career. She also recently was seen in the FX series Mrs. America. Noble most recently worked on the HBO Max series The Sex Lives of College Girls and prior to that served as a writer on Never Have I Ever and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Kelley is coming off another hit courtroom drama, Presumed Innocent for Apple, which has several Emmy nominations including Best Actor for Jake Gyllenhaal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mother Teresa (1910-1997), the ethnically Albanian nun born in what is now known as North Macedonia and whose name has become a synonym for saintly goodness, was officially canonized in 2016, mostly for her missionary work with the poorest of the poor in Kolkata, India. But she continues to be a controversial figure, loved and worshipped by many Catholics but reviled by others who accuse her of hypocrisy and cruelty. Inside 'Megadoc': How Francis Ford Coppola Made Mike Figgis an Offer He Couldn't Refuse Venice vs. Cannes: Who's Winning the Festival Fight for Oscar Supremacy? With Mother, partly inspired by Alexander Sokurov's offbeat portraits of Hitler (Moloch) and Lenin (Taurus), Mitevska threads the dirty needle with a decidedly non-hagiographic portrait of Teresa as a youngish mother superior in 1948 when she was about to leave her original order, the Sisters of Loreto, to start up her own outfit, the Missionaries of Charity. With crucial assistance from lead Noomi Rapace, in sterling form here with a coiled, subtle performance, Mother limns a Teresa whose stern expressions barely conceal the rolling boil of ambition, passionate attachments and religious fervor bubbling inside her. Venue: Venice Film Festival (Horizons)Cast: Noomi Rapace, Sylvia Hoeks, Nikola Ristanovski, Ekin Corapci, Marijke Pinoy, Akshay Kapoor, Amrita ChattopadhyayDirector: Teona Strugar MitevskaScreenwriters: Goce Smilevski, Teona Strugar Mitevska, Elma Tataragic Partly informed by Mitevska's own research for her 2000 documentary Teresa and I, Mother also suggests Teresa might have been a less-than-ideal line manager, prone to capricious power games with the nuns working under her. At worst, she comes across as spiteful and cruel to those who disappoint her, such as her protégée Sister Agnieszka (Sylvia Hoeks), who unwisely gets herself knocked up. Those hoping for a more thorough dismantling of the Mother Teresa shrine of popular imagination will be disappointed that the screenplay, credited to Goce Smilevski, Mitevska and previous collaborator Elma Tataragic, doesn't play rougher. But such is the fashion these days with filmmakers who, despite their known leftist allegiances, bend over backwards to be balanced when depicting the likes of Donald Trump (The Apprentice), Dick Cheney (Vice) or Boris Johnson (British TV's This England). The script even sprinkles the dialogue with unfinished sentences, frequent interruptions and teasing lacunae, allowing viewers to fill in blanks as they wish. For example, it's never made clear whether anything palpable happened between Teresa and her confessor Father Friedrich (Nikola Ristanovski), although at one point a disgruntled nun hisses a rumor that they were lovers. You'd think, given Teresa's dedication to chastity and staunch belief that any kind of contraception let alone abortion is an abomination, that it's unlikely she and Friedrich ever got busy knocking sandals. With tendrils of blonde hair always trying to escape her wimple, there's an ineluctable sensuality about Agnieszka. It's hinted that Teresa may see something of a younger version of herself in Agnieszka, which may be why she so fiercely rejects her when Agnieszka reveals her pregnancy. After Agnieszka visits the local Indian doctor (Akshay Kapoor) to inquire about an abortion, Teresa predictably flames out and locks Agnieszka in her room, telling the other nuns that she's suffering from gastric complaints. All this unfolds while the days count down, flagged by bold onscreen graphics, to the Day Zero when Teresa will get her papal dispensation and leave the convent to start her new order. She's already thought out how they will wear simple white and blue saris like the local women, how much leave they will be allowed to go home and visit their family (precious little), and how they will devote themselves to ministering to the poor, the leprous and the outcast. Soon, she imagines her sisters floating as if on roller skates or wheeled dollies through moonlit corridors while electric guitars and vocalists wail away like heavy metal wraiths. It's not what you'd expect from a film about Mother Teresa, and Hitchens surely wouldn't have approved of anything that risked making her seem cooler and hipper than she was.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two members of the long-running metal band Cradle of Filth have abruptly left the group amid their current tour, citing “unprofessional behavior” and a “foolish” collaboration with Ed Sheeran. Singer and keyboardist Zoë M. Federoff first announced her exit from the band earlier this week for “personal reasons”; days later, Cradle of Filth revealed they were “firing” guitarist and Federoff's husband Marek “Ashok” Šmerda, who had been a member of Cradle of Filth since 2014, while Federoff joined in 2022. While fans initially speculated that a rift in Federoff and Šmerda's marriage was to blame for their sudden departures, Federoff clarified on social media, “Ashok isn't cheating. Cradle of Filth frontman Dani Filth issued the band's statement regarding Šmerda's firing “effective immediately” after Šmerda initially told fans he would leave the group after their current South American tour. “We simply do not feel like Cradle can provide for our future, and in fact hinders it. Among other reasons, it is a lot of work for relatively low pay, the stress is quite high, and we haven't felt for a while like this band actually prioritizing/caring about members. It has been years of unprofessional behavior from people above us that led to our decision,” Šmerda wrote. “I have also asked all compositions of mine removed from upcoming releases including Ed Sheeran collab. This song feels like foolish clown antics for me at this point anyways — first it was charity single for kids, then for profit single, then on next album, and now who knows and I just do not want to be involved anymore, no disrespect to Ed Sheeran.” Lil Nas X Breaks Silence on Arrest and Felony Charges: ‘That Was F-cking Terrifying' Bruce Willis Is Living in a Separate Home Away From Family as Part of His Dementia Care “Despite all attempts to illegally defame and derail the band, CRADLE OF FILTH WILL NOT cancel any of our South American shows, though fans will have to bear with us being a band with only one guitarist live, that is of course until Ashok's temporary replacement is flown out to join the tour in a few days time,” Dani Filth said in his statement. A replacement for Federoff was already installed in Cradle of Filth's ever-changing lineup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With ‘Dead Man's Wire' premiering out of competition in Venice, the elusive auteur looks back on a career defined by risk, reinvention and ignoring all the rules. There's no such thing as a typical Gus Van Sant film. With the possible exception of Steven Soderbergh, no American filmmaker working today has had a career marked by such radical shifts in style, budget and artistic ambition as the 73-year-old director from Louisville, Kentucky. From edgy indies to blockbuster crowd-pleasers, prestige Oscar bait to experimental movies, Van Sant has spent the past 40 years delighting, surprising and confounding his audience. His early films — the “Portland trilogy” of 1988's Mala Noche, 1989's Drugstore Cowboy and 1991's My Own Private Idaho — were gritty, realist dramas about outsiders: migrant workers, nomadic drug addicts and gay hustlers. Venice Hidden Gem: Willem Dafoe Is a Poetic Postal Worker in 'Late Fame' His “death trilogy” — 2002's Gerry, 2003's Elephant and 2005's Last Days — was a sharp turn into art house experimentation. Around the same time, in 1998, he made his notorious shot-for-shot color remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, a $60 million studio picture that now plays like a conceptual art installation. “I think it goes back to the beginning, when I started making short films with my friends,” Van Sant says of his frequent shifts in style. But we were also going to the cinema in this small town in Connecticut every Friday, watching war movies, or cartoons, or whatever. The experiment became: Could I extend my experiments in film into dramatic storytelling, to make something that looked like the things I would see on TV?” Van Sant credits his high school English teacher David Stone with introducing him to experimental cinema, showing 14-year-old Gus Canadian Film Board shorts and Citizen Kane in class. Other early influences included a stint assisting Ken Shapiro, director of 1974's pre-SNL sketch spoof The Groove Tube. “Lorne Michaels was actually working for him as a writer when he pitched Saturday Night Live to NBC,” Van Sant recalls. At the same time, he was bingeing on films from an emerging queer cinema scene. Apart from John Waters — whose 1972 cult classic Pink Flamingos played every Friday at midnight at New York's Quad Cinema — “there weren't really other gay filmmakers that I knew,” he says. With $25,000 he'd earned in New York advertising, he financed Mala Noche, a 16mm black-and-white adaptation of the Walt Curtis novel about an almost-romance between a gay store clerk and two young Mexican immigrants. “Walt Curtis wasn't a typical city gay man,” says Van Sant. So Mala Noche wasn't about mainstream gay culture. The film arrived during a golden moment for American indie cinema, fueled by upstart distributors like New Line, Orion and Miramax and the booming home video market. Van Sant credits his chameleon-like approach to filmmaking to the way he shape-shifts when working with actors: “One director — I can't remember who, probably Frank Capra — was asked, ‘How do you direct different people?' He has often gravitated toward real-life stories: Mala Noche, Drugstore Cowboy and Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot were all adapted from memoirs; Milk was a biopic; To Die For satirized the Pamela Smart murder case. His latest, Dead Man's Wire, premiering out of competition in Venice (where Van Sant will receive the Campari Passion for Film Award), is based on a bizarre 1970s hostage standoff in Indianapolis. The project originally was set up with Werner Herzog and Nicolas Cage. “I also really knew the quality of this Midwest, middle-class life. Van Sant is currently developing another real-life tale, a project about disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried. “With Sam Bankman-Fried, I just thought this is an amazing sort of car crash in the crypto world. And then someone sent me a script about it.” He comes by a style that's where I've always lived: You make something with small intentions but find the humanity within those intentions,” says Van Sant. “You don't let the money take over your sentiment as a filmmaker. You cast people that are new, that haven't been used before, and simplify the set to not have too many working parts. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hank (Austin Butler) is the bartender trying to coax young drinkers into wrapping things up. But it's Hank's boss who draws the immediate connection to a classic film (just a few weeks shy of its 40th anniversary at the time of this film's release): Martin Scorsese's After Hours. Maybe Paul finally got fed up with that data-entry job and moved downtown for good, embracing 15 years of rough living. He's an affable and good-natured (if seemingly underachieving) California-to-NYC transplant, who comes home to an Alphabet City apartment stocked with booze and sometimes graced by the presence of Yvonne (Zoë Kravitz), the paramedic he's been seeing. Butler is so likable that it takes a little while to fully register his alcohol dependency, perhaps more emotional than physical; a series of quick, harrowing flashbacks to a moment from his days as a hotshot high school baseball player fill in what, exactly, Hank has come to New York to escape from. Like Aronofsky's previous film, Caught Stealing is another adaptation where the original writer—in this case, novelist Charlie Huston—takes screenplay duties. When some Russian thugs show up at Hank's building looking for his mohawked neighbor Russ (Matt Smith), who has abruptly jetted home to London to see his dying father, Caught Stealing seems like it's setting up a crime caper doubling as an unlikely recovery narrative. By sheer wrong-place-wrong-timing, Hank catches a beating so severe that his health is permanently altered, necessitating him giving up alcohol. This isn't the end of his problems; soon enough, a cop (Regina King), a gangster (Bad Bunny), and a pair of armed Hasidic Jews (Liev Schreiber and Vincent D'Onofrio), among others, all come looking for Russ and/or Hank in turn, on the hunt for something Russ may have hidden from his criminal associates. Looks like Hank picked the wrong week to quit drinking. Yet while the story's basic set-up jointly recalls After Hours, Coen Brothers-style malicious fates (an errant cat is involved), and maybe a touch of Guy Ritchie's antics, Caught Stealing's sometimes-jarring tone keeps readjusting to a grimmer frequency. Scorsese may specialize in anguish, but many of his movies have a pitch-black sense of humor, often impressively integrated into tense and violent material, providing appropriate catharsis, or laughs that catch in your throat. ; among its highlights is a smash cut to a bar singalong of a very late '90s track that's even funnier when you picture how insanely out of place it would be in any other movie he's ever directed. So maybe it's the source novel that dictates a few particularly hellish plot turns, or maybe it's Aronofsky who has trouble properly setting them up. Regardless, some major pivots designed to raise the stakes have precisely the opposite effect, deflating tension by shellshocking and slowing down Hank's scrappy ballplayer's physicality. He and Kravitz may have to engage in a few too many convenient exchanges complaining about Giuliani-era gentrification, but their chemistry is palpable, and so are their differing levels of New Yorkiness, as she playfully ribs his mama's-boy out-of-towner vibe. The movie doesn't need to lay Hank's weaknesses on too thick, because Butler's angular, haunted face and body language so clearly and casually conveys who this guy is—someone whose closer relationships are held at bay by his suppressed guilt. It's remarkable, then, how well Caught Stealing holds together as entertainment; as much as Aronofsky seems incapable of the modulation needed to make a crime caper, he's also a big part of why this particular variation works anyway. At times, the movie resembles the director running through his greatest hits, with its Lower Manhattan setting (like Pi, released the year this movie takes place), forays into Brighton Beach (like Requiem For A Dream), and athletic lead character felled by the limitations of his abused body (The Wrestler) as well as his addiction issues (Requiem again), despite an obsessive and mother-abetted fixation on his initial field of excellence (Black Swan). Some part of Aronofsky may want to evoke the darkly funny mishaps of a vintage crime comedy, but something else keeps coaxing him halfway down dark alleyways, before the movie scrambles back into more comic-adjacent urgency. It's that run-and-stop-short rhythm that makes Caught Stealing feel more like a fraught, imperfect recovery than a Requiem-style spiral into hell, and an unusually balanced New York portrait.
