Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Rather than stand up to those threats and risk losing federal funding, these hospitals have chosen to abandon their transgender patients — an act many parents describe as outright capitulation, and one that likely violates state nondiscrimination laws. Until now, state attorneys general have largely limited their response to lawsuits against the administration, leaving hospitals free to wash their hands of responsibility. “This cowardly acquiescence to political pressure from this president and his administration is not what patients have come to expect from an institution that has labeled itself, ‘the leaders and the best,' and my Department will be considering all of our options if they violate Michigan law,” read the statement from Nessel. “This administration draws most of its power from the willingness of its targets to capitulate without a fight, abandoning their own principles and interests, and throwing disfavored populations under the bus,” Nessel continued. “Despite repeated successful legal challenges to actions by this administration, UM has chosen instead to sacrifice the health, well-being, and likely the very lives of Michigan children, to protect itself from the ire of an administration who, oftentimes, engages in unlawful actions itself.” Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Word that University of Michigan cancelled its transgender care program for youth comes after a slew of executive orders issued by President Trump, as well as investigatory threats and funding cuts. Rather than fight for their transgender patients, many hospitals have chosen to comply, even in states where safe-state legislation was supposed to offer the promise of protection against a loss of transgender healthcare. If you are uncertain about how this change might impact you or your clients/patients, please discuss this with your supervisor,” read the email informing staff of University of Michigan Health about their decision to end care. At the same time, it has moved to withhold Medicaid funds from any institution providing such care. Crucially, these laws do not actually ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth — these are intimidation tactics based on a purposeful misreading of law that would not hold up in court — and when challenged, courts have rejected them. They keep their funding and avoid a courtroom battle — at the price of abandoning transgender patients whose lives depend on that care. Similar calculations are playing out at some of the nation's most prestigious universities. Institutions like Penn, Columbia, and Brown have recently adopted anti-trans policies at Trump's behest — policies that in many cases appear to violate state nondiscrimination laws. Transgender students who believed they were shielded by both the inclusive promises of their universities and the protections of blue state law now find themselves trapped, vulnerable, and targeted by the very institutions that promised to keep them safe. State Attorneys General will play a decisive role in the months ahead in halting the wave of preemptive compliance with Trump's anti-trans threats. Suing the administration alone is not enough; as we've already seen, it can simply pull another lever, delay, or repackage its demands until institutions fold. Michigan's attorney general has shown one path forward: warning institutions directly that capitulation itself may be unlawful. If more AGs follow that lead, they could tip the balance, compelling schools and hospitals to resist rather than retreat, and ensuring that transgender lives are not treated as expendable bargaining chips.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's tariffs of 50% have come into force on most US imports from India. Washington added an extra 25% duty on top of the 25% imposed earlier this month, citing India's refusal to stop buying Russian crude and defence hardware. Around two-thirds of shipments are covered by the 50% tariff, threatening jobs and growth across sectors reliant on US demand. “No Indian product can stand any competitive edge under such heavy import taxes,” said Garima Kapoor of Elara Securities. Economists say the tariffs could erase up to one percentage point from India's GDP growth this fiscal year. A major drop in US exports could hit millions of workers, economists say. Exports from affected sectors could plunge 70%, from $60.2bn to $18.6bn, while overall shipments to the US could fall by 43%, said Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative, Delhi-based thinktank . With the tariff wall now up, exporters must either swallow costs, which will be impossible for many, or cede market share to countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico. Mithileshwar Thakur, of the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), said Indian exporters now faced a 30% cost disadvantage compared with Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia. “This is an earthquake,” said Kirit Bhansali, chair of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council. Even if tariffs are lowered later, competitors may have already locked in US market share. “Competitors like China, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, and even Pakistan, Nepal, Guatemala and Kenya stand to gain, potentially locking India out of key markets even after tariffs are rolled back,” Srivastava said. But right now it views Russia as an all-weather friend – a vital defence and energy ally amid the trade turmoil that Trump has unleashed. Russia supplies about 40% of India's oil needs, up from less than 1% before the Ukraine war. Even though discounts on Russian crude have narrowed from $20–$25 below benchmark Brent crude in 2022 to about $2.50 a barrel now, India continues buying because it secures energy reliably and relatively cheaply. A sudden reduction could also leave India vulnerable to global price swings. It will continue buying oil from wherever it gets the best deal and take measures to protect its national interest from US tariffs, India's ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, told TASS onsaid at the weekend. “Now, we have a working system of trade settlement in national currencies. There is no problem now in payment for oil imports,” he said. Indian firms are calculated to have saved $17bn by buying cheaper Russian oil since the start of the war in Ukraine, but that could be dwarfed by the impact of tariffs on exporters, which could cut India's US exports by nearly $37bn this financial year, said Srivastava. Narendra Modi's government has urged Indians to buy domestically made goods. Essentials such as food, textiles and cement will become cheaper, while luxury goods remain pricey. The government is reportedly assembling a multibillion-dollar package to free up cash for exporters. India has been seeking to diversify its markets and recently signed a free trade deal with the UK. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has called for a state-supported one-year moratorium on repaying the principal and interest on loans to free up cash for diversifying markets. “We are staring at a crisis which will force shutdowns and cause unemployment,” said the FIEO's president, SC Ralha. Modi is making his first visit to China since relations went into a deep freeze following a brutal clash along their disputed border in 2020 to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. He said this week the world was living through an era of “economic selfishness” in which countries pursue their own interests first.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The children, aged eight and 10, were attending the school's start-of-year Mass when they were hit by bullets as they sat praying on church pews. The suspect, thought to be in his early twenties, took his own life in the church's car park, Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said. He was dressed in black and camouflage, Mr O'Hara said, and there is no clear motive for the attack at the current time. Seventeen other people were injured, with 14 of them being children. Two of those children are in a critical condition, he added. “He struck children and worshippers inside the building,” Mr O'Hara said. “The shooter was armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol. Lisa Elm, who has been living in the area for more than 20 years, said: “It's a quiet, sweet community, it's a neighbourhood where people come together. Her daughter is currently on lockdown in a neighbouring high school. “I worry about what it's going to be in the future. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told a press conference that the killer “is in his early 20s” and “does not have an extensive known criminal history”. The suspect, dressed in black with cargo pants, approached up one side of the church as children were praying during morning Mass and opened fire with a semi-automatic weapon, police said. The school children, aged under 14, were praying on just their third day of term when a gunmen opened fire, killing two children in the pews and injuring 17 other people, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told a press conference. First responders rushed those injured to nearby hospitals, police said, while those who survived were relocated into the school, where they were reunited with their families. The gunman who opened fire on the morning Mass in Minneapolis was armed with a rifle, shotgun and a pistol, police confirmed. Addressing the “unspeakable tragedy”, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara described how the gunman, who also carried a smoke bomb, opened fire, killing two children, aged 8 and 10, and injuring 17 others, 14 of whom were children. Two of those injured children are in critical condition, he said. He added: “Our hearts are broken for the families who have lost their children, for these young lives that are now fighting to recover, and for our entire community that has been so deeply traumatised by this senseless attack.” “This worship service was marking the first week of school for children that are attending the Annunciation Catholic School,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said. Issuing an emotional plea outside Annunciation Catholic School, Jacob Frey said: “These kids were literally praying. These are kids that should be learning with their friends. “They should be able to go to school or church in peace without the fear or risk of violence, and their parents should have the same kind of assurance. “We are a Minneapolis family, but to everybody out there, do not think of these as just somebody else's kids.” I said, ‘There's no way that could be gunfire,'” he told the Associated Press. Speaking to local media, he added: “It seemed like a rifle, it certainly didn't sound like a handgun.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vancouver, Los Angeles, and Toronto consistently rank among the least affordable cities in North America.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press Vancouver, Los Angeles and Toronto consistently rank among the least affordable cities in North America. For years, some have argued that Toronto and Vancouver's high housing costs are natural for “world-class cities.” But that logic collapses when New York and Boston – true global hubs – are more affordable. Since 2005, housing affordability has worsened in nearly every major city in Canada and the U.S., driven by asset inflation, which is when asset prices rise faster than wages. The main driver has been loose monetary policy, with money supply expanding about 7.3 per cent annually over the past two decades, which has fuelled price growth across asset classes, including real estate. But that still doesn't explain why specific cities keep ranking at the very top of unaffordability charts. As I noted in an earlier article, Canada's housing affordability began to diverge from that of the U.S. around 2007–08. At the same time, Canadian incomes continue to lag those in the U.S., in part by an economy too reliant on real estate rather than productivity and innovation. Texas and Florida have seen some of the fastest growth in North America, yet their cities remain relatively affordable. When housing can't respond to demand, prices surge and affordability collapses. Multiple factors drive housing unaffordability, but the most practical fix is clear: boost supply. That means easing zoning rules and cutting red tape so builders can respond quickly to demand. Without decisive action, housing in Canada's largest cities will remain out of reach for most young Canadians, widening wealth gaps as more people are shut out of real estate's wealth-building opportunities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• At least two children were killed in a shooting in Minneapolis during a Catholic school Mass to mark the first week of school, according to police, in a “deliberate act of violence.” • The shooter is dead, law enforcement officials said. Children ages 6 to 14 are being treated for injuries at a Minneapolis-area health care system, with some in critical condition. In the aftermath of a deadly shooting, a man and woman were seen walking into Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis with their arms around each other. Less than a minute later, screams of “Oh my God. The tragic mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis took place as universities around the United States have seen a wave of active shooter hoaxes in recent days. Last week, false reports of active shooters wielding assault rifles on campus sent students preparing for a new school year at Villanova University in Pennsylvania and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga into lockdown. While law enforcement officers surged to the schools to assess the threats, students hid behind walls, locked themselves into dorm rooms and frantically texted loved ones. They were part of an apparent wave of fake reports that have struck university campuses across the country, stirring fear and disruption from Pennsylvania to Arizona. Six universities had active shooter reports Monday; all of them turned out to be unfounded. In the 2022-2023 school year, there were more than 446 false reports of active shooters at schools, according to a report from the Educator's School Safety Network, a non-profit dedicated to school safety. An 8-year-old and a 10-year-old were killed in a shooting today during Mass marking the first week of class at a Catholic school in Minneapolis, where parents rushed to the scene, anxiously hoping to be reunited with their children — now an all-too-familiar scene in America. “This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshiping,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said, calling the shooting “absolutely incomprehensible.” Pat Scallen, who lives down the street from the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, said he didn't hesitate when he heard gunfire ring out this morning. “I ran right to the church,” he told CNN. When he got there, Scallen said “the shots had just stopped” and it was quiet initially, but then people started coming out of the front doors. “There were no police yet or EMTs so I just stayed with them.” Scallen said it appeared that one was shot in the neck and another was possibly grazed by a bullet across her forehead. Another little boy's arm looked to be injured, he said. Eventually, an ambulance arrived and Scallen said he helped flag it down. Scallen, who said he went to the Annunciation Catholic School himself and is still a member of the church, said he hopes “the positive shines through because it's truly a wonderful, caring, loving place.” Zuheir Safe's granddaughter was injured during the shooting Wednesday during a Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, he told CNN affiliate WCCO. “It's very sad, it should not be this way,” he told the reporter as they stood outside of Children's Minnesota hospital. Congressional leadership and Minnesota lawmakers are expressing their condolences and horror following the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. I am praying for all the families impacted by this horrific tragedy. I will continue to closely monitor the situation and provide updates.” Sen. Tina Smith: “My staff and I are monitoring the situation at Annunciation Catholic School. I'm grateful for the quick response of law enforcement as we continue to gather information. These kids should not be fearing for their lives.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar: “I am heartbroken by the horrific violence at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis this morning. House Speaker Mike Johnson: “We are heartbroken over the tragic violence that has occurred at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, and we send our gratitude to law enforcement and the first responders who are on the scene. Our prayers are with the children, families, civilians, law enforcement, and all those impacted by this evil attack.” My prayers are with the students, families, and community. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries: “The shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis is horrifying. Weapons of war have no place in our neighborhoods, streets or schools.” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer: “I'm horrified by the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis and closely monitoring the situation. Students and teachers should not be putting their lives on the line just by going back to school. We must do more to stop gun violence in America.” I am devastated by the news of a mass shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. No one should have to fear for their lives when attending religious services.” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the daughter of one of her former employees watched her friends get shot after a shooter opened fire during a Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis today. “I think this image of this gunman shooting through these windows, picking off these kids while they're praying, is something that is going to be with people for a long time,” Klobuchar said. Children ages 6 to 14 are being treated for injuries at one Minneapolis-area health care system following a fatal shooting at a local Catholic school. Nine of the 11 patients from the attack being treated at Hennepin Healthcare are children ranging in ages from 6 to 11, Thomas Wyatt, Chair of Emergency Medicine at Hennepin Healthcare, said Wednesday. Some pediatric patients are in critical condition, Wyatt noted. At least two children were killed in the shooting, authorities said Wednesday afternoon. Four of the 11 patients received by Hennepin County Medical Center required surgery, Dr. Thomas Wyatt, the chair of emergency medicine, said at a news conference. The assailant who opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School approached on one side of the church building, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said. On that side, at least two doors appeared to be blocked by “like a 2-by-4,” the police chief said. He noted other doors around the building were not blocked. The suspect in the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis is believed to be dead, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said. “We believe it is one suspect, a sole shooter,” O'Hara said. The suspect was in his early 20s and “does not have an extensive known criminal history,” O'Hara said. “He struck children and worshipers that were inside the building.” The initial police response to a shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis can be heard on dispatch audio from Broadcastify.com 509 West 54th St., Minneapolis,” one officer can be heard saying as they ask for assistance. Other officials can be heard discussing possible victims, the medical response and a reunification center. Students have been relocated inside Annunciation Catholic School, where they are reuniting with their families following the fatal shooting at the church, Police Chief Brian O'Hara said Wednesday. The shooting left at least two children dead, authorities said. Despite reports that there were explosives at the scene of Wednesday's shooting, none were found, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said. “There were no explosives or improvised devices that we found.” “Children are dead,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. “There are families that have a deceased child. “Every one of us needs to be wrapping our arms around these families, giving them every ounce that we can muster,” he said. At least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a Catholic church in Minneapolis, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said. The mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School was a “deliberate act of violence,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said. “This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshiping.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The German government has endorsed Defense Minister Boris Pistorius's bill on a new model of military service, the DPA news agency reported. The bill introduces a voluntary military service similar to Sweden, where all school leavers are subject to military examination but only some eventually enter active service. The document also contains certain "mandatory elements," which in particular reinstate the examination of conscripts and oblige all men between 18 and 25 years old to fill out a form with a paragraph on their readiness to perform military service. The authorities aim to make military service more appealing. To this end, they plan to increase military salaries, cover some costs for new recruits, including driving licenses, expand career and training opportunities, and improve access to language courses and sports facilities. Those who decide to remain in the army will receive additional payments. This may occur if the security situation deteriorates and the country faces a shortage of volunteers to ensure national security and carry out NATO missions. Members of the conservative bloc of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CDU/CSU) demanded clarification on how many recruits are expected each year and under what conditions a return to mandatory service would take place. Germany abolished mandatory military service in July 2011, switching to a professional army. The German authorities believe that to fully safeguard the country's security and perform NATO missions, the army needs at least 80,000 more professional soldiers and contract servicemen, as well as about 140,000 reservists.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A suspected shooter at a Minnesota Catholic school is dead, two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter told CNN Wednesday, soon after Gov. Tim Walz lamented yet another “horrific act of violence.” The nature and scope of any injuries was not immediately clear. Authorities are expected to hold a news conference later Wednesday morning. “I'm praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,” the governor said. President Donald Trump has similarly been briefed, he said on Truth Social, calling the incident a “tragic shooting.” “Please join me,” the president said, “in praying for everyone involved!” Hennepin Healthcare, a level 1 trauma center, said on social media it is “caring for patients from the shooting that occurred this morning.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, was “heartbroken” by the news, she said in a post on X. CNN's Chris Boyette and Lily Hautau contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An explosion on Aug. 26 started a fire at the Ryazan-Moscow oil pipeline, a key petroleum product supply route for the Russian capital, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. Russian Telegram channels claimed that a loud blast could be heard at a section of the main pipeline. Since 2018, the pipeline has been repurposed by Transneft, a state-run pipeline operator, to supply automobile gasoline to Moscow. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure through sabotage operations and drone strikes throughout the full-scale war, aiming to undermine Moscow's gas and oil revenues. Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. Everyone involved in the sale of Ukrainian property will be held accountable," the Center of National Resistance said. It is a potential contribution to the peace that our nation has made, and I think we should be proud of it," Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said. It has been over seven months since U.S. President Trump took office, vowing to end Russia's war in Ukraine within 24 hours. The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell explains why Trump's peace effort has failed so far — and what could happen next. Among supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump from the Republican Party, 76% backed sanctions against Russia's trading partners, while Democrats shared this position at 58%. Presidential Office Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov are heading to New York this week to discuss security guarantees and future peace talks, Bloomberg reported. More than 300 Ukrainian soldiers who took part in the Kursk Oblast incursion have been convicted on terrorist charges by Russia this year. The position was most present among supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, with 72% saying that Ukraine should be ready to give up on occupied territories for peace. "Discussing specific details out of context and in public would hardly be helpful to the overall outcome of the matter," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukrainian forces downed 74 out of the 95 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Vilnius reportedly proposes launching technical-level accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova without Hungary, provided the other 26 member states agree. The moves follows Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure, as the paralyzed refineries freed up additional crude oil volumes for export. Vitalii Mazurenko, a Ukrainian journalist and deputy editor-in-chief of the Polish outlet Obserwator Międzynarodowy, was dismissed after insulting Polish President Karol Nawrocki, according to the outlet's statement published on Aug. 27.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. The Trump administration's week of Russian-Ukrainian diplomacy yielded mixed results. At his Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump treated an imperial dictator and indicted war criminal like a revered dignitary. His main goal for the summit—a cease-fire—was rejected outright by Putin, and his most modest objective for the meeting—a commitment by Putin to meet directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with Trump in attendance—has thus far been rebuffed by Moscow, as well. A subsequent summit in Washington, attended by Zelensky and other European leaders, was more productive, as the group discussed potential U.S. and European security guarantees for Kyiv. Before that meeting, the American commitment to security guarantees was ambiguous. Trump's intuition that a deal will require land swaps and security guarantees is correct; Putin will agree to end the war only if he feels that he has won Ukrainian territory, and Zelensky will never agree to cede territory without the promise of protection from a future Russian invasion. But Trump's improvisational attempt to negotiate over both subjects at the same time, with the same groups of leaders, is wrong-headed. Rather than discussing these two issues with everyone all at once, Trump needs to organize two sets of separate negotiations. The order in which these negotiations occur will be key to their success. Trump and his team must first reach an agreement on security guarantees among Ukraine, other European countries, and the United States. Only then should Washington encourage a conversation between Zelensky and Putin about de facto territorial concessions that could bring an end to the war. But if Trump and European leaders can hold successful negotiations with Zelensky before the Ukrainian president sits down with Putin, they have a chance to craft a lasting peace. Putin would have to abandon his maximalist position that Ukraine withdraw its soldiers from the parts of the Donbas that it currently controls. Zelensky will never agree to cede territory to Russia formally—doing so would be political suicide and could even trigger a coup by his own soldiers—but he could instead commit to pursuing reunification only through peaceful means. But the de facto ceding of territory temporarily is preferable to the de jure handing over of land permanently. In fact, it is a necessary condition for an end to the war. For Trump to convince Zelensky, his government, his generals, and the Ukrainian people to accept such a sacrifice, the Ukrainian president would need something substantial in return, and he would need it up front. Before Trump can entice Zelensky to risk his political future on a potential land swap, he must convince him that the United States and its allies in Europe are willing to credibly deter a future Russian invasion. Trump has regrettably already taken off the table NATO membership for Ukraine, which would represent the most credible security guarantee, since Moscow has never attacked a NATO member. But if the United States and Europe are to offer Ukraine a truly credible deterrent, Russia cannot be involved in these talks. Trump and European leaders should not repeat the disaster of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for a toothless assurance that Russia would not attack it (and would, in fact, protect it). Seeking Moscow's permission for security guarantees would also signal weakness from NATO members and represent a tacit acceptance that Ukraine is part of Putin's sphere of influence. A precedent exists for ironing out European security arrangements without consulting Moscow: Washington and Europe did not ask Stalin for the Soviet Union's permission to found NATO in 1949. Six years later, the alliance extended an invitation to West Germany without seeking Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's blessing, despite opposition from some American strategists, most vocal among them former ambassador to the Soviet Union George Kennan, who feared it could provoke a major conflict between the Soviet Union and NATO. Negotiations over security guarantees must be completed before Zelensky agrees to a prolonged Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory. The details of a deal could be kept secret until the border negotiations between Putin and Zelensky are completed and then announced after the new dividing line between Ukraine and Russia is established. But Zelensky and the Ukrainian people cannot agree to such significant concessions without knowing what they are getting in return. Zelensky and his citizens have good reason not to trust the United States right now, given that Trump has periodically cut off military assistance to Ukraine and has thus far not implemented new sanctions on Russia. The United States and its allies must commit to providing meaningful security guarantees before any progress is made on the borders. Negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine remains a long shot. But if any diplomatic resolution brokered by the United States and Europe is to have a chance, it will require an approach from Trump more disciplined and creative than he has shown so far.
