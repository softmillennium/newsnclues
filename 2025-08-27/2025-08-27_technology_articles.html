                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicolas Cage has become his own genre at this point, and for every risky triumph (Longlegs, Dream Scenario, Mandy) or intriguing lurch into the edgier fringes of the mainstream (Renfield, the upcoming Spider-Noir series), there have been several misfires. It remains to be seen where The Carpenter's Son will fall, but the premise is bonkers enough to make us pay attention. We first learned of this film over a year ago, when Deadline explained it would explore “the rarely told story of the childhood of Jesus with a horror take,” noting that writer-director Lotfy Nathan drew “inspiration from the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas for the screenplay. We also got an official synopsis at that time: “The Carpenter's Son tells the dark story of a family hiding out in Roman Egypt. The son, known only as ‘the Boy,' is driven to doubt by another mysterious child and rebels against his guardian, the Carpenter, revealing inherent powers and a fate beyond his comprehension. As he exercises his own power, the Boy and his family become the target of horrors, natural and divine.” Souheila Yacoub (Dune: Part Two) is also in the cast. But that teaser is all Cage, presumably playing the Carpenter, reacting to the “natural and divine” horrors swirling around his grimy existence.

A major round of layoffs at Rec Room impacted 141 employees at the Seattle-based startup according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filing on Wednesday from the Washington State Employment Security Department. In a company blog post, co-founder and CEO Nick Fajt, alongside co-founder Cameron Brown, called the cuts “one of the toughest choices in Rec Room history.” Founded in 2016, Rec Room grew in popularity behind the success of its self-named virtual hangout app, which allows players to make and share games, virtual goods, and other experiences with one another. It raised another $145 million at a $3.5 billion valuation later that year. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google's new $800 Android smartphone looks almost identical to last year's Pixel 9, save for an additional 5x telephoto camera lens and some new colors, including the makes-me-smile Indigo blue. But like most new phones, there are a bunch of small upgrades internally that add up to a better daily experience, even if they're not revolutionary. All of that stuff is good and necessary for a new phone—though, there are some features that are a downgrade—but the real star of the Pixel 10 is AI. Google has injected a heavy dose of AI and Gemini into Android to make the Pixel 10 feel genuinely more personalized and helpful. Android 16, with the new Material 3 Expressive design language, is still a home screen of app icons and widgets that you tap and swipe through. There's a lot of AI to take in and learn, and it'll take more than the one week I've been testing the Pixel 10 to rewire my brain to not only use the phone's many AI features but also remember that they exist. However, I can already see where Google thinks phones are headed—the intersection of phones and AI is inevitable, whether you like it or not. Google's Pixel 10 is less about the tech specs and more about the AI and Gemini features that help you do things faster or easier. The Pixel 10 also supports faster Qi2 wireless charging and the new Pixelsnap magnetic wireless charging puck, which is Google's own version of Apple's MagSafe for iPhones. I'm happy to report that the Pixelsnap puck attached to the Pixel 10 with a satisfying snap, and it's quite strong. There's nothing groundbreaking about any of these upgrades, but I appreciate them all the same, especially the longer battery life and Pixelsnap. The Pixel 10, from a hardware standpoint, may look less appealing when you dig deeper into some of the other specs. They're not bad cameras by any means—Google's own image processing still does a lot of the heavy lifting to tweak photos so that they look decent—but sticking the same cameras from a $500 phone into an $800 one is not going to go over well with nerds. Photos from the Pixel 10 are good enough for posting on Instagram, but if you really zoom in on the details, you'll find less vibrant colors, soft and muddied details, and just an overall lack of sharpness even outdoors. It works, but I wasn't blown away by zoomed-in photos. I'm still a little shocked that Google's camera stack has fallen so behind as it prioritizes AI camera features like Auto Best Shot, which combines several similar images into one “best” shot. Other unforgivables that may upset people include the removal of reverse wireless charging, an LTPS instead of LTPO screen, no vapor chamber for better cooling, and the loss of the SIM card slot for U.S. Pixel 10 models. Like I said in my Nothing Phone 3 review, the real-life gains of an LTPO display that can drop down to a lower refresh rate versus an LTPS screen that can't go as low are negligible. And while eSIM is more widely used nowadays, I still prefer a physical SIM card that I can easily move between devices. I'm no hardcore mobile gamer, but the lack of any vapor chamber is going to have gamers looking at other phones to get their entertainment fix. It's no secret that there's an all-out AI race currently happening. Like every tech company, Google is throwing AI at the wall and seeing what sticks. The rules are being written and rewritten at a speed we've not seen in technology. Even nearly three years after ChatGPT's breakout moment, we're still figuring out what AI is, what it can be, and how it can fit into our lives. The Pixel 10 is a vessel for Google's experiments, and mastering the many AI and Gemini features will require changing a decade-plus of smartphone muscle memory. Samsung and Apple have taken a more reserved approach to adding AI features into their phones, choosing to introduce a few new applications in small doses every year or so. The downside to these slow-and-steady AI drops is that they may not go far enough. The same way people asked more of Siri and then gave up on the assistant when it couldn't do what they requested, if Gemini can't do what Pixel owners ask it to do, then it leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Having tried most AI features in the latest crop of flagship phones, I've noticed a trend, which is thoughtful AI. Google has put a lot of thought into coming up with helpful AI features that should either make doing phone stuff faster or easier. For example, Magic Cue is very well done when it works. The opt-in AI feature suggests relevant information or actions within certain apps, like the Phone, Messages, and Google Maps apps. Instead of manually having to find something like a hotel reservation or flight booking details from within an email, Magic Cue can simply surface it when the AI detects you may be talking about it. You'll know something is a Magic Cue suggestion because it's labeled as such or there's a little rainbow outline around it. Magic Cue is limited right now—I really liked looking up restaurant reviews in Chrome and then seeing the business suggested as an option in Google Maps—but I see the potential. This is just the start of proactive intelligence on phones to help triage all the information we have stored in our apps. While Google has repeatedly said that privacy is core to the Pixels and Google service, and some AI features are processed on devices, only you can decide whether you're comfortable letting any company have what's essentially a map of your digital life. If you're clueless about editing photos or just want to do a quick edit, the “Help me edit” feature can be clutch. Instead of manually moving sliders around or circling things to erase from a photo, you can simply describe how you want a photo to be edited, and Gemini will do it all for you. Results are mostly good, but as with all generative AI, sometimes you'll get some bad or even comical edits. I was surprised by how Gemini nailed “remove shadows from faces.” And don't worry, “Help me edit” works on all photos in your Google Photos library, not just ones you take with the Pixel 10. Voice Translate during phone calls is a potential game-changer. The AI features essentially deepfakes your voice into another language in near real time. In my testing, it was generally fast and accurate with the translations (so I was told by my friends). It still freaks me out to hear my voice speak French or Spanish. At the time of testing, the feature only supports translation for languages to and from English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. I've been learning Mandarin Chinese for over a year, and I'm surprised that a language spoken by about 1 billion people isn't supported at launch but Swedish, which is spoken by around 10 million people is. I also found AI features like Writing Tools in Gboard (basically a spellcheck or style rephraser), the improved Pixel Screenshots (lets you turn screenshots into helpful and searchable notebooks with NotebookLM), and Take a Message (real-time transcriptions for missed or declined calls) useful, though you may never use them at all. A week is simply not enough time to fully immerse myself in all of the Pixel 10's AI features and get a good understanding of how it'll change my phone workflow long-term, but I already know some of the duds I won't be revisiting. There's a feature that lets you turn voice recordings in the Recorder app into music (you choose a vibe such as “chill beats” or “dancy party” and the AI will generate a song); Pixel Studio, which is a better version of Apple's cheesy Image Playground, and uses Imagen 4 to generate images for whatever you might need some media for; Camera Coach lets you point your Pixel 10 camera at a scene and Gemini will suggest a few ways to improve the shot like focusing on certain objects or switching to a different lens or tilting up or down (it's basically photography for dummies). Again, there's a lot of AI and Gemini inside the Pixel 10, and while most of it is easy to understand, it will take longer to sink in. AI is a better way to make sense of all your data. In a table of tech specs comparing the Pixel 10 to other phones starting at $800, like the iPhone 16 or Nothing Phone 3, Google's 10th-generation phone is going to seem like a lesser deal. Apple has yet to get its botched Apple Intelligence act together, and as I already said, Samsung and others are integrating AI with a slower pace, so as not to upset consumers with the unfamiliar. Google has put together the most comprehensive “AI phone” that I've seen. Practical AI that you actually want to use and that actually helps you do things faster and easier is finally here.

Last week, Microsoft pushed a Windows 11 update that was reportedly breaking several SSDs. Chief among them was Phison, a prolific name in the industry whose controllers are used in drives across multiple applications—both consumer and business. Now, Phison has come forward to essentially deny these reports following internal testing, in a new press release. In a statement, the company told Tom's Hardware that "... Phison dedicated over 4,500 cumulative testing hours to the drives reported as potentially impacted and conducted more than 2,200 test cycles. We were unable to reproduce the reported issue, and no partners or customers have reported that the issue affected their drives at this time." Initially, reports suggested that drives powered by Phison controllers were possibly among the most impacted, following errant reports that solely Phison drives were affected by the issue. Phison acknowledged the problem early on and even released a statement to Tom's Hardware confirming that some of their drives may have been affected: "Phison has recently been made aware of the industry-wide effects of the 'KB5063878' and ‘KB5062660' updates on Windows 11 that potentially impacted several storage devices, including some supported by Phison.... At this time, the controllers that may have been affected are under review and we are working with partners." It was falsified information that might've been deliberately targeting Phison rather than helping address the issue in a meaningful way. All of that brings us to the latest event in this chain. "We continue to advise users that for extended workloads, such as transferring large files or decompressing large archives, make sure a proper heatsink or thermal pad is used with the storage device. This helps maintain optimal operating temperatures, reduces the likelihood of thermal throttling, and ensures sustained performance." Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The whole situation has turned into more of a narrative than it should have, with many singling out Phison despite reports of multiple drives being affected. Despite not being able to recreate the issue, it is possible that users of drives, including those powered by Phison controllers, are experiencing issues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new fossil discovery, however, has revealed that the earliest ankylosaurs were several orders of magnitude more badass than their descendants. In a study published today in the journal Nature, researchers describe the partial skeleton of a Spicomellus, a genus of early ankylosaurs, unearthed in Morocco and dating to around 165 million years ago. The finding includes six ribs with spikes, a pelvic shield with long and short spikes, a bony collar with plates and two pairs of spikes—one of them is almost complete and is 34 inches (87 centimeters) long. The fossils indicate that the earliest known ankylosaurs had unique armored features, unparalleled among vertebrates as well as their own ankylosaurian descendants. “The armoured ankylosaurian dinosaurs are best known from Late Cretaceous Northern Hemisphere ecosystems, but their early evolution in the Early–Middle Jurassic is shrouded in mystery due to a poor fossil record,” the researchers wrote in the study. The Jurassic Period lasted from around 201 million years ago to 145 million years ago and was followed by the Cretaceous Period, which ended around 66 million years ago with the infamous dinosaur-killing asteroid. Researchers had previously suggested that a single partial rib also dating to the Middle Jurassic and found in Morocco's Atlas Mountains, belonging to a Spicomellus afer, represented the world's oldest known ankylosaur. If you're thinking a bone fragment isn't much to go on, you're not wrong. That's why the recent discovery is so exciting—it consists of a larger quantity of Spicomellus remains, providing fresh insights into these early ankylosaurs. “Here we describe a new, much more complete specimen that confirms the ankylosaurian affinities of Spicomellus, and demonstrates that it has uniquely elaborate dermal armour unlike that of any other vertebrate, extant or extinct,” the researchers explained. The remains suggest that Spicomellus had a nasty tail weapon, challenging previously held theories that ankylosaurs' tail clubs had only evolved in the Early Cretaceous. Paleontologists Claim to Have Discovered Terrifying New Dinosaur Species in Pre-WWII Photographs The flashy armor “may have functioned for display as well as defence,” with later species in the Late Cretaceous featuring simpler plating with fewer elaborate bumps. Extreme defenses like those seen in ankylosaurs shouldn't come as a surprise—they were the product of a relentless evolutionary arms race. As these predators got bigger, badder, and stronger, prey animals had to keep up with their own evolutionary solutions. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Malaysia has developed its first domestic edge AI processor. Malaysian chip design company SkyeChip announced its MARS1000 processor at an industry event on Monday, Bloomberg reported. While an edge processor isn't as powerful as an advanced Nvidia chip, it still represents a technological milestone for Malaysia, which is looking to play a bigger role in the global AI race. This rule means individuals and companies are required to notify the Malaysian government at least 30 days in advance if they plan to export or transship U.S.-made AI chips.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned an international fraud network used by North Korea to infiltrate U.S. companies with hackers posing as legitimate job seekers, agency officials announced Wednesday. Once employed, the hackers earn a wage from the company, but also steal sensitive company data and extort their employers by demanding a ransom. In a statement Wednesday, the Treasury said the fraud network generated at least $1 million in profits for the North Korean regime, one of many such schemes that have helped raise billions of dollars in stolen funds, including cryptocurrency, to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program. The U.S. says Andreyev worked with a North Korean consular official based in Russia called Kim Ung Sun to launder close to $600,000 in stolen money into cryptocurrency for the regime. Security firm CrowdStrike says North Korean hackers have infiltrated hundreds of companies in the United States alone by using fake documentation and deception techniques to gain employment. The new sanctions mean U.S. companies, or any company doing business with a U.S. company, are barred from transacting or working with those listed by the Treasury. In practice, the Treasury rules put the legal responsibility on hiring companies to ensure they are not hiring North Koreans or other sanctioned individuals by mistake.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even in the final years of his life, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen was as excited as ever about what the future would bring for science, technology, and the world — telling GeekWire in a 2017 interview, “It really is a golden age of what's possible.” Allen's optimism — and the impact of his wealth — will live on in a new nonprofit foundation charged with making bold bets on the future. “Our primary role is to ask big questions and have a big impact,” said Dr. Lynda Stuart, the CEO of the Seattle-based foundation, a physician-scientist with extensive experience in immunology and global health, in an interview with GeekWire. The mission isn't an interpretation of Allen's wishes — it's a direct implementation. Allen personally directed the foundation's formation and focus areas before his 2018 death from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. “With this new foundation, we're bringing Paul's philanthropic vision to bear,” said Jody Allen, in a news release announcing the milestone. While the separate Allen Family Philanthropies will continue to support a wide range of community and arts initiatives — such as its recent $10 million grant to 930 arts and culture organizations across Washington state — FFST is structured to handle large-scale funding for high-impact science and technology projects. That process of estate administration is still under way, and it's expected to continue for years given the size and complexity of what Allen left behind. FFST is starting with a team of six people, based in the building just south of downtown Seattle that houses Vale Group, the new name for what was previously known as Allen's Vulcan holding company. Allen estate spokesperson Hunke did not answer the question of whether FFST will eventually take over funding for the Allen Institute and AI2 as part of its bioscience and AI mandates, saying that the new foundation's “funding priorities will be driven by its strategy, which will be revealed over time.” While FFST will eventually fund projects nationally and internationally, its inaugural grants are strategic investments in Allen's hometown. Dr. Jane Buckner, BRI president, explained that this type of core infrastructure is vital for many projects but difficult to support through traditional, project-specific grants. In an unstable funding environment, long-term investments like the biorepository are often the first things to be cut, even though their value increases over time. It's a “unique vision that they've brought to the table,” Buckner said of FFST's efforts to fund resources that will help the broader bioscience community. The grant to Seattle Children's will ensure continued funding for research and development of off-the-shelf cell therapies — treatments that can be made in advance and given to any patient without the need for custom, single-patient manufacturing. Dr. Colleen Delaney, VP and chief medical officer at Seattle Children's Therapeutics, said the funding will help keep trials moving forward. She described it as critical at a time when federal support for scientific research has been under attack. For the broader community, Delaney said, FFST's funding offers “a unique opportunity to bring us together and to reimagine how quickly we get things done.” Stuart said the new foundation doesn't see its role as filling gaps left by federal funding cuts. Instead, she said, FFST will be guided by its larger mission, aligned with Allen's vision of making a lasting impact in science and technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Second-hand A100 and H100 accelerators are being rebuilt into custom inference systems. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. China's AI industry is quietly turning to refurbished and second-hand Nvidia GPUs after fresh curbs on the company's H20 accelerator left customers scrambling for alternatives. The H20, a cut-down Hopper-based GPU designed specifically to comply with U.S. export restrictions, was meant to keep Nvidia in the Chinese market. According to a recent report by Digitimes, this has led to surging demand for older A100 and H100 cards as firms strip down and reconfigure them into “low-cost, high-performance” custom inference systems. Models don't require full floating-point precision, and workloads can run efficiently on hardware that's been trimmed or reconfigured. The A100 was built on Nvidia's Ampere architecture, with up to 80GB of HBM2e memory and 2 TBps bandwidth. While it lacks Hopper's peak throughput, it remains highly effective for inference tasks thanks to its large memory pool and mature CUDA software ecosystem. For workloads like chatbots and recommendation engines, developers can still achieve cost-efficient results without cutting-edge silicon. By contrast, the H20 was tuned for inference but cut back so aggressively that it delivers between three and nearly seven times less AI performance than a full H100, and more than thirty times slower in FP64 supercomputing tasks. With Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem still unrivaled, older cards remain plug-and-play for developers. And because inference hardware can run around the clock with lower risk of accuracy loss, China's data centers are evidently happy to pay for refurbished boards even as reliability declines. The company took a $5.5 billion write-down on unsold H20 inventory when Washington introduced licensing requirements for its export to China. Yet, paradoxically, its GPUs remain the catalyst of China's ongoing AI boom. This is a double-edged sword for Nvidia: Its chips still dominate, but gray market channels risk eroding margins and slowing the adoption of newer architectures. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The gray market is also hugely problematic for Beijing, which is eager for its own competing firms like Huawei and Biren to scale. Every second-hand, stripped-down H100 racked in a Chinese data center is another system not running on Ascend accelerators, which could potentially slow domestic investments. Instead, the result is a recycling economy where yesterday's A100s and H100s continue to power tomorrow's AI deployments. For now, China's AI industry is making do with pragmatism, stretching the useful life of older Nvidia hardware while waiting for both political and technological roadblocks to clear. Although his background is in legal, he has a personal interest in all things tech, especially hardware and microelectronics, and anything regulatory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It's a popular grip attachment that's been around for years, originally designed for smartphones with a Kickstarter that launched back in 2012. That's still the PopGrips' main use, but plenty of people stick them on the back of a Kindle case to make their Kindle easier to hold. PopSockets just dropped its first collection of Kindle cases, called the PopCase Kindle, that have a built-in MagSafe adapter so you can easily attach the PopSockets grip of your choice onto the case. The cases retail for $40 and come without a grip, so you can either choose one that matches the style of your new case or use one you already have. For now there will be four basic colors, plus two designs from the PopSockets Bookish collection, adding a new layer of options to the world of Kindle accessories. PopSockets also says more design options are to come. I got to try out the 7-inch cases with my Kindle Paperwhite and Colorsoft. Here are my thoughts so far, and what you need to know to see if they're a good fit for your favorite e-reader. I have small hands and was initially worried about the reach required to access the center of my e-reader while using it with a PopCase Kindle. It has a wider top that my fingers could reach more easily than the standard sizes. Overall, the PopCase Kindle was comfortable to use on these 7-inch devices, and using a PopSockets grip on your Kindle is a nice way to distribute the weight across your hand. I've got a wrist cyst that often makes holding a Kindle too long uncomfortable, but switching to the PopSockets Kindle case-and-grip combos really did take weight off my thumb and wrist while I held my Kindle. I didn't get to test it out on the basic Kindle, but I think this would also be comfortable to use on that model since it's even slimmer, making the PopSockets easier to reach. I noticed it more than one typically would, since I was intentionally swapping around several PopSockets grips to test the case, but it was an interesting side effect of adding the MagSafe case onto a Kindle. The cases themselves are made of flexible plastic that's easy to attach to your Kindle, but they don't feel flimsy. There's no option right now for the Scribe, but given its size, I'm not sure there's a good spot to put a PopSockets grip on the Kindle's digital notebook and e-reader hybrid. There are four basic colors so far: Clear, Black, Gingham, and Aura, all of which are similar to PopSockets phone cases in the same colors. There are also two designs from the Bookish collection, both of which I tested and found to be beautiful prints. I really like that there are designs that cover your whole Kindle, and some semi-clear options, too, along with a true clear. My favorite pairing I tested was the Curled Up With a Good Book PopCase ($40) and PopGrip ($30) from the Bookish collection, which not only matched the case and grip but also left about a quarter of my Kindle's case uncovered, allowing the raspberry-pink shade to peek out. It pairs nicely with the pink and purple books on the cover, making it feel like an intentional pairing rather than a kismet test sample. The matching set is a really fun option, and a few colors are available—there's an Aura PopGrip ($30) that you can pair with the Aura case, and a Red Gingham PopGrip ($30) that you can pair with the black and white Gingham case ($40). The PopSockets case and grip range offers a variety of choices to mix and match, allowing you to swap out the grip for a new look whenever you want. These cases aren't cheap, especially compared to other simple designs and clear cases you can find and customize with stickers on Amazon for $10. A MagSafe adapter also typically retails for under $10, so you can still DIY this if you're on a budget. I think these cases are a great option for individuals who already have a PopSockets grip collection and want to attach them to their favorite e-reader more easily. However, if you're new to the PopSockets world, purchasing a new PopCase and a PopGrip will cost you $70. Still, they really feel like they're made to last, rather than being just a cheap sheet of clear plastic. The matching sets are really fun in my eyes, but you'll also find me sticking the Heart of Silver on every Kindle I own from here on out.

We've come across our fair share of 3D printers here at Tom's Hardware. We've even covered a handful of clever Lego-based projects. Most people would rather buy a printer and get busy printing, but Zealousideal-Army333 truly channeled their inner maker when coming up with this idea. The entire 3D printer body was put together from scratch and, being an original idea, this inevitably took a look time to complete, as confirmed by Zealousideal-Army333 in the original project thread. A handful of motors make this design possible. Zealousideal-Army333 put together a custom script that is able to read Marlin gcode and translate that into workable instructions to print the object. This means the Lego 3D printer is able to print regular gcode files without any special processing. Surely you're wondering how well a Lego-based 3D printer performs. Sure, you can print a Benchy but it's going to take several tries and the patience of a saint to see it through. Let's say that you're willing to see past those shortcomings for the delightful novelty of a Lego 3D printer—be ready to fork out plenty of cash. You're going to spend almost twice as much as you would on something like an Ender (the Ender 3 V3 is one of our favorites). This project requires more than just Lego bricks, you'll need motors, gears, technic frames, a 3D printing pen and more. Still, we recommend anyone interested in 3D printing snag a 3D printer for themselves rather than build one out of Lego bricks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor in chief Mat Honan reflects on how Gen Z is thinking about the rise of AI. When I picked up my daughter from summer camp, we settled in for an eight-hour drive through the Appalachian mountains, heading from North Carolina to her grandparents' home in Kentucky. With little to no cell service for much of the drive, we enjoyed the rare opportunity to have a long, thoughtful conversation, uninterrupted by devices. No one is excited about it,” she told me of her high-school-age peers. “Because,” she replied, “it seems like all the jobs we thought we wanted to do are going to go away.” I was struck by her pessimism, which she told me was shared by friends from California to Georgia to New Hampshire. In an already fragile world, one increasingly beset by climate change and the breakdown of the international order, AI looms in the background, threatening young people's ability to secure a prosperous future. Just a few days before our drive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was telling the US Federal Reserve's board of governors that AI agents will leave entire job categories “just like totally, totally gone.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told Axios he believes AI will wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company will eliminate jobs in favor of AI agents in the coming years. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke told staff they had to prove that new roles couldn't be done by AI before making a hire. And the view is not limited to tech. Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, recently said he expects AI to replace half of all white-collar jobs in the US. These are no longer mere theoretical projections. Hiring of new grads is down, for example, in sectors like tech and finance. For Gen Z, the issue is broader than employment. It also touches on another massive generational challenge: climate change. AI is computationally intensive and requires massive data centers. Meta and OpenAI have announced plans for data centers that will require five gigawatts of power just for their ­computing—enough to power the entire state of Maine in the summertime. That means more carbon dioxide emissions for an already warming world. Data centers also require vast amounts of water. There are communities right now that are literally running out of water because it's being taken by nearby data centers, even as climate change makes that resource more scarce. Proponents argue that AI will make the grid more efficient, that it will help us achieve technological breakthroughs leading to cleaner energy sources and, I don't know, more butterflies and bumblebees? But xAI is belching CO2 into the Memphis skies from its methane-fueled generators right now. Google's electricity demand and emissions are skyrocketing today. Things would be different, my daughter told me, if it were obviously useful. But for much of her generation, she argued, it's a looming threat with ample costs and no obvious utility: “It's not good for research because it's not highly accurate. One teacher told us we're all going to be janitors.” And yet there are other urgent problems that we need to address to build security and prosperity for coming generations. This September/October issue is about our attempts to make the world more secure. We're also introducing three new columns in this issue, from some of our leading writers: The Algorithm, which covers AI; The Checkup, on biotech; and The Spark, on energy and climate. You'll see these in future issues, and you can also subscribe online to get them in your inbox every week. This story was part of our September/October 2025 issue. An exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment. It's now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer. But it's still far short of AGI. Discover special offers, top stories, upcoming events, and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They were being offered $8,000 per month to take part in a secretive program aimed at bolstering Democratic messaging on the internet. Among other issues, it mandated extensive secrecy about disclosing their payments and had restrictions on what sort of political content the creators could produce. “Should we send a joint email (with all of our email addresses) … or, are we just going to send things separately and hope they change everything for everyone?” Laurenzo, a nonbinary creator in Columbus, Ohio, with over 884,000 TikTok followers, asked the group. “Any Newsies fans here?” Eliza Orlins, a public defender and reality TV star known for her appearances on Survivor, posted in the group. They represented some of the most well-known voices online posting in support of Democrats, and they're key to wherever the party moves next. But ultimately, the group didn't make much progress. “Reading through this revised Chorus contract like: you win some, you lose some,” a reproductive justice influencer named Pari, who posts under the handle @womeninamerica, responded later in the thread. “I also think there's at least 4 other things that should change 🤣but the vibe I got from their email was that there would be minimal, if any, changes.” (Laurenzo, Orlins, and Pari did not reply to requests for comment.) “I don't feel strongly about pushing tbh,” Aaron Parnas, a Gen Z news influencer who has been called the Gen Z Walter Cronkite and has been lauded in legacy media outlets, posted to the chat. Seems like a take it or leave it.” (Parnas declined to comment.) In 2024, President Joe Biden's White House snubbed several prominent content creators after they lightly criticized the administration over its policies on climate change, Covid, Gaza, and the TikTok ban. Content creators who challenged Kamala Harris—including Hasan Piker, a well-known influencer on the left—were similarly unwelcome at campaign events. After the Democrats lost in November, they faced a reckoning. While Republicans spent decades building a powerful and robust independent media infrastructure, maximizing controversy to drive attention and maintaining tight relationships with creators despite their small disagreements with Trump, the Democrats have largely relied on outdated strategies and traditional media to get their message out. Some creators also raised concerns about a slew of restrictive clauses in the contract. Influencers included in communication about the program, and in some cases an onboarding session for those receiving payments from The Sixteen Thirty Fund, include Olivia Julianna, the centrist Gen Z influencer who spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention; Loren Piretra, a former Playboy executive turned political influencer who hosts a podcast for Occupy Democrats; Barrett Adair, a content creator who runs an American Girl Doll–themed pro-DNC meme account; Suzanne Lambert, who has called herself a “Regina George liberal;” Arielle Fodor, an education creator with 1.4 million followers on TikTok; Sander Jennings, a former TLC reality star and older brother of trans influencer Jazz Jennings; David Pakman, who hosts an independent progressive show on YouTube covering news and politics; Leigh McGowan, who goes by the online moniker “Politics Girl”; and dozens of others. Dozens of liberal influencers are believed to have been approached by Chorus about The Sixteen Thirty Fund financing opportunity this spring. They were told that Chorus appreciated the work they were doing online and were asked if they'd be interested in being part of the first cohort of a new program that Chorus was running to help “expand their reach and impact,” creators tell WIRED. But following the initial outreach, many creators expressed concern about some stipulations. According to copies of the contract viewed by WIRED, creators in the program must funnel all bookings with lawmakers and political leaders through Chorus. Creators also have to loop Chorus in on any independently organized engagements with government officials or political leaders. Creators in the program are not allowed to use any funds or resources that they receive as part of the program to make content that supports or opposes any political candidate or campaign without express authorization from Chorus in advance and in writing, per the contract. The contracts reviewed by WIRED prohibit standard partnership disclosures, declaring that creators will “not publicize” their relationship with Chorus or tell others that they're members of the program “without Chorus's prior express consent.” They also forbid creators from “disclos[ing] the identity of any Funder” and give Chorus the ability to force creators to remove or correct content based solely on the organization's discretion if that content was made at a Chorus-organized event. “It gives us the ability to raise money from donors. We don't need to deal with any of that. Your names aren't showing up on, like, reports filed with the FEC.” (Wilson did not reply to a request for comment.) Those messaging check-ins are led by Cohen on “rapid response days.” The creators also have to attend at least two Chorus “newsroom” events per month, which are events Chorus plans, often with lawmakers. Elizabeth Dubois, an assistant professor and university research chair in politics, communication, and technology at the University of Ottawa who has researched the ways influencers are reshaping the US political system, says that “we are seeing influencers being pulled into these dark campaigns or shadow campaigns, where the legal aspect is murky at best.” “Sometimes it is actually clear that influencers are being used to, for example, evade spending limits,” she says. “I think that we need to remember that for democracy to thrive, we do need transparency around who is paying for political messages.” “If the contract for getting money from a particular interest group says you can't disclose it, then it's pretty simple, you can't take the money,” he says. “We're living in an era where a lot of powerful people have basically taken the rule book and thrown it out the window.” Keith Edwards, a Democratic content creator who has skyrocketed to fame on YouTube since starting his channel last year, was not invited to be part of the program but believes that the way it was structured seemed “predatory.” He says that he would never agree to take part in a program that was run in secret or wouldn't allow him to disclose funding. “What I don't understand is, why wouldn't you just donate to creators directly who have already built something and just need to put gasoline on the fire?” says Edwards. But they still think influencers are just there to do a terrible direct-to-camera interview that no one watches rather than just treating us like another form of media.” At least one cohort was specifically told they could not have their lawyers redline it. “I don't think [Chorus is] out to screw us,” Orlins, a creator who was offered $8,000 per month, said in the group chat. (Some influencers for Chorus Creator Incubator Program were offered as little as $250 per month, according to one creator who declined to accept the deal, while others were offered membership into the “amplifier” cohort, which provides up to $8,000 per month.) Its website notes that issues supported by the organization include economic equity, affordable health care, climate solutions, racial justice, voter access, and other “essential social-change goals.” The organization was founded in 2009 as a liberal response to conservative dark money groups and organizations like the Koch network, and under Trump it has soared. In 2020, the fund distributed more than $400 million, according to the organization's public tax filing, which Politico said was used in “efforts to unseat then-president Donald Trump and Republicans' Senate majority.” In 2022, The Sixteen Thirty Fund spent $196 million backing state ballot measures on abortion rights heading into the midterms, according to NBC. “The Sixteen Thirty Fund, which is not required to disclose its contributors, has for years been a major funding source for liberal and progressive causes and groups, including those that spend in elections,” says Walker Davis, a research director for the open-government group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Chorus, which is described in contracts reviewed by WIRED as a “project of” The Sixteen Thirty Fund that handles operations for the creator program, launched in November 2024 as a nonprofit arm of Good Influence, a for-profit influencer marketing agency aimed at helping content creators connect with social-good campaigns. Good Influence was founded in October 2020 by Stuart Perelmuter, the former communications director for representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky. Seeing an opportunity after Kamala Harris' loss last November, Perelmuter cofounded Chorus with Democratic influencer Brian Tyler Cohen, who has over 4.6 million subscribers on YouTube and leads messaging check-ins for the creator cohort on “rapid response days.” According to records reviewed by WIRED, Chorus claims that its initial creator cohort has a collective audience of more than 40 million followers with more than 100 million weekly viewers and that the organization has “hundreds of creators signed up” and “ready to amplify” messaging. “Our political systems haven't been able to figure out a real solution, and I've been really excited to see you all treading the path forward. I deeply, deeply believe that the work you all are doing is what's going to make the difference in supporting and frankly resuscitating our democracy.” “Follow these creators bringing you hope instead of doomscrolling: @sander_jennings, @eorlins, @jesscraven101, @tono.latino, @gemma_talks, @thezactivist,” they posted. While some creators have been eager to work with Chorus, others distrust the organization. This spring, Chorus faced a wave of backlash from prominent content creators whose images were included in the firm's fundraising decks without permission. “I was included on some [of Chorus'] decks like, ‘We have access to V,' when you do not,” said V Spehar, a liberal content creator with over 3.5 million followers on TikTok. However, users who clicked the button were taken to a fundraising page for Chorus instead of anywhere their dollars would go directly to the creators featured. Progressive YouTuber and former Media Matters staffer Kat Abughazaleh, who's running for Congress in Illinois, was pictured on Chorus' website and included in fundraising decks without her consent. “What we need is for people to invest in independent media, and that doesn't necessarily mean investing in a consulting group that is going to become a middleman for independent media,” says Spehar. Several influencers who doggedly defended Chorus throughout that controversy, including Elizabeth Booker Houston, a Democratic comedian and content creator on Instagram, and Allie O'Brien, a progressive creator with more than 600,000 followers on TikTok, were involved in membership talks for the highest-paid tier in Chorus' new creator incubator program. One creator named Chesko, who goes by @thespeechprof online, applied to join the program because he viewed it as an “opportunity to get access to people that have funding or backing and actual research that I could use,” he says. Ultimately, he wasn't accepted and received an email on June 26 rejecting his application. Republicans have spent decades building up a powerful independent media ecosystem, though the right-wing influencer world is far from transparent. In September 2024, a federal indictment alleged that the Russian state-sponsored network RT was covertly providing millions in funding to Tenet Media, a company working with major right-wing influencers including Benny Johnson, Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, and Lauren Southern. In 2024, the National Republican Congressional Committee spent nearly $500,000 on work with Creator Grid, an influencer marketing company whose website says it “connects Republican candidates with the internet's most powerful conservative influencers,” according to analysis of campaign finance filings from The Washington Post.
