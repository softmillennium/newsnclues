Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 4: Badly described races

Why did Cadillac choose Bottas and Perez for their 2026 line-up?

See which driver's got the smarts in the final episode of Grill the Grid for 2025.

We like to think our Grill the Grids are pretty fiendish – but our producers really had it in for the F1 drivers with the final round of the series for 2025.

The current field were asked to guess the Grand Prix and the year in which it took place from some pretty opaque descriptions – with each question involving three separate clues, and points on offer from three down to one depending on how many of those clues the drivers required.

It was tricky enough to make Kick Sauber driver Nico Hulkenberg plead “help me” to his press officer waiting in the wings – as the drivers' efforts set the final scores for the 2025 Grill the Grid championship.

Hit play on the video above to see who aced the final round of Grill the Grid – and find out which driver was crowned the series champion for 2025.

Oscar Piastri remains at the top of the Drivers' Championship ahead of Round 15, but his lead now stands at just nine points from McLaren team mate Lando Norris following the Briton's victory last time out in Hungary. There is likely to be plenty of fan support for Max Verstappen as the Dutchman enters into his home weekend. Red Bull struggled for pace at the Hungaroring, but can they bounce back this time out?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why did Cadillac choose Bottas and Perez for their 2026 line-up? Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will resume their intra-team fight at the upcoming Dutch Grand Prix. Oscar Piastri has taken a moment to reflect on his battle against McLaren team mate Lando Norris this season, with the championship situation finely poised ahead of the decisive 10-round run-in. While there have been some dramatic moments, such as a collision at the Canadian Grand Prix and close calls during wheel-to-wheel scraps in Austria and Hungary, the two drivers have maintained cordial relations. “Our relationship hasn't really changed,” Piastri, who leads Norris by a slender margin of nine points, explained in an interview for the official McLaren website. That is not lost on either of us. Healthy competition is important, of course, but it is important to keep the team united, and I think we both have that in the back of our minds.” Piastri, who is navigating his third season in F1, compared to Norris' seventh, also reflected more generally on how he has dealt with the weight of being in contention for the title. “Obviously, you don't want to give away points, but it has been far too early to be thinking of the season in that way. Looking ahead, though, Piastri admitted: “The pressure is only going to increase from here. While Piastri and Norris' head-to-head looks set to rumble on, McLaren are cruising towards back-to-back Teams' Championship titles for the first time since 1991 – boasting more than double the points of second-placed Ferrari in the standings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why did Cadillac choose Bottas and Perez for their 2026 line-up? Jonathan Wheatley has embarked on a new challenge with Kick Sauber this season, having previously acted as Sporting Director for Red Bull across many years. Jonathan Wheatley has shared what he has been able to carry forward from his time with Red Bull through to his new role as Team Principal at Kick Sauber, with the Briton having “immersed” himself in the Hinwil-based outfit since joining back in April. Acting as Sporting Director, Wheatley worked for the championship-winning team until 2024, when it was confirmed that he would join Kick Sauber as their new Team Principal in April 2025 ahead of the outfit transitioning into Audi's works squad for the 2026 season. When asked during a chat with Sky Sports F1 if he had taken anything from his extensive stint at Red Bull to his new position, Wheatley reflected on delivering a “cultural philosophy”. “You have to absorb yourself in the team, you have to immerse yourself in it,” he explained. “It's a very young team and I think people forget that. A lot of people here only started in January or February so we're knitting together the team. I'm excited about it – we're making steps, we're gaining momentum, and of course this business is all about momentum.” Nico Hulkenberg is currently an impressive P9 in the Drivers' Standings on 37 points, while rookie team mate Gabriel Bortoleto sits in P17 on a tally of 14.</p>
