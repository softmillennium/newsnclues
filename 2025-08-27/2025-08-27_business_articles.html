                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift's engagement announcement on Tuesday sparked the latest example of the celebrity's influence in America's corporate and economic world. The "Love Story" singer's joint social media post sharing the update with her now fiancé, NFL player Travis Kelce, sent fans buzzing — and even some stocks and prediction markets moving. Signet Jewelers, one of few publicly traded jewelry companies on major exchanges, jumped more than 6% on Wednesday. That builds on gain of around 3% in Tuesday's session, which included a pop directly following Swift and Kelce's afternoon post. That jump comes after fans raced the decipher what type of ring Swift opted for from the photos. Multiple industry professionals confirmed the diamond was a cushion cut. Ralph Lauren, whose clothes both halves of the couple seemed to sport in the pictures, rose 0.5% on Wednesday after gaining 2% a day earlier. Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans said Swift's apparent preference for the brand is a positive for the stock. "For a company that states it is not only in the clothing business but in the dreams business, we view this outcome as mission success," Helgans wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. American Eagle shares jumped more than 8% on Wednesday after the retailer announced a collaboration with Kelce's sportswear brand Tru Kolors. Kelce is headlining a campaign tied to the collection. Domino's Pizza and GrubHub pushed alerts to app users, with each referencing Swift's songs and including a ring emoji. Soda producer Poppi shared an Instagram photo themed to the duo's social media caption. Prediction markets also lit up on the latest cultural moment. Swift has been considered an economic engine coming out of the pandemic. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the latest round of Covid vaccines in the U.S., but set new limits on who can get them. The agency ended its broader authorization of the shots, only clearing them for people at higher risk of severe illness. That includes those 65 and up and younger adults with at least one underlying condition that puts them at higher risk. The move could complicate access to the shots for millions of Americans, and raises questions about whether insurance plans will still cover them for healthy adults. "The emergency use authorizations for Covid vaccines, once used to justify broad mandates on the general public during the Biden administration, are now rescinded," Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a post on X. "The American people demanded science, safety, and common sense," he said. It follows several efforts by Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, to change and undermine immunizations in the U.S. The new limited authorizations are a break from U.S. vaccine policy in previous years, which recommended an annual Covid shot for all Americans 6 months and up. A key panel of vaccine advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must vote to recommend the Covid shots. But Kennedy earlier this year gutted that panel and named new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics. In the post, Kennedy said the shots are available for all patients who choose them after consulting with their doctors. But it's unclear how easily patients without high risk factors will be able to get a Covid vaccine. Kennedy said the FDA has authorized Moderna's shot for those 6 months and up, Pfizer's vaccine for people ages five and up and Novavax's jab for those ages 12 and up, but for those specifically at higher risk of getting severely sick from the virus. Adults ages 65 and up are at higher risk of severe Covid, and so are younger adults who are immunocompromised or have underlying medication conditions such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart diseases, according to the CDC's website. In a release, Pfizer confirmed that the FDA had cleared its updated Covid shot for use in adults 65 and above and those ages five through 64 with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe illness. Shares of Pfizer and Moderna were trading slightly higher Wednesday afternoon, while Novavax shares dipped. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Adults ages 65 and up are at higher risk of severe Covid, and so are younger adults who are immunocompromised or have underlying medical conditions such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart diseases, according to the CDC's website. The end of the so-called emergency use authorizations means that Pfizer's shot is no longer cleared for children ages 6 months to 4 years. It comes after Pfizer in August said it has requested that the FDA keep that authorization in place for the upcoming fall and winter season. In a release, Pfizer confirmed that the FDA had cleared its updated Covid shot for use in adults 65 and above and those ages five through 64 with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe illness. In a separate release, Moderna also confirmed that its updated Covid shot is approved for those 65 and up and people 6 months through 64 years of age who are at higher risk of severe illness. The company added that its new, next-generation Covid vaccine is approved for older adults and high-risk patients ages 12 through 64. But the American Academy of Pediatrics diverged from the agency earlier this month, recommending Covid shots for children between 6 months and 2 years old. In a statement on Wednesday, Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, called the FDA's more limited approval "deeply troubling." "Any parent who wants their child vaccinated should have access to this vaccine," she said. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also advised pregnant women to get the Covid vaccine to protect themselves and their infants, who cannot be immunized until they are 6 months old.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saudi Arabia is looking to make data its new oil — if artificial intelligence and data center company Humain gets its way. The company, owned by the Saudi kingdom's massive sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, is looking to build out data center capacity in a country with seemingly unlimited land and abundant energy resources. Faced with lower oil prices and soaring costs for domestic megaprojects like the futuristic region of Neom, the kingdom is hoping that surging demand for the data and computing facilities will serve as a reliable cash cow for decades to come. Launched in May of this year, just a day before U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to the Kingdom, Humain aims to deliver full-stack AI capabilities across data centers, infrastructure, cloud platforms and advanced AI models, which it hopes will position Saudi Arabia as the region's AI hub. Saudi Arabia faces stiff competition from the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which is forging ahead with its own major partnerships with U.S. tech giants on a number of projects, including the Stargate Campus in Abu Dhabi. The Stargate Project is a $500 billion private sector AI-focused investment vehicle, announced by OpenAI in January in partnership with Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX and Japan's SoftBank, and will be built with the help of Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco Systems. While Saudi Arabia's data center market is projected to grow from $1.33 billion in 2024 to $3.9 billion by 2030, it still has a long way to go before reaching the scale of the U.S. market, currently valued at over $200 billion. Further questions remain as to the cost and environmental impact of running and cooling miles of data centers in the Middle East's scorching deserts, as well as the ability to draw AI engineers to live in Saudi Arabia. Access to skill and talent remains a major challenge — to bridge that gap, Saudi Arabia relies heavily on foreign talent, with professionals that require high salaries and often don't stay in the kingdom for a sustained period of time. Even with the offer of ample pay, drawing and retaining AI engineers will prove difficult for the kingdom. AI-related roles in Saudi Arabia remain largely vacant, with a 50% hiring gap, according to Minister of Human Resources and Social Development Ahmed Al-Rajhi. In comparison to the UAE, which has a more consistent strategy of attracting investment and executing government strategy, Saudi Arabia is more likely to "struggle" when it comes to AI engineers, said Baghdad Gherras, a UAE-based venture partner at Antler, which invests in early-stage AI ventures. Humain does not disclose investment targets, but has announced $23 billion for strategic technology partnerships and a $10 billion venture fund. The PIF, which owns it, oversees nearly $1 trillion in assets across a wide swathe of sectors and countries. Any startup that is really addressing my number one requirement ... the joint IP creation, the localization, workload consumptions in Saudi, is really where we're going and investing capital in," Amin said. "So I'm putting a lot of capital in infrastructure, meaning, think about Groq and other companies that we will be investing in, and then the application layers." California-based AI company Groq in February secured a $1.5 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia for expanded delivery of its chips. This deployment of Groq AI inference infrastructure is now enabling service to the EMEA and South Asia markets in ways unseen before," the company said earlier this year in a statement. Humain is also in partnership with U.S. chipmaking giants AMD and Nvidia, for chips that will supply Humain's ambitious data center construction plans. The PIF-owned firm has started construction on two large campuses in the kingdom made up of 11 data centers. By the fourth quarter of 2025 Humain wants 50 megawatts built, followed by an additional 50 megawatts every quarter into 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with 49-year-old Damon Duncan, who is based in Atlanta. His identity and salary have been verified by Business Insider. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I was laid off from my job as a sales engineer in April 2023. That was the last job I had in my career field. It's now been over two years since I worked in the technical sales field. I took a couple of related roles after my company went through a merger, but was laid off for a second time in August 2024 and was unemployed until I took a drastic step back — both in position and pay. When I sit with them in the common room, they're like, "This is my first big boy job fresh out of college," and I'm sitting here, almost 50 years old, with a child about to go to college. I am now making about one-third of what I made at my sales engineering job. The layoff cost us a lot of money, and because of it, we don't travel anymore. Our credit also took a massive hit during this time, and we weren't able to cosign on a loan for our daughter to go to college. So she decided to take a gap year and start at a local tech school while she builds up savings and credit to be able to take out loans and transfer. We've had to cancel a lot of services. Typically, we could hire somebody to do some of the bigger things, but now I have to do them on the weekend. So now, instead of spending my weekends with my family, I spend them fixing things around the house, like rebuilding a staircase, working on cars, painting rooms, replacing light fixtures, AC plugs, light switches, and other such projects. We couldn't afford to fix my daughter's car, so we had to get rid of it. Now we're down to two cars instead of three. We have to carpool a lot, which isn't a big deal, but it does inconvenience us from time to time. So, I'm on the road two hours a day. I am trying to get back into the field that supported me for the better part of 20 years, but nobody is hiring or interviewing me. Since being laid off in 2023, I've applied to hundreds jobs. I did get one offer last year, but it was rescinded because of company changes. I still apply to anywhere between two and five jobs a day. No matter what I do to my résumé or how much outreach I do, it feels like it doesn't matter. I've been doing everything that they tell me to do, and I might as well be throwing darts at a piece of paper, hoping they land and don't fall. I don't understand the market anymore. They don't realize that I'm applying to the job not only because it's a job in my field, but also because I see it as a possible career. I've got three kids, one of whom is about to go to college and two more on the way. I got my daughters' weddings to pay for in the future. There may also be some ageism at play here. If that doesn't prove how scrappy we are and how willing we are to get the job done and to work, I don't know what does. Have you struggled to find a job?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A gunman killed two young children and injured 17 people gathered at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis for a service on Wednesday to mark the first week of the parish's school, police said. Fourteen of the injured are children, two of whom are in critical condition, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference. The children who died were 8 and 10 years old, O'Hara said. The shooter is dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, he said. The gunman, armed with a rifle, a pistol and a shotgun, and clad in black cargo-style pants, positioned himself on the outside of the building and began firing through windows toward the children, who were sitting in pews. The shooter, who is in his 20s and does not have an extensive criminal history, is believed to have acted alone, O'Hara said. The chief said he was not aware if the shooter was a former employee or student of Annunciation. "The sheer cruelty and cowardice, the firing into a church full of children, is absolutely incomprehensible," O'Hara said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said: "Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. "There are no words that can capture the horror and the evil of this unspeakable act," Frey said. "Do not think of these as just somebody else's kids. Those families are suffering immense pain right now. Think of this as if it were your own," the mayor added. Victims have been admitted to two different hospitals. The nine children being treated at Hennepin Healthcare Hospital are between 6 and 14 years old, the hospital said at a news conference. Tim Walz said that he had been briefed on the shooting and that he was "praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence." President Donald Trump spoke to Walz after the shooting, a White House official told NBC. Trump wrote on Truth Social later Wednesday morning, "I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota." The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation. Please join me in praying for everyone involved!" These kids should not be fearing for their lives," Smith wrote. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ByteDance, the owner of short-video app TikTok, is set to launch a new employee share buyback that will value the Chinese technology giant at more than $330 billion, driven by continued revenue growth, said three people with knowledge of the matter. The latest buyback at a higher valuation will come as ByteDance consolidates its position as the world's largest social media company by revenue, with its second-quarter revenue up 25% year-on-year, the people said. That jump resulted in the company's second-quarter revenue hitting about $48 billion, two of the people said, most of which is from the Chinese market as it continues to face political pressure to divest its U.S. arm. ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 1 social media company by sales, topping Facebook and Instagram owner Meta's $42.3 billion in that period. Both firms maintained sales growth above 20% in the second quarter, helped by robust advertising demand. ByteDance's biannual buybacks allow employees of the privately held company to cash out some holdings and reflect a balance sheet strengthened by its expanding domestic and international businesses. Many, including SpaceX and OpenAI, use external investor capital to fund these programmes. ByteDance has been an outlier, steadily using its own balance sheet in a signal of financial flexibility and healthy margins. ByteDance is also widely regarded as one of China's artificial intelligence leaders, having invested billions of dollars in buying Nvidia chips, building AI-related infrastructure and developing its models. Despite outpacing Meta on revenue this year, ByteDance's valuation remains less than a fifth of Meta's roughly $1.9 trillion market capitalization - a gap analysts attribute largely to political and regulatory risks in the U.S. ByteDance faces intense pressure in Washington, where lawmakers have raised national security concerns over its Chinese ownership. Congress last year passed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. assets by January 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban of the app, which has 170 million U.S. users. President Donald Trump has granted TikTok multiple reprieves and last week extended the deadline for the company to divest its U.S. assets to September 17. He said U.S. buyers were lined up for TikTok and the deadline could be pushed back again. Some lawmakers have criticised the delay, arguing his administration is flouting the law and ignoring national security concerns related to Chinese control over TikTok. ByteDance is profitable as a company, but TikTok's U.S. business has been loss-making so far, said two of the people. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. If the sale of TikTok's U.S. business is finalised, it is expected to be owned by a joint venture formed by an American investor consortium and ByteDance, which will maintain a minority stake. The new ByteDance buyback could help bolster morale among its U.S.-based staff, some of whom are concerned about TikTok's uncertain future. TikTok has also been working on preparing a potential standalone app for U.S. users, sources told Reuters earlier, though it remains unclear if any contingency plan will be finalised amid Trump's ongoing trade talks with Beijing.
