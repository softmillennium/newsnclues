                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This is an exciting time for soccer fans and the city as a whole,” said Texas Region Executive Managing Director Daniel Taylor. This event represents far more than world-class soccer—it's an opportunity to highlight Dallas' progress, strength and welcoming spirit. Colliers' From Stadiums to Skylines report provides critical insights into how the World Cup will shape our local economy and real estate landscape, underscoring Dallas' readiness and long-term potential as a powerhouse market.” Dallas-Fort Worth ranks number one in the U.S. for real estate investment and development in 2025, driven by strong population growth, over 50,000 multifamily units under construction, top-three net migration, resilient workforce housing rents, investor confidence and solid submarket performance. As of Q2 2025, more than 4 million square feet of office space is under construction, led by financial services, tech, and professional sectors. Demand is strong in key submarkets such as Uptown Dallas, Preston Center, Fort Worth CBD, Las Colinas and Far North Dallas, where companies are gravitating toward Class A, mixed-use buildings. Dallas-Fort Worth is one of the top three industrial markets in the U.S., with over 1 billion square feet of space and more than 80 buildings larger than 1 million square feet, up from just eight in 2000. Since 2020, over 80 million square feet have been delivered, with development continuing to meet strong demand. DFW's location allows same-day access to 93 percent of the Texas population and next-day delivery to much of the U.S., supported by low taxes and a large, affordable labor pool. “Hosting the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup is an opportunity for Dallas to demonstrate its economic strength, world-class infrastructure, and dynamic culture to a global audience,” said Marianne Skorupski, Director of National Office Research at Colliers. The Dallas region boasts a rich legacy in sports and entertainment, partially anchored by Arlington's Entertainment District, a premier destination that draws over 15.6 million visitors annually and generates $2.8 billion in economic impact. This transformation is the result of strategic planning, public-private partnerships and a long-term vision to create a vibrant, walkable urban hub. Renowned venues in the district include AT&T Stadium (home of the Dallas Cowboys), Globe Life Field (Texas Rangers), Choctaw Stadium, Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags Hurricane Harbor. Dallas hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1994, and its return in 2026 is projected to generate an even greater economic impact, expected to exceed the $600 million mark set three decades ago. Colliers is a global diversified professional services and investment management company. For 30 years, Colliers has consistently delivered approximately 20% compound annual returns for shareholders, fueled by visionary leadership, significant inside ownership and substantial recurring earnings. With nearly $5.0 billion in annual revenues, a team of 23,000 professionals, and more than $100 billion in assets under management, Colliers remains committed to accelerating the success of our clients, investors, and people worldwide.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The English striker wrote history with Tottenham Hotspur, becoming their all-time leading scorer and climbing to second on the Premier League's all-time list. Now 32 years old, Kane remains at the top of his game. Jackson was a regular starter for the Blues last season but has since lost ground. With the arrivals of João Pedro and Liam Delap, his minutes have decreased, and he now finds himself battling for playing time in London. According to transfer reports, including updates from insider Fabrizio Romano, Bayern and Chelsea are in direct talks regarding a deal. While no agreement has been finalized, Bayern continues to push for the move. Cristiano Ronaldo vs. Kingsley Coman: Legend's $244M salary compared to Al Nassr's new Bayern signing His pace, physicality, and ability to stretch defenses could provide a different attacking dimension, especially in domestic matches where Kane may need rest. At 23, Jackson still has room to grow, and working alongside Kane could accelerate his development. When their star striker is neutralized or absent, Bayern's attack has often looked one-dimensional. Bringing in Jackson would not only give Kane valuable rest but also ensure that Bayern can remain competitive across multiple competitions. Bayern Munich star Harry Kane praised Lamine Yamal and even imagined a potential showdown against Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League. Luis Diaz made a blockbuster move to Bayern Munich, and comparisons didn't doubt to raise regarding his new deal and star's Harry Kane $29 million salary. Harry Kane will not start for Bayern Munich in today's Group C finale against Benfica at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

LA Galaxy Academy products Ryan Hartley, Kike Martinez and Mateo Tsakiris each named to U-17 USMNT roster for international training camp in Netherlands from Sept. 1-8

LOS ANGELES (Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025) – LA Galaxy Academy products Ryan Hartley, Enrique “Kike” Martinez and Mateo Tsakiris were each named to the U.S. U-17 Men's National Team roster for an international training camp to be held in Noordwijk, Netherlands from Sept. 1-8.

The camp is part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship. The roster features 16 players from 10 different Major League Soccer clubs. The LA Galaxy and Philadelphia Union lead the way with three players each.

In the team's second-to-last gathering before heading to the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Qatar, Segares will guide the U-17 MNT in a pair of friendly matches against the Netherlands on Friday, Sept. 5 and Monday, Sept. 8 at Gemeentelijk Sportpark SJC in Noordwijk, Netherlands. Both matches will kick off at 7:00 p.m. local time (10:00 a.m. PT).

All players are born after Jan. 1, 2008, and are age-eligible for this fall's FIFA U-17 World Cup, where the USA will face Burkina Faso (Nov. 5), Tajikistan (Nov. 8) and Czechia (Nov. 11) in Group I.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sporting Kansas City defender Ian James has been selected to the United States U-17 Men's National Team for a training camp from Sept. 1-8 in Noordwijk, Netherlands. Led by head coach Gonzalo Segares, the United States will face the Netherlands U-17s in a pair of friendlies kicking off at 12 p.m. CT on Sept. 5 and Sept. 8 at Gemeentelijk Sportpark SJC. James, a 17-year-old center back who joined Sporting's first team ahead of the 2025 MLS campaign, previously competed with the U.S. U-17s during a training camp in Costa Rica in March. James made the first three appearances of his MLS career earlier this summer, a stretch that saw Sporting collect seven of a possible nine points. He earned his league debut on June 25, helping the team close out a dramatic 2-1 home win over Charlotte FC. He earned his first start three days later by going the full 90 minutes in a 1-1 home draw with Real Salt Lake, becoming the second youngest starter in an MLS match in club history at 17 years and 22 days. James most recently appeared as a second-half substitute on Sunday at Seattle Sounders FC. In addition to playing five first-team matches this season, James has started in eight MLS NEXT Pro games for Sporting KC II. On Dec. 6, 2024, James became the fourth youngest player in club history and the youngest defender signed to an MLS contract when he inked a Homegrown deal alongside teammate and goalkeeper Jack Kortkamp. Sporting will return to Children's Mercy Park on Saturday, hosting Colorado at 7:30 p.m. CT with tickets available at SeatGeek.com and live coverage on MLS Season Pass via Apple TV.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not everyone was a fan of this summer's Club World Cup, but Chelsea and Todd Boehly certainly were. Under Enzo Maresca, Chelsea were able to win the tournament and earn a huge amount of cash in the process. It is thought that Chelsea's goal for the new season is still just Champions League qualification. As things stand, Chelsea would need to win that very competition in the next four years to guarantee a place in the 2029 Club World Cup. Their review includes deciding whether Chelsea should be invited back to defend their trophy, meaning that the Blues may not need to rely on winning the Champions League or their UEFA coefficient after all. That would be great news for Boehly and Behdad Eghbali, who will want the club to compete in the tournament's next edition after all of the money that was won this year. As per Sky Sports, Chelsea took home £85m after managing to win the whole thing in the US last month. Playing all of those extra games may have an impact on Chelsea's squad. Injury expert Ben Dinnery has told The Chelsea Chronicle that supporters may not see the best of Chelsea until November or December because of their participation at the Club World Cup. One reason why Chelsea were able to lift the Club World Cup trophy was because of Joao Pedro.</p>

UEFA Champions League qualifiers wrap up on Wednesday ahead of Thursday's draw but even as the club game takes center stage, the U.S. men's national team are already gearing up for September's international break. U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino is once again leaning on a group of lesser known talent, calling up a group of inexperienced players for September's friendlies against South Korea and Japan, a camp he describes as "the last opportunity to bring some new faces" with less than 300 days to go until the 2026 World Cup. Only seven players in the squad have 30-plus caps, while 11 members from this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup roster return and five could earn their first cap next month. September's friendlies will see Christian Pulisic's return after a summer of bickering between USMNT players past and present following the player's decision to opt out of the Gold Cup, a chapter Pochettino said was "behind us" with months to go until the World Cup on home soil. Sergino Dest is also poised to play his first match for the USMNT since recovering an ACL injury he sustained last year, while Josh Sargent is back in the mix after being left off the Gold Cup squad in a "football decision." The USMNT will convene in New Jersey next week ahead of a friendly against South Korea on Sept. 6 at Sports Illustrated Stadium, followed by a friendly against Japan three days later at Columbus' Lower.com Field. The final round of UEFA Champions League qualification will wrap up on Wednesday, with eight teams competing for the last four spots in the competition in time for Thursday's league phase draw in Monaco. These eight teams will take to the pitch after a dramatic day in Europe on Tuesday, when three first-time Champions League participants -- Norway's Bodo/Glimt, Cyprus' Pafos FC and Kazakhstan's Kairat-- all advanced, in some cases beating competition regulars to book their spots. Glimt's 5-0 first leg victory over Sturm Graz paved the way for a straightforward 6-2 aggregate win on Tuesday, while Pafos defeated Crvena zvezda 3-2 on aggregate thanks to an 89th minute goal from Jaja. Kairat, though, completed the lengthiest and most arduous path to the Champions League by taking Celtic to penalties after 210 minutes of goalless play over two legs, with goalkeeper Temirlan Anarbekov making three saves in the shootout. The headlining act of Wednesday's action will take place in Lisbon, where Benfica host Fenerbahce after a scoreless draw in Istanbul last week. Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho makes his return to Benfica, where he held his first managerial role in a brief spell almost exactly 25 years ago, but enters the match as the underdogs -- the Portuguese team are a Champions League regular while his side have not played in the competition in almost 20 years. It means Mourinho's pre-match reflections come with a hint of practicality, even if he is still willing and able to talk a big game. 🇺🇸 USMNT-ers on the move: After a busy summer for a handful of USMNT players, here's who has the most to gain as the competition for World Cup roster spots gets underway. Pressure is already on Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim, so much that an EFL League Cup match against Grimsby Town is crucial for them to win. 🇦🇷 A rising star: Argentina's next big talent may just be Nico Paz. But why in the world would Italian club Como reject $70 million for a player, but maybe sell him for $10 million? 🔴 Liverpool's fun imbalance: Liverpool's attack-minded rebuild might make them a defensive liability, but their flair for the dramatic should be encouraged for the sake of entertainment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most iconic voices in global soccer is returning to Fox for the 2026 World Cup in North America. Veteran World Cup broadcaster Ian Darke will join Fox Sports as a play-by-play broadcaster during its coverage of the 2026 World Cup, an industry source briefed on Fox's plans told The Athletic. Darke currently calls La Liga games for ESPN in the United States. He also calls Premier League games on a freelance basis in the United Kingdom. The assignment would be Darke's ninth World Cup as an announcer. He worked for ABC and ESPN during the men's World Cups in 1994, 2010 and 2014, as well as the Women's World Cup in 2011. Darke's first World Cup assignment was in 1982 for BBC Radio. He also announced one for Australian television (SBS) in 1998. “I love the World Cup, and I think any soccer commentator would be lying to you if they said they didn't want to do the World Cup regardless of the controversial venue. By hook or by crook, I have managed to get assigned,” Darke told The Athletic in 2022 upon getting the World Cup assignment from Fox. He and Donovan worked together at Fox for the 2022 World Cup as well as for coverage of the 2024 European Championship. Richard Deitsch  is a media reporter for The Athletic. He previously worked for 20 years for Sports Illustrated, where he covered seven Olympic Games, multiple NCAA championships and U.S. Open tennis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Haiti's government has granted 100 million gourdes (about $770,000) to back its national soccer teams. PORT-AU-PRINCE — The Haitian government presented a check of 100 million gourdes, equivalent to approximately  $770,000, during an official ceremony in Port-au-Prince on Monday, Aug. 25, to Haiti's soccer federation to support the national teams' preparations, especially the under-17 men's team that will represent the country at the 2025 FIFA World Cup this November in Qatar. The event brought together Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, Youth and Sports Minister Niola Lynn Sarah Octavius, Finance Minister Alfred Fils Métellus and Gally Amazan, a member of the Haitian Football Federation's (FHF) committee. “You will carry to Qatar the dream of a people who believe in you,” Fils-Aimé told the young players. The U-17 Grenadiers, led by coach Eddy César, qualified in February with three wins out of three games in the final qualifiers' round. They will face Venezuela, England and Egypt in Group E of the 2025 FIFA World Cup, scheduled for Nov. 3–27. “This support represents a major lever to aid the preparation of our national teams and meet the logistical demands of high-level competitions,” the FHF said in a statement. Every step you take on the field will be a step for the dignity, unity, and greatness of our Nation.” Octavius praised the U-17 squad's discipline and urged them to “redouble their efforts to raise the Haitian flag on the world stage proudly.” But she also acknowledged the difficulties: Haiti's largest training center has been closed since gangs took over Croix-des-Bouquets, and insecurity has hampered talent scouting and facility upgrades. “There's no bigger pride than waving our flag for the world to see.” Officials stressed that despite the country's turmoil, soccer remains a symbol of unity and resilience. “Every step you take on the field will be a step for the dignity, unity, and greatness of our Nation,” Prime Minister Fils-Aimé said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Derrick Arthur Kohn has earned a debut call up to the Black Stars Ghana has drafted German-born defender Derrick Arthur Kohn into the Black Stars squad for next month's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. He could make his senior debut in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, when Otto Addo's side face Chad and Mali in Group I on September 4, 2025, and September 6, 2025, respectively. Watch highglights of Black Stars new boy Derrick Kohn  His talent quickly caught the eye of scouts, and he was snapped up by Bayern Munich's reserve side, where he spent three seasons developing his craft in Germany's lower divisions. His performances earned him a move back to Germany in 2022, joining Hannover 96, where he became one of the club's most consistent performers. In 2024, Turkish giants Galatasaray paid €3.4 million to sign him but immediately sent him on loan to Werder Bremen for the 2024/25 Bundesliga season. Following that success, Kohn secured a permanent transfer to Union Berlin in the summer of 2025. Although he featured for Germany's youth national teams earlier in his career, Kohn remained eligible for Ghana through his parents and has now embraced the opportunity to represent the Black Stars at the senior level. His versatility, pace, and attacking threat from the left flank are seen as key assets for Otto Addo's side. For Kohn, this maiden call-up represents the start of a new chapter, one that gives him the chance to contribute to Ghana's push for a fifth World Cup appearance.

Barcelona are fully aware of Chelsea's interest and the discussions Maresca has had with Fermin. His silence has been interpreted as a sign that he is seriously considering Chelsea's offer. While Fermin's loyalty to Barcelona remains clear, players in his position often face tough decisions when top European clubs come knocking with high offers.

Celentano is one of three goalkeepers to make the 23-man roster. The Naperville, Illinois, native totaled 52 appearances with Indiana, securing 28 shutouts and a .62 goals-against average. Celentano earned two All-America selections, and he is still the only player to win two Big Ten Goalkeeper of the Year awards. Since joining FC Cincinnati, Celentano has started in all 118 of his appearances. Celentano has started in every MLS match for Cincinnati in the 2025 season, racking up nine clean sheets and a 1.25 goals per game average. He broke the club record for total minutes against Charlotte FC on Aug. 10, surpassing midfielder Luciano Acosta with 12,382 minutes across all competitions. The September international window will mark Celentano's second stint with the USMNT, as he first was called up in January 2024. However, he has yet to make a senior appearance for the national team.
