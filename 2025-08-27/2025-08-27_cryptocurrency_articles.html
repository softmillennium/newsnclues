                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is making a big move toward modernizing its market surveillance. Its current surveillance system dates back to the 1990s and was intended for a far different trading stage. Today's markets are faster, more global, and vastly more complex, with crypto assets and prediction markets in the mix. Regulators say the old tools are no match for new challenges. The platform offers auto-alerts, cross-market analytics, and real-time visibility into trading activity. The decision also comes as political and industry pressure increases on regulators to bolster oversight of digital assets. Watchdogs risk being left behind without advanced technology. Officials say the upgrade makes the CFTC a more effective enforcer of market integrity when American financial oversight has been under a microscope. It is about replacing a pretty old system as much as creating a regulator ready for the future of finance. CFTC and Nasdaq want real-time trade surveillance across all asset classes, including crypto. The CFTC is working with Nasdaq on allowing market surveillance information sharing from CME Group, sending direct market participants information that in the past was kept confidential for obvious reasons. She stressed that as markets evolved, the regulator also had to evolve. According to her, Nasdaq Market Surveillance would provide automated alerts and cross-market analytics, enabling the CFTC to track unusual trades, prevent manipulation, and protect investors more quickly. The system, which replaces decades-old technology at the agency, allows staff to simultaneously scan trading patterns across traditional derivatives and fast-moving crypto markets. Officials say this is crucial to forestalling risks such as wash trading, price manipulation, or cross-exchange arbitrage in digital assets. Nasdaq is not new to market regulation. Its technology can monitor manipulation across asset classes, commodities, fixed income, cryptocurrencies, and prediction markets. This is particularly important for crypto markets that are open 24/7 and can move extremely fast. He added that Nasdaq was proud to support the CFTC in its efforts to ensure the resilience and fairness of U.S. markets. It is also preparing for the next wave of financial creativity. Earlier this year, it introduced a “crypto sprint” to examine digital assets and follow recommendations from a White House report. The rise of round-the-clock trading, decentralized finance, and prediction markets calls for more sophisticated surveillance tools. The CFTC can gain a straightforward view across markets through Nasdaq's platform. So fraud or unusual activity in one asset class can be cross-checked with others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- "White Whale" launched a $2.5M social media campaign against MEXC over frozen $3.1M assets, rejecting in-person KYC demands in Malaysia as coercive. - The campaign uses Base NFTs and a bounty system, framing the dispute as a broader challenge to crypto industry practices and MEXC's compliance inconsistencies. - MEXC defended its risk protocols, citing 17,464 account restrictions in 2025, but faced criticism for unclear policies and conflicting responses to user complaints like Pablo Ruiz's $2.08M freeze. The trader claims MEXC froze $3.1 million of their assets without valid justification and refused to unfreeze them unless they flew to Malaysia for an in-person identity verification—a step that deviates from standard Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures typically conducted online. Screenshots of communications shared by the trader indicate that MEXC's customer service team suggested an "exclusive invitation" to meet in Malaysia for "in-depth communication with the leadership team," while offering incentives like potential partnerships and "trading perks." A total of $2.5 million in USDC has been pledged as a bounty, with $1 million to be split equally among the first 20,000 NFT holders if MEXC releases the frozen funds. An additional $250,000 is allocated for verified charitable donations, as stated by the trader in a public post [2]. The trader emphasized that this is not just a personal battle, but a broader effort to challenge what they describe as exploitative practices within the crypto industry. MEXC, in response, has maintained that it adheres to strict risk management protocols and does not freeze assets without reason. A MEXC spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the exchange may take action against accounts engaged in price manipulation, wash trading, front-running, or other violations. This is not the first instance of user complaints regarding frozen assets on MEXC. Ruiz claimed to receive automated responses, including one stating that his account would remain under review for 365 days [2]. The White Whale noted that MEXC's Terms of Service do not mention in-person KYC verification, suggesting the exchange has failed to follow its own established rules. MEXC has publicly defended its risk control and compliance measures, announcing in August 2025 that it had restricted 17,464 suspicious accounts in July and August—representing a 62% decline compared to previous periods—through enhanced AI-based monitoring systems. The exchange also emphasized its efforts to combat bot trading, restricting 2,008 such accounts between July and August, a 24% increase from earlier months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrencies were rallying on Wednesday, with ethereum (ETH-USD) continuing to lead the charge, rising more than 2.5%, among the major cryptocurrencies, while bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ripple's XRP (XRP-USD) also rose. Ether briefly hit a new all-time high Sunday, topping $4,900, as a dovish speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell late last week lifted broader markets, with crypto continuing this rally into the weekend. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still down about 10% from its mid-August all-time high north of $124,000. This legislation created a framework and governance for stablecoins, digital tokens backed by assets like the US dollar. "As the Ethereum real-world economy grows (stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets), Ethereum becomes the leading network for blockchain banking and capital market applications," Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote on Monday. Corporate treasuries have been loading up on ether, sending prices higher in recent months. Wall Street has grown increasingly bullish on the Ethereum blockchain, or its decentralized network, which is widely used to store and exchange digital tokens. At the same time, bitcoin ETFs recorded more than $1 billion in outflows last week, their worst week since March, in a reversal of steady inflow trends, said Leo Zhao, investment director at crypto exchange MEXC Ventures. "Bitcoin is at critical inflection point, where it could enter a period of consolidation between $110,000 and $120,000 or break lower towards key psychological levels around $105,000 to $100,000 if market momentum doesn't pick up in the near future." Industry watchers noted that a massive crypto whale investor with $11.4 billion unloaded their bitcoin to invest in ether over the weekend. "I do think part of the reason we're seeing weakness in crypto is that so many flows have gone into ETH, a lot of them have been siphoned from bitcoin," Fundstrat head of digital asset strategy Sean Farrell said earlier this week. For ether and other cryptocurrencies to outperform in the longer term, bitcoin must also participate, Farrell said, reiterating his call for investors to remain long on crypto assets. "Despite the potential for ETH to outperform on its own, it's tough," Farrell said. It's tough for any asset in crypto to do well if bitcoin isn't receiving flows."</p>

To obtain the best experience, we recommend you use a more up to date browser (or turn off compatibility mode in Internet Explorer). In the meantime, to ensure continued support, we are displaying the site without styles and JavaScript. The rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices created new demands for secure data management. To address these needs, we propose LIBLO, a lightweight blockchain-based smart NFT architecture designed for decentralized environments with limited resources. Traditional models mostly depend on heavy computation techniques to ensure the data security. To avoid this, LIBLO introduces a compressed blockchain layer combined with lightweight encryption techniques. This allows secure storage, verification, and controlled access to IoT-generated data without overloading devices. In this architecture, LIBLO acts as a trusted digital framework that securely encapsulates metadata, ownership identity, and access control policies. Each transaction is verified through digital signatures and efficiently recorded on a compressed blockchain ledger. This design ensures privacy, traceability, and integrity and also contributes to energy-efficient implementation in real-time IoT scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested LIBLO achieves high encryption strength and strong decryption accuracy of 0.96%, and low error rates of (1.1%). By simplifying cryptographic operations and reducing blockchain complexities, LIBLO presents a practical and adaptable solution for securing digital assets and IoT interactions in smart environments. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a revolutionary concept in the digital realm, fundamentally altering how we perceive and represent digital assets1,2,3. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are indivisible and unique, making them ideal for representing digital assets with distinct value. For example, NFTs can represent digital art, collectables, virtual real estate, and more, providing a new way for creators and collectors to engage with digital content4,5,6. However, as NFTs gained prominence, they also brought forth critical challenges that must be addressed. These challenges span various domains, with data privacy and security being paramount concerns. NFTs often involve the transfer of valuable digital assets, and ensuring the privacy and security of these transactions is crucial7. Additionally, as the NFT ecosystem grew more complex, managing these digital assets intelligently became increasingly challenging. Traditional NFT systems, initially designed for simpler use cases, struggled to keep pace with the evolving demands of the digital asset landscape8,9,10. Recognizing these challenges, a pressing need emerged for innovative solutions that could re-envision NFT management11,12. This is where the Lightweight Blockchain-based (LIBLO) Smart and Secure NFT Architecture comes into play. LIBLO represents a paradigm shift in how NFTs are handled and secured. It draws on cutting-edge technologies and integrates various crucial domains, effectively reshaping how NFTs are managed and utilized. Instead of depending on computationally intensive mechanisms, LIBLO involves lightweight cryptographic techniques and decentralized trust mechanisms tailored for IoT environments. LIBLO involves IoT-driven data intelligence, lightweight symmetric encryption (SIT cipher), ECC-based digital signatures, compressed blockchain ledgers, and smart contract-driven access control to achieve privacy, efficiency, and traceability. These elements specifically strengthen the foundation of LIBLO, by restricting the performance risks found commonly in traditional blockchain-NFT models13,14,15. It transforms NFTs into lightweight, intelligent containers that support encrypted metadata, automated verification, and traceable interactions16,17. By compressing blockchain records and enabling policy-based access through smart contracts, LIBLO provides a scalable solution for secure NFT management. It is specifically designed for IoT settings, ensuring low power consumption and reduced bandwidth needs that perform without centralised intermediaries18,19. Also, Smart NFTs in LIBLO integrate encrypted metadata and digital ownership signatures, which helps to allow secure asset tracking by maintaining user privacy. In the upcoming sections, we discuss in depth the LIBLO and its contributions that highlight its ability to reshape the NFT landscape and provide users with enhanced security, trust, and user experiences in the world of digital assets. This paper presents Lightweight BLOckchain (LIBLO), a Smart and Secure NFT architecture that integrates IoT-driven data collection, lightweight encryption, ECC-based signatures, compressed blockchain storage, and smart contracts. LIBLO ignores the dependence on heavy learning-based encryption methods; instead of that it focused on lightweight cryptography to reduce computational burden by preserving data security and access control. LIBLO transforms NFT management by converting NFTs into lightweight digital wrappers which help to encapsulate encrypted metadata and signatures for secure verification and traceability. The proliferation of IoT technology20 has introduced advancements and security challenges, particularly in interconnected networks susceptible to IoT attacks. Protecting sensitive data collected by numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart cities is crucial to prevent privacy violations and data abuse. To address these concerns, the study proposes an innovative solution combining Federated Learning (FL) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). The evaluation of four FL-based FHE approaches demonstrates their efficacy in enhancing data accuracy, privacy, and security while reducing communication overhead and latency. The proposed solution, xMK-CKKS, enhances privacy preservation in federated learning by encrypting model updates with an aggregated public key before sharing them with a server. Collaboration among participating devices is necessary for decryption, ensuring privacy protection. The article22 addresses the challenges organizations face, particularly in finance and healthcare, when collaboratively training machine learning models without sharing sensitive data in cross-silo federated learning (FL). The primary goal is to reduce the computational and communication costs associated with homomorphic encryption (HE), which is currently a dominant and resource-intensive approach in federated learning (FL) frameworks. The proposed solution, BatchCrypt, encodes batches of quantized gradients into a single ciphertext, optimizing gradient-wise aggregation and significantly reducing encryption and communication overhead. The paper's23 motivation is to address the efficiency challenges in federated learning (FL), where statistical heterogeneity among client data distributions and global distribution skewness can degrade performance. The primary aim is to improve the FL process by introducing a client selection method called Dubhe. This method enables clients to actively participate in training while maintaining data privacy through homomorphic encryption (HE), ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of FL across various datasets. This study24 introduces a blockchain architecture that operates over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of blocks and transactions. This design is handy for environments with limited resources. In study25, SeF is proposed as a blockchain storage solution that utilizes fountain codes to reduce storage requirements. This architecture allows full nodes to store encoded versions of the blockchain and provides lightweight operations without compromising security benefits for NFT platforms. This study26 presents a privacy-preserving system for managing self-sovereign identities using NFTs on the Dusk Network. By applying zero-knowledge proofs, it ensures that user identities and associated NFTs remain confidential. This research27, which introduces SB, a blockchain framework designed for IoT environments, highlights lightweight consensus mechanisms and scalable architecture. Its design reduces computational overhead and makes it suitable for NFT applications where devices have limited processing capabilities. The primary motivation28 behind this project is to address privacy concerns in the rapidly growing Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market. Current NFT marketplaces lack privacy tools, making NFTs easily visible to everyone and leading to issues like theft and shill trading. Paras allows users to hide real NFTs, seller and bidder identities, bid values, and wallet balances using cryptographic techniques such as threshold encryption and robust secret sharing, without relying on trusted execution environments for security. This initiative seeks to provide a more secure and private environment for NFT transactions. This application uses blockchain technology to centralize and secure users' medical information. Users can monitor who accesses their data, and hospitals can efficiently input and manage patient information, including various medical data formats like images and PDFs. This initiative aims to enhance the overall efficiency and security of medical data management. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies in the financial sector has garnered significant attention in recent years30. According to31,32, the authors highlight how AI-driven solutions are transforming various aspects of financial operations, from risk assessment to customer service. They emphasize that AI technologies enhance decision-making processes, improve operational efficiencies, and enable more robust security measures. This study33 addresses challenges in the gaming industry, particularly in the context of NFT-based In-App Purchases (IAPs) and player preferences. The gaming industry's significant market value and the widespread use of IAPs have created a situation where players have many choices but may find it overwhelming. Additionally, concerns about the security of digital assets in games due to hacking incidents are prevalent. The proposed solution is a recommendation system that leverages a multi-criteria recommender system (MCRS) method. It uses eight criteria to provide players with more accurate and tailored item recommendations, improving their gaming experience and asset security. By thoroughly examining the above encryption techniques, most solutions remain computationally intensive. Lightweight blockchain models are already implemented in the existing NFT domain, but they lack unified frameworks that integrate efficient encryption, identity protection, and decentralised control in low-resource settings. Additionally, current privacy solutions primarily rely on complex cryptographic protocols, often overlooking device-level constraints. To address these restrictions, we develop our suggested LIBLO framework, which helps to balance privacy, security and computational efficiency in IoT-driven NFT platforms. The LIBLO architecture is designed to enable secure and efficient management of smart NFTs using lightweight blockchain and encryption methods. Initially, the process begins with data collection, where IoT devices gather real-time data, including sensor outputs, environmental readings, and transaction logs. This raw data is encrypted locally using lightweight symmetric algorithms and processed through Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based digital signatures to ensure confidentiality. Instead of using an existing blockchain mechanism, LIBLO utilizes a novel compressed blockchain ledger, which stores only essential hashes and references to reduce memory and bandwidth requirements. Transactions and Smart NFTs are processed using lightweight consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Authority (PoA), to validate and record updates with minimum energy consumption. A smart contract layer involves handling data verification, enforcing access policies, and managing NFT ownership. This decentralized structure ensures that all operations are performed without overburdening the IoT devices. Proposed LIBLO model for smart and secure NFT. Each IoT device \(\:{\delta\:}_{j}\) is installed with a lightweight cryptographic identity, based on elliptic curve operations that allows signed and verifiable interactions. Here, each device generates a key pair using a compact elliptic curve signature algorithm, this can be expressed as where, \(\:{K}_{j}^{pub}\) is the public key of \(\:{\delta\:}_{j}\), \(\:{K}_{j}^{pri}\) is a private key and \(\:GenKeys\) denotes the lightweight ECC key generation function. To uniquely denotes the device within a blockchain, hashed token is created by binding the public key with the device-specific ID, which is expressed as Here, \(\:{\mathcal{T}}_{j}\) is the identity token of device \(\:{\delta\:}_{j}\), \(\:{\psi\:}_{j}\) is the device assigned identifier, and \(\:\mathcal{H}\) is the Hash function. This token is registered on the compressed blockchain ledger through a smart contract. It allows decentralized identity verification, which prevents impersonation, and supports trust bootstrapping for secure smart NFT interactions. As we discussed earlier, each IoT device is denoted as \(\:{\delta\:}_{j}\), which continuously collects the data at specific time intervals. Here, \(\:{D}_{j}\left(t\right)\) is collected by device at time \(\:t\), and \(\:CD\) denotes the data acquisition process. In the LIBLO framework, Secure IoT (SIT) cipher is applied by considering its efficiency and low computational overhead. SIT is a 64-bit block cipher that utilizes a hybrid structure combining Feistel networks and substitution-permutation (SP) networks, that achieves high level security in just five encryption rounds. Here, the structure of SIT is adapted from34. For each five rounds \(\:r\), each block of \(\:{B}_{k}\) undergoes substitution using predefined \(\:S\) boxes to produce \(\:{S}_{k}\). Then the substituted blocks \(\:{S}_{k}\) are arranged to enhance distribution. Update each block using XOR and round function \(\:f(\cdot\:)\). where, \(\:f\) is a round function to ensure non-linearity. Therefore, the final output is expressed as The encrypted data \(\:{C}_{j}\left(t\right)\) is first split into four blocks, and the reverse operation are performed per round. This process is repeated for r = 5 down to 1 and reassembled to recover the original plaintext was shown as In this section we generate the digital signature using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)35. It is a lightweight and secure public-key cryptographic mechanism that is highly suitable for IoT environments due to its ability to provide strong encryption and digital signing abilities using small key sizes. In the LIBLO framework, ECC is used to digitally sign encrypted NFT data to ensure authenticity. ECC is based on the mathematics of elliptic curves over finite fields. According to the concept of [], elliptic curve E of a prime field \(\:{F}_{p}\) is defined as Here, the security of ECC depends on the difficulty of Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). To sign the encrypted data \(\:{C}_{j}\left(t\right)\). LIBLO performs a cryptographic Hash function which is expressed as Then, the random number of \(\:k\) is generated. Using the random number \(\:k\), we calculate a new elliptic curve point \(\:R\) by performing scalar multiplication, \(\:R=k\bullet\:G\). Now we consider the \(\:x\) coordinate of \(\:{R}_{x}\) to reduce it module \(\:n\) to get the value \(\:r\). This value \(\:r\) serves as a compressed representation of the elliptic curve point and contributes to the security and uniqueness of the final ECC signature. Once the NFT data from IoT devices is encrypted and digitally signed, LIBLO moves to the next phase of Smart NFT construction. In this step, all essential features such as the encrypted content, the signature, and additional metadata are grouped into a Smart NFT. This smart NFT is specifically defined as Equation (9) combines encrypted data, digital signature and metadata in unique traceable NFT. Traditional blockchain systems store complete transaction records in every block, which leads to high storage costs, particularly in managing large-scale NFT metadata and transactions. To overcome this limitation, LIBLO uses a novel compressed blockchain ledger, also referred as a squeezed ledger, which is used to notably reduces on-chain storage by preserving data integrity. Here, instead of recording all the transactions \(\:{\mathcal{T}}_{j}\left(t\right)\) directly on the blockchain, LIBLO calculates Merkle Root Hash \(\:{\mathcal{H}}_{j}\) over multiple transaction bundles, defined as This root hash \(\:{\mathcal{H}}_{j}\) becomes a compressed representation of an entire batch of transactions. The blockchain replaces the original old blocks with a new block that contains only \(\:{\mathcal{H}}_{j}\) and a pointer to the corresponding off-chain storage location \(\:{Addr}_{j}\). Then, the updated compressed block is defined as Here, \(\:{B}_{j}\) denotes the compressed blockchain block for device \(\:{\delta\:}_{j}\) and \(\:{Addr}_{j}\) is a secure off chain database reference for raw transaction data. Once a user \(\:{U}_{k}\) request access to NFT data, the LIBLO smart contract evaluate this request \(\:{R}_{k}\) against predefined access control rules \(\:P\), this include role based, attribute-based ownership policies, which means the decision is based on the access evaluation, expressed as Algorithm 3: Compressed ledger storage and access control The dataset features selected to evaluate the proposed LIBLO comprise critical information essential for assessing LIBLO's performance in managing and securing NFTs. These features include NFT transaction data from prominent NFT markets, encompassing 6.1 million transactions involving 4.7 million NFTs distributed across more than 4000 collections, further categorised into six main categories (Art, Collectable, Games, Metaverse, Utility, and Other). Each NFT within the dataset is associated with image data, textual descriptions, and selling prices, facilitating comprehensive evaluations of LIBLO's capabilities in handling diverse NFTs. To demonstrate the real-world applicability, LIBLO is simulated in an IoT environment using a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, configured to perform in lightweight models. This setup confirms LIBLO ability in resource-constrained settings. The dataset's focus on transaction history, categorisation, and pricing ensures a strong foundation for evaluating NFT data tracking, integrity preservation, and decentralised access. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of our novel LIBLO system against established privacy-preserving techniques, including Blockchain-based Zero-Knowledge Proofs37 and traditional Homomorphic Encryption methods like Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)38 and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE)39. LIBLO integrates the robustness of Federated Learning-based Homomorphic Encryption with several advanced techniques, as previously discussed. Therefore, we embark on a comprehensive evaluation through simulated comparisons and practical experiments to gauge the effectiveness of LIBLO in safeguarding sensitive data in various scenarios. The robustness of LIBLO's encryption strength becomes evident through an extensive comparative analysis with existing models, like BL-ZK, PHE, and SHE, was shown in Fig. These evaluations are structured throughout varying encryption rounds (from 1 to 5). By assigning encryption strength values to each model across these encryption stages, the consistent dominance of LIBLO in terms of cryptographic security becomes evident. 2, where each curve corresponds to a model (LIBLO, BL-ZK, PHE, SHE), the x-axis now represents the number of encryption rounds, and the y-axis signifies encryption strength (in bits). Notably, LIBLO consistently outperforms BL-ZK, PHE, and SHE, and proves its provision of more effective encryption. Figure 3 demonstrates the computational efficiency and cryptographic stability achieved by the proposed LIBLO framework based on increasing encryption rounds, which ranges from 1 to 5. Within this illustrative visual, we accurately outline the decryption accuracy values attributed to LIBLO, as well as other prominent models, including BL-ZK, PHE, and SHE. The figure's significance unfolds through several critical facets: Initially, it provides a direct evidence of LIBLO's decryption accuracy against its competitive models, enabling a precise evaluation of LIBLO's performance with 5 simulation rounds. Next, the figure proves the LIBLO's consistent efficiency over BL-ZK, PHE, and SHE through each encryption round. This consistent dominance highlights the LIBLO's decryption accuracy. Also, the controlled and stable reduction pattern observed in LIBLO's decryption curve highlights its efficient inverse in cryptographic processing, particularly in resource-constrained IoT scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed LIBLO model in ensuring data integrity is prominently illustrated in Fig. This visual representation distinctly highlights LIBLO's consistent superiority over other models, including BL-ZK, PHE, and SHE. Throughout all the encryption rounds considered, LIBLO consistently maintains a position above these models, firmly establishing its robustness in safeguarding data integrity. This noteworthy trend underscores LIBLO's unwavering commitment to upholding data accuracy and reliability. LIBLO's remarkable consistency in maintaining data integrity serves as a testament to its resilience and adaptability. It vividly showcases the model's capacity to ensure the precision and trustworthiness of data, even when confronted with complex computational challenges. Figure 5 offers a concise and visually informative comparison of LIBLO's error handling performance against other models, namely BL-ZK, PHE, and SHE. LIBLO emerges as the standout performer with the lowest error rate, underscoring its exceptional error management capabilities. Its minimal error rate underscores LIBLO's proficiency in handling errors during data processing, ensuring the highest level of data accuracy and integrity. While BL-ZK maintains reasonable performance, it may have a marginally increased likelihood of encountering errors during data operations. PHE, on the other hand, demonstrates a significantly higher error rate when compared to both LIBLO and BL-ZK. This notable increase in error rate suggests potential challenges in error management, which could compromise the overall integrity of processed data. Lastly, SHE exhibits the highest error rate among the models, indicating potential struggles in effective error handling. This higher error rate highlights the increased likelihood of SHE encountering errors during data processing tasks. Finally, the overall comparison analysis is shown in Table 2. The efficacy of the proposed LIBLO, as observed through user experience was shown in Fig. 6, is a critical aspect that reflects its performance and impact on end-users. In the context of user experience, LIBLO aims to provide a seamless and satisfactory interaction for individuals interacting with the system. Excellent: LIBLO strives to deliver an exceptional user experience, which is represented by the highest percentage of users who rate their experience as “Excellent.” This category signifies that a significant portion of users finds LIBLO to be highly effective, user-friendly, and reliable. An excellent user experience suggests that LIBLO successfully meets user expectations and offers a smooth, hassle-free experience. Good: The “Good” category in the user experience evaluation indicates that a substantial number of users have a positive perception of LIBLO. They may encounter minor issues or challenges occasionally, but overall, their experience is satisfactory. LIBLO ensures that a considerable proportion of users fall into this category, demonstrating its ability to provide a generally positive user interaction. Average: Some users may find their experience with LIBLO to be “Average.” This category suggests that while LIBLO offers functionality and utility, there might be room for improvement in certain aspects. These users might encounter occasional usability issues or limitations, which LIBLO should consider addressing to enhance the user experience further. Poor: The “Poor” user experience category represents the smallest percentage of users who find their interaction with LIBLO to be unsatisfactory. This category indicates that there are specific areas where LIBLO may need improvement to meet user expectations and resolve usability or performance issues. LIBLO's efficacy depends on its ability to maintain a high percentage of users within the “Excellent” and “Good” categories while minimizing the proportion of users in the “Average” and “Poor” categories. A higher percentage of satisfied users in the top categories demonstrates LIBLO's effectiveness in delivering a superior user experience. It showcases LIBLO's commitment to user-centric design, usability, and overall performance, making it a preferred choice for secure digital asset management and NFT applications where user trust and satisfaction are paramount. In this paper, we have addressed the critical challenges facing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), including data privacy, security, and intelligent management. In response, we have introduced the innovative Lightweight Blockchain-based (LIBLO) Smart and Secure NFT Architecture, which represents an efficient approach to NFT management. LIBLO takes on these challenges head-on by leveraging IoT-driven data intelligence, lightweight symmetric encryption (SIT cipher), and elliptic curve digital signatures (ECC). Also, LIBLO maintains its cryptographic strength and acts as an effective contribution for resource-constrained IoT environments. This combination transforms NFTs from simple tokens into repositories of intelligence. With LIBLO, NFT data tracking, management, and analysis become automated, resulting in enhanced performance, security, and valuable insights. Our lightweight framework offers a holistic approach to digital asset management. Through the integration of smart contracts and digital wallets, NFT transactions gain trust and automation, while advanced analytics enable real-time tracking and comprehensive behavior analysis. At the heart of LIBLO are Smart NFTs, fortified with lightweight encryption and ECC based digital signatures with a compressed blockchain ledger. These Smart NFTs ensure data integrity, enable verifiable ownership, and enforce decentralized access policies through smart contracts. Each secure operation is subject to meticulous authentication through Smart NFTs, instilling the highest level of trust in the NFT ecosystem. In conclusion, our simulations have validated the effectiveness of LIBLO, showcasing its potential to practical NFT landscape. By addressing the challenges of data privacy, security, and intelligent management, LIBLO offers a robust and comprehensive solution that can elevate the NFT industry to new heights, providing users with enhanced security, trust, and user experiences in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. Apart from advantages some restrictions should be considered. LIBLO uses lightweight encryption and ECC-based digital signatures to secure data and verify identities, therefore full security analysis of possible threats is not fully analyzed. Some risks like key leakage, replay attacks, and misuse of smart contracts are observed but not deeply analysed in this version. In future work, we plan to explore these vulnerabilities more thoroughly using standard threat modeling approaches like STRIDE. Also, future versions should focus to incorporate direct inputs from environmental or visual sensors depending on the NFT domain.

Gizmodo reports that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told President Trump on Aug. 26 that his department "is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain because you are the crypto president, and we are going to put out GDP on the blockchain so people can use the blockchain for data distribution." Lutnick added, "and then we're going to make that available to the entire government so all of you can do it ... we're just ironing out all the details so we can do it.” You'd be forgiven for not remembering what the blockchain is. It was the hype train of choice before being briefly supplanted by the metaverse, and now it's barely managed to hitch its caboose to AI. For everyone else, just say it with me: The blockchain is an immutable, distributed ledger used to keep an ostensibly tamper-proof log of... stuff. Kraken said in January that "blockchain adoption is accelerating across major sectors like finance, healthcare, and supply chain management." So-called Web3 proponents have also made blockchain adoption (among other things) a core part of what they view as the next generation of the internet. Yet it's still unclear how blockchain-based solutions are superior to their predecessors. Even if the ultimate goal for most of these projects is to avoid centralized authority, the Department of Commerce is by definition a central authority, so that wouldn't apply here.

Yesterday, Hut 8 unveiled plans to develop 1.53 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity across four U.S. sites, in Louisiana, Texas and Illinois, more than doubling its power under management to 2.55 GW. Palmer raised Hut 8's price target to $36 from $33 and reiterated his buy rating on the stock. The new price target suggests nearly 40% upside from yesterday's close just below $26. Palmer noted the update was significant because it showed a clear path to monetizing Hut 8's energy pipeline, with the company already securing land and power agreements, building infrastructure and negotiating with potential customers. Hut 8 is a flexible bet on both bitcoin and the artificial intelligence (AI)/high performance computing (HPC) boom, Palmer said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's recent price weakness may not be over yet, according to K33, with a leverage surge and significant rotations into Ethereum leaving the foremost cryptocurrency vulnerable to further downside in the near term. Notional open interest in bitcoin perpetual futures has surged to a two-year high of over 310,000 BTC ($34 billion) — up 41,607 BTC in the last two months alone — with a sharp weekend acceleration of 13,472 BTC marking a potential inflection point, K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde said in a Tuesday report. The spike, paired with a jump in annualized funding rates from 3% to nearly 11%, signals increasingly aggressive long positioning at a time of relative price stagnation, he explained. According to Lunde, the conditions resemble leverage build-ups seen in the summers of 2023 and 2024, both of which ended with sharp liquidation cascades in August. This time, however, the OI peak has arrived later in the month, suggesting a more drawn-out consolidation regime — one that might catch dip buyers offside. Adding to the volatility is a "huge" rotation by a long-term holder, who swapped 22,400 BTC for ETH via decentralized exchange Hyperunit last week, Lunde noted. The whale's move helped push ETH to a new all-time high of $4,956 over the weekend, ending a 1,380-day drawdown and flipping market momentum toward Ethereum, he said. However, despite ETH's USD rally, its longer-term relative trend against BTC remains weak — with 1-, 2-, and 3-year rolling ETH/BTC returns still in negative territory, Lunde noted. Historically, ETH all-time highs have often marked broader crypto tops, with past cycles in 2017 and 2021 showing similar sequences: ETH breaks out, altcoins rip, and BTC stagnates amid waning demand — fueling concerns that the current crypto bull market is too nearing its end. However, compared to sub-40% levels during prior peaks, BTC dominance remains elevated at 58.6%. "Thus, while the relationship between former ETH ATHs and BTC is concerning, we've yet to reach a situation that significantly points toward broad altcoin froth," Lunde said. Meanwhile, institutional flows continue to show a cautious tilt. CME traders have pared BTC exposure, while options markets have turned notably defensive, with longer-dated skews entering positive territory for the first time since 2023, per K33. ETH futures, in contrast, are trading at a double-digit premium and have outpaced BTC since early August — fueled in part by substantial ETF inflows and corporate treasury accumulation. But as Ethereum's relative strength matures, traders are bracing for whether this cycle's script follows history or diverges entirely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SharpLink Gaming has continued its aggressive Ethereum accumulation strategy, disclosing another major purchase of $252 million in ETH last week. The move brings its total Ethereum treasury to nearly 800,000 ETH, valued at around $3.7 billion, while leaving the company with $200 million in cash reserves for additional buys. According to SharpLink's Tuesday update, the company acquired 56,533 ETH at an average price of $4,462, funded through $360.9 million raised via its at-the-market equity program. Since launching its ETH-focused treasury strategy in June, SharpLink has more than doubled its holdings, climbing from 438,000 ETH to 797,704 ETH in just four weeks. SharpLink said it has already generated 1,799 ETH in staking rewards since adopting Ether as its core reserve asset earlier this summer. Alongside the treasury expansion, SharpLink's board approved a $1.5 billion stock buyback plan designed to enhance shareholder value while capital continues flowing into Ethereum. SharpLink's latest purchase comes as other corporate treasuries are also ramping up Ethereum accumulation. With SharpLink's near-800,000 ETH position and BitMine's multi-billion dollar stash, Ethereum is increasingly cementing its place as a corporate treasury reserve asset alongside Bitcoin, signaling growing institutional confidence in its long-term value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As large nations adopt digital currencies, major economies or blocs like the European Union or China could build their frameworks first, set industry standards and export those rules worldwide. American companies would face a patchwork of rules that are incompatible with free-market principles and privacy protections. Surveillance-driven central bank digital currency (CBDC) models, like the one China is promoting, could gain adoption in key regions. The EU has already passed MiCa, a crypto framework for transparency, disclosure, and supervision of electronic tokens. In Asia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea are crafting nuanced policies to attract capital, talent, and innovation. Singapore's Monetary Authority has built a regulatory framework by licensing stablecoin issuers, launching fintech and tokenization hubs, and running sandboxes such as APIX. China has taken a different path, banning retail cryptocurrency transactions and mining nationwide, while tightly controlling digital finance through its CBDC, the digital yuan. Beyond its borders, Beijing is integrating this model into its cross-border trade and promoting the use of digital yuan to pay for services and goods. Advancements in other countries stem from regulatory frameworks that gave their industries a stable economic environment to grow. While other countries advanced, the U.S. created an uneven playing field in digital assets by granting selective approvals that favored large financial institutions over smaller, innovative blockchain firms. Today, financial heavyweights like JPMorgan, Interactive Brokers and other major players are capitalizing on a pro-crypto administration and Congress, integrating crypto into their services to meet growing client demand. Grayscale, Ripple and Circle have each expanded in the U.S. after gaining it, showing how predictable frameworks can draw investment and innovation. Ripple in particular benefited from a five-year court battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, where a federal judge declared the XRP token sold on public exchanges was not a security. The SEC finally dropped its appeal on Aug. 7, leaving Ripple and XRP with clear legal standing. Extending that level of federal clarity across the board would strengthen the competitive position of all U.S. crypto firms and draw in new clients, capital, and innovation. Legislative proposals like the GENIUS Act, recently signed into law, and the CLARITY Act, which has passed the House and awaits Senate consideration, could formalize U.S. positions on stablecoins, custody, and tokenization. This would equip businesses to invest confidently at home and compete effectively abroad, but only if Washington gets the rules right. But if we fail to lead the costs will be significant. The U.S. has a unique opportunity to remain the global leader in finance in this new digital currency era.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google Cloud confirmed it is building its own Layer 1 blockchain, called Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL), marking the company's most direct move yet into on-chain financial services. Rich Widmann, the firm's head of Web3 strategy, described GCUL during an August 27 briefing, outlining a network designed to handle cross-border payments and asset settlement for banks and other large institutions. GCUL will use Python-based smart contracts and is currently running in a private testnet. Google Cloud said the ledger will draw on the company's global infrastructure to serve billions of potential end-users and hundreds of institutional partners once the platform is opened more widely. Earlier this year, the company began a pilot with CME Group to explore tokenised products on the new chain. The initiative puts Google Cloud alongside other payments heavyweights pursuing proprietary blockchains aimed at the financial sector. Circle last quarter announced Arc, its own Layer 1 that treats the USDC stablecoin as native gas, while Stripe is developing the settlement-focused Tempo network. Widmann stressed GCUL's neutrality, saying any stablecoin issuer or payments firm could build on the ledger. For more information, including article sources, visit DeepNewz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By Shaanti Shamdasani, President & Chief Economist, S. ASEAN International Advocacy & Consultancy (SAIAC) Those who are asking this question should reflect on the use of transaction modes such as credit cards, online payments and QR (Quick Response) codes; they are all quasi-digital—in other words, the transaction is transferred and paid using digital technology and means. Such a shift could redefine traditional financial alliances and reshape the contours of regional power. However, this would also invite critical challenges, including navigating the technological infrastructure for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), ensuring interoperability between diverse local currencies and establishing trust among participating nations. As digital currencies evolve, their geopolitical ramifications could set the stage for a competitive but collaborative financial order that challenges existing norms, creating ripples in global trade, investment dynamics and financial governance. Let's look at the evolving payment infrastructure, a decentralized blockchain-based messaging/payment network that aims to connect national systems (for example, China's CIPS [Cross-border Interbank Payment System], India's SFMS [Structured Financial Messaging System], Russia's SPFS [System for Transfer of Financial Messages] and Brazil's PIX) to enable direct local-currency settlements and bypass SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) systems. With advanced pilots in Russia and China, the efforts to integrate these CBDCs into common platforms such as BRICS Bridge and mBridge will avail real-time cross-border interoperability. This model presents a stark contrast to the single interconnected US dollar system, instead promoting fragmentation into regional blocs defined by their own digital rails. Such a fragmented architecture challenges the dollar's primacy, shifting economic gravity toward emerging power centers, especially China and other BRICS nations, which gain leverage by offering their currencies and infrastructures as alternatives. This sovereignty extends to cross-border transaction systems such as China's digital yuan that are integrated with platforms such as the BIS' mBridge, fostering faster and cheaper settlements in local currencies and weakening intermediaries tied to Western financial infrastructure. CBDCs facilitate sanctions evasion and grant issuing states enhanced strategic influence. China's e-CNY (digital renminbi), for instance, is being promoted in Belt and Road nations as an alternative to dollar-based transactions, granting these countries a credible exit route from US financial reach. Conversely, the United States' delay, and even outright ban, on a digital dollar under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump has ceded global standard-setting opportunities to Europe and China. One clear impact on cross-border settlements is most evident in the financials—that is, fees ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 percent versus 0.3 to 0.5 percent for SWIFT, plus the benefit of real-time and same-day settlement. Additionally, local currencies have already dominated bilateral trade (e.g., 90 percent of China-Russia settlements are in non-US dollars). By enabling local-currency and CBDC-based trade, BRICS could erode the US dollar's central role in global payment systems and reduce reliance on the Western dollar, making it “sanction-proof/resistant”. China's digital yuan is being strategically integrated into trade with developing nations via the Belt and Road Initiative, expanding its financial influence while chipping away at dollar dependency. Western powers have responded by enhancing dollar-backed stablecoins and digital-dollar initiatives, aiming to preserve their existing financial dominance. Yet the momentum remains toward a multipolar digital order whereby regional CBDC alliances become critical nodes of influence. In conclusion, central banks worldwide are increasingly focusing on regional cooperation and interoperability as key future directives for digital currencies. Initiatives such as Project mBridge and Project Agorá highlight this trend, bringing together multiple central banks and commercial entities to explore wholesale CBDCs for improved cross-border settlements. The aim is to overcome complexities such as time-zone differences, varying legal frameworks and diverse technical systems, ultimately fostering a more interconnected and efficient global financial landscape. Beyond technical interoperability, future directives will also emphasize the need for coordinated policy approaches to address common challenges such as privacy, cybersecurity and financial stability. This collaborative spirit extends to understanding the diverse motivations for CBDC adoption across advanced and emerging economies, ranging from enhancing payment-system efficiency and financial inclusion to preserving monetary sovereignty. The ongoing dialog and joint efforts are shaping a future in which regional digital-currency responses are not isolated but rather part of a broader, globally coordinated effort to navigate the evolving digital monetary order.

Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. The cryptocurrency market has had a turbulent week, swinging between sharp pullbacks and brief rallies. After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday, Bitcoin staged a dramatic rebound, jumping from $110,000 to nearly $117,000 within hours. Ethereum also stole headlines by hitting a fresh all-time high at $4,900. Currently hovering around 57%, this decline shows capital rotating into altcoins. Historically, August has been a slow month for crypto markets. If history repeats, the next few weeks could see liquidity pour into a wider set of projects. In a recent interview with Coinpedia, market analyst Lennaert Snyder outlined where he sees the greatest long-term opportunity beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. His focus is on Layer-1 blockchains with thriving ecosystems and Ethereum Layer-2 networks that enhance scalability. He said that Arbitrum and Optimism are the two Ethereum Layer-2s poised for lasting success, with Arbitrum being his top pick thanks to its developer activity and adoption. “I also believe ETH L2s will continue to play a major role in scaling Ethereum. Each, he argued, brings unique strengths, particularly in DeFi and stablecoin markets, making them stand out for long-term accumulation.</p>

Riley Securities in the U.S., as well as Canada's Canaccord Genuity, among others. Last week, Kindly MD disclosed a $679 million Bitcoin purchase through its subsidiary, Nakamoto Holdings, marking the first acquisition under its new treasury reserve strategy in a move it said reinforces its "conviction in Bitcoin" as "the ultimate reserve asset" for corporations and institutions. While the WKSI status "clearly gives a company an advantage in capital raising," it also imposes pressure "due to the large issuance volumes and high market volatility risks," Jay Jo, senior analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt. "Institutional crypto exposure has, without fear, expanded into corporate balance sheets and treasury strategies," Kelvin Koh, co-founder and CIO at Asia-based venture capital firm Spartan Group, told Decrypt. Those events have "normalized crypto exposure" and "opened the door for altcoin-focused digital asset treasuries," he added. Yet the continued accumulation and expansion of DATs might open broader trade-offs, Koh opined. "DATs were almost exclusively Bitcoin-focused, with their appeal grounded in Bitcoin's narrative as a scarce, non-sovereign store of value acting as a hedge against fiat currencies," Koh wrote. As a model, DATs rely heavily on raising equity to buy crypto, giving them high exposure to volatility that could cut off new capital and force asset sales that risk amplifying market declines, the paper argues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, it is still not widely utilised as a form of payment across the country. The central bank maintains that JAM-DEX offers a safe, efficient, and convenient way to pay for goods and services without the need for cash. Responding to a question during the recent BOJ press conference, Governor Byles stated that retrofitting point-of-sale (POS) machines at consumer-facing establishments to accept the CBDC will facilitate a broader rollout of JAM-DEX. “The breakthrough with JAM-DEX will happen when we get the POS machines Converted… that's when we will see a much more rapid spread of use. A lot of the problems that people are experiencing at ATMs to get cash can be addressed over the years when we get JAM-DEX rolled out,” he said. Meanwhile, BOJ Deputy Governor, Financial Markets and Payments Systems, Natalie Haynes, reported a 30 per cent increase in the volume of JAM-DEX transactions since the start of 2025. “We have seen, since the start of this year, more interest in JAM-DEX by the individual users who do what we call peer-to-peer transactions. The data for the quarter, ending June shows, in terms of value of transactions, about a 30 per cent increase,” she informed. Haynes said this outturn is partly attributable to BOJ “now actively pursuing the communication and the events, in terms of persons using JAM-DEX”. “So we have moved from brand awareness to more transaction-oriented events. We were very big… for those who were at Sumfest… and that has contributed to the increase, in terms of merchants accepting it and individuals using it,” she added. The deputy governor further noted that retrofitting point-of-sale (POS) machines, together with onboarding additional digital wallet providers, is essential to advancing the rollout of JAM-DEX. Also [we are] waiting on other wallet providers to be onboarded. She also noted that additional staff have been recruited to strengthen public communication around JAM-DEX and encourage its adoption.</p>
