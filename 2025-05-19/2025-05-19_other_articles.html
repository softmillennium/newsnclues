                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Saturday, Feb. 22, the Painted Lady Bed and Brewery hosted a ghostology class with paranormal expert Cody Polston. The class delved deep into the science and history of ghost hunting, then allowed attendees to experiment with various equipment and go on ghost hunts of their own on the Painted Lady Grounds. Cody Polston, an author and paranormal expert, has been investigating ghost sightings since 1985 with his group the Southwest Ghost Hunters association. As Polston explained, ghostology has a long history. Ghostology has its roots in spiritualism, he said, which is the belief that when you die, you become a spirit with supernatural powers, including communication beyond the grave. “It really kicked off during the Civil War. Early spiritualism had issues, however, with people lying about contacting the dead in order to make a profit. The desire to lessen fraudulent practices within spiritualism led to a desire to study ghosts scientifically, which inspired the creation of the Ghost Club in 1862, as Polston explained. Curran alleged that the works were created by a spirit named Patience Worth, who was communicating through Curran. The works also referenced places and events Curran would have had no way of knowing. A rift quickly formed between spiritualists and the SPR. “The big problem is: How are you going to coexist? Preferably, there would be more than one witness. Polston explained that modern ghost-hunters use similar criteria. Polston explained various theories of what ghosts are, including the theory of “Veridical Hallucinations” – collective, non-drug induced hallucinations. Polston explained that the Veridical Hallucination theory explains some questions skeptics have about ghost encounters. “Big question: Why do ghosts wear clothes? Those things don't have life energy,” Polston asked the audience to consider, before elaborating. “The perception of it is in your head… [ghosts] can appear anyway they want.” “Our science guys are already convinced that it's happening in the brain. Some top universities still offer programs in parapsychology, such as Duke and the University of Virginia. In his discussion of parapsychology, Polston discussed the “God Helmet”, an experiment done by Stanley Koren and Michael Persinger, wherein scientists stimulate the brain with electro-magnetic waves, causing the participant to have paranormal experiences. Though many scientific journals have disregarded the experiment due to failures to replicate it, the experiment has remained in the mind of ghost hunters, according to Polston, especially as it relates to using electromagnetic field detectors as a ghost hunting tool. Polston tied in another theory about the brain, ghosts, and electromagnetic fields – the CEMI Field theory by Johnjoe McFadden. Where ghost hunting comes into play is if that could somehow survive death, you could have an electro-magnetic field floating around and that is what's sending out the signal causing me to perceive it.” EMF readers, Polston explained, pick up these fields , or “ghosts” making them valuable tools for investigators. He explained that the skeptic method was important to paranormal research, as a science, because the more one tries and fails to explain a phenomenon “normally” the more credible a paranormal explanation becomes. “When you see people being skeptical, understand they're not bad guys. Pseudo-skeptics are just people who don't believe. After the class, attendees were provided with EMF readers and app recommendations and allowed to explore the property looking for supernatural activity while listening to stories of ghost encounters on the property.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the F-16 Viper fighter jet was hit by an 'orange-white UAS' - which stands for uncrewed aerial system, better known as a drone - on January 19, 2023. These new details come as a stunning report from the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) shows there have been hundreds of UFO reports made in recent years and Arizona is becoming the nation's new UFO hotspot. AARO serves as a centralized department which looks into all things related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings and reports which could impact national security or air safety. The F-16 collision is just one of 22 incidents involving Air Force fighter pilots seeing or crashing into strange objects between October 2022 and June 2023, according to azfamily.com. Although the FAA said there's no evidence that the collision involved something extraterrestrial, it's one of several recent UFO incidents that have plagued US airspace over Arizona. In fact, some of these strange sightings involved swarms of up to eight mysterious objects flying over Air Force training bases along the US border with Mexico. Between 2016 and 2020, military pilots reported seeing unidentified drone-like objects over the state eight times. The new FAA details come as another government report shows that there were 757 sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) worldwide reported between May 2023 and June 2024 alone - and only 49 of these cases have been solved. If the incident involves a UFO, it's sent to AARO for further investigation. However, many more of these encounters took place over restricted military airspace, and the AARO report did not reveal where exactly these sightings occurred. That includes Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer who investigated these cases before leaving the Pentagon. Bob Thompson, who spent 14 years with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), also recently shared never-before-seen videos of UFOs spotted over Arizona. Thompson added that over 100 CBP agents have confessed to him that they have seen strange and unidentified objects flying along the US border. These sightings included US border agents witnessing terrifying 'portals' opening into the sky. 'I got told that they witnessed a portal opening up in the sky and there were pictures of it on a camera that I was able to see,' Thompson revealed. Although hundreds of these strange sightings sent to AARO are still marked as open investigations, many in the government are blaming Mexico - not aliens. Specifically, there's a growing belief that the surge in unidentified drone sightings is due to drug cartels launching high-tech spy missions into the US. Unlike drones which the US government believed were launched by China, these new drones are harder to detect and also larger so they can potentially carry bigger packages of drugs across the border. Trump Administration border czar Tom Homan has added that many of these sightings are likely high-tech drones spying on US military bases in Arizona. Bradley noted that one of the cartels' top goals is to infiltrate US military facilities, so they can stay one step ahead of patrols enforcing illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Of the 49 AARO investigations that have been closed, the UFOs were determined to be airplanes, balloons, birds, drones, and satellites that were mistaken as alien aircraft. AARO has recommended that another 243 cases be closed for the same reasons.</p>

On Monday, she dropped a new video for “Supernatural,” repurposing a sci-fi scene from her Brighter Days Ahead short film for the visual. The Christian Breslauer and Ariana Grande-directed video sees Grande, dressed in a silk cream dress, walking through the debris of a city on fire. “This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all/It's like supernatural,” Grande sings. “Letting go is harder work than it seems, even when Grande's turning her pain into music,” read a Rolling Stone review of the deluxe album and film. “But that's what makes these songs — like the rest of Eternal Sunshine — reach so deep.” Trump Preps for Putin Call With Another Meltdown Over Bruce Springsteen The Who Part Ways With Drummer Zak Starkey (Again) Ahead of Farewell Tour Sean Combs Trial: Cassie Testifies, Baby Oil, Imprisoned Male Escorts That Doc on Shia LaBeouf's Acting School Is Even Crazier Than You've Heard Grande led the album with “Yes, And?” in January 2024 and “We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” in March of that year.</p>

May 19 (UPI) -- Pop icon Ariana Grande released a music video Monday for "Supernatural," a song featured on her Eternal Sunshine album.

The video shows the Wicked actress walking through a city apparently ravaged by aliens, with wrecked cars and fires burning in various places. Grande sings as she takes in the scene, wearing a cream-colored silky dress.

"This love's possessing me, but I don't mind at all," she sings. "It's taking over me. Don't wanna fight the fall."

She approaches an alien space craft and is beamed up to the ship as the song concludes.

Grande released Eternal Sunshine on March 8. She followed up with Brighter Days, a deluxe version of Eternal Sunshine featuring six new songs, on March 28.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pokémon TCG has unveiled new Japanese Frillish and Jellicent ex cards, with infuriatingly good item lock powers - and more besides. The latest crop of card reveals from Pokémon White Flare is in, with a new Frillish and Jellicent ex that could well shoot right to the top of the meta thanks to great stats, tasty energy synergy with the infamous Gardevoir ex, and extreme item locking abilities that'll leave poor Budew back where it started: just a cute little guy. As revealed via fansite Pokébeach on Sunday, the new Frillish and Jellicent are coming in White Flare – one half of Black Bolt and White Flare, the Pokémon TCG's first ever English 'dual set', due out on June 18. For full details, check our complete list of all Pokemon sets. And these two psychic-type jellyfish Pokémon have already sent the fandom spinning, with good reason: the new Jellicent ex is an absolute powerhouse. One of the highest HP Pokémon ex around, combined with a relatively do-able 160 damage attack, is a powerful cocktail, but that's not even the best part: Jellicent is packing the best item-locking ability we've yet seen. Ability: Sea Curse As long as this Pokémon is in the Active Spot, your opponent can't play any Item cards or attach any Pokémon Tool cards from their hand. Loading up four energy for the Power Press attack might seem like a bottleneck, but that's where the Gardevoir ex synergy comes in, because – contrary to all watery appearances – these jellies use psychic energy. Use Gardy's ability to hoover up lost psychic energies to power Jellicent, and you'll be giving your opponent very dangerous hugs, very quickly. Shutting down both items and Pokémon tools passively, without being tied to an attack or energy cost, is way beyond any other item lockers around, and a fantastic foil to many of the most powerful strategies in the game currently. With precious few ability-locking cards in the meta just now, this evil jellyfish is going to shut down a lot of opponents' decks with ease. Buffing it to a mighty 370HP with a Hero's Cape, safe in the knowledge that your opponent can't tool up in response, is a fiendish control play that'd make even Magic: The Gathering Blue deck players jealous. During your opponent's next turn, they can't play any Item cards from their hand. It's essentially the Budew everyone's been afraid of, but stronger, and in Psychic rather than Grass. But it's still likely to replace Budew in Gardevoir decks, simply for the ease of psychic energy use – effectively streamlining an already popular deck that didn't need much help. If a Special Illustration Rare version gets revealed, expect it to become one of the most expensive rare Pokémon cards of the dual set. Have we overhyped this big, nasty, psychic butt jellyfish and its Budew-beating younger sibling? Let us know in the Wargamer Discord community – we can aways use some more hype about the newest Pokemon set.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino reaffirmed Sunday, countering conspiracy theories that have lingered since Epstein died while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He killed himself,” Bongino added in their joint interview at the FBI's Hoover Building. Their blunt answers represent a turn in the long-debated Epstein case. Multiple members of the Trump administration vowed to provide more insight into the Epstein case and his death after Trump's return to the White House, as questions have persisted over Epstein's alleged sex trafficking of minors and who else may have been involved. A bipartisan congressional panel also has been tasked with going over the documents. Epstein, who owned a Caribbean island, private jet and several mansions, frequently hobnobbed with powerful and wealthy individuals, even after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to solicitation charges. Photos have shown him with Trump, former President Clinton, England's Prince Andrew and a slew of other celebrities. Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, his alleged co-conspirator in the sex trafficking scheme, was convicted in 2021 on multiple charges, including sex trafficking, conspiracy and transportation of a minor for illegal sexual activity.

An unidentified flying object that struck and damaged a U.S. military fighter jet was among several mysterious objects found near Air Force training ranges in Arizona, according to multiple reports.

The UFO hit the clear bubble "canopy" located above the head of a pilot flying an F-16 Viper jet, which caused damaged to the plane and left it temporarily grounded during an incident in January 2023, according to Federal Aviation Administration documents first obtained by the War Zone. The object was described as "an orange-white UAS" or "uncrewed aerial system," a term that often describes drones, according to the FAA documents.

Three additional UAS encounters were flagged the following day, according to the outlet.

“What I can tell you is that there has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the [Mexico] border," former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo told News Nation earlier this month.

The FAA issued a statement to the New York Post claiming that it “documents Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to an air traffic control facility."

“If supporting information such as radar data corroborates the report, the FAA shares it with the UAP Task Force," the statement added. "The Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office serves as the centralized clearing house for UAP reporting impacting national security or safety.”

The U.S. government filed 757 related reports between May 2023 and June 2024, which includes 708 aerial incidents, and only 49 were marked as being "cased closed," according to the latest Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office report. The small unidentified objects found in Arizona tend to fly in groups of up to eight during incidents at high altitudes in or near military air combat training sites and have reoccurred since January 2020.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An unidentified flying object literally crashed into a U.S. fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona—and it seems our real lives are getting closer to an X-Files plot than we'd probably like. It's real, and it's just one of dozens of increasingly bizarre midair incidents that military pilots have been reporting over restricted airspace in the Southwest. The collision happened in January when an F-16 Viper jet struck what officials later described as an “orange-white uncrewed aerial system,” or UAS. Since 2020, military pilots flying training routes over Arizona have reported dozens of encounters with strange objects. Others defied easy explanation—metallic spheres moving in groups, eight “silver UAS” flying in tight formation at 20,000 feet, and one suspiciously fast object tearing through the sky at Mach 0.75, or about 500 mph, at 33,000 feet. For context, your average off-the-shelf drone barely clears 500 feet and maxes out at around 45 knots. Another F-35 crew spotted a glowing blue-green object while cruising at 36,000 feet. At that altitude, you're usually sharing airspace with commercial jets. “These reports are coming in constantly,” former Pentagon UAP investigator Luis Elizondo told NewsNation, pointing to the Arizona-Mexico border as a repeat offender. Either way, the technology doesn't match what's publicly known. “Maybe they've got tech we're not used to seeing in the drone space,” said former CBP official Ron Vitiello. From May 2023 to June 2024, the U.S. government logged 757 sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. With more objects appearing in restricted airspace—and one now confirmed to have struck a fighter jet—the question is no longer if something is out there but who's behind it and how close these encounters are going to get.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Part of a new SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) approach that scans the cosmos for signs of technologically advanced non-human intelligences employing light pulses instead of radio signals to communicate, called ‘optical SETI', the detections could unveil previously misunderstood natural phenomena or may represent actual extraterrestrial communications. More recently, scientists have proposed innovative new methods to look for extraterrestrials communicating with one another. In a recently published study, veteran NASA scientist Richard H. Stanton detailed a multi-year optical SETI effort aimed specifically at Sun-like stars that revealed some unusual results. According to Stanton, whose impressive resume includes NASA's Voyager missions and working as the Engineering Manager of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, several potential explanations exist for his unexpected findings, including the possibility of extraterrestrial communication. Unlike other optical SETI projects that hunt for light signals in varying spectra, Stanton's study employed a multi-channel photometer that he designed and the immense patience of a NASA veteran to study the light from stars for these signals. “My approach is to stare at a single star for roughly 1 hour using photon counting to sample the star's light at what is considered a very high time-resolution for astronomy (100 microsecond samples),” Stanton explained. “The resulting time series are then searched for pulses and optical tones.” “I'm not sure if anyone else is doing this with a significant time commitment,” he added. Stanton said that patience finally paid off on May 14, 2023, when his equipment detected an unexpected “signal” while observing the Sun-like star HD 89389. During his one-hour survey, the scientists spotted two fast, identical pulses of light separated by 4.4 seconds. After some detailed analysis, he was able to rule out lightning, meteors, airplanes, satellites, system noise, and other atmospheric phenomena as the source of the light pulses. Next, Stanton looked for similar “overlooked” detections in previous historical observation data. As hoped, he found a nearly identical pair of light pulses detected on September 30th, 2019, around the Sun-like star HD 217014. Stanton discussed another event that occurred on January 18th of this year, after the paper was submitted for publication. Stanton says that in over 1,500 hours of searching, “no single pulse resembling these has ever been detected.” A deeper analysis of the 2023 detection also revealed an interesting pattern that Stanton found difficult to explain with natural phenomena. When the pulses of light were detected, the star got brighter, fainter, and brighter again before returning to its previous ambient light level, “all in about 0.2 seconds.” Stanton says this variation is much too strong to be caused by the typical false signal culprits, such as random noise or atmospheric turbulence. James Webb Space Telescope Discovery Reveals a Dark Matter Anomaly Related to Ghostly ‘Einstein Ring' “No one knows how to explain this behavior,” he writes. For example, the 2019 detection was originally written off as a false signal caused by birds, a determination Stanton was able to refute with new data and analysis. Stanton also discusses other possible explanations, including starlight diffraction by a distant object in the solar system, partial eclipses caused by satellites or asteroids, edge refraction, and gravitational waves. Still, Stanton says that none of these explanations are satisfying “at this point” and suggests that more study of all three known events is required to further limit the possibilities. “We don't know what kind of object could produce these pulses or how far away it is.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump Jr. referred to a non-existent stage five cancer diagnosis in his comments about Joe Biden At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Donald Trump Jr. has taken aim at Joe Biden's wife for failing to miss the signs of her husband's prostate cancer. The US president's son shared a conspiratorial message claiming that the White House must have known about Biden's diagnosis while he was in office. ?” Trump Jr. said in a sarcastic jab at former First Lady Jill Biden. There is no such thing as stage five cancer. Dr. Ronny Jackson, a Republican congressman and Donald Trump's former physician, tweeted his belief that Biden's doctor during his tenure in the White House was “more concerned about assisting with the political cover up than providing world class medical care.” Currently Biden has prostate cancer with metastasis to the bone. With the best doctors money can buy there's no way they didn't know. In a statement released by the former president's office on Sunday, it was announced that Biden was diagnosed a week prior after experiencing “increasing urinary symptoms”. “Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,” the statement read. Trump, who has often ridiculed Biden following rumours of his ill-health while in office, wrote that he was “saddened” to hear about the diagnosis. He wrote: “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Chinese woman was allegedly forced to take off her heavy makeup after facial recognition scanners at an airport failed to confirm her identity. A short clip showing a young woman using wet wipes to clean her face of makeup while being scolded by airport staff went viral on Chinese social media last week, sparking all sorts of humorous comments. According to the boarding pass shown in the video next to the woman's ID, the video was shot in September of last year, at Shanghai Airport, but only recently attracted attention online. “Wipe everything off until you look like your passport photo. Why would you do your makeup like that? It's unclear whether the woman eventually passed the airport's facial recognition scan, but her ordeal did inspire humorous comments on social media. “It's not like she was able to walk around with a filter on in real life, right?” one person asked. Others took pity on the young woman, saying that she already looked embarrassed enough, and there was no woman for the airport official to nag her about the makeup, while others wondered whether the makeup should be an issue for modern facial recognition scanners. Isn't it time to upgrade the equipment?” one person wondered. We reported a similar incident a while back, when several Chinese women had problems entering the country after flying to South Korea for facial plastic surgery, which changed their look so much that they became unrecognizable.</p>

"The texture is a bit like toothpaste," senior author Aiman Rahmanudin, an assistant professor at Linköping University in Sweden, said in a statement. The scientists at Linköping University's Laboratory of Organic Electronics solved that problem by using materials that can hold and conduct negative and positive charges to power devices regardless of their energy demands. "Batteries are the largest component of all electronics," Rahmanudin said. But with a soft and conformable battery, there are no design limitations. It can be integrated into electronics in a completely different way and adapted to the user."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An unidentified flying object struck a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona last year, damaging the aircraft and prompting concerns about a surge in mysterious aerial activity near American military sites, the New York Post reported. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents, first reported by The War Zone, the incident occurred in January 2023 when an "orange-white" uncrewed aerial system (UAS) collided mid-air with the canopy of a $63 million F-16 Viper, forcing it to be grounded. The incident is one of several unexplained aerial encounters reported near US Air Force training zones in Arizona since 2020. Former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo told News Nation that reports of unidentified aerial activity have spiked near Arizona's southern border. The FAA confirmed that it logs sightings of "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" (UAP) when pilots report them to air traffic control. Between May 2023 and June 2024, the office received 757 such reports, with only 49 cases marked "closed" so far. Many of the objects spotted near Arizona's military ranges appear in small swarms, sometimes in groups of eight, flying at high altitudes. Some US officials, including former Customs and Border Protection advisor Ron Vitiello, suspect these could be advanced drones operated by foreign cartels for smuggling or surveillance. "There's a possibility they're using cutting-edge technology we're not familiar with," Vitiello said, noting that cartel-funded drone systems have been used to smuggle drugs weighing up to 10 kilograms across the US-Mexico border. That's part of their business model," he added.</p>
