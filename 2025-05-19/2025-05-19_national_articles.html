                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to strip legal protections from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The court's order, with only one noted dissent, puts on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept in place Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans that would have otherwise expired last month. The justices provided no rationale, which is common in emergency appeals. The status allows people already in the United States to live and work legally because their native countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife. The high court's order appears to be the “single largest action in modern American history stripping any group of non-citizens of immigration status,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, one of the attorneys for Venezuelan migrants. “This decision will force families to be in an impossible position either choosing to survive or choosing stability,” said Cecilia Gonzalez Herrera, who sued to try and stop the Trump administration from revoking legal protections from her and others like her. “Venezuelans are not criminals,” Gonzalez Herrera said. A hearing is set for next week in front of U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, who had paused the administration's plans. The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals President Donald Trump's administration has made to the Supreme Court, many of them related to immigration and involving Venezuela. Last week, the government asked the court to allow it to end humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, setting them up for potential deportation as well. The Supreme Court is pictured, Jan. 10, 2025, in Washington. The high court also has been involved in slowing Trump's efforts to swiftly deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act. The complex economic and political crisis in Venezuela has driven more than 7.7 million people to leave the South American nation since 2013. Venezuela's most recent economic troubles pushed year-over-year inflation in April to 172%. The latest chapter even prompted President Nicolás Maduro to declare an “economic emergency” last month. Maduro, whose reelection last year to a third term has been condemned internationally as illegitimate, also has cracked down on his political opponents. The protections had been set to expire April 7, but Chen found that the expiration threatened to severely disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and could cost billions in lost economic activity. But Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on behalf of the administration that Chen's order impermissibly interferes with the administration's power over immigration and foreign affairs. In addition, Sauer told the justices, people affected by ending the protected status might have other legal options to try to remain in the country because the “decision to terminate TPS is not equivalent to a final removal order.” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she would have rejected the administration's emergency appeal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — In Joe Biden's family, there's a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are “you have cancer.” One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease. Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden's life could be what ends it. “Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.” Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career. Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016. Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to “channel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better” on treating cancer to “make sure that other people didn't have to go through what he went through.” The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor. “Beau should be the one running for president, not me,” Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions. “Beating cancer is something we can do together,” Biden said. By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases. Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau's death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq. “When they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same — headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,” he said. The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality. In his memoir “Promises to Keep,” he described “lightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge — and then a rip of pain like I'd never felt before.” Biden wrote that “I had no real fear of dying. I'd long since accepted the fact that life's guarantees don't include a fair shake.” McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Israeli military released a video on Monday showing what they say are troops operating in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile after a nearly three-month blockade and warnings by global experts of impeding famine, Israel says it will allow a limited amount of humanitarian aid into Gaza even as it launches “extensive” new ground operations there. Doctors worked to treat injured children on Monday at a hospital in southern Gaza. A group of Palestinian men also sat by the wrapped body of a leader of the armed wing of a Palestinian militant group which said he was killed in a shootout during an Israeli operation in Khan Younis. Palestinians began evacuating Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis on Monday after Israel ordered its evacuation. Israel has stepped up its offensive in Gaza in what it says is a bid to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages abducted in the October 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Displaced Palestinians flee from Khan Younis, Gaza, amid the ongoing Israeli military offensive in the area, on Monday, May 19, 2025.

Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Jabalia, northern Gaza Strip, Monday, May 19, 2025. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The first few aid trucks have entered Gaza following nearly three months of Israel's blockade of food, medicine and other supplies, Israel and the United Nations said Monday, as Israel acknowledged growing pressure from allies including the United States. Five trucks carrying baby food and other desperately needed aid entered the territory of over 2 million Palestinians via the Kerem Shalom crossing, according to the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, COGAT. The U.N. humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, called it a “welcome development” but described the trucks as a “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.” Food security experts last week warned of famine in Gaza. During the latest ceasefire that Israel ended in March, some 600 aid trucks entered Gaza each day. Fletcher said an additional four U.N. trucks were cleared to enter Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his decision to resume “minimal” aid to Gaza came after allies said they couldn't support Israel's new military offensive if there are “images of hunger” coming from the Palestinian territory. Shortly after Israel announced the first trucks entered Gaza, the U.K., France and Canada issued a sharply worded joint statement calling the aid “wholly inadequate.” They threatened “concrete actions” against Israel, including sanctions, for its activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, calling on Israel to stop it “egregious” new military actions in Gaza. Hamas has said it will only release them in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. In a video statement, Netanyahu said Israel's “greatest friends in the world” had told him, “We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We will not be able to support you.” The Trump administration, which has voiced full support for Israel's actions and blames Hamas for deaths in Gaza, has expressed growing concern over the hunger crisis. President Donald Trump — who skipped Israel on his trip to the region last week — voiced concern, as did Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Two far-right governing partners have pressed Netanyahu not to allow aid into Gaza. Aid into Gaza would be “minimal,” Netanyahu said, and would act as a bridge toward the launch of a new aid system in Gaza. Israel says the plan is meant to prevent Hamas from accessing aid, which Israel says it uses to bolster its rule in Gaza. U.N. agencies and aid groups have rejected the plan, saying it won't reach enough people and would weaponize aid in contravention of humanitarian principles. According to aid officials familiar with the plan, it will involve setting up distribution points mostly in southern Gaza, forcing many Palestinians to move south once again. “We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank,” the three countries said, calling them illegal. The countries said they have always supported Israel's right to defend itself against terrorism but called the military escalation in Gaza disproportionate. The countries earlier criticized the new U.S.-backed proposal for aid delivery in Gaza, saying it would not align with humanitarian law. Canada has already imposed a series of sanctions against Israel over the last two years regarding settler violence in the West Bank. It was unclear how much France can act unilaterally given that it is a member of the European Union. In a separate, letter Monday, the foreign ministers of Germany, Italy, Japan and 18 other countries — not including the United States — called for Israel to fully reopen humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza by U.N. and NGOs. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's retaliatory offensive, which has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. At first, behavioral ecologist Zoë Goldsborough thought the small figure seen on the back of a capuchin monkey in her camera trap footage was just a baby capuchin. She quickly sent a screenshot to her research collaborators. As Goldsborough searched through the rest of her footage, she noticed the same adult monkey — a white-faced capuchin nicknamed “Joker” for the scar on his mouth — carrying a baby howler monkey in other clips, too. Then, she noticed other male capuchins, known scientifically as Cebus capucinus imitator, doing the same thing. They found that, starting with Joker, four subadult and juvenile male capuchin monkeys had abducted at least 11 infant howler monkeys between January 2022 and March 2023. They reported their initial findings Monday in the journal Current Biology. The howler population on Jicarón is an endangered subspecies of mantled howler monkeys, Alouatta palliata coibensis, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, a global assessment of species' vulnerability to extinction. Additionally, howler monkey moms give birth only once every two years, on average. Examining the capuchin kidnapper case “was kind of like a roller coaster where we kept having different interpretations, and then we would find something that proved that wrong,” said Goldsborough, the study's lead author and a doctoral student with the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and University of Konstanz. With no electricity and a rocky terrain, scientists have to haul their gear and other materials to the island with boats when the tides are right, making in-person observations of the skittish capuchin monkeys difficult. But there's a major limitation to their work: You don't know what you can't see, and the camera traps don't capture what's happening in the treetops, where howler monkeys live. At first, the researchers thought it was a rare, one-time case of adoption. Monkeys have been known to “adopt” abandoned infants of the same or other species. But Joker wasn't caring for the howlers — he was just carrying them on his back, with no clear benefit to himself, until the infants eventually perished of starvation without access to breast milk. It's an odd behavior for male primates, said Pedro Dias, a primatologist at Veracruzana University in Mexico who studies Mexico's mantled howler monkeys and was not involved in the research. In primatology, it's fairly common to find females adopting or abducting infants to then care for them as a maternal instinct, he said. But on Jicarón, the males were not providing maternal care. When behavioral ecologist Corinna Most first read about the Jicarón monkey kidnappings, she suspected something else was going on. “They're probably eating these babies,” said Most, an adjunct associate professor at Iowa State University who studies baboons, of her initial thoughts. But as she learned more about the team's observations, she was surprised to find that wasn't happening in this case, either. Why they would exert the energy to steal babies is largely unclear, said study coauthor Brendan Barrett, a behavioral ecologist and Goldsborough's adviser. However, it's important to note that these island capuchins evolved in a different environment from their mainland relatives, explained Barrett. Capuchins are “destructive, explorative agents of chaos,” he said. Even on the mainland, they rip things apart, hit wasp nests, wrestle with each other, harass other species and poke around just to see what happens. On an island without predators, “that makes it less risky to do stupid things,”   Barrett said. Island capuchins can also spread out since they don't need strength in numbers for protection, allowing them to explore. With this relative safety and freedom, Jicarón's capuchin monkeys might be a bit bored, the researchers proposed. Boredom, it turns out, could be a key driver of innovation — particularly on islands, and particularly among younger individuals of a species. This idea is the focus of Goldsborough's thesis research on Jicarón and Coiba's capuchins, the only monkey populations in these areas     that have been observed using stones as tools to crack nuts. There are a few possible reasons for this, Dias explained. Adolescence is a time during which primates are independent from their mothers, when they start to forage and explore on their own. At that stage the monkeys also aren't fully integrated into their group's society yet. Over-imitation — a tendency in human children to imitate the behavior of others  even if they don't understand it — could possibly be at play as well, Most said. This over-imitation isn't found in other animals, Most emphasized, but, “I almost feel like this is what these other capuchins are doing,” perhaps as a way to socially bond with Joker, she observed. Most said she has usually thought that necessity, rather than free time, is the mother of invention in nature. But “this paper makes a good case for (the idea that) maybe sometimes animals that are really smart, like capuchins, just get bored,” she noted. People and other primates famously share a certain level of intelligence defined by tool usage and other metrics, but some shared traits could be less desirable, Goldsborough said. As a kid growing up in the northeastern United States, Barrett said he used to catch frogs and lightning bugs in mason jars while exploring the outdoors. It's possible that the capuchins' kidnapping behavior is similarly arbitrary — if not moderately entertaining for them. Or perhaps the howler monkeys will catch onto what's happening and adapt their behavior to better protect their babies, Goldsborough added.</p>

Related article Supreme Court lets Trump move toward ending temporary deportation protections for Venezuelans In March, the Trump administration fired most of USIP's board and acting President George Moose, and the three remaining board members — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin — said they were installing Kenneth Jackson as acting USIP president. Days later, DOGE personnel, accompanied by Washington, DC, police, gained access to the headquarters after having been turned away during an earlier attempt. Some USIP officials remained in the building after DOGE's arrival, including Moose, a retired career diplomat. He was later forced to exit the building by DC police. Shortly after, USIP filed suit against the administration in an effort to stop its dismantlement and the transfer of its private building and endowment to the federal government. Howell wrote that Trump and his subordinates “used brute force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP's headquarters, despite being cautioned that this organization did not fall within the Executive branch and its leadership was not subject to the President's unilateral Executive branch removal power.” “This Administration then went even further, taking severe actions to dissemble USIP, including terminating its appointed Board members, its expert management, its dedicated staff and contractors located in both Washington, D.C. and around the world, and dispersing its assets and headquarters building,” the judge wrote.</p>

Former Arizona Supreme Court Judge Andrew Gould discusses the U.S. Supreme Court blocking the Trump administration's deportations of suspected Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act on 'Fox Report.' The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to lift a lower court injunction that blocked President Donald Trump's decision to terminate the protected legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants living in the U.S., in a win for the administration as it looks to deliver on its hard-line immigration enforcement policies. Solicitor General John Sauer argued as much when he asked the Supreme Court to lift the injunction this month, arguing in an emergency appeal that a lower court judge had overstepped their authority by blocking the administration from ending the program for certain Venezuelans. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem (Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images) At issue was the TPS program, which allows people from certain countries to live and work in the U.S. legally if they cannot work safely in their home country due to a disaster, armed conflict or other "extraordinary and temporary conditions." Trump's administration seeks to end protected status for certain migrants. Solicitor General John Sauer (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images) In it, he also accused the lower court judge of improperly intruding on the executive branch's authority over immigration policy. "Forceful condemnations of gang violence and broad questioning of the integrity of the prior administration's immigration practices, including potential abuses of the TPS program, do not evince discriminatory intent," Sauer said, describing Chen's descriptions as "cherry-picked" and "wrongly portrayed" as "racially tinged."

Supreme Court is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, April 25, 2024. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to strip legal protections from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The court's order, with only one noted dissent, puts on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept in place Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans that would have otherwise expired last month. The justices provided no rationale, which is common in emergency appeals. The status allows people already in the United States to live and work legally because their native countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife. The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals President Donald Trump's administration has made to the Supreme Court, many of them related to immigration. Last week, the government asked the court to allow it to end humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, setting them up for potential deportation as well. The high court also has been involved in legal battles over Trump's efforts to swiftly deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act. The administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending the temporary protected status for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians. The protections had been set to expire April 7, but U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ordered a pause on those plans. But Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on behalf of the administration that Chen's order impermissibly interferes with the administration's power over immigration and foreign affairs. In addition, Sauer told the justices, people affected by ending the protected status might have other legal options to try to remain in the country because the “decision to terminate TPS is not equivalent to a final removal order.” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she would have rejected the administration's emergency appeal.</p>

American Olympic rugby star Alev Kelter will face a judicial hearing and potentially lengthy suspension after being sent off in a women's rugby test on Saturday for stamping on the head of an opponent. Team USA was playing against Australia, who went on to celebrate a 27-19 victory in Saturday's contest. Upon a video review, referees issued a red card around the 79th minute of action in the Pacific Four Series test. Officials determined Kelter forcefully stamped on the head of Australian center Georgie Friedrichs. Friedrichs appeared to avoid any major injuries in the incident. Team USA coach Sione Fukofuka later apologized to the Australian players. United States forward Alev Kelter, #5, runs against Great Britain in a women's quarterfinal rugby match during the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games at Stade de France on July 29, 2024. Rugby, like many contact sports, has changed its rules in an effort to limit the danger of concussion and other head injuries. United States forward Alev Kelter, #5, and United States forward Ilona Maher, #2, celebrate after defeating Great Britain in a women's quarterfinal rugby match during the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games at Stade de France on July 29, 2024. Kelter is a three-time US Olympic representative in rugby sevens and won a bronze medal in Paris last year. She previously played ice hockey and soccer for the University of Wisconsin. In rugby, judicial hearings over foul play usually take place within 48 hours of a match. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

FIRST ON FOX: Police officers are rallying behind a provision in President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" to end taxing overtime work, which they say would have a favorable ripple effect on officer retention and morale. "No tax on overtime, it would be a huge advantage to law enforcement across the country," one officer said in a White House video shared with Fox News Digital. Another added, "We work sometimes 100 plus hours a pay period. It's a lot of time taken away from the family. Trump has called on Republicans to swiftly pass the legislation, touting that it will lower taxes and provide larger paychecks for Americans, while also securing the border. Trump touted from the campaign trail that not taxing overtime pay would serve as "more of an incentive to work," and bolster retention of employees who receive overtime pay as their paychecks would not be whittled down by taxes. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a Monday press conference that not taxing tips would lead to an average tax cut of $2,000 per individual, which Leavitt said will be a boon "for our nurses, our police officers and all those who work overtime to make ends meet across our country." "Put simply, President Trump's one big, beautiful bill will be a boon for working class America," she said. "This one big, beautiful bill is also pro-family, it will increase the child tax credit to $2,500 per child, establish optional savings account for newborn babies with a $1,000 credit added and strengthen paid family leave. This bill also delivers historic tax relief to America's seniors by allowing middle and low income Social Security recipients to deduct an additional $4,000 in payments from their taxable income." Officers in the White House video touted that eliminating taxes on overtime would serve as an extra dose of "appreciation" to law enforcement. Police departments nationwide saw morale and staffing crater in 2020 and the following years as left-wing cities answered calls from activists to defund the police following the death of George Floyd while in police custody on Memorial Day 2020. Many liberal cities soon walked back budget plans slashing police department funding as crime waves washed over the nation, stretching from sky-high murder rates to teenagers repeatedly carrying out carjackings. Police officers endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to end taxes on overtime. "If there was no tax on overtime … we'd be working about as hard as we currently do, but we would have that appreciation that goes along with it," one officer in the video said. Police officers have endorsed President Donald Trump to end taxes on tips as the president's "big, beautiful bill" legislation works its way toward passage. The police officers continued that removing taxation on overtime would likely lead to senior officers sticking around in the job longer to help train the next generation of law enforcement, while also giving younger officers extra cash in their pockets to raise their young families on an officer's salary. National Police Week and Law Enforcement Appreciation month remember officers killed in the line of duty. "To have something like this in play would just help senior officers, perhaps stay a little bit longer to help be that guidance for that department, that community, to help teach those policy and procedures that we know of and to help with the retention," one police officer said. A female officer added, "That would really benefit those, especially younger cops that have younger kids and a lot of families. I think that would mean a tremendous amount." Vice President JD Vance doubled down during an event celebrating law enforcement that the Trump administration fully supports police. May is Law Enforcement Appreciation month, with a mid-May National Police Week celebration and the White House illuminating its exterior in blue colors Thursday evening in honor of police officers who were killed or injured while in the line of duty. We know that you're out there doing a good job for us. But from this administration, you're, of course, getting it both."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is calling for “a major investigation” into former Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign over allegations that she paid off celebrities such as Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, and Bono to endorse her for president. “HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump posted on Truth Social. ISN'T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? Springsteen's production company, Thrill Hill, was paid about $75,000 for “travel and production” by the Harris campaign for his October performance at one of her rallies. Beyonce's production company was paid $165,000, and Oprah Winfrey's production company was paid $1 million to cover the cost of Harris's town hall with the media personality. “I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Candidates aren't allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment. In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds. He later accused Harris of paying Beyonce $11 million for the endorsement, though that number has not been found on any Federal Election Commission reports and is unsubstantiated. Between Oct. 17 and Election Day, Nov. 5, the Harris campaign paid entertainers nearly $900,000, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis. Trump's post comes as Harris is mulling a bid in California's governor race.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿What happens when the federal government will no longer respond to a local health crisis? For many months now, the city of Milwaukee has been grappling with a lead poisoning crisis that has forced at least four schools to temporarily close and dozens more to undergo rigorous inspections. It began on January 13, when Milwaukee first notified parents at one grade three to five school that a child had tested positive for high levels of lead in their blood. City investigators found chipped lead paint and lead-laden dust throughout the school building; press and government reports indicate that the school district has struggled to keep up with paint maintenance requests, due to a lack of funding and manpower. Local officials soon realized they had a big problem on their hands, as the vast majority of the city's school buildings (roughly 125 out of 150) were built before 1978, when lead paint was banned. Lead, a dangerous neurotoxin that can lead to development problems in children after prolonged exposure, has now been detected in at least nine public schools, and at least four students have tested positive for high lead levels in their blood. So far, no children have been hospitalized for acute lead poisoning, which can be life-threatening, but the affected kids continue to be monitored. Several buildings have been temporarily closed so workers can do a deep clean. Milwaukee has pushed ahead with its own inspection and free blood testing clinics. The city reported on May 13 that it had replaced 10,000 lead water service lines, in an attempt to remove another possible source of exposure for local children. But they still have 55,000 more left to go, and local officials have said they would need state or federal funding to finish the job. (It is estimated to cost the city about $630 million.) Ordinarily, Totoraitis said, the CDC experts would serve as the city's subject matter experts, guiding them through their epidemiological investigations. Milwaukee officials had recent experience with lead exposures in homes but not in schools; they were relying on federal expertise to interpret lead dust levels that were found during the school inspections. Without them, they've been left to navigate a novel and dangerous health threat on their own. “They were there for that sole purpose of having some of the best subject matter expertise on lead poisoning, and it's gone now,” Totoraitis said. In this uncertain new era for public health, Milwaukee's experience may become all too common: a city left to fend for itself amid an emergency. What in the past might have been a national scandal could become all too routine. When I spoke with Totoraitis, he was already contemplating the next public health problem he would have to deal with. The department just rehired hundreds of health workers focused on workplace safety, but other teams, including the lead team, have not been brought back. The turmoil makes it harder for local officials to keep track of which federal experts are still on staff, where they are located, and who has actually been let go. But the message is clear: President Donald Trump and his senior deputies want state and local governments to take on more of these responsibilities — without a helping hand from the feds. The federal government supplies insights that state and local officials probably don't have on their own. That is what Totoraitis was depending on; Milwaukee was inexperienced with lead exposures in large public buildings before this year's emergency. (One of the laid-off CDC scientists has since sought to volunteer to help Milwaukee, as Stat recently reported; the person told me they were hoping to help with community engagement, which federal officials would usually assist with.) Right now, there is a small tuberculosis outbreak in Kansas; a Florida town experienced the unexpected spread of hepatitis last December. And the US is currently facing its largest outbreak of measles in decades, with more than 1,000 people sickened. There used to be little doubt the federal government would step up in these scenarios. But Totoraitis warns that Milwaukee's experience of the past few months, left to fend for itself in an emergency, could soon be repeated elsewhere. “Let's say next year this time, St. Louis is in a similar situation — they could call us, but we don't have the bandwidth to consistently support them,” Totoraitis said. Kennedy, Trump, and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency gleefully cut 10,000 jobs from US health agencies this spring. The cost of those losses will be felt every time a city is confronted with an unexpected health threat. Today, in Milwaukee, families are facing the fear and uncertainty of lead exposure — and they know federal help isn't coming. As one Milwaukee mom told ABC News recently: “It really sends the message of, ‘You don't matter. The record drop in drug overdose deaths, briefly explained. Uh oh, the quest for a safer cigarette may have backfired.﻿</p>

As regulations shift with political winds, the question has become more salient: Who defines quality, and at what cost to kids, families, and society? Their solution: developing rating systems that attempt to boil aspects of child care settings down into simple metrics, much like hotel or restaurant reviews. Over the past two decades, such Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) have become the primary method for assessing child care quality. These systems, which vary significantly across states, award ratings based on multiple dimensions, including teacher qualifications (such as holding a child development associate credential or a degree in early childhood education); learning environments (including safe teacher-to-child ratios, classroom cleanliness, and availability of age-appropriate books and toys); administrative practices (like documented emergency procedures and business management systems), and the caliber of child-adult interactions (measured through classroom observations). By 2020, nearly all states had implemented some form of QRIS, though participation remains voluntary in many areas. Financial incentives also differ, with states offering a variety of supports, technical assistance, and bonuses for higher scores. The evidence is mixed, though, on whether these ratings actually predict better outcomes for children. Yet these critical interactions carry relatively little weight in some QRIS systems, overshadowed by structural features that are easier to quantify and less costly to implement. “The scoring matters in that providers and parents react to it,” McCabe said. “But like the US News and World Report rankings, I don't know if it actually makes them better colleges or students.” A 2019 Department of Education study found that children who attended higher-rated programs according to QRIS did not have better developmental outcomes than those attending lower-rated ones. This echoed earlier research that found that the overall QRIS ratings were less predictive of child learning than a single measure of teacher-child interactions. QRIS showed no significant boost to teacher qualifications or teacher-child interactions. These rating systems can also create a troubling cycle, said Hailey Gibbs, associate director of early childhood policy at the Center for American Progress. Lower-rated programs receive fewer resources, making it even harder for them to improve. Gibbs notes there's “valid criticism” that QRIS systems often lack cultural sensitivity and tend to disregard the perspectives of enrolled families when adjudicating which programs are good or bad. This fundamental tension — between standardized measurement and the complex, relationship-based reality of quality care — remains at the heart of ongoing debates about how best to ensure positive outcomes for America's youngest children. As sociologist Zach Griffen notes of performance measurement across other sectors like health care and K-12 schooling, quality assessment tools can be “wildly successful in policy research at the same time as they fall apart in real-world applications.” While the QRIS measure of “quality” might be contentious, the stakes are high because quality itself does seem to really affect kids' life trajectories. Back in 2000, the National Academies of Sciences published a 600-page report concluding that both nurturing parenting and caregiving relationships were essential for early childhood development, and that well-designed programs could help improve the lives of kids growing up in poverty in particular. Another landmark federal study tracked more than 1,300 children from infancy through adolescence. The study highlighted responsive adult-child relationships as the most critical quality factor, with elements like staff ratios and group sizes also playing important roles. Other experts say the growing demand for professional training devalues the kind of care offered by parents, grandparents, and other informal community leaders. … We need more flexibility in who can provide care, so families can say, ‘We really like this neighborhood grandmother because of the way she relates to our children, and we're less concerned about whether or not she got a degree in human development. There is perhaps more agreement, however, on what constitutes unacceptably poor care. Finding the balance between acceptable care and parent preferences can be tricky, especially when public funding is involved and lawmakers pursue multiple policy objectives at once, like promoting child development, supporting moms in the workforce, advancing educational equity, and even broader social concerns like reducing crime or increasing GDP. “Quality, in some sense, can take many different forms, and perhaps it should, because child care and early learning is not one-size-fits-all,” Gibbs told me, noting that some home-based child care options “are extremely high quality” yet nevertheless are sometimes “viewed as second tier to school-like center-based care” when it comes to state ratings. The landscape of child care quality measurement appears poised for significant shifts. States would have been required to develop tiered QRIS frameworks aligned with the federal Head Start preschool standards, and mandate child care provider participation in QRIS to receive federal money. Most significantly, payment rates would have been directly linked to quality ratings — so child care programs achieving higher QRIS scores would have received higher reimbursement rates. However, with the transition to a new administration, a fundamentally different approach is emerging, as states move to reduce restrictions conservatives see as driving up costs without improving outcomes or access. This regulatory rollback fits within a broader conservative vision reshaping child care — one that prioritizes less expensive home-based programs over professionally staffed centers, de-emphasizes academic credentials and curricula, and often encourages more mothers to stay home to raise their children. As Idaho Rep. Rod Furniss argued when promoting his deregulation bill, “perhaps the most important” small business is the home day care, “where moms can stay home and supplement the household income and watch a few kids.” This approach also aligns with principles outlined in the American Enterprise Institute's 2024 “Three Principles for Conservative Early-Childhood Policy,” which advocated for subsidizing “lower-cost” options while keeping “children connected to their families.” Conservatives specifically warn against what they call the “Bill de Blasio model” — folding early childhood education into the credentialing, unionization, and compensation structure of K-12 teachers. This approach, which many progressive advocates view as essential for stable and quality care, is viewed by many on the right as a recipe for unsustainable costs. As control shifts in Washington, the very definitions of quality that have guided policy for decades may soon change. But the core questions remain unresolved: What matters most in determining quality and how do we capture it? How should we balance measurable outcomes with family preferences? What trade-offs between quality, affordability, and access are Americans prepared to make? And ultimately, what kind of care do American children deserve? This work was supported by a grant from the Bainum Family Foundation. Vox Media had full discretion over the content of this reporting. Most Americans have no access to employer-sponsored child care. The “care economy” agenda collapsed despite a Democratic trifecta.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was at this very tournament a year ago, Scottie Scheffler made national headlines following his arrest. 1 won his first PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, trading in a mugshot and a jail cell for the famous Wanamaker Trophy. He finished Sunday's final round at 11-under par, five strokes ahead of Bryson DeChambeau, Davis Riley and Harris English. Despite bogeying on the final hole, Scheffler celebrated by spiking his hat on the ground, embracing his caddie, Ted Scott, and then quickly found his wife, Meredith, and son in the crowd. “This golf course will keep you on your toes,” Scheffler said. Making the turn, I kind of squared my shoulders up and I hit a really good tee ball at 10, a really good tee ball at 11. Scheffler added that it was ‘really hard to put into words” when asked by CNN's Patrick Snell to reflect on his journey from his first major win, to becoming father and now winning his third major. I feel like we're in high school yesterday. We just started dating and all of a sudden you know life out here is pretty cool right now,” Scheffler said. Scheffler also joins Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus as the only players to win three career majors and 15 PGA Tour titles. The 2025 season did not start off too kindly for Scheffler. A self-described “stupid” Christmas day injury resulted in surgery on his hand, forcing him to delay the start of his season. Scheffler would make his season debut in late January at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in Northern California. He would then go winless until two weeks ago, when he took home a victory at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson at TPC Craig Ranch in McKinney, Texas. Scheffler joined Seve Ballesteros as the only golfers in the past 100 years to win each of his first three majors by more than three strokes. But it wasn't an easy round for world's best. Scheffler came into the fourth and final round with a three-stroke lead but after three bogeys in the front nine, his lead quickly disappeared. LIV Golf star Jon Rahm surged ahead of him, with the Spaniard looking to win his third major. However, the 2021 US Open and 2023 Masters winner, completely faltered in the back nine especially on Quail Hollow's infamous Green Mile where he bogeyed once and double-bogeyed twice to fall to 2-over par on the day and a tie for 8th place. Related article The lurking menace of golf's Green Mile As Rahm fell, Scheffler arose past his early struggles, sinking back-to-back birdies on holes 14 and 15 to reclaim the lead and never looked back. The 30-year-old, former Arizona State Sun Devil Rahm, said this was a position he has never been in when asked how he would “heal” from this. “I think it's the first time I've been in position to win a major that close and haven't done it. The only times I think I've been in the lead in a major on a Sunday, I've been able to close it out, and this is a very different situation,” Rahm told reporters after the round. But if it's ever a time, that's what family's for is the best. To them, whatever I did today, win or lose, they don't care. Following the win Sunday, Scheffler quipped he had a few “jokes” that he would keep to himself about his experience last year with the arrest. Despite being pressured to say them, Scheffler said it was “not a good idea” but expanded on why it was “sweet” to be sitting with the trophy a year later. “Last year sometimes, it still doesn't almost feel real. But I can tell you it's very sweet sitting here with the trophy this year,” Scheffler added. Last year, Scheffler was arrested trying to drive around the scene of a fatal crash ahead of his tee time at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. He had been charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer and the lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, Jefferson County court records showed. In what Scheffler called a “severe miscommunication in a chaotic situation,” adding he held “no ill will” toward the detective who arrested him, he ultimately finished eight shots behind the winner, Xander Schauffele, for a share of eighth place. Scheffler can begin his quest for a fourth career major win next month at the US Open at the Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pennsylvania. This story has been updated with additional reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery. “Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family,” Obama said in a post on X. “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery.” During the 2016 speech, Obama tasked then-Vice President Biden with an initiative to find a cure for cancer. “Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer,” Obama said at the time. “Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. Biden commenced his “Moonshot” initiative with a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, one of the world's leading cancer research facilities. “You're on the cusp of some breakthroughs,” Biden said then. Biden made pursuing a cure for cancer an important part of his work, particularly after his son, Beau Biden, died from brain cancer in January 2015.</p>
