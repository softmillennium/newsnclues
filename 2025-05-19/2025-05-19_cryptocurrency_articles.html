                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jamie Dimon isn't a fan of bitcoin, but he plans to start offering it to clients of JPMorgan Chase nonetheless. "We are going to allow you to buy it," Dimon said at the bank's annual presentation for investors on Monday. We're going to put it in statements for clients." But I defend your right to smoke," he said in explaining his position. In the roughly 40-minute session, he touched on a range of topics, from the economy to what he expects from Trump's regulators. Dimon sounded a dour note on the economy, saying he thinks the risk of stagflation is "two times" higher than many think, and making dire predictions on credit as an investment class. He also said the bank had lost some commercial opportunities as a result of Trump's trade war. "We've lost business because of that," he said in response to an analyst's question. He sounded upbeat, however, when it came to the president's regulatory agenda. Some will take longer than others, but they all want to do it." He called on regulators to consider lightening regulations for publicly traded companies, which he said have been halved since the 1990s, from 8,000 to 4,000. "We're driving companies out of the public marketplace because of expensive reporting, litigation, cookie-cutter approaches to boards, compensation, and litigation," he said. "I would love to be a private company," he added. Dimon also raised questions about the rapid expansion of investments in credit, including through funds raised to make nonbank loans, or private credit. I think credit today is a bad risk," he said, adding, "I think that people who haven't been through major downturns are missing the point about what can happen in credit." As interest rates rise and economic conditions soften, the risk of credit defaults rises, sometimes leaving borrowers strapped for cash and lenders struggling to recoup capital. Earlier in the day, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's CEO of consumer and community banking, said the firm was "closely monitoring the whole ecosystem" of lending but not giving up in spite of warning signs. "The environment is very challenging for home lending and auto," she said, adding, "but we remain committed." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>

TOPICS:

(TNND) — JPMorgan Chase, one of the world's largest banks, has announced it will allow its clients to buy cryptocurrency, marking a significant step for digital currency as it gains traction in mainstream banking. 

However, the bank's Chief Executive Officer, Jamie Dimon, remains skeptical about the move.

"We are going to allow you to buy it, we're not going to custody it. We're going to put it in statements for clients," Dimon said during the bank's annual investors day conference.

This development follows a similar move by Morgan Stanley, which began allowing advisors to pitch certain bitcoin exchange-traded funds to select clients in August. Despite the shift, Dimon maintains his personal reservations about bitcoin, citing concerns over issues such as money laundering and unclear ownership.

"I don't think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke," Dimon said. "I defend your right to buy bitcoin."

While banks now have the ability to custody cryptocurrency, they still face restrictions on working directly with crypto firms without explicit approval from the Federal Reserve.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interchain Labs announced it is collaborating with a consortium of major banks and the Colombian government to pilot the country's first central-bank digital currency (CBDC) on the Cosmos network, using IBC Eureka as its primary transfer protocol. The initiative seeks to modernize cross-border settlements by leveraging the efficiency of programmable money without compromising institutional security. it carries the same legal status as cash while enabling programmable features typically found in digital payments. “When you're the Colombian government, there is no way you're trusting anyone except for yourself,” said Maghnus Mareneck, chief executive officer of Interchain Labs. So having technology they can understand and change is the most important thing in terms of the security assumptions.” Mareneck noted that this mirrors the strategy of real-world asset issuers such as Ondo Finance — which has onboarded investors including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock — in building dedicated Cosmos chains. These issuers configure their own validator parameters so transfers occur only under preapproved conditions. “IBC Eureka only rests upon the trust assumptions of your blockchain,” Mareneck noted. The pilot allows Colombia's central bank and partner banks to define and modify their list of trusted validators, effectively creating a permissioned CBDC rail atop a public network. By starting with a controlled set of participants — and adding new ones only as confidence grows — the project aims to demonstrate that programmable money can deliver faster, more transparent settlements without sacrificing institutional security.</p>

Dimon, long known for his skepticism of cryptocurrency, doubled down in his closing remarks, saying he's still “not a fan” of bitcoin, mainly because of its use for illegal activities, including sex trafficking and money laundering He also pushed back on the industry's hype around blockchain technology, arguing it's less important than it's made out to be — even as JPMorgan continues building in the space. “We have been talking about blockchain for 12 to 15 years," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan Chase is finally allowing clients to buy bitcoin. But CEO Jamie Dimon is still a skeptic. "We are going to allow you to buy it," Dimon said at the bank's annual investor day on Monday. We're going to put it in statements for clients." Since August, Morgan Stanley has allowed its financial advisors to pitch some spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds to qualifying clients. Dimon made it clear that his personal view of bitcoin remains unchanged, highlighting issues like money laundering and the lack of clarity surrounding ownership, along with "the sex trafficking, the terrorism." The bank is looking at offering clients access to bitcoin ETFs, according to a person briefed on its plans. Until now, the company has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of bitcoin. When crypto valuations were soaring in 2021, Dimon dismissed bitcoin as "worthless." He told lawmakers during a Senate hearing in late 2023 that he's "always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc.," and that, "The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers … money laundering, tax avoidance." At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Dimon said, "Bitcoin does nothing.

A notice issued by the Fed in Jan. 2023 continues to restrict banks from certain crypto-related activities. While banks can now custody crypto, thanks to the repeal of an accounting rule called SAB 121, they still face certain limitations on working directly with digital asset firms.

According to Van de Poppe, LINK is most likely a solid play looking ahead, with the $14 level being a potential entry point for bulls. “It would be great if LINK holds this first level of support. If buying pressure comes in here, that's a sign of continuation. Van de Poppe believes the Solana (SOL) challenger is close to igniting a new leg up.

According to a May 19 announcement, Strategy acquired 7,390 BTC for about $764.9 million at an average price just under $103,500. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor made his usual hint at the purchase in a May 18 X post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin needs to break through $110,000 and rally toward the $150,000–$200,000 range on rising trading volume for the alt season to begin, said BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes in a recent interview with Fortune Crypto. “I think that happens sometime in the summer or early third quarter, and then the rotation starts into various altcoins,” Hayes noted, when asked what level Bitcoin needs to reach to trigger an altcoin rally. Alt season describes the market phase where altcoins outperform Bitcoin, historically occurring after BTC rallies when traders shift capital from BTC into altcoins seeking greater upside. Bitcoin has led the market in recent weeks, but altcoins have been slower to respond. According to Hayes, unlike the explosive altcoin rally of 2021, where nearly every token surged regardless of fundamentals, the next cycle will likely be more selective. He believes a new narrative will drive attention and speculative trading in specific assets, but warns that many “dino coins” are unlikely to recover. “A lot of those coins have high FDV, low float, no customers, no revenue, just some CEX listings, that went down 95%, I don't really see why those should do well in the next cycle,” he added. Hayes, who now manages the Maelstrom fund after receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump earlier this year, expects Bitcoin to climb toward $200,000 in its next surge and reach $250,000 by the end of the year. He projects Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2028, just as Trump's term is set to conclude. The rally has been fueled by persistent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and steady corporate demand. Hayes maintains a large position in gold, he revealed during the interview, with around 20% of his portfolio allocated to the asset. His holdings include physical gold stored in a vault as well as substantial investments in gold mining equities, which he believes remain undervalued despite the metal's rising prices. “I think that Ethereum could outperform Solana in this next sort of 18-24 months bull run,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin surpassed the symbolic threshold of $105,000 this Sunday, a first since January 2025. This renewed strength – +2% over 24 hours and +25% over one month – seems to be part of a cautious optimism, favored by the easing of the American trade war. But beware, the current euphoria might mask a more nuanced reality. In other words, its market share is eroding as altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, or Dogecoin gain ground. For some analysts, however, this dynamic does not signal the arrival of a sustainable altcoin season. It rather reflects a temporary appetite for risk assets in an still fragile context. Contrarian traders have learned the hard way: betting against this bullish trend can be very costly. While BTC attracts the spotlight, attention also shifts to other players. As for Dogecoin, it leads with an impressive 8% rise, reaching $0.232. This renewed interest in altcoins is explained by several factors. Macroeconomic uncertainties, lingering geopolitical tensions, and possible volatility resurgence could bring investors back to Bitcoin, the crypto market's safe haven. In other words, if strong winds blow, altcoins could sink again. But believing this heralds a lasting reshuffling of the cards would be premature. Historically, altcoin season phases occur only after a sustained accumulation phase and Bitcoin stabilization. Yet, we are still in the midst of speculative frenzy. Seasoned investors know: when adrenaline rises, crowd movements can create illusions. If the economic or political climate were to tighten, the market could quickly turn defensive, refocusing flows on Bitcoin and leaving other cryptos behind. Bitcoin flirts with its all-time high, and the whole crypto market seems carried by a wind of optimism. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!
