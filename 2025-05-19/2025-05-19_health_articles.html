                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using the gene scissors CRISPR and stem cells, researchers at Stockholm University and the UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI) at King's College London have managed to identify a common denominator for different gene mutations that all cause the neurological disease ALS. "We show that the nerve cells, termed motor neurons, that will eventually die in ALS have problems soon after they are formed. The research team was able to establish that these problems were common to all ALS-caused mutations, which will be important for future treatments of the disease. This means that there are common factors that could be targeted with drugs, regardless of the cause of the disease." The researchers used the gene scissors CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce various ALS-causing mutations into human stem cells, called iPS cells. From these, motor neurons, the nerve cells that are lost in in ALS, and interneurons, nerve cells that are relatively resistant to the disease, were produced. These were then analyzed with single-cell RNA sequencing, a method that enables identification of all messenger molecules (mRNA) in each individual cell and with that understand how a particular cell works, how it talks to its neighbors and if it starts to have problems. "In the data we obtained, we identified a common disease signature across all ALS-causing mutations, which was unique to motor neurons and thus did not arise in resistant neurons," says Dr Christoph Schweingruber, first author of the study. "Until now, it has been believed that it is the change where the proteins are within the cells, called mislocalization, that occurs first," says Dr Marc-David Ruepp. In ALS, it is often said that some problems are caused by a loss of function in a protein that is mutated, while other problems arise due to the opposite, namely the emergence of a new toxic function that has been obtained through the mutation, called "gain-of-function", but according to Eva Hedlund, it has not always been easy to clarify how it really works and much is still unknown. "By making various CRISPR mutations in the ALS-causing FUS-gene, we have now been able to show for the first time that most errors arising are caused by a new toxic property of the protein, not by a loss of function," says Dr Christoph Schweingruber. Without them the nerve cells do not have enough energy to communicate properly with other cells," says Dr Eva Hedlund. The new discoveries open up for early treatment methods, something that for the research team is a continuous work in progress. "We are trying to understand how these early errors occur in the sensitive motor neurons in ALS, and how it affects energy levels in the cells and their communication and necessary contacts with muscle fibers. We believe that these are important keys to the understanding of why the synapses between motor neurons and muscles is broken in ALS and also to identify new targets for therapies," says Dr. Eva Hedlund.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announcing a new article publication for Cardiovascular Innovations and Applications journal. Cardiac dysfunction is a prevalent and serious complication after cardiac arrest (CA), yet limited therapeutic interventions are available. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a critical mediator of innate immune responses, has recently been identified as a potential contributor to cardiac dysfunction. This study was aimed at investigating the role of cGAS in post-CA cardiac dysfunction. In vivo, in rats with ventricular fibrillation (VF)-induced CA, a selective cGAS inhibitor (RU.521) was used to specifically inhibit cGAS activity, thereby blocking its downstream signaling pathway. In vitro, hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) were used to stimulate H9C2 cardiomyocytes, and a specific siRNA targeting cGAS was applied to knock down cGAS expression. Pharmacological inhibition of cGAS with RU.521 effectively ameliorated cardiac function and maintained hemodynamic stability in ROSC rats. Mechanistically, cGAS inhibition effectively attenuated CA-induced mitochondrial injury while concurrently suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis. These findings highlight a strong association between cGAS upregulation and cardiac dysfunction after CA. Targeting cGAS might provide a promising therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac function in patients with CA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A wearable pulse oximeter and connected software platform show promise for monitoring obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep-related breathing diseases, according to research presented at the ATS 2025 International Conference. The device (pulse oximeter), which is cleared for medical use, was designed for comfort and ease of use; a clinical trial found high rates of utilization by patients. Investigators in our clinical research trials report how useful longitudinal data are to observe night-to-night variability and the response to treatment of OSA. Ketan Mehta, MS, head of product and engineering for Connected Wearables at Apnimed Wearable sensors like the Oura ring and Apple Watch that measure biometrics during sleep are widely used by consumers, but are not cleared for medical use. At the same time, other medical devices used in sleep studies gather clinically relevant data, but are too cumbersome and costly to use for frequent monitoring. The device provides a bridge between these two extremes, he said. Worn as a ring, the device offers several key differences from other consumer wearables. Notably, it uses transmittance-based photoplethysmography, which has been shown to be more suitable for the proximal phalanx region, provide better signal-to-noise ratio, and is more effective in low perfusion situations. It also engages in continuous data collection, rather than spot checks, he added. The device connects to an app that users can access from their smartphone, giving patients access to a subset of the same data as their health care providers. This offers the opportunity for shared decision making between patient and provider using digital medicine," Mr. Mehta said. In addition to clinical use, the device and connected software could be applied to research in conditions like COPD, ILD, and other conditions that involve sleep-related breathing diseases and require monitoring of oxygenation, noted Mr. Mehta. The device is FDA cleared for medical use; the connected software requires similar clearance before it can be deployed outside of clinical trial settings Discover how Bruker is advancing live single-cell functional analysis, helping to accelerate breakthroughs in immunology and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People who sit or remain sedentary for more than 14 hours a day, on average, may have a higher risk of a cardiovascular event or death in the year after treatment at a hospital for symptoms of a heart attack such as chest pain, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's peer-reviewed scientific journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. Previous research from the study authors found that people who had experienced a heart attack were spending up to 12 to 13 hours each day being sedentary, defined as any awake activity that involved little-to-no physical movement. In this study, the researchers used a wrist accelerometer to track the amount of time each participant spent moving or being sedentary for a median of 30 days after discharge from a hospital's emergency department. These measurements allowed the researchers to infer the intensity of a participant's physical activity, and they provide more accurate measurements of the participants' time spent moving, rather than asking participants to remember. Some examples of moderate intensity physical activities are brisk walking, water aerobics, dancing, playing doubles tennis or gardening, and examples of vigorous-intensity activities are running, lap swimming, heavy yardwork such as continuous digging or hoeing, playing singles tennis or jumping rope. "Current treatment guidelines after a cardiac event focus mainly on encouraging patients to exercise regularly," said study lead author Keith Diaz, Ph.D., the Florence Irving Associate Professor of Behavioral Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, a certified exercise physiologist and a volunteer member of the American Heart Association's Physical Activity Science Committee. "In our study, we explored whether sedentary time itself may contribute to cardiovascular risk." Researchers followed more than 600 adults, ages 21 to 96, treated for a heart attack or chest pain in the emergency department at a single hospital system in New York City. Participants wore a wrist accelerometer for a median of 30 consecutive days after hospital discharge to measure the amount of time they spent sitting or being inactive each day. Additional cardiac events and deaths were evaluated one year after hospital discharge via phone surveys with patients, electronic health records and the Social Security Death Index. The study was focused on understanding the risk of sedentary behavior and identifying modifiable risk factors that may improve long-term outcomes in this high-risk group. We were surprised that replacing sedentary time with sleep also lowered risk. More physical activity and more sleep are healthier than sitting, so we hope these findings support health professionals to move toward a more holistic, flexible and individualized approach for physical activity in patients after a heart attack or chest pain." Keith Diaz, Ph.D., the Florence Irving Associate Professor of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center Physical activity and sleep are both key components of the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8, a list of health behaviors and factors that support optimal cardiovascular health. Poor sleep is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which claims more lives each year in the U.S. than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined, according to the American Heart Association's 2025 Statistical Update. Additionally, there was no information about participants' income and characteristics of the neighborhoods where they live, which limits the study's ability to account for social and environmental factors including participants' risk of one-year cardiac events and deaths. Also, hospital discharge information about whether patients were sent home, referred to rehabilitation or referred to other care centers such as skilled nursing facilities were not collected. "This study provides further support for a 'sit less, move more' strategy and – important for patients recently hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome who may have barriers to more intense exercise – found that increasing light-intensity activities by 30 minutes a day was related to dramatic reductions in the risk of a cardiac event within the next year," said Bethany Barone Gibbs, Ph.D., FAHA, a professor and chair of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the School of Public Health at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia, and immediate past chair of the American Heart Association's Physical Activity Committee. "This study found that replacing sedentary time with light intensity activities, like tidying up the house or strolling at a slow pace, was nearly as beneficial as moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activities, like biking or doing aerobics. "These findings suggest sitting less and doing anything else – like taking a walk, cooking, playing with your dog or gardening – will help you stay healthier."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During his first administration, President Donald Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services. Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans — a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works. In Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far. "This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans," CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement. "This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing," Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies. The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause — or worsen — physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health. Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price. The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage. "What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need," said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction. Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident. "When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments," said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. "If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results — people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise," said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers. Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts. But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection. "We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture," said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. "We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health." Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce. While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment — operating in mostly rural counties — by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations. State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services. "Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waist-to-height ratio predicts heart failure incidence, according to research presented today at Heart Failure 2025, a scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Obesity affects a substantial proportion of patients with heart failure (HF) and it has been reported that the risk of HF increases as body mass index (BMI) increases. Study presenter, Dr. Amra Jujic from Lund University, Malmö, Sweden, explained why the current analysis was carried out: "BMI is the most common measure of obesity, but it is influenced by factors such as sex and ethnicity, and does not take into account the distribution of body fat. Waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) is considered a more robust measure of central adiposity, the harmful deposition of fat around visceral organs. Participants were aged 45–73 years at baseline and were selected so that approximately one-third had normal blood glucose levels, one-third had impaired fasting glucose and one-third had diabetes. All participants were followed prospectively for incident HF. The study population had a mean age of 67 years and 29% were women. During the median follow-up of 12.6 years, 132 HF events occurred. Higher WtHR was associated with a significantly increased risk of incident HF (hazard ratio [HR] per one standard deviation increase 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.61; p=0.001), independent of confounders. When WtHR was categorised into quartiles, individuals with the highest values of WtHR (median of 0.65) had a significantly higher risk of HF compared with individuals in the other three quartiles (HR 2.71; 95% CI 1.64–4.48; p<0.001). He concluded: "We found that WtHR was a significant predictor of incident HF and our results suggest that WtHR may be a better metric than BMI to identify patients with HF who could benefit from therapies for obesity. Our next step is to investigate whether WtHR predicts incident HF and also other cardiometabolic disorders in a larger cohort."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Surgeons from Keck Medicine of USC and UCLA Health have performed the world's first-in-human bladder transplant. The surgery was successfully completed at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on May 4, 2025, in a joint effort by Inderbir Gill, MD, founding executive director of USC Urology, and Nima Nassiri, MD, urologic transplant surgeon and director of the UCLA Vascularized Composite Bladder Allograft Transplant Program. This surgery is a historic moment in medicine and stands to impact how we manage carefully selected patients with highly symptomatic 'terminal' bladders that are no longer functioning. Transplantation is a lifesaving and life-enhancing treatment option for many conditions affecting major organs, and now the bladder can be added to the list." "This first attempt at bladder transplantation has been over four years in the making," Nassiri said. Nassiri, formerly a urology resident with the Keck School and now assistant professor of urology and kidney transplantation at UCLA, and Gill worked together for several years at the Keck School to develop the new surgical technique, design a clinical trial and secure the necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous pre-clinical procedures were performed both at Keck Medical Center of USC and OneLegacy, Southern California's organ procurement organization, to prepare for this first-in-human bladder transplant. The patient had been dialysis-dependent for seven years. He lost the majority of his bladder during surgery to resect cancer over five years ago, leaving the remainder of his bladder too small and compromised to function appropriately. Both of his kidneys were subsequently removed due to renal cancer. "The kidney immediately made a large volume of urine, and the patient's kidney function improved immediately," Nassiri added. "There was no need for any dialysis after surgery, and the urine drained properly into the new bladder." "The patient is doing well, and we are satisfied with his clinical progress to date." Some develop terminal bladders that are either non-functioning and/or cause constant pain, repeated infections and other complications. Current treatment for severe terminal cases of bladder dysfunction or a bladder that has been removed due to various conditions includes replacement or augmentation of the urinary reservoir. "While these surgeries can be effective, they come with many short-and long-term risks that compromise a patient's health such as recurrent infections, compromised kidney function and digestive issues," said Gill. "Because of the need for long-term immunosuppression, the best current candidates are those with a pre-existing organ transplant or those who need a combined kidney and bladder transplant," said Nassiri. As a first-in-human attempt, there are naturally many unknowns associated with the procedure, such as how well the transplanted bladder will function immediately and over time, and how much immunosuppression will ultimately be needed. "Despite the unknowns, our goal is to understand if bladder transplantation can help patients with severely compromised bladders lead healthier lives," said Gill. As part of the research and development stage, Gill and Nassiri successfully completed numerous practice transplantation surgeries at Keck Medical Center of USC, including the first-ever robotic bladder retrievals and successful robotic transplantations in five recently deceased donors with cardiac function maintained on ventilator support. Several non-robotic trial runs of bladder recovery were performed at OneLegacy by Gill and Nassiri, allowing them to perfect the technique while working alongside multidisciplinary surgical teams. The bladder transplant was done as part of a UCLA clinical trial. Gill and Nassiri hope to perform more bladder transplants together in the near future. Under Gill's leadership, USC Urology has rapidly established itself as a pioneer and world leader in the most advanced robotic urologic oncologic surgeries for kidney, bladder, prostate, testicular and penile cancers, and has achieved important milestones leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize patient outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rising temperatures increase the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), according to a large new study published at the ATS 2025 International Conference. This study really highlights the societal burden associated with the increase in OSA prevalence due to rising temperatures." Previous cross-sectional studies identified a link between ambient temperature and OSA severity. However, this is the first to explain and describe that connection in detail. For the study, researchers analyzed a consumer database of more than 116,000 worldwide users of an under-mattress sensor validated to estimate OSA severity. The dataset included around 500 repeat measurements per user. Researchers then analyzed this data against 24-hour ambient temperatures extracted from climate models. However, these findings varied by region, with people in European countries seeing higher rates of OSA when temperatures rise than those in Australia and the United States. They conducted modeling including disability-adjusted-life-years, productivity losses, and health economics to estimate the OSA burden under several climate scenarios. They found that any scenario that involved temperatures rising 2 degrees Celsius or higher would result in a 1.5-fold to 3-fold increase to the OSA burden by the year 2100. They estimated that climate change has already increased the OSA burden by 50 percent to 100 percent since the year 2000. In addition to providing further evidence of the major threat of climate change to human health and wellbeing, Dr. Lechat said the study highlighted the importance of developing effective interventions to diagnose and manage OSA. Next, the team plans to develop intervention studies looking at strategies to mitigate the effects of temperature on OSA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite national guidelines, most American teen girls chase weight loss, often at the expense of healthier habits. New research shows that intent to slim down doesn't always align with health, underscoring the urgent need for supportive interventions. Study: Lifestyle Behaviors Associated with Weight Loss Intent in Adolescent Girls: Findings from the US 2021 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers at Worcester State University, USA, investigated the lifestyle behaviors associated with weight loss intent in adolescent girls using nationally representative data. Obesity affects over 22% of adolescents aged 12 to 19 in the United States (US), with long-term risks such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Girls, more than boys, often experience body dissatisfaction, which can drive weight loss attempts. Social media, peer pressure, and family environments significantly influence young girls' perceptions of ideal body weight. Despite existing physical activity and dietary guidelines, adherence remains low among adolescents, especially girls. Simultaneously, behaviors like skipping breakfast, insufficient sleep, vaping, and alcohol use are rising. A better understanding of these lifestyle patterns is critical. Further research is needed to clarify causal relationships. The present study used data from the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, a cross-sectional survey administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess health behaviors in US high school students. Researchers extracted data from 4,362 female students in grades 9 through 12 who responded to the question about weight loss intent. Variables included dietary habits (e.g., breakfast, fruit, and vegetable intake), physical activity (e.g., strength training, aerobic activity), screen time, sleep duration, alcohol use, and vaping. The Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile was calculated using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts based on self-reported weight and height. Based on the discrepancy between actual BMI and self-view, weight perception was categorized as accurate, underestimated, or overestimated. Logistic regression analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 29, adjusting for grade level, race/ethnicity, BMI percentile, and other covariates. Models were stratified by body image perception to examine subgroup differences. However, 43.4% of girls in the normal weight category also reported a desire to lose weight, indicating widespread body image dissatisfaction. Additionally, among girls with a normal BMI, 16% were trying to gain weight, reflecting further complexity in body image concerns. Proportion of adolescent girls reporting weight loss intent by BMI percentile categories (Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese) in the 2021 YRBS Survey: BMI, Body Mass Index. Girls trying to lose weight were more likely to engage in muscle-strengthening activities (odds ratio [OR] 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.57) and report more than three hours of daily screen time (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58). They were also more likely to have consumed alcohol (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.32-1.98) and used electronic vapor products (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47) in the previous month. Conversely, healthier habits were less common in this group. There was no significant difference in the frequency of consuming fruits, milk, or soda. While muscle-strengthening exercises were more common among girls intending to lose weight (but not overall aerobic or total physical activity), there was no difference in meeting the national recommendation for 60 minutes of physical activity daily. The link between weight loss intent and muscle-building activity may reflect an attempt to lose weight rather than focusing on overall health. Girls trying to lose weight slept less and used screens more, both of which can contribute to weight gain and mental health challenges. Extended screen time is known to influence self-esteem and body dissatisfaction, especially among adolescent girls, reinforcing a cycle of negative self-image and unhealthy behaviors. The desire to lose weight was most common among obese girls (87.8%), but was notably high among girls in the normal weight range as well. These findings suggest that weight loss intent is not always aligned with actual weight status and may reflect unrealistic body standards. To summarize, this study shows that adolescent girls trying to lose weight often engage in unhealthy behaviors such as skipping breakfast, inadequate sleep, excessive screen time, alcohol use, and vaping. These habits may not support long-term weight management or overall well-being. Moreover, a significant portion of girls with a normal BMI still express weight loss intent, highlighting concerns about distorted body image. Notably, the cross-sectional design means causality cannot be determined, but the associations suggest important targets for intervention. Interventions should focus on promoting healthy behaviors over weight fixation, integrating strategies like sleep hygiene, reducing screen exposure, addressing unrealistic body standards, and improving body image perceptions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Growing emphasis on self-reliance and trade barriers could impair the ability of people to consume healthy and sustainable diets around the world. Research teams from the University of Göttingen and the University of Edinburgh investigated the extent to which 186 countries can feed their own populations solely through domestic production. Only one in seven countries achieve self-sufficiency in five or more essential food groups – most within Europe and South America. Six countries, primarily in the Middle East, do not produce enough of a single food group for their own needs. Notably, only Guyana achieved complete self-sufficiency in all seven food groups, while China and Vietnam nearly reach this by achieving six. Significant discrepancies exist regarding self-sufficiency in meat and dairy products. For example, while several European countries produce far in excess of their needs, domestic production in African countries is very low. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, produces only about 15% of its requirements for meat. The analysis uncovers shortfalls in nutrient-dense plant protein worldwide: fewer than half of the countries achieve their domestic needs for legumes (for instance, beans and peas), or nuts and seeds, while only a quarter do so for vegetables. The study additionally highlights that some countries have low production and simultaneously rely almost exclusively on a single trading partner for more than half of their imports, compounding their vulnerability. This pattern is especially pronounced in smaller countries, including island states. However, heavy reliance on imports from single countries can leave nations vulnerable. Building resilient food supply chains is imperative for ensuring public health." This research was financially supported by the European Centre for Advanced Studies (ECAS).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Advances in medical technology over the last 30 years have made it easier to detect and treat diabetes, leading to significant health improvements in people with the disease. Despite this, workforce participation among people with diabetes has not improved over time, finds new USC Schaeffer Center research in JAMA Health Forum. Historically, workforce participation rates have been much lower among people with diabetes due to factors like health complications, time needed to manage the disease and workplace barriers. But the surprising failure of substantial health gains to drive economic progress in this population - a phenomenon that researchers call the "diabetes paradox" - suggests that rising diabetes prevalence poses a growing threat to the labor market and strain on government disability programs. Instead, there is a large and growing population of people with diabetes who are having challenges with labor market performance that should be addressed." Jack Chapel, study author, scholar at the Schaeffer Center and research assistant professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy Researchers analyzed 20 years of National Health Interview Survey data (1998-2018) on nearly 250,000 Americans ages 40-64. This age range includes a person's peak earning years and coincides with a period when most diabetes diagnoses occur - about 1 in 7 Americans ages 45-64 have diagnosed diabetes, according to federal data. The study findings suggest expanded access to powerful new anti-obesity medications, which could prevent or delay diabetes, could have positive effects on the labor market. The diabetes paradox may be partly explained by shifts in who is diagnosed, disparities in access to medical advances and the changing nature of work, researchers said. There may be some good news buried in the findings. If more people with worse economic prospects - due to reasons unrelated to health - are diagnosed with diabetes, it seems likely that overall economic outcomes for this group would have declined. "The fact that economic outcomes have remained stable might mean things are actually improving beneath the surface," said study author Matthew Kahn, a senior scholar at the Schaeffer Center and Provost Professor of Economics and Spatial Sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. "My hunch is that the expansion of health care access to the poor and the proactive steps taken by those diagnosed with pre-diabetes has meant that the new cohort of people diagnosed with diabetes is more economically vulnerable than in previous decades, complicating comparison over time." To better understand labor trends among people with diabetes and identify opportunities to improve workforce participation, researchers said more clinical trials for diabetes prevention and management therapies should assess economic outcomes like employment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide, with rising incidence linked to dietary and lifestyle changes. The epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR/MAPK) signaling pathway, frequently hyperactivated in CRC, drives tumor growth, but its downstream effectors-particularly noncoding RNAs-are not fully understood. The study reveals that ESSENCE stabilizes a key metabolic enzyme, CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase), to promote cancer growth and suppress ferroptosis. The findings also propose a novel combination therapy targeting ESSENCE-high tumors, offering new hope for precision treatment. ESSENCE expression correlates with poor prognosis in CRC patients and is transcriptionally activated by the EGF-induced transcription factor EGR1. Mechanistically, ESSENCE binds to CAD, a multifunctional enzyme critical for pyrimidine synthesis, and blocks its degradation by the E3 ligase KEAP1. This stabilization fuels cancer cell proliferation and ferroptosis defense. Combining the MEK inhibitor selumetinib and the ferroptosis inducer sulfasalazine synergistically suppressed tumor growth in ESSENCE-high PDX models, while ESSENCE-low tumors showed minimal response. These findings support the clinical potential of patient stratification based on ESSENCE expression levels to optimize combination therapy selection. The study demonstrates that ESSENCE serves not only as a prognostic biomarker but also as a directly targetable molecular driver in colorectal cancer. However, whether ESSENCE plays a similar oncogenic role in other malignancies beyond colorectal cancer remains to be explored. Additionally, the proposed combination therapy requires further preclinical validation before clinical translation. Future study will focus on developing targeted therapies against the newly identified ESSENCE-CAD signaling axis, which may expand treatment strategies for a broader range of cancers. This study highlights the growing importance of lncRNAs in precision oncology and underscores the need for innovative approaches to combat treatment resistance. EGF-upregulated lncRNA ESSENCE promotes colorectal cancer growth through stabilizing CAD and ferroptosis defence.
