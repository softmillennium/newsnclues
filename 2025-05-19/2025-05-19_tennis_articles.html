                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Open's Arthur Ashe Stadium will get an overhaul as part of an $800 million project announced Monday that the U.S. Tennis Association is touting as the “largest single investment” in the history of its Grand Slam tournament. FILE- Fans enter Arthur Ashe Stadium during the second round of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2022, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Open's Arthur Ashe Stadium will get an overhaul as part of an $800 million project announced Monday that the U.S. Tennis Association is touting as the “largest single investment” in the history of its Grand Slam tournament. According to a class-action antitrust lawsuit filed in federal court in New York in March by a players' group co-founded by Novak Djokovic, the four major tennis tournaments — the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, French Open and Australian Open — “generated over $1.5 billion collectively in 2024, while only paying between (10% to 20%) of revenue to players.” Separately, in April, Djokovic, Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff were among 20 leading tennis players who signed a letter sent to the heads of the Grand Slam tournaments seeking more prize money and a greater say in what they called “decisions that directly impact us.” Play in the main draw this year begins on Aug. 24 — shifting to a Sunday start for the first time in the Open era, which began in 1968, and adding a 15th day of competition. The USTA's work, which is expected to be done in time for the 2027 U.S. Open, includes constructing a $250 million player performance center. The new player area will be next to the practice courts and include additional courts, locker rooms and lounges. Ashe's courtside-level seating capacity will increase from 3,000 to 5,000, while some seats in other sections will be removed, leaving the arena's total similar to what it is now — around 23,000 to 24,000, the biggest in Grand Slam tennis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its central venue, Arthur Ashe Stadium — the biggest in tennis with almost 24,000 seats — is a 30-year-old concrete edifice with narrow corridors and limited bathrooms and dining facilities. It was built at a time when everyone, the four biggest tennis tournaments in the world included, expected a lot less from their arenas. Over the next three years, Ashe, as it is commonly known, will undergo a massive, $800 million facelift that every fan, player and United States Tennis Association (USTA) partner should feel in a big way. The project is privately funded, though the USTA has in the past received access to tax-exempt bonds and a special taxation deal with New York City that is common among local sports operations. The 2024 U.S. Open brought in almost $560 million in operating revenue, according to the USTA's financial report for that year. It's the latest move in an ongoing tennis arms race. They all want to keep up with each other at a minimum and to outpace each other wherever they can, in a bid to be the best of the best. Tennis Australia in 2022 added a new stadium, the Kia Arena, to Melbourne Park, the site of the Australian Open; it has spent over $1 billion Australian dollars ($645 million USD) on upgrades in recent years. The All England Club, which stages Wimbledon, is in a legal battle with local residents over the building of 39 new tennis courts, one of them a stadium court, so that it can add capacity and hold its qualifying competition there, rather than roughly five miles away. Roland Garros, site of the French Open in Paris, recently added a roof on its second court as well as an additional 5,000-seat stadium. It found room for some new facilities in a set of old stone buildings nearby. “This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis,” Lew Sherr, the chief executive and executive director of the USTA said of his organization's move, a statement that his fellow Grand Slam leaders would likely query. The four-story structure will include vastly expanded locker rooms, warm-up areas and dining facilities. The front of Ashe will get the arena version of a fancy new doorway, in the form of a giant, Daniel Libeskind-designed steel medallion hanging off its south end. For the fancy people who shell out thousands of dollars for tickets with high-end hospitality, the renovation will bring a renovated courtside seating area. It's a good deal for the tournament's coffers: like many premium sports events, the U.S. Open experiences some of its highest demand for its most expensive tickets, including those courtside seats that cost more than $1,000 each per session. That expansion will pull some inventory from what is known as the loge level, which includes tickets in the mid-range price point of roughly $200 to $600 each. Accomplishing all this during the next two-and-a-half years without any interruption to staging a three-week tournament will take some juggling. The entire Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is just 46.5 acres, and doesn't have much extra space to stage a major construction project. The USTA went through this the last decade when it rebuilt Louis Armstrong Stadium, built the new Grand Stand court, and added Court 17, a kind of theater-in-the-round of a tennis stadium that seats 2,800. That's more complicated than it sounds, since the complex sits on a swamp and buildings requires extra reinforcement to mitigate sinking. By then, this Grand Slam arms race will surely have found a new frontier.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Playing her first Grand Slam qualifying event in six years, Bianca Andreescu was in no mood to hang around. The former US Open champion raced into the second round of Roland Garros qualifying, whitewashing China's Yao Xinxin 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. The last time she won a match 6-0, 6-0 at any level was in Junior Billie Jean King Cup in 2016 over Watsachol Sawatdee. Previously, she had notched two 6-0, 6-1 wins in professional events: over Ari Matsumoto in the first round of the 2018 Gifu ITF W25, and over Garbiñe Muguruza in the 2019 Indian Wells quarterfinals. This is just the fifth tournament of Andreescu's season following an appendectomy in February, and she is currently ranked No. Last week, she reached the fourth round of Rome, notching two Top 20 wins over Donna Vekic and Elena Rybakina en route. Andreescu has contested Roland Garros qualifying twice previously, falling to Tereza Smitkova in the 2017 first round and Richel Hogenkamp in the 2018 third round. Her best main-draw performances at the tournament to date are third-round finishes in 2023 and 2024. There was a gulf in experience between Andreescu and Yao, the 21-year-old who notched her first tour-level win in Jiujiang last October and who was playing the first Grand Slam qualifying event of her career. The Canadian did not face game point in the first set, repeatedly exposing Yao's movement on clay with a series of drop shots. 261-ranked Yao improved in the second set, but could not take advantage of three points to hold serve. "I felt really good coming here," said Andreescu afterwards. "It's the French open -- no matter what match you play in whatever draw, it's a very important match. I was very pleased with my attitude today." 17 seed in the qualifying draw, will next face former No. Elsewhere, Andreescu's Canadian compatriot and the partner with whom she won the 2017 Australian Open and Roland Garros girls' doubles titles, Carson Branstine, notched her first career major qualifying win 6-4, 6-2 over Whitney Osuigwe. Two of Day 1's longest matches were won by local wild cards who thrilled the Parisian crowd in a pair of rollercoaster epics. Margaux Rouvroy -- who previously upset Sofia Kenin in the 2023 qualifying first round -- needed 3 hours and 40 minutes to defeat Japan's Haruka Kaji 6-7(7), 7-5, 7-6[3], sinking to her knees after triumphing in a gruelling clay-court battle. Earlier, Carole Monnet had pulled off an unlikely comeback against Croatia's No. There was better fortune for Croatia in the second-longest match of Day 1, Jana Fett's 6-2, 4-6, 7-6[10] defeat of Priscilla Hon in 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One player who is clear of questions is Carlos Alcaraz, having won the Italian Open title to add to his Monte Carlo Masters from last month. This came after Alcaraz beat Sinner in the final, who has just played his first tournament since winning the Australian Open after three months out of action. Despite Sinner and Alcaraz both impressing in Rome, some of their rivals are not heading into the second major of the year in strong form. There have been some surprising results over the clay court season so far, with some top players not performing at their expected level. This is particularly relevant on clay courts, with Djokovic winless after opening losses in Monte Carlo and Madrid. Djokovic elected to skip the Italian Open after these disappointing results, but has now entered the Geneva Open in a bid to find some match wins ahead of Roland Garros. As he looks to find some confidence ahead of the major tournament that he probably has the best chance of winning, Zverev has gone against his word and received a late wildcard for the Hamburg Open. However, he has been unable to find much momentum at recent clay court tournaments, including the Monte Carlo Masters where he is a three-time champion. All four of his clay court defeats come against two players in Lorenzo Musetti and Arthur Fils, two players that he will for sure be hoping to avoid when the Roland Garros draw comes around. With Roland Garros likely to fuel some extra energy and particularly motivation for the likes of Djokovic, Zverev and Tsitsipas, it will be intriguing to see who can perform at the Parisian major. The Geneva Open will be a big indicator to see how Djokovic performs at Roland Garros, especially following the announcement of his split from coach Andy Murray. While it may be a great confidence booster for Djokovic and Zverev to get some clay court wins in ahead of Roland Garros, playing the week before a major tournament can also be detrimental. 🚨𝙒𝙄𝙇𝘿 𝘾𝘼𝙍𝘿𝐍𝐎𝐕𝐀𝐊 𝐃𝐉𝐎𝐊𝐎𝐕𝐈𝐂 🇷🇸Will play at the Gonet Geneva Open 2025 🤩🔥📷 @mutuamadridopen#gonetgenevaopen #atpgva #atp #novakdjokovic #djokovic #tennistv #atptour #geneva #geneve #suisse #switzerland #genevaevent #tennis #welovetennis #tennislove pic.twitter.com/3c8ZryCRtq Zverev most probably has the best chance to perform at Roland Garros this year, but his ranking dropping to world number three is certainly significant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One player who is clear of questions is Carlos Alcaraz, having won the Italian Open title to add to his Monte Carlo Masters from last month. This came after Alcaraz beat Sinner in the final, who has just played his first tournament since winning the Australian Open after three months out of action. Despite Sinner and Alcaraz both impressing in Rome, some of their rivals are not heading into the second major of the year in strong form. There have been some surprising results over the clay court season so far, with some top players not performing at their expected level. This is particularly relevant on clay courts, with Djokovic winless after opening losses in Monte Carlo and Madrid. Djokovic elected to skip the Italian Open after these disappointing results, but has now entered the Geneva Open in a bid to find some match wins ahead of Roland Garros. As he looks to find some confidence ahead of the major tournament that he probably has the best chance of winning, Zverev has gone against his word and received a late wildcard for the Hamburg Open. However, he has been unable to find much momentum at recent clay court tournaments, including the Monte Carlo Masters where he is a three-time champion. All four of his clay court defeats come against two players in Lorenzo Musetti and Arthur Fils, two players that he will for sure be hoping to avoid when the Roland Garros draw comes around. With Roland Garros likely to fuel some extra energy and particularly motivation for the likes of Djokovic, Zverev and Tsitsipas, it will be intriguing to see who can perform at the Parisian major. The Geneva Open will be a big indicator to see how Djokovic performs at Roland Garros, especially following the announcement of his split from coach Andy Murray. While it may be a great confidence booster for Djokovic and Zverev to get some clay court wins in ahead of Roland Garros, playing the week before a major tournament can also be detrimental. 🚨𝙒𝙄𝙇𝘿 𝘾𝘼𝙍𝘿𝐍𝐎𝐕𝐀𝐊 𝐃𝐉𝐎𝐊𝐎𝐕𝐈𝐂 🇷🇸Will play at the Gonet Geneva Open 2025 🤩🔥📷 @mutuamadridopen#gonetgenevaopen #atpgva #atp #novakdjokovic #djokovic #tennistv #atptour #geneva #geneve #suisse #switzerland #genevaevent #tennis #welovetennis #tennislove pic.twitter.com/3c8ZryCRtq Zverev most probably has the best chance to perform at Roland Garros this year, but his ranking dropping to world number three is certainly significant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Live Fantasy Analysis of the 2025 NFL Draft This week, fan behavior was a key topic at the Italian Open, preparations for the French Open escalated — in esports — and American college tennis changed things up regarding the U.S. Open. If you'd like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here. While Carlos Alcaraz danced through the second set of the Italian Open final against Jannik Sinner, he did so in near total quiet. During her quarterfinal defeat against Zheng Qinwen, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka told a fan to “shut the f— up” after they yelled out at her. 22 Clara Tauson confronted a crowd member who heckled her after she served a double fault against Mirra Andreeva, asking, “Who are you?” before imploring the chair umpire to intervene. 19, engaged in a similar confrontation during his match against Fábián Marozsán, while in her last-eight meeting with home favorite Jasmine Paolini, world No. 10 Diana Shnaider riled the baying Italian faithful after they cheered her getting broken. Not all tennis atmospheres are created equal, and partisan support can quickly devolve into unwarranted abuse, especially when the spectators delivering it are not in support of a particular player but of whatever outcome makes them money on sports betting. For Shnaider and Alcaraz, one met with roars and one with not even a smattering of applause, they can put things down to playing a home hope. While it's possible that Andreeva and Marozsán both have a secret coterie of Roman ultras, it's the kind of needling that Menšík and Tauson experienced that presents the sport with a problem. Elite players have documented how abuse during matches bleeds onto social media. Nearly every player will have a story of logging onto Instagram or X to floods of abusive messages after a defeat, not from their fans nor their opponent's followers but from people who simply decided that they might win them a bet and ended up not getting a pay-off. Fans not being ejected — or at least disciplined — when they engage in abuse on a match court only encourages them to continue, but umpires and security staff are rarely able to distinguish between partisan support, which the sport should embrace over silence, and the kind of directed heckling that needs discouraging. Tauson at least got a measure of revenge. Straight after that double fault, she smashed an ace down the T and gestured mockingly to the same fan behind her for some noise. Eight players, whittled down from more than 500,000 original applicants, will battle it out on a bespoke French Open version of the mobile game Tennis Clash for a €5,000 (£4,210; $5,636) prize pot, which is shared between the winner and the runner-up. The mere mention of esports is enough to make many tennis purists recoil in disgust, but it's something that all four of the sport's Grand Slams have adopted. This is the eighth edition of the Roland Garros event, while Wimbledon held its first esports competition in 2024. This year's French Open event will see the eight players competing as individuals, but split into two teams. A keen gamer, Simon actually competed in the event himself last year, and picked up a couple of victories. He always travelled with his PlayStation during his career, including for France's Davis Cup ties, and it was a mutual interest he shared with former U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who he coached until February and with whom he still games online. Simon, 40, is well aware of the scepticism towards esports from many tennis fans, but believes that events such as the Roland Garros eSeries can serve a valuable purpose. “If some of the guys that are playing Tennis Clash play good and are then coming to the stadium, or they want to finally pick up a racket and start to play, then it's a win,” he said in a recent video interview. He added that the Grand Slams should be looking to attract as diverse a crowd as possible, and that esports gives the tournaments an even more compelling package of events. In 2024, there were 200 spectators on site for the esports event, but there were over 200,000 more who watched via live-streaming platform Twitch. Tennis has also lagged behind other sports in using such outlets to broaden its fandom: elite soccer players and Formula One drivers are some of the most-viewed celebrities on Twitch, some of them becoming megastars in online gaming before breaking through in their respective sports. A good while before college sports in the United States officially changed its rules to allow student-athletes to earn gobs of cash, university-level tennis there had its own version of prize money. If those champions had turned professional after winning the collegiate championship, which many of them do, they got to keep the first-round payment, which last year reached $100,000. The NCAA decided that it was too much for players to participate in both its team and individual championships consecutively. It moved the individual championships to November. Also, who doesn't like a little more competition? Instead of going directly to the U.S. Open, Michael Zheng of Columbia University in New York City and DJ Bennett of Auburn University, Al., won automatic qualification into a four-person playoff. Zheng won the men's individual championship; Bennett qualifies as a losing finalist. It will be held between June 16 and 18, with a committee selecting the three other participants on both the men's and women's side. The runners-up get a wild card into qualifying. There will be men's and women's doubles playoffs as well. Now just win two more matches and you get into the U.S. Open. Sinner (1) 7-6(5), 6-1 to win the Italian Open (1,000) in Rome. It is the Spaniard's 19th ATP Tour title. Coco Gauff (4) 6-4, 6-2 to win the Italian Open (1,000) in Rome. Chloe Paquet 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 to win the Trophée Clarins (WTA 125) in Paris. It is Boulter's first WTA clay-court title. 📈 Alcaraz moves up one place from No. 📉 Iga Świątek falls three places from No. 📉 Alex Michelsen drops one place from No. 149 after losing his ranking points for reaching the 2024 Italian Open final. 📍Hamburg, Germany: Hamburg Open (500) featuring Alexander Zverev, Frances Tiafoe, Andrey Rublev, Francisco Cerundolo. 📍Geneva: Geneva Open (250) featuring Novak Djokovic, Taylor Fritz, Tomáš Macháč, Learner Tien. 📍Strasbourg, France: Internationaux de Strasbourg (500) featuring Elena Rybakina, Jessica Pegula, Emma Raducanu, Barbora Krejčíková.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has a strong chance of being seeded for Wimbledon in what would be a huge boost to her hopes at SW19. Raducanu has made an excellent comeback from two years of hell with injuries and form issues. Her performances at the upcoming Strasbourg International and then the French Open could put her in a good place ahead of Wimbledon, which takes place across June and July. 42 when the updated WTA leaderboard is released. You can check out at any time. The 22-year-old is now only 276 ranking points away from world No. Strasbourg offers 500 points to the winner, while a positive run at the French Open will also be an excellent opportunity to build points ahead of the grass-court season. She will also have British rival Katie Boulter in her sights, with the 28-year-old now only four places ahead. Boulter won a WTA 125 event in Paris yesterday. 1, Boulter responded: “I don't feel any pressure at all. I'm very comfortable in my seat, and I know that every single person has a different journey. It's something which I'm quite used to.” This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. He told Sky Sports: “Her game is moving in the right direction. I think she's around 42 in the live rankings. A number in the back of my mind is 32 pre-Wimbledon. Can she get to be seeded and have that protection in the early rounds on grass?" Injuries and inconsistency prompted her to tumble. She is now restoring her best form ahead of a busy summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are a number of factors which turn an exciting rivalry into an epic, enduring duel that transcends the sport. The tussle between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz - ranked one and two in the men's game - has all those components. Their rivalry resumed in the final of the Italian Open, marking a fitting end to the men's singles at a tournament where Sinner returned from a three-month ban for failing two doping tests. Spain's Alcaraz, benefiting from more matches in the tank, ruined the perfect homecoming for Italy's Sinner to record his seventh victory in their 11 meetings. But Alcaraz is the one dominating their head-to-head record. But there was none of that in a disciplined performance against Sinner. And it was another tantalising reminder of how the Alcaraz and Sinner rivalry - which the ATP Tour has long pinned its hopes on filling the Federer-Nadal-Djokovic void - could be a blockbuster for years to come. While it was never going to be a long-term arrangement, the timing of Andy Murray's stint coaching Novak Djokovic coming to an end before the French Open - and Wimbledon - surprised many. Italian fans have waited 40 years to celebrate a home singles victory in Rome. A jubilant Jasmine Paolini ended that run on Saturday. At the start of the clay-court swing we discussed how Iga Swiatek had a mountain of ranking points to defend - and it could not have gone much worse for the four-time French Open champion. Swiatek has slipped to fifth in the WTA rankings and will be seeded outside of the top four at Roland Garros. Clay is a surface where the 28-year-old still has very limited experience and has struggled to adapt her aggressive baseline game at the top level. Victory means Boulter has moved up to 38th in the rankings, putting a little more light between the British number one and her nearest rivals Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal. All-British pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski, along with Australian Open champion Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara, were beaten in their respective semi-finals. But those who feel they need a bit more match practice have options to play tournaments. For those not ranked higher enough to earn direct entry into the French Open, the qualifying events begin on Monday. British players Billy Harris and Dan Evans face each other in the first round, while Jan Choinski, Harriet Dart, Francesca Jones and Heather Watson - also aim to win three matches and make the main draw. Second Serve will take a break over the French Open before returning on Monday, 9 June. In the meantime, got any burning tennis questions you'd like us to answer?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'” said USTA CEO and Executive Director Lew Sherr, who was chief revenue officer from 2010-22. “Venue upgrades, from a fan experience standpoint, was one of the things that came out of that.” More than two years of plotting those upgrades followed. Through an extensive renovation of Ashe and the construction of a multistory player performance center next door, the fan experience and athlete accommodations will be transformed at the Flushing, N.Y., site. Last year, the event broke one million visitors across Fan Week and main draw play for the first time. “When Ashe was built, the thought process was, ‘Fans would watch tennis in Ashe, and then they would go out to the grounds to eat and shop and all of that,'” Sherr said. “The reality is, for many of our fans, there's an expectation that the Ashe experience will be similar to any other arena.” Ashe's mezzanine-level suites, meanwhile, will be rebuilt, and a second row of suites will be added above that. This will reduce the loge level's footprint by 3,500 seats (another measure executives say will lessen congestion) while adding suite and courtside inventory. The USTA will also add a few hundred upper promenade seats that were previously not sold. Architects: Rossetti, Daniel Libeskind (entrance redesign), Garrett Singer (new club/restaurant spaces) (Twelve points of sale, one retail location and 15 bathroom stalls will be added at the club level.) Thanks in large part to its New York market, the U.S. Open hosts some of American sports' most premium clientele and corporate sponsors. “We've had an excess amount of demand for the courtside area for the last decade that we can't satisfy,” said USTA Chief Commercial Officer Kirsten Corio, adding that the organization's revenue attributed to experiential hospitality has jumped by triple-digit percentage points over the past two years. 1 complaint of our loge and promenade subscribers being that they never have an opportunity to move down to the courtside, this [renovation] will open up more opportunity for both that demand and for the subscriber who is interested in upgrading to the lower bowl.” Pricing for the new inventory is being determined. Presently, some offerings include courtside seats at Ashe and luxury dining space at the campus' indoor tennis facility in the east plaza. “One of the ideas that [Zausner] came up with was, ‘Hey, we could use this idea of taking care of the players and premium at the same time. Pulling player facilities out of the [Ashe] base opens all this additional space that we need and we could use for premium. The USTA held focus groups with subscribers, hospitality clients and sponsors, beginning in 2020, to inform the strategy behind upgrading premium experiences. The USTA also last week announced the hire of Laura Lefton, former NFL vice president of club business development, as managing director of ticket sales and premium experience, a new role that reports to Corio and reflects the organization's enhanced focus on premium. “What we heard [was] a lot more corporate hospitality demand, a lot more experiential demand — meaning, they want to get closer to the players, they want opportunities for meet-and-greets, to host corporate events,” Corio said. “These new spaces are purpose-built to meet those needs and to surprise and delight in a way that we just can't today.” “The three dimensions that always come up in the athletes' feedback for us [are] larger fitness [areas], indoor/outdoor training opportunities and player-only areas,” said Stacey Allaster, USTA chief executive of professional tennis and U.S. Open tournament director, citing the organization's annual player survey. The fourth floor is slightly more public-facing — as it will also accommodate credentialed visitors — and include a dining hall, lounge spaces, outdoor terrace, coach locker rooms and media areas, such as the U.S. Open interview room and a broadcast studio. Among athletes, their support staffs and families, the USTA accommodates around 2,800 people in its player facilities each U.S. Open. This project is expected to be staggered in such a way that the two-level parking structure will be finished by the 2025 U.S. Open; new courtside seats and hospitality areas in Ashe will open in 2026 (although the suites and club spaces will be unfinished); and the full renovation will be completed by 2027. The previous project also was entirely self-funded. “So, we're in a position to capitalize on that.” Indeed, in 2024, operating revenue associated with the U.S. Open reached nearly $560 million, about a threefold jump from the 2020 edition held without fans, and comprising about 90% of the USTA‘s $624 million in overall revenue. “We are not tapping out or maxing out on our ability to fund the growth of this event,” Sherr said of the U.S. Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it was over and the ecstatic crowd at La Caja Magic jumped to its collective feet in applause, Aryna Sabalenka did not fall to the crushed red clay beneath her, didn't scream or pump her fists or even openly exult. She merely raised her arms in a perfect V -- for victory. And then, blowing kisses to the camera, strolled to her changeover chair, fished a camera out of her bag, crossed the court and snapped a picture of her team. After that thoroughly professional 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory over Coco Gauff on Saturday, Sabalenka is now a three-time Mutua Madrid Open champion. Winning is never guaranteed, but in Sabalenka's mind, this was expected. Her will manifested itself in the moments that mattered. 1 will become only the third woman to amass more than 11,000 ranking points and is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. Sabalenka is more than 1,600 points clear of No. She's the only player with three titles so far -- Brisbane, Miami and Madrid -- and has collected back-to-back WTA 1000 titles on vastly different surfaces. Her 31 match-wins are also the most among Hologic WTA Tour players. This was Gauff's 10th match against Sabalenka in six years. “I feel like she just got a lot better in everything,” Gauff said. “I think she just probably is more confident, so that's why the consistent results are happening.” Back in January, Sabalenka was going for her third consecutive Australian Open but Keys was simply too good in the final. For Sabalenka, who started the year 11-0, it was a devastating loss. Sabalenka's won 19 of her past 21 and even with the slow surfaces in Rome and Paris looming, she's going to like her chances. A few hours after the win in Madrid, Sabalenka fielded some questions from wtatennis.com: Looking back, how did losing that Australian Open final motivate you to produce the best start of your career heading into Rome? Sabalenka: Yeah, honestly, that final was the toughest one. I really struggled to accept that match, tough loss. Then I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder. Your last two matches, four of six sets went to seven games -- you won them all … how proud are you of the fact you competed so well in the most important moments? Super happy with the level I played this week and hopefully I can keep going the way everything is going. Your defense doesn't get a lot of attention, but … against Coco how important was it to stay in some of those long points? Sabalenka: It's very important to not only be an attacking player, but in those key moments to be a good defender and dig really deep in there, try to steal a few points. It definitely brings more confidence in your game. Only four women in 40 years won their first six matches against Top 10 players in straight sets – their names are Martina Navratilova (1986), Steffi Graf (1994, 1995 and 1996), Serena Williams (2014) -- and Aryna Sabalenka … what do you think of that? They achieved so much, these players I look up to. Me, being in the same line with them … it just sounds crazy and I couldn't be more proud. Sabalenka: I definitely feel really good about my game. And now, still, I want to get better. Three Madrid titles … the way you're playing, in your mind, can you win in Rome or Paris for the first time?</p>
