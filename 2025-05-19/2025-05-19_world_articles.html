                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police make chance find of sculpture that adorned Doors singer's Paris grave until its 1988 disappearance Police in France said they had been carrying out a search related to a fraud case when they happened to stumble upon the bust of the frontman of the Doors. The announcement, made on social media on Monday, was accompanied by a photo showing the graying sculpture still covered in graffiti and missing a chunk of its nose, reportedly sliced off by souvenir hunters before its disappearance. Conceived as a tribute to Morrison, the sculpture was carved after his death by the Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin. While the exact circumstances of Morrison's death remain shrouded in mystery, most early accounts say the singer died of cardiac arrest in his bathtub. From its perch on top of Morrison's headstone, the statue welcomed the throngs of visitors who came to snap photos, lay flowers and – before the hiring of a guard to watch the site – smoke pot and party with one of Père-Lachaise's most famous residents. In 1994, after years had gone by without any sign of the sculpture, two Americans were arrested for attempting to erect their own bronze version of the bust at Morrison's grave site. Todd Mitchell, who said he had travelled from Utah and spent thousands of dollars of his own retirement fund to resurrect the bust, said the security guard was initially confused when he came across him and his nephew scrambling to bolt the bust to Morrison's headstone in the dark. “He just looked dumbfounded … Most people are destroying stuff in that cemetery,” Mitchell told the Salt Lake Tribune in 1994. On Monday, as fans of Morrison celebrated what police described on social media as an “unusual discovery”, there was little news on whether the bust would be returned to the singer's tomb.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smotrich vowed that the level of destruction in Gaza will be unprecedented globally. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised a top Israeli minister after he vowed that Israel will carry out the “conquering” and “cleansing” of the Gaza Strip, as the military escalates its genocide in order to implement its permanent occupation plan. In a statement on Monday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that Israel's goal is “destroying everything that's left of the Gaza Strip,” with the military working to completely level already destroyed infrastructure. “We are conquering, cleansing, and remaining in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed,” Smotrich went on, per a translation by Israeli outlet Haaretz. This is effectively an admission that Israeli officials intend to carry out ethnic cleansing. The statements were made in response to criticism from some Israelis over the government's announcement on Sunday that it will allow “minimal” humanitarian aid into Gaza after nearly three months of Israel's total aid blockade. Further, the Israeli military has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the last few days alone in its escalated campaign and ground assault. Netanyahu reassured far right coalition partners that the small trickle of aid was a tactic to quiet criticisms from foreign allies and pave the way for Israel's total forced displacement plan, known as “Gideon's Chariots.” “Our best friends in the world — senators I know as strong supporters of Israel — have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge,” he said. “We must avoid famine, both for practical reasons and diplomatic ones. Without international backing, we won't be able to complete the mission of victory.” “We are disassembling Gaza, and leaving it as piles of rubble, with total destruction [which has] no precedent globally.” Earlier this month, following Israeli officials' approval of Gideon's Chariots, Smotrich had said that Israel must “stop being afraid of the word ‘occupation,'” vowing to escalate Israeli acts that have already been deemed illegal. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• High-stakes call: ﻿President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for nearly two hours this morning, according to a US official, a day after top administration officials met with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in Rome. Putin said the call with Trump was “frank and substantive,” according to Russian state media. Trump also held a call with Zelensky today, the Ukrainian presidency said. • SCOTUS ruling: The Supreme Court today allowed the Trump administration to move toward ending temporary deportation protections for potentially hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. This comes just days after SCOTUS blocked Trump from moving forward with deportations under a sweeping wartime authority, siding with Venezuelans who feared they were poised for imminent removal. • Trump's agenda: ﻿House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as House Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members before an expected floor vote later this week. Issues related to Medicaid are among the biggest sticking points. US President Donald Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin has concluded, according to a US official and Russian state media TASS. The call lasted nearly two hours, according to a US official. The official said Trump will provide a readout shortly. Putin said the conversation with Trump was “frank and substantive,” according to TASS. This post has been updated with more of Putin's remarks on the call. USIP is not a federal agency within the executive branch. What happened: In March, the Trump administration fired most of USIP's board and acting President George Moose. The three remaining board members — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin — said they were installing Kenneth Jackson as acting USIP president. Days later, DOGE personnel, accompanied by Washington, DC, police, gained access to the headquarters after having been turned away during an earlier attempt. Some USIP officials remained in the building after DOGE's arrival, including Moose, a retired career diplomat. He was later forced to exit the building by DC police. Howell wrote that Trump and his subordinates “used brute force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP's headquarters, despite being cautioned that this organization did not fall within the Executive branch and its leadership was not subject to the President's unilateral Executive branch removal power.” The Supreme Court today allowed President Donald Trump's administration to move toward ending temporary deportation protections for potentially hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. At issue is a move earlier this year by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to end a form of humanitarian relief known as temporary protected status for Venezuelan migrants. Seven Venezuelan nationals who are covered by Temporary Protective Status, or TPS, and a group that represents others challenged the move, arguing in part that Noem's decision was motivated by racial and political hostility. House Republican leaders are negotiating over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote on the GOP's massive tax and spending cuts package later this week. Among several sticking points is the timeframe over when new Medicaid work requirements would kick in and whether to change the federal-state cost sharing program for Medicaid. Nearly 80 million children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, parents and adults without dependents rely on Medicaid and the related Children's Health Insurance Program. It's uncertain, however, whether Republican lawmakers' Medicaid revamp will achieve their topline goal for the cuts needed to help finance President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts agenda. More than 60 House Republicans represent districts with higher-than-average Medicaid enrollment, according to a CNN analysis of Medicaid enrollment data and 2024 election results. While most Republican districts aren't heavily reliant on the program, Speaker Mike Johnson's historically tight margin in the House means that he can only afford a handful of Republican “no” votes to pass any changes to Medicaid without Democrats' help. Read more about districts throughout the country that depend on Medicaid. More on the call: Earlier today, Vice President JD Vance said he believes Trump will ask Putin whether he is “serious” about peace with Ukraine during the phone call. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today that Trump has “grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,” adding that his goal “is to see a ceasefire and to see this conflict come to an end.” House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over President Donald Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as House Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote later this week. Among the major issues that are still unresolved: The timeframe over when new Medicaid work requirements would kick in, whether to change the federal-state cost sharing program for Medicaid, when green energy tax credits would be phased out and how much Americans can deduct from the state and local taxes they pay. House GOP leadership aides said on Monday morning that key decisions have not been finalized even though Johnson wants the bill passed out of his chamber by Thursday. But aides contended that “95%” of the bill had been agreed to among House Republicans. More on the bill: The bill calls for first-time work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries to be implemented by 2029, but GOP hardliners are demanding that timeframe be moved up — something that is causing angst among more moderate members. Johnson is expected to continue talks on Monday with his members. “The talks have been proceeding for a little while. Are you real about this?” Vance said to reporters aboard Air Force Two. “There are a lot of economic benefits to thawing relations between Russia and the rest of the world, but you're not going to get those benefits if you keep on killing a lot of innocent people.” While Vance said “it's hard to pinpoint one” obstacle to reaching a ceasefire, he reiterated how “one open question” is whether Putin is serious about negotiating peace. “I'm not sure that Vladimir Putin has a strategy himself for how to unwind the war, of course, that's been going on for a few years now,” Vance added, saying he thought “the president would agree” with that. Vance also said that the US is still “more than open to walking away.” While Putin didn't show up for direct talks that he proposed last week, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Turkey on Friday and agreed to a large-scale prisoner swap. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who agreed to meet with Putin directly, criticized him for sending a “low-level” delegation and said the Russian leader was “afraid.” ET call, Vance said, “I was just on the phone with him. During a briefing with reporters on Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump has “grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,” adding that his goal “is to see a ceasefire and to see this conflict come to an end.” Pressed on whether the president still wants to meet with Putin, as he told reporters last week in the Middle East, Leavitt said it will depend on today's call. Vice President JD Vance said he thought about visiting Israel after his trip to Rome, but cited logistical and security reasons as the obstacle, rather than Israel's expanding military operation in Gaza. But the simple reason is: We thought about going to Israel. We also thought about going to a couple of other countries that the president would like me to visit here in the next few months,” Vance said in a gaggle aboard Air Force Two. “Logistically, it was just a little bit too hard on basic things like, who the hell is going to take care of our kids if we take another couple of days overseas?” Axios had reported that Vance considered traveling to Israel on Tuesday but decided against it due to the expansion of Israel's military operation in Gaza, citing a senior US official. “But on some more serious things like, how do we provide security? So, I'm sure we'll visit Israel sometime in the future, but not today,” Vance said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today that the controversial Qatari plane that President Donald Trump said he plans to accept is “the Air Force's project” and that Trump “has nothing to do with it.” “Let's be very clear, the government of Qatar, the Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,” Leavitt said. CNN has reported that the Department of Defense plans to accept the luxury Boeing 747-8 jet, which would be retrofitted for the president's use with security features and modifications before being donated to Trump's presidential library after he leaves office. Trump has denied that he would use the plane after his term concludes. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about the plane. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Tuesday that the plane “poses significant espionage and surveillance problems.” And Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said accepting it would pose “immense counterintelligence risks by granting a foreign nation potential access to sensitive systems and communications.” President Donald Trump's spokesperson voiced confidence Monday in the White House Medical Unit and professionals at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center amid questions about whether physicians there missed signs of former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer. “The White House physician we have here is phenomenal, and the team of physicians that take care of the president, particularly at Walter Reed Medical Center, are great,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a White House briefing. Dr. Sean Barbabella, the current physician to the president, provided a readout of Trump's medical exam earlier this year showing he was fit to serve in office. She said to the best of her understanding, Trump was screened for prostate cancer during his physical exam. Biden's office revealed Sunday the former president had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. Some MAGA-world allies, including Donald Trump Jr., have suggested without evidence that Biden's team tried to cover up the medical issue. President Donald Trump has invited Pope Leo XIV to the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing on Monday. The White House declined to weigh in on comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday that Israel will take “control of the entire Gaza Strip,” during a briefing with reporters Monday. “I'll have to talk to the president about those comments as they just came, I believe, from the prime minister this morning, and I'll let him speak on that,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. Earlier Monday, Netanyahu said that Israel plans to take control of all of Gaza, less than 24 hours after the country's military launched an extensive ground operation in the territory, in addition to an air campaign that intensified last week. More than 300 people have been killed and over 1,000 others have been injured after Israel ramped up intense airstrikes since Thursday, according to a CNN count of this week's Palestinian Ministry of Health data. CNN's Dana Karni and Kara Fox contributed reporting to this post. The sweeping bill aimed to advance President Donald Trump's legislative agenda will not add to the deficit, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed today – despite multiple nonpartisan reports that say otherwise. The primary issue with getting aid into Gaza is logistical — not political — and the Trump administration does not want to see a humanitarian crisis unfold there, US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told ABC News' “This Week” on Sunday. Describing President Donald Trump as a “humanitarian,” Witkoff said that “everyone is concerned about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza,” adding that “logistically … I don't think there's any daylight between President Trump's position and (Israeli) Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu's position.” “I think the issue now is, how do we logistically get all of those trucks into Gaza? Adding that the logistics of aid are “complicated,” Witkoff said: “We do not want to see a humanitarian crisis, and we will not allow it to occur on President Trump's watch.” Witkoff's comments came hours before Israel announced Sunday that they would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza, which would end an 11-week blockade of all aid into the territory, which has been criticized by many in the international community. President Donald Trump said he's going to call for a “major investigation” into the celebrity endorsements of former Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing his 2024 rival of paying Bruce Springsteen, Oprah Winfrey and Bono for their support and showing up at rallies. There is no evidence that Harris paid for celebrity support, nor did Trump provide any. Continuing to obsess over crowd size, Trump claimed “this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds.” This comes as Springsteen is on tour, calling the president “unfit” for office and urging his fans to stand against authoritarianism. Trump bashed Springsteen last week in response, telling him he “ought to keep his mouth shut” and calling him a “pushy, obnoxious JERK.” Nuclear discussions between the United States and Iran will fail if Washington demands that Tehran abandon domestic enrichment of uranium, a nuclear fuel that can be used for a bomb if enriched to high levels, an Iranian official said. “Regarding zero enrichment, we said from the beginning that if this is their (American) position, it is natural that the work will not actually get anywhere,” Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht Ravanchi was cited as saying by Iran's Nour News on Monday. We will not back down on the issue of enrichment.” Iran and the US have had four rounds of talks to reach a nuclear deal that could see crippling US sanctions lifted in exchange for Tehran putting curbs on its nuclear program. “Enrichment enables weaponization, and we will not allow a bomb to get here. Witkoff had previously suggested that Iran could be allowed some uranium enrichment. On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said that the issue “is not negotiable under any circumstances,” criticizing American negotiators for reversing their positions after each round of negotiations, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency. United States Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Pope Leo at the Vatican on Monday. Vance arrived at the Vatican at 7:56 a.m. local time for a meeting with Pope Leo, according to a spokesperson for Vance's office, who said Rubio was also in attendance. On May 19, Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican. President Donald Trump has expressed frustration in recent days over the state of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine — a goal he often said on the campaign trail he would achieve within a day of taking office. Putin originally pitched the meetings as a face-to-face with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which he initially accepted. But neither leader ultimately attended, and Zelensky criticized his Russian counterpart for not sending a higher-level delegation. The meetings yielded a prisoner swap and further talks about the two presidents meeting, but little appeared to substantively change on each country's ceasefire terms. Zelensky meeting in Rome: Zelensky said he had a “good meeting” yesterday in Italy with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who traveled to Rome for the inaugural mass of Pope Leo XIV. The secretary of state indicated Trump speaking directly with Putin should get talks moving, and warned Russia against delivering unrealistic ceasefire proposal terms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For one, there is no sign of a decline in global carbon dioxide emissions and the Earth is getting hotter faster than ever before, despite constant pledges of government action. And now, of course, the second Trump administration is implementing policies that represent the biggest attack on nature, climate and people ever. Yet, as world-renowned progressive political economist Robert Pollin shows in this exclusive interview with Truthout, there are also hopeful signs on the climate front. In this context, he advances a concrete green transition program for phasing out fracking operations in the state of Pennsylvania and proposes alternative measures of support for working people and the poor to meet their energy needs. He is the author of scores of books and academic articles, and was selected by Foreign Policy magazine as one of the “100 Leading Global Thinkers for 2013.” The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Polychroniou: Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased by nearly 70 percent since 1990 and hit a record high of 37 billion tons in 2023. Robert Pollin: The goals of reducing global CO2 emissions by 45 percent relative to the 2010 level of about 33 billion tons and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 was first advanced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in a 2018 report called “Global Warming of 1.50C.” The IPCC is a UN agency focused on advancing credible research on all aspects of climate change, including, in particular, what we need to accomplish to stop the ever-deepening calamities resulting from rising average global temperatures, such as what we saw only a few months ago with the devastating fires that devoured major sections of Los Angeles. '” As just one follow-up in March, Lee Zeldin, Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator, pronounced that, “Yesterday was the most consequential day of deregulation in American history. And yet, even in the face of these assaults from Trump and company, we can still point to some positive developments on which we build. First, while it is true that global CO2 emissions have not fallen since 2018, they also have risen only slightly since 2013, from 35 to 37 billion tons. So there is some evidence emerging — absolutely too slowly to be sure, but emerging nonetheless — of global CO2 emissions decoupling from overall economic activity. Second, the average costs of generating electricity from solar and wind power have plummeted since 2010, making them the low-cost alternatives, without subsidies, relative to fossil fuel energy. Thus, on average, generating electricity from onshore wind sites was 23 percent more expensive than fossil fuel alternatives in 2010, but was 67 percent cheaper in 2023. Electricity from solar panels was, on average, 414 percent more expensive than fossil fuel alternatives in 2010, but was 56 percent cheaper in 2023. This was about equal to 2 percent of 2024 global GDP. According to my own estimates, and those of other researchers, we need to reach an annual clean energy investment level of about 2.5 percent of GDP per year, every year, to achieve a zero-emissions global economy by 2050. So, at least as of this past year, we have started to approach that necessary investment scale. One of the most important components of this overall renewable investment expansion is that small-scale solar electricity installations — i.e., mini-grids — are growing rapidly in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, even in West Virginia, a state that is very poor, still dependent on its fossil fuel industry, and deep red in its politics (Trump won West Virginia in 2024 with 70 percent of the vote), $5.3 billion had been committed by the time Biden left office to build a low-emissions steel mill; a battery storage equipment manufacturing facility; a renewable energy microgrid industrial site; a hybrid vehicle transaxle manufacturing plant; and multiple solar farms. Even Kamala Harris opposed a fracking ban during her 2024 presidential campaign, after having supported a ban during her brief initial presidential run in 2019. Fracking is a technology used to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations, such as sandstone, limestone, or shale rock deposits. This technology is employed as a means of increasing the rate at which oil and gas can be extracted profitably from such rock formations. This is why five U.S. states have banned fracking (California, New York, Washington, Maryland and Vermont). But within the U.S., fracking operations continue in up to 30 other states, and are most extensive in Texas, Pennsylvania and North Dakota. In fact, the Pennsylvania economy would experience a major hit if fracking were banned and no large-scale alternative economic activities were introduced to substitute for the jobs and incomes that would be lost through shutting down fracking. But a fracking ban should not be understood as an isolated, one-off policy measure. It should rather be recognized as one component of a much larger green transition program, in Pennsylvania and everywhere else. My own research with co-authors on this specific question of comparing the economic impacts of continuing with fracking versus advancing a green transition project in Pennsylvania produced the following major results: Governments across the world continue to subsidize the production and consumption of fossil fuels, as you and co-authors show in a new extensive study. How large are global fossil fuel subsidies, and how should we understand the political economy of fossil fuel subsidies, given that there are obvious benefits in removing them? This is because they create perverse incentives, making it cheaper for consumers to continue purchasing oil, coal and natural gas to meet their energy needs and for producers to continue profiting off of selling the stuff. At the same time, fossil fuel subsidies represent a huge financial resource that could be mobilized to help pay for the transition to a global clean energy-dominant infrastructure. As of the most recent 2023 figures, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $1.1 trillion, equal to about 1 percent of global GDP. To put this figure in perspective, as noted above, I estimate that we need approximately 2.5 percent of global GDP per year devoted to clean energy investments to build a 100 percent clean energy, zero-emissions global economy by 2050. So, if we could transfer this 1 percent of global GDP out of subsidizing fossil fuels and into building a clean energy economy, those funds alone would cover roughly 40 percent of the entire funding level that is needed. And yet, unfortunately, matters aren't quite so straightforward. In fact, it would be both undesirable and unrealistic to move all $1.1 trillion out of fossil fuel subsidies and into clean energy investments. This is because, in many countries, fossil fuel subsides provide critical support to low-income and working-class people, by reducing the costs these people must pay to meet their energy needs. Such alternative forms of support could include food, housing or cash subsidies. These alternative subsidies would have to be generous enough and maintained over time, so that, at a minimum, the overall living standards of working people and the poor would be defended when the fossil fuel subsidies are eliminated. In fact, in terms of providing the necessary money to support generous alternative subsidy measures, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies can release formidable levels of funds to both deliver generous alternative subsidies for working people and the poor, and to still provide large-scale funding for clean energy investments. This is because, by far, the largest beneficiaries of fossil fuel subsidies are high-income households and the fossil fuel corporations themselves — two groups who don't need or deserve such subsidy support but are nevertheless happy to pocket the money if governments continue to hand it to them. I can illustrate this point by considering the case of Indonesia, which is one of the case studies we review in our study. As of the most recent 2023 data, total fossil fuel subsidies in Indonesia — including the funds received by both consumers and fossil fuel corporations — amounted to about $35 billion. This was equal to about 2.5 percent of Indonesia's 2023 GDP. This massive disparity resulted because rich households spend much more money buying oil, coal, or natural gas than poor households, but all households — rich, poor, and those in between — are able to purchase all of their fossil fuel energy at reduced costs due to the country's subsidy program. What if, as an alternative, all Indonesian households, at all income levels, received a cash, food or housing subsidy equal to what had been the fossil fuel subsidy amount received by the country's middle-income households? In that scenario, all Indonesian households would have received about $380. At the same time, under this alternative subsidy plan, Indonesia would still have freed up about $8 billion in funds that could then be channeled into building the country's clean energy infrastructure. This level of clean energy investments would amount to about a 500 percent increase over Indonesia's clean energy investment spending level for 2023. That is: 1) phasing out fossil fuel subsidies is an absolute imperative that must be accomplished as one centerpiece of a global climate stabilization program; and 2) for the fossil fuel phase-out to be accomplished according to any reasonable standard of social and economic justice, the overall project must include robust measures to defend and improve the living standards of working people and the poor.

The body of Sánchez was scheduled to be transferred on Monday to the naval academy in her home state of Veracruz. She was in her final year as a navy cadet and was part of the international training cruise scheduled to visit 15 countries. Sánchez's mother, Rocío Hernández, said her daughter was “exemplary” and “a dedicated student” who dreamed of becoming a naval engineer. “She was a warrior, a soldier who didn't give up, who always fought for her goals,” Hernández said of her daughter, according to the BBC. She said that Mexico's navy would hold a private ceremony for her at the naval academy before she brings her home. Meanwhile, friends and relatives of Maldonado have reportedly been paying their respects in San Mateo del Mar, a coastal town in the state of Oaxaca. According to New York police, the Cuauhtémoc – which had 277 people on board – lost power as it was departing New York Harbor for Iceland and was dragged toward the Brooklyn Bridge by the current. The ship left Acapulco, Mexico, on 6 April and was scheduled to stop in Aberdeen, Scotland, in July amid a global goodwill tour. The National Transportation Safety Board was scheduled to hold a news conference to provide updates on the investigation on Monday afternoon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In October of last year, just days before the U.S. presidential election, Head of the McCain Institute Evelyn Farkas told the Kyiv Independent that a Donald Trump victory would be the "worst-case scenario" for Ukraine. In the months since, a victorious Trump has taken office, dismantled the global post-World War II security architecture, blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting Russia's full-scale invasion, and left Ukraine in limbo, all without securing a peace deal. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Farkas at the Kyiv Security Forum on May 8 to ask her if that worst-case scenario had come true, or if there was still some hope left for Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: When we last spoke, you said a Trump election victory was the "worst-case scenario" for Ukraine — are we now in it? Evelyn Farkas: I imagined an administration that turned its back on Ukraine. It remains to be seen ultimately what position the United States takes. Our government has not clearly delineated — aside from saying that we want to make peace — what our position is on the definition of peace. But it does, of course, make people nervous about what the ultimate objective is because it hasn't been clarified. If the ultimate objective is not to support Ukraine, then that is the worst-case scenario because it means that Russia will not be stopped. Russia will then turn its aggressive attention to other neighboring states — first the ones that used to be part of the Soviet empire, and then it will threaten Europe, and ultimately the United States. The Kyiv Independent: Have you noticed a shift in rhetoric from the White House in recent weeks towards Russia? Vladimir Putin doesn't want an end to the war because it will likely mean the end of his political existence, if not his actual existence. And maybe there's a dawning realization that in this world that Vladimir Putin is not stronger after Prigozhin marched on Moscow, and he's weaker economically, politically, militarily, and heavily dependent on China. In this world, Vladimir Putin doesn't want an end to the war because it will likely mean the end of his political existence, if not his actual existence, because there will be a lot of angry veterans running around Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Kyiv Independent: Why do you think it has taken the White House so long to realize this? Evelyn Farkas: Probably because there are competing interests. There are those who really want to bring the war to an end and do it in a way that's sustainable, that looks like a victory for the president, not a defeat. Because there are some versions of a peace agreement that would look like a defeat for President Trump and for the United States. And then there are others who are interested in making deals with the Russian elites, Putin and his oligarchs. And so initially, at least, I think the impatience and the overwhelming desire to make business deals were impacting their diplomacy more in the beginning. And now it seems that the reality is becoming understood — you can't just go and make business deals. The Kyiv Independent: How much has this peace process been driven by people's personal interests rather than America's interests? The Kyiv Independent: What do you think of U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff's performance? Evelyn Farkas: I think he was a peculiar choice because he's not a seasoned diplomat, and I don't really know whether he's a seasoned business deal broker either. Of course, he was repeating things the Kremlin told him, and we know that the Kremlin sells a bunch of propaganda and lies. The Kyiv Independent: Here in Ukraine, at some moments during Trump's term, it has seemed like the U.S. might not only abandon Ukraine, but outright betray it by giving Russia everything that it wants — was that felt by Ukraine supporters in the U.S.? Evelyn Farkas: I think for pro-Ukraine people in the United States, there was a lot of concern around statements like 'Ukraine can't ever become part of NATO', that 'Crimea was always Russian.' And frankly, they are a betrayal of our interests, because our interest is in stopping Putin's neo-imperial aggression, and getting a just, lasting peace for Ukraine. And that is not articulated clearly from the White House." So, yes, we were alarmed by those statements because they seemed to indicate that that was the private negotiating position of the administration. Again, not a lot has been made public. And that's also disturbing because you can't have a deterrence of Putin, and that is to say, a lasting peace for Ukraine, without the United States military to back it up. The Kyiv Independent: Do you think Trump and Zelensky's relationship is OK now, or could we see it revert to a time similar to the infamous Oval Office showdown? Evelyn Farkas: You can't rule it out. I think a lot of it is tactics, although, of course, Trump (does) seem to have this preference for Russia over Ukraine that goes all the way back to the 80s when he visited Moscow. The Kyiv Independent: What can Democrats do, if anything, right now to help Ukraine? I wish sometimes they would be more honest about things that we did wrong, things that we might have done better, in order to actually give the Republicans an incentive to do more right now in Ukraine. And the last thing that they can do is continue to speak to their constituents. And then listen to their constituents, because there are a lot of constituents who care and who want America to do the right thing when it comes to Ukraine and other places in the world. The polls show that there's still a majority of Americans in favor of supporting Ukraine. But in the White House, it's unclear. That is not articulated clearly from the White House. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Defense has directed commanders to identify service members with a history of gender dysphoria who have not come forward under a new policy preventing people who identify as transgender from serving in the military. At least some of the troops with gender dysphoria, characterized by the belief that one's gender identity does not match one's biological sex, are undergoing or have completed transgender procedures in an attempt to align their sex with their gender identity. Active-duty troops have until June 6 to identify themselves as being unable to serve because of gender dysphoria. “Commanders who are aware of service members in their units who meet the criteria of this policy will direct individualized medical record reviews,” the official said. “Any individuals who meet the criteria of the policy and do not voluntarily identify themselves and go through the voluntary separation process will be processed involuntarily unless they are granted a waiver.” Troops who are involuntarily separated may lose certain benefits that they would receive if they come forward, according to the Department of Defense. The military uses its readiness program to make sure troops are qualified and fit for duty. Medical evaluations are conducted through the program periodically, including an annual health screening. “Any negative action that they would take to one of their assigned service members that would be retaliatory would be completely unacceptable regardless of whether it concerned this policy or any other policy,” the official added later. Troops who are discharged under the new policy are eligible for up to $125,000 in separation payments, depending on their rank and how long they've been serving.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lester Pearson and Mr. Carney share much in common, starting with the vital importance of Canada-U.S. relations.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press John Ibbitson is a media fellow at the Fraser Institute and a senior fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Polic Prime Minister Mark Carney is just the latest example. Mackenzie King was deputy labour minister and then minister of labour, before leading the Liberal Party from opposition (where it had been for a decade) to forming government in 1921. “Hence, it naturally turns when in trouble to those who know something about governing.” Pearson and Mr. Carney share much in common, starting with the vital importance of Canada-U.S. relations. But Pearson discovered that the relationship with a president can swiftly change. Johnson was furious when the prime minister proposed in a 1965 speech that the Americans consider pausing their bombing campaign in Vietnam. “You pissed on my rug,” he reportedly yelled at Pearson when the two were at Camp David, grabbing him by the lapels. President Donald Trump appears determined to relocate the Canadian and Mexican automotive sectors to the United States, while also proposing that Canada become an American state. During a meeting at the White House earlier this month, relations seemed cordial, but Mr. Carney apparently made no progress in changing Mr. Trump's mind. Tariffs and counter-tariffs are now part of the relationship. Both Pearson and Mr. Carney achieved international fame before becoming Liberal leader. As opposition leader, Pearson opposed acquiring nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft missiles from the United States, until it became clear that he could get elected by reversing that position, and so he did. Mr. Carney is devoted to the cause of fighting global warming. Yet his first act as Prime Minister was to cancel the unpopular consumer carbon tax. Pearson grappled with a restless Quebec that was questioning what place, if any, it should have in Canada. Mr. Carney confronts deep levels of alienation among many people in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Pearson was opposed by a Western Conservative populist, John Diefenbaker. Mr. Carney is opposed by a Western Conservative populist, Pierre Poilievre. Mr. Carney was described in The Guardian in March as being charming and confident, but also possessing a “volcanic temper.” He appears quite sure – even full – of himself. Pearson knew little about economics and cared even less, entrusting the nation's finances to his friend Walter Gordon. As finance minister, Gordon presided over a botched attempt at greater economic independence from the United States. Mr. Carney, with his PhD in economics from Oxford (a university Pearson attended as well), is seeking to preserve the integrated Canada-U.S. economy that Gordon tried to weaken. Pearson is regarded as one of Canada's most successful prime ministers, establishing public health care and pensions, while giving Canada the Maple Leaf flag. He should think himself grateful were he one day to be compared favourably with that other public servant who became prime minister.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's war against Ukraine is waged not only with missiles and tanks, but with distorted myths — powerful narratives that romanticize empire, rewrite history, and embolden Russian soldiers to reduce once prosperous cities to rubble. Those very same myths surfaced at the Photo London Festival from May 15 to 18, where the inclusion of Russian photographer and fashion designer Gosha Rubchinskiy's new book "Victory Day" sparked fierce backlash. "The book is a non-partisan representation of post-Soviet military on Red Square," Rubchinskiy declared on May 14 in an Instagram post, adding that the photos "serve as a deeply personal representation of the individual outside of ideology and propaganda." Though Rubchinskiy has long insisted that his work transcends politics, critics argue the photographer has been promoting pro-Russian propaganda through art and, in the case of "Victory Day," aestheticizing a war founded on violent falsehoods. "His work extensively uses Soviet and Russian nationalistic symbols, which is problematic because they are currently used to justify war crimes, torture, and the killing of civilian Ukrainians," Emine Ziyatdinova, a Ukrainian photographer of Crimean Tatar descent, told the Kyiv Independent. The black and white portraiture and "architectural studies" of Rubchinskiy's "Victory Day" were taken from 2018-2019, already half a decade into Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine. "For the last three years of the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, multiple Ukrainian cultural figures, curators, politicians, historians, scholars, and artists have tried to show Western cultural institutions that Russian culture is political and aligned with Russian imperialistic ideas." In particular, Red Square is the location for Russia's largest Victory Day military parade, where during this year's commemoration, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Soviet soldiers "of different ethnic backgrounds… will forever remain Russian soldiers in world history." Positioning the Allied Victory against the Nazis during World War II alongside the claim that it is somehow a book dedicated to "over 20 years of Russian youth culture," Rubchinskiy also appears to imply that this Soviet imagery can be claimed by Russians alone, and not the millions of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs and other nationalities that fought and died serving in the Soviet army. "Victory Day" was presented at the Photo London Festival by the exhibitor A/political, which says on its website that it prides itself on "producing radical knowledge through cultural terror." "For the last three years of the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, multiple Ukrainian cultural figures, curators, politicians, historians, scholars, and artists have tried to show Western cultural institutions that Russian culture is political and aligned with Russian imperialistic ideas. After three years of continuous horrors perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine, one would think these issues should be self-evident — but unfortunately, they are not." Although "Victory Day" has yet to be widely released, an image displayed on Photo London's website depicts a young military conscript wearing the historic St. George Ribbon. The Soviet army played an important role in defeating Nazi Germany, but during that time it was also responsible for a number of massacres, as well as deportations and forced relocations — atrocities that the Soviet government systematically attempted to cover up. Under Putin, Russia has distorted the history of World War II even further by using the accomplishments of the Soviet army as a means to "justify" Russia's war against Ukraine, who they depict as Nazis. His 2014 book "Crimea/Kids" is a romanticized portrayal of youth in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. "All these kids were born in a new country, and because of the internet, they feel the same as other young people in London, China, or Japan. That's why it's interesting for me to see how these young kids born in an informational context manage to keep this kind of Russian spirit, this Russian view on things," he told German media outlet 032c in January 2014. Speaking to British magazine Dazed in September 2014, already several months after the illegal annexation, he called Crimea's youth movement "a new Russia." Despite repeatedly claiming to be above politics, Rubchinskiy has occasionally let slip his belief that Russia suffers from biased media portrayal. "The World Cup is a unique reason to come to Russia and see what's going on here by your own eyes," he said. "Sometimes you should check for yourself and decide your own feelings about things rather than believe other people's opinion from the media." Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine also became a launchpad for Rubchinskiy's fashion collection Duval, which he tweeted about on Feb. 25, 2022 — just one day after the war began. At this point — four years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and the unlawful annexation of Crimea — Ukrainian political prisoners, including filmmaker and writer Oleh Sentsov, were already suffering harsh conditions in Russian detention, with Sentsov declaring a hunger strike to coincide with the international sporting event to demand the release of all Ukrainians imprisoned by Russia. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine also became a launchpad for Rubchinskiy's fashion collection Duval, which he tweeted about on Feb. 25, 2022 — just one day after the full-scale war began. Such a move is part of the bigger issue which critics see with Rubchinskiy's work — namely, how it exploits post-Soviet trauma, repackaging collective pain as aesthetic currency. "It is a space where pain, collapse, and violence experienced in the post-Soviet world are transformed into consumable images — rendered as aesthetic or nostalgic resources, easily instrumentalized," Ukrainian visual artist Yana Kononov explained in a post on Instagram on May 18.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A statue of Britain's late Queen Victoria, outside Windsor Castle in Windsor, west of London on May 7, 2019.ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images The current moment makes that shout-out all the more poignant: A reminder from Victorian era Canadians that they forged a working federation while laying rails to hang an economy on. Queen Victoria, whom the day honours, was a strong proponent of Confederation in 1867. She told a Canadian delegation she took the “deepest interest in it” because she believed it would make her North American provinces “great and prosperous.” Treaties were being signed with Plains First Nations and Dominion Land Surveys were developed in Western Canada to divide land into parcels of one square mile for farming and inexpensive homesteads. Canada was a new frontier for investment. Capital flowed from Britain, new banks and insurance firms were founded. In November of 1885 the greatest infrastructure achievement of Victorian Canada was completed, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The work was hard, the idea of Canada caught people's imagination, but the gap between its promise and the economic reality gave reason for many to think Canada was a failed project. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians moved south to the United States in the 1880s and early 1890s. The union that Queen Victoria presided over, after all, was an alliance of strangers. There was little truck or trade between the three-and-a-half million people spread across a giant continent. Most provinces were more familiar with their U.S. neighbours than each other. In contrast, Canada seemed a motley crew of regions that trains happened to roll through from time to time. Investments that farmers in Ontario and Quebec were making in new equipment and farming methods to improve productivity in the late 1880s and 1890s began paying off as the 20th century approached. The result was bumper crops and bumper profits from sales to export markets that also spread to the Prairies. This reinforced the demand for new farm equipment, driving added manufacturing capacity and innovation in the process. With more deposits coming from farmers in Ontario and Quebec, there was more capital to support larger, complex projects that continued to give momentum to productivity improvements, including two new national railways built between 1900 and 1912. Developing efficient sources of energy, such as hydroelectric power in Ontario and Quebec helped electrify cities while making it easier to produce steel as well as pulp and paper. If Canadians who built the economic foundations of Canada in the three decades after Confederation could speak, they would tell us that national infrastructure isn't enough. Building productive businesses is equally important if you want the prosperity Queen Victoria believed Canada was capable of.

MOSCOW, May 19. /TASS/. The Russian Prosecutor General's Office has declared the activities of the international non-governmental organization Amnesty International undesirable in Russia.

"The Prosecutor General's Office has made a decision to recognize the activities of Amnesty International Limited, an international non-governmental organization registered in London, as undesirable on the territory of Russia," the statement reads.

The PGO explained that since the beginning of the special military operation Amnesty International activists have been doing everything possible to fuel the military confrontation in the region: they justify crimes committed by Ukrainian neo-Nazis, call for an increase in their funding, and insist on Russia's political and economic isolation. "The participants in the organization support extremist organizations and finance the activities of foreign agents," the agency said.

The organization positions itself as an active promoter of human rights protection in the world, but in reality, the London headquarters of Amnesty International is a training center for global Russophobic projects paid for by the Kiev regime's accomplices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A feng shui master urges people to stay away. This might sound like the plot of a disaster movie but for Japan's tourism industry, a recent spate of so-called earthquake-related “predictions” like these has led to more superstitious travelers, particularly in East Asia, canceling or delaying their holidays. Seismologists have long warned that accurately predicting when an earthquake might strike is all but impossible. But the fear of a “big one,” amplified by both soothsayers and social media, is prompting some travelers to get cold feet. And for many, it's a comic book that's scaring them away. Published by manga artist Ryo Tatsuki in 1999, “The Future I Saw” warned of a major disaster in March 2011, a date which turned out to coincide with the cataclysmic quake that struck Japan's northern Tohoku region that month. Her “complete version” released in 2021 claimed that the next big earthquake will hit this July. At the same time, psychics from Japan and Hong Kong have shared similar warnings, triggering some unfounded panic online that has led to a flurry of cancelations of travel plans from destinations in the region. CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, a travel agency based in Hong Kong, said bookings to Japan dropped by half during the Easter holiday and are expected to dip further in the coming two months. The speculations have scared off mostly travelers from mainland China and Hong Kong, which are Japan's second- and fourth-largest sources of tourists, respectively. But the fear has also spread to other markets such as Thailand and Vietnam, where social media platforms are overflowing with posts and videos warning people to think twice before traveling to Japan. Anxieties provoked by these prophecies have, according to Yuen, become “ingrained.” He added that “people just say they want to hold off their trip for now.” Related article Japan is bracing for a once-in-a-century earthquake. Fears of a “big one” have been mounting since the Japanese government warned in January that there was an 80% chance of a severe earthquake hitting the country's southern Nankai Trough within 30 years. Some seismologists have been critical of these warnings, questioning whether they can ever be accurate. Tatsuki's work has a significant following in East Asia and her fans often believe she can accurately see future events in her dreams. Her 2011 quake prediction — or coincidence — made Tatsuki famous not just in Japan but also in other parts of Asia like Thailand and China. The comic book has sold 900,000 copies, according to its publisher. Fans believed she also predicted the deaths of Princess Diana and singer Freddie Mercury, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, however critics say her visions are too vague to be taken seriously. Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported last week that while she viewed it “very positively” that interest in her work has made people more prepared for disasters, she urged them not to be “overly swayed” by her dreams and “act appropriately based on expert opinions.” Chinese media has been reporting the predictions of a self-proclaimed Japanese psychic who suggested a massive earthquake would strike the densely populated Tokyo Bay Area on April 26. Qi Xian Yu, a popular feng shui master and Hong Kong TV personality known as Master Seven, also urged people to stay away from Japan, starting in April. Meanwhile Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi prefecture, which was hit hard during the 2011 quake, spoke out against the impact of superstitious beliefs on Japan's tourism. “I believe it is a serious issue when the spread of highly unscientific rumors on social media had an effect on tourism,” he said during a press conference. Samantha Tang, from Hong Kong, is one of those who has shelved her trip to the country. Originally she planned to visit Wakayama, a beach destination about 50 miles south of Osaka, in August, but has gotten cold feet. “Everyone says so much about an earthquake coming,” said the 34-year-old yoga teacher, who says she has gone on vacation to Japan at least once a year since the end of the pandemic. Another Hong Kong traveler, Oscar Chu, 36, who usually visits Japan multiple times per year, has changed his mind this year as well. It's going to be really troublesome if an earthquake indeed happens,” he said. He explained he wasn't too worried specifically about being in an earthquake but was wary of the ensuing travel chaos and flight disruptions. Meanwhile, 2.36 million mainland Chinese travelers visited Japan in the first quarter of this year, up 78% from last year, the tourism body said. During the same period, some 647,600 Hongkongers visited Japan, marking an overall 3.9% year-on-year growth. In March alone, 343,000 Americans visited Japan, along with 68,000 Canadians and 85,000 Australians. Vic Shing from Hong Kong is among those who haven't changed their plans. He is visiting Tokyo and Osaka in June. “Earthquake predictions have never been accurate,” he said. Even if one did hit, “Japan has encountered many massive earthquakes before.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. SASHA LEZHNEV is Senior Policy Adviser at the Sentry. Every year, illicit gold worth more than $30 billion flows across the globe, including gold originating in conflict zones and authoritarian states. Much of it is smuggled to gold-trading centers such as Dubai or Hong Kong before silently entering the global market. But this trade is underwriting deadly crises around the world. Over the past decade, gold has nearly tripled in price, reaching record highs earlier this month. One can smuggle more than $1 million worth of gold in nothing more than a briefcase, and demand for it is always strong because, unlike critical minerals, gold is universally valuable. The illicit gold trade directly affects U.S. national security because it is fueling armed conflicts and transnational criminal enterprises. And because the gold is being laundered into global supply chains, it threatens global business risks for banks, tech companies, and jewelers. These players should help the largest gold-trading centers, where most illicit gold is laundered—principally the United Arab Emirates but also China, India, Switzerland, and Turkey—reform. In 2022, the country imported and refined an estimated 400 tons of smuggled gold before selling it on global markets. Banks and regulators may find willing local partners: some of the trading centers are facing financial hurdles as a result of smuggling and other money-laundering issues, and they want to increase their credibility in the global financial system. If they meet certain due diligence standards, banks and regulators should offer them financial incentives, including positive evaluations and memberships to global gold organizations, which would improve their reputation and increase their share of global trade. The United States, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, should also work with the gold industry to establish and lead a public-private illicit gold initiative that can publish real-time data on the gold trade and independently monitor and certify trading centers. Although artisanally mined gold provides a livelihood for mining communities in many countries, many small-scale mines situated in conflict areas or authoritarian states frequently employ children as young as eight years old and damage the environment by using corrosive chemicals, including mercury and cyanide. Gold from such mines is then usually smuggled to neighboring countries for initial refining before being shipped or smuggled to a refinery in a global gold-trading center—most often Dubai or Hong Kong. In Sudan, for instance, where gold makes up 70 percent of exports, the ability of the country's warring factions to purchase weapons is heavily dependent on their procuring and selling illicit gold. Such trade also helps sustain the repressive regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which sold more than $1 billion of illicit gold to UAE companies in 2020. Armed groups in the region that commit human rights abuses and deforest the Amazon rainforest, including Tren de Aragua, also mine and traffic illegal gold to the tune of $2.2 billion per year. Russia's involvement in the illicit gold trade spiked after many Western states sanctioned Russian gold following the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The measures have forced Russia, the world's second-largest producer of gold, to try to smuggle out its product and source additional gold from illicit sources, including both sides of the Sudan conflict. The UAE's imports of Russian gold—$2.5 billion in 2023—have fueled Moscow's war economy. This arrangement, however, cut out Rwanda, angering Kigali; afterward, M23 forces, armed by the Rwandan government and supported by up to 12,000 Rwandan troops, took over the swaths of eastern Congo that include its gold mines. Rwanda set up a refinery and exported a record $1.5 billion worth of gold in 2024, despite the fact that the country has nearly no domestic production. Like many cash transactions, the illicit gold trade is insufficiently monitored by governments and industry. There is also no system for sharing real-time data on gold traffickers, meaning bodies that have the power to sanction entities moving illicit gold are often behind in tracking them. The only publicly available data on where gold is traded is two years old, by which time illicit gold has left its country of origin and been laundered into the global supply chain. These data gaps allow countries that have little or no domestic production to buy and sell illicit gold without consequence. There have still been attempts to better regulate this trade. In 2012, for instance, the London Bullion Market Association, an international trade association for gold made up mainly of global banks and refiners, created a due diligence system to audit refineries for high-risk gold—or gold that may have been mined illegally or in a conflict zone—in their supply chains. There's a nascent auditing system for mines, too. Certain regions, including the Great Lakes region of Africa, have set up intergovernmental processes to certify whether mines are conflict free and devoid of child labor. In 2024, the private sector introduced a system by which refiners, miners, and industry associations can share data. There have also been budding attempts to hamper the beneficiaries of smuggling. The United States and Europe have started to take slightly more aggressive action, too. Although these measures are starting to produce some welcome changes, illicit gold continues to flow through trading centers, and the vast majority of illicit traders remain unimpeded. This is because the implementation of these measures is insufficient and uncoordinated and because there are not nearly enough concrete consequences—including sanctions or prosecutions—for illicit-gold traffickers and the refiners that purchase from them. It is essential to address the illicit gold trade before it grows into an uncontrollable black market for criminals, traffickers, armed groups, and rogue regimes that threaten U.S. national security and the integrity of the global financial system. But key gold-trading centers have incentives to reform. These centers want full access to the global financial system. The task force should stringently examine Abu Dhabi's requirements for importers and bullion dealers bringing in gold from high-risk countries, perhaps by requiring a financial paper trail for all imported gold and the implementation of due diligence audits. It should also call to end cash-for-gold transactions above minimal amounts. Entities such as the London Bullion Market Association could provide these trading centers with benefits—such as accepting some of their refiners as members—if, for example, they adequately reformed and implemented their cash-for-gold and customs policies. In 2022, both the London Bullion Market Association and the World Gold Council launched a gold-bar integrity program that uses blockchain technology to make gold transactions more traceable. They could offer to include UAE-based refineries in their program if those facilities agreed to follow much stricter due diligence and transparency measures; this would open the refineries up to the London Bullion Market Association's massive market and help them gain prestige in the global gold trade. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has an important role to play, too, as a platform for governments, the private sector, and civil society to coordinate and share information on illicit gold. Banks and jewelers must also enhance their due diligence efforts by, for example, red-flagging gold exported from trading centers known to buy and sell illicit gold, banning cash transactions above small amounts, and requiring proof of payment for all gold imports as opposed to only certificates of origin, which are easy to fake. When he was a senator, Rubio called the illicit gold trade a “direct threat” to U.S. national security because of how it was strengthening the Maduro regime and demanded that Washington choke it off. Now, as a central figure of the Trump administration, Rubio has an opportunity to do so. The resulting entity should publish real-time data related to the gold trade, which would help curb smuggling by allowing banks and refiners to instantaneously cut off high-risk illicit gold,independently monitor trade centers to catch smugglers, and certify relevant centers as conflict free. As part of the task force, the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network could issue alerts, exchange information with banks and refiners to stay updated on traffickers, and encourage trading entities to file reports on suspicious transactions. The State Department could also encourage shippers and jewelers to share any information they may have on smuggling networks. Rogue actors are increasingly profiting from illicit gold. But if the U.S. government works together with industry and key allies, it can help end this deadly trade and bolster its own security interests.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Spend a few minutes browsing political commentary or scrolling social media and you will discover a seemingly settled truth: inequality in the West is soaring, the middle class is being hollowed out, and democracies stand on the brink of oligarchy. The idea is seductive because it fits everyday anxieties in many Western countries—housing has grown increasingly unaffordable, billionaire wealth mushrooms unfathomably, and the pandemic exposed yawning gaps in social safety nets. Yet the most influential claims about inequality rest on selective readings of history and partial measurements of living standards. When the full balance sheet of modern economies is tallied—including taxes, transfers, pension entitlements, homeownership, and the fact that people move through income brackets across their lives—the story looks markedly different. But focusing only on the eye-catching fortunes of tech founders or hedge-fund managers obscures a quieter, broader transformation: households across the income spectrum now own capital on a scale unimaginable to earlier generations, and basic measures of well-being in Western societies—including life expectancy, educational attainment, and consumption possibilities—have improved for nearly everyone. If governments assume that capitalism is inexorably recreating the disparities of the Gilded Age, they will reach for wealth confiscations, price controls, or ever-larger public sectors funded by fragile tax bases. If, instead, the evidence shows that free-market economies have enriched middle classes by expanding asset ownership, that entrepreneurs' fortunes are associated with advances shared with the broader public, and that much of the post-1980 rise in recorded inequality reflects methodological quirks, then a different agenda follows: states should encourage ambition, protect competition, widen access to wealth-building, and ensure that public services complement—not smother—private prosperity. In short, before treating inequality as an existential crisis, it is worth double-checking the thermometer. The turn toward market liberalization around 1980 unleashed a second wave of plutocracy. First are tax-return data that track pretax market income: salaries, dividends, and realized capital gains. These show widening gaps because high earners captured disproportionate gains from globalization and digital technology. Second are surveys of household wealth that measure who owns stocks and real estate; when asset prices boom, wealthy portfolios balloon. Third are particular statistics that make headlines—the many CEOs paid hundreds of times more than average workers, or the eight men who together are richer than half the world—and feed public outrage. Starting the clock in 1980 is rhetorically convenient because inequality was then unusually low, following decades of steep taxation and stringent regulation that had dampened entrepreneurship and curtailed many ambitious career paths. Today's levels, although higher than those of the late 1970s, are far below those of the pre–World War II era when taxes were much lower than they are today. Recent work on U.S. income distribution by the tax economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter shows that correcting for underreported income at the bottom, income shifted into tax-deferred retirement accounts, and welfare transfers flattens the trend dramatically: in the United States, the top one percent's share of after-tax income is only slightly higher today than it was in 1960, nowhere near the doubling implied by estimates presented by Piketty and his co-authors. Europe's picture is flatter still, thanks to heavier redistribution and less winner-take-all compensation at the top of the corporate ladder. Reconstructed national balance sheets for France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States show real per-adult wealth roughly tripling since 1980 and rising more than sevenfold since 1950. In 1900, assets held by the elite—agricultural domains and shares in industrial or financial corporations—dominated; today, residential property and funded retirement accounts represent the majority of private assets. That shift parallels mass homeownership: in most Western countries, 60 to 70 percent of households now own the roof over their heads—an equity stake unavailable to their great-grandparents. Most workers hold pension claims in mutual funds or index funds, granting them the high returns of stock markets at low risk—what amounts to financial democratization. The dominant quantitative fact of the century, therefore, is not a new Gilded Age but a dramatic wealth equalization propelled by mass asset ownership. Third, the fact that people move through different income brackets over the course of their lives should temper typical measures of inequality. So, too, should the effects of welfare payments. Annual snapshots lump graduate students with retirees living off savings, making income and wealth gaps appear wider than lifetime consumption gaps. When studies in different countries instead follow individuals over time, they typically find that within only a few years, half the households in the bottom income decile have climbed to higher levels. Many top-decile households can drop to lower rungs of the ladder after business or investment setbacks. In Sweden, when public pension entitlements are capitalized and added to assessments of personal wealth, this alone cuts the measured wealth inequality—known as the Gini coefficient—by almost half. In the United States, the market's redistributive role is smaller, but when Social Security, Medicare, and employer-provided health insurance are treated as in-kind income, median households fare far better than raw wage data suggest. Yes, superstar entrepreneurs have amassed fortunes measured in tens of billions. Over the past four decades, life expectancy in advanced economies (including in the United States despite the much-noted increase in “deaths of despair”) rose roughly six years, high school completion became nearly universal, and personal computers once reserved for elites went mainstream. Even advocates of government intervention should champion efficient growth: every percentage point of GDP adds billions to tax revenue. The West's most durable path to fairness, then, is to scale up the channels through which ordinary households acquire assets—including affordable housing supply, portable retirement accounts, and low-fee index funds—and to keep markets open so new firms can challenge incumbents. That perspective should also moderate calls for annual taxes on the stock of net wealth, which have recently been proposed by some politicians and researchers, and have even been discussed officially at G-20 and UN meetings. These so-called wealth taxes are problematic because they hit illiquid assets, forcing entrepreneurs or farmers to borrow or liquidate. Scandinavian experience of such taxes shows that they produce meager revenues, come with high administrative costs, and encourage capital flight. If capital is to be taxed, a more efficient and equitable way is to tax capital income—such as dividends, realized gains, and corporate profits. It diverts energy from the real challenges to Western economies, which include lax productivity growth, aging populations, and the imperatives of climate adaptation. Misunderstanding inequality also breeds regressivity: taxing housing wealth indiscriminately can hit asset-rich but cash-poor retirees; taxing private firms can force sales to multinational giants with cheaper credit. And it corrodes trust: when citizens hear that capitalism benefits only the elite—even as their own living standards rise—they may grow cynical about official statistics and susceptible to populist cures worse than the disease. Transparent rules for campaign financing and party contributions are essential to minimize the undue influence of money. Core welfare services, such as education and health care, should not become overly dependent on private funding, otherwise they would tie the quality of care to personal wealth—and in the process deepen inequality. States should celebrate entrepreneurial success and foster competition by reducing regulatory burdens—especially those that disproportionately affect smaller and younger firms. Taxation on labor income should be modest enough to incentivize hard work and also allow for the accumulation of new wealth, while capital taxation should target income rather than wealth or inheritances. Public investment should focus on building the capabilities that let households become stakeholders—education, infrastructure, and a rules-based climate that rewards risk-taking. Such an agenda accepts that inequality can coexist with, and even flow from, broad prosperity. Frustration with privilege should be channeled into reforms that expand opportunity rather than cap success. This agenda advances neither laissez-faire complacency nor egalitarian maximalism. It is an acknowledgment that the West's most remarkable achievement is not the fortune of a Jeff Bezos or Bernard Arnault but the mundane riches enjoyed by millions whose grandparents lived without antibiotics, central heating, or college degrees. Policymakers would do well to remember that progress before they diagnose calamity—and nurture the conditions that make it possible: secure property rights, open markets, and an efficient public sector powered by the very economic growth its advocates sometimes disparage.

MOSCOW, May 19. /TASS/. Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) is discussing with aviation authorities of many countries the possibility of resuming air traffic, the agency's head Dmitry Yadrov told reporters.

"We are constantly working with the Foreign Ministry, the Transport Ministry, and the Economic Development Ministry on international air traffic. We are in dialogue with the aviation authorities of many countries. Many countries that have suspended flights are ready to resume them," he said.

According to Yadrov, Russian airlines are ready to fly to certain countries, but they need guarantees that their aircraft will receive necessary maintenance and will not be subject to sanctions-related restrictions.

Currently, it is possible to fly from Russia to 38 countries without connecting flights, 17 of which are served by both domestic and foreign airlines.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An early-morning crash has torn one family apart, Toronto police said Sunday as they announced three children had died in a collision allegedly caused by an impaired teen driver. Baheer Sarbanandan said a 19-year-old driving a Dodge Caravan eastbound on the highway was allegedly speeding while exiting at Renforth Drive. This was “a tragic collision that took away three children's lives,” Sarbanandan said. The 40-year-old man behind the wheel, a 35-year-old woman and a 10-year-old child are currently in hospital and are in stable condition. Police said 19-year-old Ethan Lehouillier of Georgetown, Ont., was arrested at the scene and is facing 12 charges, including three counts of impaired driving causing death and three counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm. “We educate the public of the dangers of drinking and driving and this is a result: a family is torn apart,” said Sarbanandan. Police are appealing to witnesses who saw the Dodge Caravan travelling eastbound on the 401 to come forward with information. They are also looking for dashcam footage, Sarbanandan said. The crash comes nearly a decade after a comparable incident in September 2015 in which another impaired driver caused the deaths of three children and their grandfather. On Sept. 27, 2015, Daniel Neville-Lake, 9, his brother Harrison, 5, and sister Milly, 2, and Gary Neville, 65, died after the crash in Vaughan, Ont. The children's grandmother and great-grandmother were also seriously injured. Marco Muzzo was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2016 to four counts of impaired driving causing death and two of impaired driving causing bodily harm. Jennifer Neville-Lake, the children's mother, made a post of “grief and solidarity” with the victims of Sunday's crash in an afternoon Instagram post. I'm heartbroken after hearing the news,“ she wrote in the caption to a photo depicting several pale yellow and blue packets of forget-me-not, sunflower and moonflower seeds.</p>
