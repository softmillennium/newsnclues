            A Japanese comic book warns of a “real catastrophe.” A psychic predicts mass destruction. A feng shui master urges people to stay away.
    


            This might sound like the plot of a disaster movie but for Japan's tourism industry, a recent spate of so-called earthquake-related “predictions” like these has led to more superstitious travelers, particularly in East Asia, canceling or delaying their holidays.
    


            Seismologists have long warned that accurately predicting when an earthquake might strike is all but impossible. Japan is a country with a good track record of withstanding even powerful tremors and the prospect of a major quake is something its population lives with on a daily basis.
    


            But the fear of a “big one,” amplified by both soothsayers and social media, is prompting some travelers to get cold feet. And for many, it's a comic book that's scaring them away.
    


            Published by manga artist Ryo Tatsuki in 1999, “The Future I Saw” warned of a major disaster in March 2011, a date which turned out to coincide with the cataclysmic quake that struck Japan's northern Tohoku region that month.
    


            Her “complete version” released in 2021 claimed that the next big earthquake will hit this July.
    


            At the same time, psychics from Japan and Hong Kong have shared similar warnings, triggering some unfounded panic online that has led to a flurry of cancelations of travel plans from destinations in the region.
    


            CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, a travel agency based in Hong Kong, said bookings to Japan dropped by half during the Easter holiday and are expected to dip further in the coming two months.
    


            The speculations have scared off mostly travelers from mainland China and Hong Kong, which are Japan's second- and fourth-largest sources of tourists, respectively. But the fear has also spread to other markets such as Thailand and Vietnam, where social media platforms are overflowing with posts and videos warning people to think twice before traveling to Japan.
    


            Anxieties provoked by these prophecies have, according to Yuen, become “ingrained.” He added that “people just say they want to hold off their trip for now.”

Japan is bracing for a once-in-a-century earthquake. Does it need to?



            Japan is no stranger to severe earthquakes. It lies on the Ring of Fire, an area of intense seismic and volcanic activity on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.
    


            Fears of a “big one” have been mounting since the Japanese government warned in January that there was an 80% chance of a severe earthquake hitting the country's southern Nankai Trough within 30 years. Some seismologists have been critical of these warnings, questioning whether they can ever be accurate.
    


            Tatsuki's work has a significant following in East Asia and her fans often believe she can accurately see future events in her dreams.
    


            She draws a cartoon version of herself in the manga, where she shares visions she gleans from her slumbers with other characters. Some of these dreams turn out to bear close resemblance to real-life events.
    


            Her 2011 quake prediction — or coincidence — made Tatsuki famous not just in Japan but also in other parts of Asia like Thailand and China. The comic book has sold 900,000 copies, according to its publisher. It has also been published in Chinese.
    


            Fans believed she also predicted the deaths of Princess Diana and singer Freddie Mercury, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, however critics say her visions are too vague to be taken seriously.
    


            The manga's cover bears the words “massive disaster in March, 2011,” leading many to believe that she predicted the 9.0-magnitude earthquake more than a decade before it hit Tohoku.
    


            The quake triggered a deadly tsunami that killed tens of thousands and crippled the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.
    


            In the latest edition, “The Future I Saw (Complete Version),” Tatsuki warned that on July 5 this year, a crack will open up under the seabed between Japan and the Philippines, sending ashore waves three times as tall as those from the Tohoku earthquake.
    


            The author was recently asked what she thought about the canceled trips resulting from readers' interpretations of her book.
    


            Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported last week that while she viewed it “very positively” that interest in her work has made people more prepared for disasters, she urged them not to be “overly swayed” by her dreams and “act appropriately based on expert opinions.”
    


            She's not the only doomsayer.
    


            Chinese media has been reporting the predictions of a self-proclaimed Japanese psychic who suggested a massive earthquake would strike the densely populated Tokyo Bay Area on April 26. Though the date passed without incident, the prediction triggered immense interest on Chinese social media.
    


            Qi Xian Yu, a popular feng shui master and Hong Kong TV personality known as Master Seven, also urged people to stay away from Japan, starting in April.
    


            Japan's Cabinet Office took to X earlier this month to explain that modern technology has yet to be able to accurately predict an earthquake.
    


            Meanwhile Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi prefecture, which was hit hard during the 2011 quake, spoke out against the impact of superstitious beliefs on Japan's tourism.
    


            “I believe it is a serious issue when the spread of highly unscientific rumors on social media had an effect on tourism,” he said during a press conference.

Why tourist information centers are some of Asia's top tourist attractions



            Despite all the social media static, it's unclear whether the fearmongering is working — Japan remains a wildly popular destination.
    


            Samantha Tang, from Hong Kong, is one of those who has shelved her trip to the country. Originally she planned to visit Wakayama, a beach destination about 50 miles south of Osaka, in August, but has gotten cold feet.
    


            “Everyone says so much about an earthquake coming,” said the 34-year-old yoga teacher, who says she has gone on vacation to Japan at least once a year since the end of the pandemic.
    


            Another Hong Kong traveler, Oscar Chu, 36, who usually visits Japan multiple times per year, has changed his mind this year as well.
    


            “It's best to avoid it. It's going to be really troublesome if an earthquake indeed happens,” he said. He explained he wasn't too worried specifically about being in an earthquake but was wary of the ensuing travel chaos and flight disruptions.
    


            Still, plenty of tourists are undeterred.
    


            Japan has seen the number of visitors surge to a record-breaking 10.5 million in the first three months of 2025, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.
    


            Meanwhile, 2.36 million mainland Chinese travelers visited Japan in the first quarter of this year, up 78% from last year, the tourism body said.
    


            During the same period, some 647,600 Hongkongers visited Japan, marking an overall 3.9% year-on-year growth.
    


            And that's only tourists from East Asia.
    


            In March alone, 343,000 Americans visited Japan, along with 68,000 Canadians and 85,000 Australians.
    


            Vic Shing from Hong Kong is among those who haven't changed their plans. Although he has heard about “the prophecy,” he said he remained committed to his Japan vacation this year. He is visiting Tokyo and Osaka in June.
    


            “Earthquake predictions have never been accurate,” he said.
    


            Even if one did hit, “Japan has encountered many massive earthquakes before. It shouldn't be too bad when it comes to disaster management,” he added.

            Portugal's ruling center-right Democratic Alliance (AD) won a snap parliamentary election on Sunday but again fell short of the majority needed to end a long period of instability as the far-right Chega gained a record share of the vote.
    


            Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the election result was a vote of confidence in his party, but with votes from abroad still to be counted Chega could supplant the center-left Socialists as the main opposition party, ending almost 40 years of dominance by the country's two major parties.
    


            Continued political instability could delay structural reforms and major projects in Portugal, including lithium mining in the north, and potentially compromise the efficient deployment of EU funds and the long-delayed privatization of TAP airline.
    


            The election, the third in as many years, was called one year into an AD minority government's term after Montenegro failed to win a vote of confidence in March when the opposition questioned his integrity over dealings of his family's consultancy firm. He has denied any wrongdoing.
    


            Electoral data showed the AD making gains, winning 89 seats in the 230-seat parliament, nine more than in the previous election.
    


            Montenegro, who has ruled out any deal with Chega, said he expected to form a minority government.
    


            “The Portuguese don't want any more snap elections, they want a four-year legislature,” Montenegro said as his supporters chanted “Let Luis work,” his campaign slogan.
    


            Chega gained 8 seats for a total of 58, winning a record 22.6% of the vote, while voters appeared to punish the Socialists for their role in bringing down Montenegro's government.
    


            They fell to 58 seats from 78, prompting Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos to say he would step down.
    


            Chega leader Andre Ventura, who was hospitalized during the campaign after collapsing on stage with an esophageal spasm, said his party had “swept the left block off the map in style.”
    


            “There are moments in life during which God says, just stop a little bit,” he told a crowd of jubilant supporters. “This time I am not going to listen. I am not going to stop until I become the prime minister of Portugal.”

            • High-stakes call: ﻿President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for nearly two hours this morning, according to a US official, a day after top administration officials met with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in Rome. Putin said the call with Trump was “frank and substantive,” according to Russian state media. The conversation comes as the White House noted earlier today that the US president has “grown weary and frustrated” with both sides and wants the conflict to end. Trump also held a call with Zelensky today, the Ukrainian presidency said.
    


            • SCOTUS ruling: The Supreme Court today allowed the Trump administration to move toward ending temporary deportation protections for potentially hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. This comes just days after SCOTUS blocked Trump from moving forward with deportations under a sweeping wartime authority, siding with Venezuelans who feared they were poised for imminent removal.
    


            • Trump's agenda: ﻿House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as House Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members before an expected floor vote later this week. Issues related to Medicaid are among the biggest sticking points.
    


            US President Donald Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin has concluded, according to a US official and Russian state media TASS.
    


            The call lasted nearly two hours, according to a US official. The official said Trump will provide a readout shortly.
    


            Putin said the conversation with Trump was “frank and substantive,” according to TASS.
    


            TASS also reported that Putin “expressed his position on the ceasefire during the conversation.”
    


            Putin thanked Trump for US support in “resuming the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine,” following the high stakes phone call.
    


                    “The US president expressed his position on the secession of hostilities, ceasefire, and from my end, I have emphasized that Russia stands for peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. We just need to outline the most effective routes of moving towards peace,” Putin said while speaking to reporters.
                





            Earlier today, Trump also held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the Ukrainian presidency.
    


This post has been updated with more of Putin's remarks on the call. 



            A federal judge ruled today that the Trump administration unlawfully removed the board of the US Institute of Peace earlier this year and that subsequent actions taken by officials installed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cripple the agency are therefore “null and void.”
    


            The lengthy ruling from US District Judge Beryl Howell is the latest defeat for the Trump administration in its attempts to exert authority over independent agencies.
    


            USIP is not a federal agency within the executive branch. It was created by Congress as a nonpartisan, independent body in 1984 and owns and manages its headquarters.
    


                    “The President second-guessed the judgment of Congress and President Reagan in creating USIP 40 years ago,” Howell, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, wrote in the 102-page ruling.
                





What happened: In March, the Trump administration fired most of USIP's board and acting President George Moose. The three remaining board members — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin — said they were installing Kenneth Jackson as acting USIP president.
    


            Days later, DOGE personnel, accompanied by Washington, DC, police, gained access to the headquarters after having been turned away during an earlier attempt. Some USIP officials remained in the building after DOGE's arrival, including Moose, a retired career diplomat. He was later forced to exit the building by DC police.
    


            Shortly after, USIP filed suit against the administration in an effort to stop its dismantlement and to try to stop the transfer of its private building and endowment to the federal government.
    


                    Howell wrote that Trump and his subordinates “used brute force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP's headquarters, despite being cautioned that this organization did not fall within the Executive branch and its leadership was not subject to the President's unilateral Executive branch removal power.”
                





            “This Administration then went even further, taking severe actions to dissemble USIP, including terminating its appointed Board members, its expert management, its dedicated staff and contractors located in both Washington, DC, and around the world, and dispersing its assets and headquarters building,” the judge wrote. “These actions against USIP were unlawful.”
    


            The Supreme Court today allowed President Donald Trump's administration to move toward ending temporary deportation protections for potentially hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans.
    


            At issue is a move earlier this year by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to end a form of humanitarian relief known as temporary protected status for Venezuelan migrants.
    


            Seven Venezuelan nationals who are covered by Temporary Protective Status, or TPS, and a group that represents others challenged the move, arguing in part that Noem's decision was motivated by racial and political hostility.
    


            Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only justice to note her dissent.
    


            House Republican leaders are negotiating over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote on the GOP's massive tax and spending cuts package later this week.
    


            Among several sticking points is the timeframe over when new Medicaid work requirements would kick in and whether to change the federal-state cost sharing program for Medicaid.
    


            Nearly 80 million children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, parents and adults without dependents rely on Medicaid and the related Children's Health Insurance Program. Most US adults say they don't want to see decreases in Medicaid spending, according to a recent KFF poll.
    


            Republican lawmakers voted to pass a budget blueprint in April that gave the House Energy and Commerce Committee instructions to shave $880 billion in funding from programs in the committee's jurisdiction. They have said they want to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. It's uncertain, however, whether Republican lawmakers' Medicaid revamp will achieve their topline goal for the cuts needed to help finance President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts agenda.
    


            More than 60 House Republicans represent districts with higher-than-average Medicaid enrollment, according to a CNN analysis of Medicaid enrollment data and 2024 election results.
    


            While most Republican districts aren't heavily reliant on the program, Speaker Mike Johnson's historically tight margin in the House means that he can only afford a handful of Republican “no” votes to pass any changes to Medicaid without Democrats' help.

            President Donald Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin is underway, a US official says.
    


More on the call: Earlier today, Vice President JD Vance said he believes Trump will ask Putin whether he is “serious” about peace with Ukraine during the phone call. Vance stressed that the United States is “not going to spin its wheels” in its attempts to reach a resolution.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today that Trump has “grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,” adding that his goal “is to see a ceasefire and to see this conflict come to an end.”
    


CNN's Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post. 



            President Donald Trump held a phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday, according to the Ukrainian presidency.
    


            Trump had been expected to start his diplomacy on Monday with a call to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over President Donald Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as House Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote later this week.
    


            Among the major issues that are still unresolved: The timeframe over when new Medicaid work requirements would kick in, whether to change the federal-state cost sharing program for Medicaid, when green energy tax credits would be phased out and how much Americans can deduct from the state and local taxes they pay.
    


            There are also big questions such as how much the sweeping bill will add to the deficit and how many Americans would lose access to benefits like Medicaid and food stamps, since the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has yet to release an official estimate on the bill's impact to the debt and the economy.
    


            House GOP leadership aides said on Monday morning that key decisions have not been finalized even though Johnson wants the bill passed out of his chamber by Thursday.
    


            “Everything is in plan all the way until the end,” said one leadership aide, noting the talks are “extremely difficult” given the narrowness of the majority and the diversity of the demands. But aides contended that “95%” of the bill had been agreed to among House Republicans.
    


More on the bill: The bill calls for first-time work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries to be implemented by 2029, but GOP hardliners are demanding that timeframe be moved up — something that is causing angst among more moderate members. Moreover, some of the hardliners want to pare back the amount of money the federal government pays into state-run Medicaid programs, a change that moderates have long resisted.
    


            Johnson is expected to continue talks on Monday with his members.
    


            Vice President JD Vance said he believes that President Donald Trump will ask Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is “serious” about peace with Ukraine in a phone call this morning. 



            Vance stressed that the United States is “not going to spin its wheels” in its attempts to reach a resolution.
    


                    “The talks have been proceeding for a little while. We realize that we're at a bit of an impasse here. I think the president's going to say to President Putin, look, are you serious? Are you real about this?” Vance said to reporters aboard Air Force Two. “There are a lot of economic benefits to thawing relations between Russia and the rest of the world, but you're not going to get those benefits if you keep on killing a lot of innocent people.”
                





            While Vance said “it's hard to pinpoint one” obstacle to reaching a ceasefire, he reiterated how “one open question” is whether Putin is serious about negotiating peace.
    


                    “He has made some concessions. He has taken some serious steps in these conversations. But we feel like we're at a point where we're hitting an impasse and that's why the president is talking to him on the phone. I think honestly that President Putin, he doesn't quite know how to get out of the war,” he said. 
                





            “I'm not sure that Vladimir Putin has a strategy himself for how to unwind the war, of course, that's been going on for a few years now,” Vance added, saying he thought “the president would agree” with that.
    


            Vance also said that the US is still “more than open to walking away.”
    


            “We want to see outcomes, and the first major outcome that we wanted to see, which we were glad about, is that we wanted to see the Russians and the Ukrainians to put a real peace proposal on the table. What would you need to do in order to stop fighting? That happened. The second thing is that they needed to agree to talks with one another,” he said.
    


            While Putin didn't show up for direct talks that he proposed last week, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Turkey on Friday and agreed to a large-scale prisoner swap. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who agreed to meet with Putin directly, criticized him for sending a “low-level” delegation and said the Russian leader was “afraid.”
    


            Ahead of Trump's 10 a.m. ET call, Vance said, “I was just on the phone with him. I know he's looking forward to it and I wish him all the best. I think he's the right guy to negotiate for the country.”
    


            During a briefing with reporters on Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump has “grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,” adding that his goal “is to see a ceasefire and to see this conflict come to an end.”
    


            Pressed on whether the president still wants to meet with Putin, as he told reporters last week in the Middle East, Leavitt said it will depend on today's call.
    


            Vice President JD Vance said he thought about visiting Israel after his trip to Rome, but cited logistical and security reasons as the obstacle, rather than Israel's expanding military operation in Gaza.
    


                    “I think there's a lot of overstatement there. I haven't seen the story to be clear, so I don't want to speak to the details. But the simple reason is: We thought about going to Israel. We also thought about going to a couple of other countries that the president would like me to visit here in the next few months,” Vance said in a gaggle aboard Air Force Two.
                





            “Logistically, it was just a little bit too hard on basic things like, who the hell is going to take care of our kids if we take another couple of days overseas?”
    


            Axios had reported that Vance considered traveling to Israel on Tuesday but decided against it due to the expansion of Israel's military operation in Gaza, citing a senior US official. CNN has not independently confirmed this reporting.
    


            “But on some more serious things like, how do we provide security? How do we make sure that we get all the assets that we need in order to do the right official delegation? So, I'm sure we'll visit Israel sometime in the future, but not today,” Vance said.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today that the controversial Qatari plane that President Donald Trump said he plans to accept is “the Air Force's project” and that Trump “has nothing to do with it.”
    


            Leavitt pushed back on reports that the Qatari royal family will gift the Trump administration the luxury plane, which would be retrofitted and used as Air Force One during Trump's second term. She criticized the media for what she called “a lot of misinformation” around the gift.
    


            “Let's be very clear, the government of Qatar, the Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,” Leavitt said. “It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force – this plane is not a personal donation or gift to the president of the United States, and everyone who wrote that last week should go and correct their stories, because this is a donation to our country and to the United States Air Force.”
    


            CNN has reported that the Department of Defense plans to accept the luxury Boeing 747-8 jet, which would be retrofitted for the president's use with security features and modifications before being donated to Trump's presidential library after he leaves office. Trump has denied that he would use the plane after his term concludes.
    


            Trump suggested in an interview that aired last week that the Qataris approached him directly with the possibility of gifting a luxury jet replacement for Air Force One, claiming that one Qatari official said: “If I can help you, let me do that.”
    


            Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about the plane. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Tuesday that the plane “poses significant espionage and surveillance problems.” And Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said accepting it would pose “immense counterintelligence risks by granting a foreign nation potential access to sensitive systems and communications.”
    


            President Donald Trump's spokesperson voiced confidence Monday in the White House Medical Unit and professionals at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center amid questions about whether physicians there missed signs of former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer.



            “The White House physician we have here is phenomenal, and the team of physicians that take care of the president, particularly at Walter Reed Medical Center, are great,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a White House briefing.
    


            Biden's White House physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, left the White House Medical Unit when Biden left office. Dr. Sean Barbabella, the current physician to the president, provided a readout of Trump's medical exam earlier this year showing he was fit to serve in office.
    


            “He's in great health, and he trusts his physicians,” Leavitt said.
    


            She said to the best of her understanding, Trump was screened for prostate cancer during his physical exam. Usual medical advice is to not test men over the age of 70, but it's not unusual to apply different standards to presidents.
    


            Biden's office revealed Sunday the former president had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. Some MAGA-world allies, including Donald Trump Jr., have suggested without evidence that Biden's team tried to cover up the medical issue.
    


            President Donald Trump has invited Pope Leo XIV to the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing on Monday.
    


            The president's invitation to the first American pontiff was delivered in a letter via Vice President JD Vance, who attended the pope's first Mass on Sunday and later met with the pontiff.
    


                    “The vice president passed along a letter to the pope from the president and from the first lady, extending their warm wishes and inviting them to the White House as soon as they possibly can come,” Leavitt said.
                





            The White House declined to weigh in on comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday that Israel will take “control of the entire Gaza Strip,” during a briefing with reporters Monday.
    


                    “I'll have to talk to the president about those comments as they just came, I believe, from the prime minister this morning, and I'll let him speak on that,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president has made it very clear he wants to see this conflict in the region end, he wants all hostages to be released…as for the prime minister's comments, I'll let the president himself respond to those.”
                





            Earlier Monday, Netanyahu said that Israel plans to take control of all of Gaza, less than 24 hours after the country's military launched an extensive ground operation in the territory, in addition to an air campaign that intensified last week.
    


            “We have intense, massive fighting going on – intense and immense. There is progress. We are going to take control of the entire Gaza Strip – that's what we're going to do,” Netanyahu said Monday.
    


            The UN and prominent aid organizations have raised the alarm over the new offensive, saying it is civilians who are bearing the brunt of the assault. More than 300 people have been killed and over 1,000 others have been injured after Israel ramped up intense airstrikes since Thursday, according to a CNN count of this week's Palestinian Ministry of Health data.
    


            While traveling in the Middle East last week, Trump once again proposed the idea of the US taking over Gaza, offering the idea of a “freedom zone” as he continued to muse about redeveloping the war-torn enclave.
    


CNN's Dana Karni and Kara Fox contributed reporting to this post. 



            The sweeping bill aimed to advance President Donald Trump's legislative agenda will not add to the deficit, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed today – despite multiple nonpartisan reports that say otherwise.
    


            Asked by CNN's Alayna Treene if the president is alright with the bill potentially adding to the deficit, Leavitt pushed back and said, “This bill does not add to the deficit.”
    


            A preliminary estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, said the package would add $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade. And annual deficits would jump from $1.8 trillion in 2024 to $2.9 trillion by 2034 as the federal government would continue to spend more than it would raise in revenue, the committee projected.
    


            Leavitt went on to claim that the bill, which includes a slew of provisions on taxes, the border and energy, “will save $1.6 trillion,” according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
    


            The press secretary added that “the president absolutely understands and hears the concerns of fiscal conservatives and of Americans who want to get our fiscal house in order. That's what the intention of this bill is.”
    


            The primary issue with getting aid into Gaza is logistical — not political — and the Trump administration does not want to see a humanitarian crisis unfold there, US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told ABC News' “This Week” on Sunday.
    


            Describing President Donald Trump as a “humanitarian,” Witkoff said that “everyone is concerned about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza,” adding that “logistically … I don't think there's any daylight between President Trump's position and (Israeli) Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu's position.”
    


            “I think the issue now is, how do we logistically get all of those trucks into Gaza? How do we set up the aid stations? There are many things — initiatives that we are working on to address this. The Israelis have indicated that they're going to begin to allow a lot more of these trucks to get in,” he said.
    


                    Adding that the logistics of aid are “complicated,” Witkoff said: “We do not want to see a humanitarian crisis, and we will not allow it to occur on President Trump's watch.”
                





            Witkoff's comments came hours before Israel announced Sunday that they would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza, which would end an 11-week blockade of all aid into the territory, which has been criticized by many in the international community.
    


            On Saturday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a post on X that “a policy of siege & starvation makes a mockery of international law.”
    


            The House Rules Committee has set the key vote to take up the rule on President Donald Trump's massive domestic policy bill for 1 a.m. on Wednesday.
    


            That will give House Speaker Mike Johnson today and tomorrow to negotiate final changes to the bill before that key meeting. At that meeting, an amendment would be added to the bill to make the changes to win over holdouts in his conference.
    


            The rule outlines the parameters for floor debate and must pass the full House before the chamber can take up and pass Trump's bill along party lines.
    


            Johnson wants to pass the bill in the House on Thursday.
    


            President Donald Trump said he's going to call for a “major investigation” into the celebrity endorsements of former Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing his 2024 rival of paying Bruce Springsteen, Oprah Winfrey and Bono for their support and showing up at rallies.
    


            There is no evidence that Harris paid for celebrity support, nor did Trump provide any. Continuing to obsess over crowd size, Trump claimed “this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds.”
    


            This comes as Springsteen is on tour, calling the president “unfit” for office and urging his fans to stand against authoritarianism.
    


            Trump bashed Springsteen last week in response, telling him he “ought to keep his mouth shut” and calling him a “pushy, obnoxious JERK.”
    


            Nuclear discussions between the United States and Iran will fail if Washington demands that Tehran abandon domestic enrichment of uranium, a nuclear fuel that can be used for a bomb if enriched to high levels, an Iranian official said.
    


                    “Regarding zero enrichment, we said from the beginning that if this is their (American) position, it is natural that the work will not actually get anywhere,” Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht Ravanchi was cited as saying by Iran's Nour News on Monday. “Our position on enrichment is clear, and we have repeatedly stated that enrichment is a national achievement for us. We will not back down on the issue of enrichment.”
                





            Iran and the US have had four rounds of talks to reach a nuclear deal that could see crippling US sanctions lifted in exchange for Tehran putting curbs on its nuclear program.
    


            US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is leading the American delegation to the talks, told ABC over the weekend that Washington “cannot allow even 1% of an enrichment capability” under an agreement.
    


                    “Enrichment enables weaponization, and we will not allow a bomb to get here. But short of that, there are all kinds of ways for us to achieve our goals in this negotiation,” Witkoff said, adding that the next round of talks may take place in Europe this week. 
                





            Iran has repeatedly said that any suggestion that it abandon enrichment would be a non-starter, insisting that it reserves the right to enrich uranium under the UN's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Witkoff had previously suggested that Iran could be allowed some uranium enrichment.
    


            On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said that the issue “is not negotiable under any circumstances,” criticizing American negotiators for reversing their positions after each round of negotiations, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency.
    


            United States Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Pope Leo at the Vatican on Monday.
    


            Vance arrived at the Vatican at 7:56 a.m. local time for a meeting with Pope Leo, according to a spokesperson for Vance's office, who said Rubio was also in attendance.
    


            Vance's meeting with the Pope wrapped up at 8:40 a.m. local time, according to Vance's office.

            President Donald Trump has expressed frustration in recent days over the state of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine — a goal he often said on the campaign trail he would achieve within a day of taking office.
    


            Trump said last week that he believes he alone can advance the stalling peace talks, and he's arranged a phone call to speak directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin this morning as part of that effort.
    


Here's how we got here:



Talks in Turkey yield little progress: Ukraine and Russia held their first direct talks in three years last week in Turkey, but the discussions were limited in scope and lacking the presence of each country's leader.
    


            Putin originally pitched the meetings as a face-to-face with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which he initially accepted. But neither leader ultimately attended, and Zelensky criticized his Russian counterpart for not sending a higher-level delegation.
    


            The meetings yielded a prisoner swap and further talks about the two presidents meeting, but little appeared to substantively change on each country's ceasefire terms.
    


Zelensky meeting in Rome: Zelensky said he had a “good meeting” yesterday in Italy with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who traveled to Rome for the inaugural mass of Pope Leo XIV.
    


            It was the first time Zelensky and Vance sat down together since the vice president castigated the Ukrainian leader in February's infamous Oval Office meeting.
    


            “I confirmed Ukraine's readiness for genuine diplomacy and stressed the importance of a complete and unconditional ceasefire as soon as possible,” the Ukrainian leader said of the sitdown in Italy.
    


Breaking up the “logjam”: Rubio told CBS' “Face the Nation” yesterday that while patience is needed, “we don't have time to waste” in the peace effort. The secretary of state indicated Trump speaking directly with Putin should get talks moving, and warned Russia against delivering unrealistic ceasefire proposal terms.
    


            Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff echoed Rubio, telling ABC's “This Week” that Trump's call will “clear up some of the logjam and get us to the place that we need to get to.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his US counterpart, Donald Trump. The conversation on Monday focused on the Ukraine conflict and a possible ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev.

The phone call was initially announced by Trump on Saturday. The US president said the discussion will focus on “stopping the ‘bloodbath'” between Russia and Ukraine, as well as on bilateral trade issues.

Moscow has described the upcoming conversation between the two presidents as “important,” with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stating the call will be based on the results of the recent Turkish-mediated meeting between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul. Russia welcomes the US mediation role and sees the diplomatic path to resolving the Ukraine conflict as preferable, Peskov stressed on Monday.

“We highly value the United States' mediating efforts – if they truly help us achieve our objectives by peaceful means,” he said.

Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy and a key figure behind kickstarting the Ukraine peace process, has expressed hope that the call will be “very successful” and can help clear “some of the logjam” in the negotiations.

19 May 2025

Moscow is ready to work with Kiev on a memorandum that envisions a future peace agreement between the two countries, Putin has said.

“We've agreed with the US president that Russia will propose and be ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a potential future peace agreement, defining such positions as the principles of the settlement and the timeframe for a potential conclusion of the peace agreement, including [the announcement of] a possible ceasefire for a certain period of time,” the president stated.

“I thanked the president of the United States for US support in resuming direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,” Putin stated.

Vladimir Putin has described the conversation with his US counterpart as “frank” and “quite  useful.” The phone call went on for over two hours, the Russian president has said.

The conversation between Trump and Putin has concluded, and the Russian president is speaking to the press.

Putin and Trump have already been talking for about two hours.

US President Donald Trump is expected to speak by telephone with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky shortly after finishing his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, multiple media reports suggest. Trump and Zelensky had also reportedly spoken briefly ahead of the call with Putin.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also confirmed that the Putin-Trump phone call is still underway, in comments to Russian journalist Pavel Zarubin.

The phone conversation between the two presidents is still going on, the New York Times has reported, citing White House officials.

During the call, Trump could potentially offer Putin unspecified “economic benefits” and the restoration of ties between Russia and the “rest of the world,” US Vice President J.D. Vance has said.

“The proposal from the United States has always been: Look, there are a lot of economic benefits to thawing relations between Russia and the rest of the world, but you're not going to get those benefits if you keep on killing a lot of innocent people,” Vance stated.

The conversation between Trump and Putin has begun, US media have reported, citing White House sources.

Finland will supply heavy ammunition to Kiev using proceeds from Russian assets which were frozen over the Ukraine conflict, the Defense Ministry said on Monday.

The move is part of a broader EU push to channel profits from immobilized Russian assets – which are primarily EU, US, and UK government bonds held in a Brussels-based securities depository – to fund Ukraine's military. Moscow considers the seizure of its assets “theft.”

Finland has struck a deal with the European Commission to send money through the European Peace Facility (EPF), the ministry said in a statement. Under the agreement, Finland will supply €90 million ($101 million) worth of heavy ammunition procured from domestic producers. The Finnish government said the deal will also benefit its defense industry. In March, Helsinki announced its 28th military aid package to Ukraine, worth around $225 million.

Western countries froze an estimated $300 billion worth of Russian sovereign funds following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Around $213 billion of this is held by Euroclear. The frozen funds have already accrued billions in interest, of which Euroclear transferred $1.63 billion to Kiev last July.

Russia has condemned the freezing of its assets, hinting at possible retaliatory measures against Western investments. Moscow has also warned against Western weapons deliveries to Ukraine, saying they only serve to prolong the conflict and heighten regional security threats.

According to Kiel Institute estimates, Kiev received over $363 billion in NATO aid as of February 2025.

A recent report by the Eurasia Observatory, which tracks the conflict's long-term impact on organized crime, suggests that a massive influx of Western-supplied weapons from Ukraine will hit Europe's black markets after the conflict with Russia is over.

The report stated that weapons, including heavy arms, are being stockpiled across Ukraine, and that once the conflict ends and martial law is lifted, reduced state control could create opportunities for organized crime.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has dismissed allegations from Romania that Moscow interfered in the second round of the country's presidential elections. In a statement on Monday, Zakharova pointed to the contentious nature of the vote in Romania, advising its officials to focus on “cleaning” their own reputation.

The diplomat was responding to claims by Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Andrei Tarnea, who alleged that there were “hallmarks of Russian interference” during the election.

On Sunday, pro-EU centrist Nicusor Dan was elected president of Romania, defeating conservative and Euroskeptic rival George Simion, who has accused France and Moldova of attempting to undermine his campaign.

Zakharova questioned the legitimacy of Romania's presidential vote, saying it should not be considered a proper election.

“You can't interfere in something like that – only get entangled in it,” Zakharova wrote on Telegram. “They shouldn't try to drag others into their electoral mess. They should clean it up themselves.”

The election followed the annulment of the previous vote, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu had led in the first round with 23% of the vote. Romania's Constitutional Court overturned the results, citing electoral irregularities and allegations of foreign interference, including claims of Russian involvement – accusations that Moscow has denied. Georgescu was subsequently barred from standing in the re-run.

Simion, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), has publicly backed Georgescu and appeared alongside him at a polling station on Sunday. He had earlier condemned the annulment of the 2024 election results as a “coup d'état” and said that, if elected, he would consider appointing Georgescu as prime minister.

Simion, who opposes military aid to Kiev and has been barred from visiting Ukraine, decisively swept the first round on May 4, securing 40%, while Dan and former Senator Crin Antonescu each garnered around 20%.

Dan is known as a staunchly pro-EU and pro-NATO candidate, and has called Romania's support for Ukraine vital for national security.

Ahead of the Sunday's runoff, Simion accused the pro-EU government in neighboring Moldova of attempting to rig the vote. The two countries share close historical and cultural links, with about 30% of Moldovans holding dual citizenship.

He claimed on Facebook that the country's voter rolls included 1.7 million fictitious names, alleging that many of them belong to people who are no longer alive.

Simion also alleged that voters were being bussed in from Moldova to cast ballots. He previously accused his opponent, Dan, of breaking the campaign silence rule by engaging in political activity on the eve of the vote.

Telegram founder Pavel Durov said in a post on Sunday that Nicolas Lerner, head of French foreign intelligence, had personally urged him to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of Romania's presidential election rerun. The Russian-born entrepreneur said he refused the request.

BUCHAREST, May 19. /TASS/. Independent pro-European candidate and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan received 53.93% of the votes after 99.4% of the ballots were counted, while his rival, the leader of the nationalist Alliance for the Union of Romanians George Simion, got 46.07%, the Permanent Electoral Authority reported.

Thus, Nicusor Dan became the fifth president of Romania after the fall of the totalitarian Ceausescu regime in 1989. Even before the results were fully summarized, the media announced him as the ""mathematical"" winner of the second round of the presidential election because he had received the necessary 50+1% of the vote after 92.4% of the votes had been counted.

Dan won a convincing victory among Romanians who voted in Romania, but lost to Simion among those who voted abroad. After counting 82% of ballots from the Romanian diaspora, Simion received 55.12% of the votes, while Dan got 44.88%.

Meanwhile, Dan won among Romanians in Russia and China, according to stiripesurse.ro. In Russia, where two polling stations were opened — in Moscow and Saint Petersburg — Dan received 58.65% of the votes, while Simion garnered 41.35%. The news outlet points out that only 115 Romanians voted in Russia. In China, Dan won 84.23% of the vote, while Simion won 15.77%. Dan also won the election among Romanians in Kazakhstan, Iran, India, Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan.

The Alliance for the Union of Romanians recognized Nicusor Dan's election victory. ""I would like to congratulate my opponent Nicusor Dan, he won the election,"" party leader George Simion said in a video posted on his Facebook (a social media site banned in Russia since it is owned by Meta corporation deemed extremist by the Russian authorities). ""This was the will of the Romanian people. I want to thank all the more than five million Romanians who put their trust in me,"" he emphasized. Earlier reports indicated that Simion had called for mass protests against the alleged vote rigging.

Dan has already received congratulations from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Moldovan President Maia Sandu, and Vladimir Zelensky.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

América Sánchez and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos died in the wreck that injured 22 other crew members

Mexico is grieving two cadets in the country's navy that were killed on Saturday when the tall training ship Cuauhtémoc crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge.

América Sánchez, 20, and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 23, died in the wreck that injured 22 other crew members, including three critically.

The body of Sánchez was scheduled to be transferred on Monday to the naval academy in her home state of Veracruz. She was in her final year as a navy cadet and was part of the international training cruise scheduled to visit 15 countries.

Sánchez's mother, Rocío Hernández, said her daughter was “exemplary” and “a dedicated student” who dreamed of becoming a naval engineer.

“She was a warrior, a soldier who didn't give up, who always fought for her goals,” Hernández said of her daughter, according to the BBC. She said that Mexico's navy would hold a private ceremony for her at the naval academy before she brings her home.

Meanwhile, friends and relatives of Maldonado have reportedly been paying their respects in San Mateo del Mar, a coastal town in the state of Oaxaca. His friends told local media he had dreamt of following in his father's footsteps in becoming a sailor.

An investigation into Saturday's crash remains ongoing. It could take a year.

Commercial water traffic in the vicinity of the wreck remained suspended on Monday.

According to New York police, the Cuauhtémoc – which had 277 people on board – lost power as it was departing New York Harbor for Iceland and was dragged toward the Brooklyn Bridge by the current. Its three masts measuring more than 157ft (48m) collided with the base of the bridge, whose clearance is around 41m (134.5ft).

The ship reportedly had a local harbor pilot – familiar with the conditions of the water there – and an area docking pilot helping guide the ship. At least one was onboard at the time of the crash.

Bystanders captured the moments the ship collided with the bridge, which collapsed all three of the ship's masts.

The ship left Acapulco, Mexico, on 6 April and was scheduled to stop in Aberdeen, Scotland, in July amid a global goodwill tour. The National Transportation Safety Board was scheduled to hold a news conference to provide updates on the investigation on Monday afternoon.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Thailand's Sawang Janpram, the oldest competitor at the World Masters Games at 105 years old, won two gold medals on Sunday in the men's javelin and 100m for the 100-plus age group.

He recorded a throw of 10.55m in the javelin and completed the 100m in 38.55 seconds, competing as the sole entrant in both events.

In a post-race interview, Sawang said he started exercising regularly at age 80, motivated by a close friend who became bedridden and by his daughter, whose health improved significantly through physical activity.

A former elementary-school principal and schoolteacher, Sawang said that he did not want to end up immobile like his friend.

He began competing internationally aged 97, and says the experience has improved his health and allowed him to connect with people worldwide.

“Next, I hope to compete in more countries and eventually become a world champion,” he said, adding that he began preparing for the Masters Games about two months ago.

He is also scheduled to compete in the discus and shot put.

Taiwan's own 88-year-old sprinter, Lin Pan Hsiu-yun, also claimed gold in the women's 100m in the 85-plus age group with a time of 27.10 seconds.

She said an earlier injury in the triple jump had sidelined her for years, but the World Masters Games reignited her passion for running.

The representative offices in Taiwan of eight nations yesterday issued a joint statement reiterating their support for Taiwan's meaningful engagement with the WHO and for Taipei's participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA).

The joint statement came as Taiwan has not received an invitation to this year's WHA, which started yesterday and runs until Tuesday next week. This year's meeting of the decisionmaking body of the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland, would be the ninth consecutive year Taiwan has been excluded.

The eight offices, which reaffirmed their support for Taiwan, are the British Office Taipei, the Australian Office Taipei, the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei, the Czech Economic and Cultural Office, the French Office in Taipei, the German Institute Taipei, the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association and the Lithuanian Trade Representative Office.

As a highly capable, engaged and responsible member of the global health community, Taiwan was invited to participate in the WHA as an observer from 2009 to 2016, the statement said.

The offices praised Taiwan for its distinct capabilities and methods, including its significant public health expertise, democratic governance and advanced technology, which would bring considerable value to the WHA's deliberations.

However, Taiwan remains largely excluded from the global international health system, the statement said.

“Taiwan's isolation from the WHA, the preeminent global health forum, is entirely unjustified,” it said. “This undermines inclusive global public health cooperation and security, which the world demands and which is enshrined in the founding documents of the WHO.”

“As COVID-19 and continued public health crises make plain, infectious diseases and health hazards do not respect borders. Global cooperation is required to keep the whole world safe,” it said.

The offices called for Taiwan's meaningful engagement in the WHO and participation in the WHA as an observer.

“Only by including Taiwan as an observer would the WHO be able to fully exemplify the health assembly's commitment to ‘One World for Health,'” the statement said.

In Geneva, representatives from 11 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies on Sunday attended a reception in support of Taiwan.

The attendees at the reception, hosted by Taiwan's representative office in Geneva, included representatives from all but one of Taiwan's 12 diplomatic allies, with the Holy See being the exception.

The Holy See is an observer, not a member, of the UN and rarely speaks on political issues during UN-related meetings.

At the reception, some representatives from Taiwan's allies spoke in strong support of Taiwan's efforts to participate in the WHA.

“I stand here today to affirm our commitment to you, our friends, that we will continue to do everything we can, in every WHA each year, to ensure that one day Taiwan will finally be given its place in the Assembly,” Palauan Vice President Raynold Oilouch said.

He also thanked Taiwan for helping to build Palau's health infrastructure.

Haitian Minister of Public Health and Population Bertrand Sinal also expressed similar sentiments, saying that Taiwan had contributed significantly to the health infrastructure in his nation.

Taiwan also provided crucial support after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, particularly with the operation of the National Ambulance Center, he said, adding that Taiwan is currently helping with public security in his country.

Haiti continues to stand in support of Taiwan's participation in international organizations, he said.

The Republic of China, Taiwan's official name, left the WHO in 1972 following a decision by UN members to expel “the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石),” and recognize instead the People's Republic of China as the only “legitimate representative of China.”

Since then, Taiwan has been unable to attend the WHA, even as an observer, due to pressure from China, except from 2009 to 2016, when relations with China were warmer under the then-Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government.

During an interview with the Plain Law Movement (法律白話文) podcast, Cho said that housing prices cannot be brought down overnight without affecting banks and mortgages.
Therefore, the government is focusing on providing more aid for young people by taking 3 to 5 percent of urban renewal projects and zone expropriations and using that land for social housing, he said.
Single people living in social housing who get married and become parents could obtain 50 percent more

Russia's war against Ukraine is waged not only with missiles and tanks, but with distorted myths — powerful narratives that romanticize empire, rewrite history, and embolden Russian soldiers to reduce once prosperous cities to rubble.

Those very same myths surfaced at the Photo London Festival from May 15 to 18, where the inclusion of Russian photographer and fashion designer Gosha Rubchinskiy's new book ""Victory Day"" sparked fierce backlash.

""The book is a non-partisan representation of post-Soviet military on Red Square,"" Rubchinskiy declared on May 14 in an Instagram post, adding that the photos ""serve as a deeply personal representation of the individual outside of ideology and propaganda.""

Though Rubchinskiy has long insisted that his work transcends politics, critics argue the photographer has been promoting pro-Russian propaganda through art and, in the case of ""Victory Day,"" aestheticizing a war founded on violent falsehoods.

""His work extensively uses Soviet and Russian nationalistic symbols, which is problematic because they are currently used to justify war crimes, torture, and the killing of civilian Ukrainians,"" Emine Ziyatdinova, a Ukrainian photographer of Crimean Tatar descent, told the Kyiv Independent. 

""As someone who is part of Russian society, it is nearly impossible (for Rubchinskiy) not to be aware of the semiotic connotations of these symbols and what they represent to the victims of these regimes.""

The black and white portraiture and ""architectural studies"" of Rubchinskiy's ""Victory Day"" were taken from 2018-2019, already half a decade into Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.

Rubchinskiy invokes in the photo book's description potent military symbols like Red Square and the World War II memorial in Volgograd — sites that are meant to reinforce the Russian state narrative of the country's military strength. 


""For the last three years of the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, multiple Ukrainian cultural figures, curators, politicians, historians, scholars, and artists have tried to show Western cultural institutions that Russian culture is political and aligned with Russian imperialistic ideas.""
    

In particular, Red Square is the location for Russia's largest Victory Day military parade, where during this year's commemoration, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Soviet soldiers ""of different ethnic backgrounds… will forever remain Russian soldiers in world history.""

Positioning the Allied Victory against the Nazis during World War II alongside the claim that it is somehow a book dedicated to ""over 20 years of Russian youth culture,"" Rubchinskiy also appears to imply that this Soviet imagery can be claimed by Russians alone, and not the millions of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs and other nationalities that fought and died serving in the Soviet army. 

""Victory Day"" was presented at the Photo London Festival by the exhibitor A/political, which says on its website that it prides itself on ""producing radical knowledge through cultural terror.""

""The presence of Gosha Rubchinskiy's work under the satirical title 'A/Political' at the London Photo Fair is yet another major disappointment and a clear example of the West's ongoing unwillingness to de-romanticize Russian aesthetics, which are rooted in military propaganda and oppression,"" Ukrainian photographer Daria Svertilova told the Kyiv Independent. 

""For the last three years of the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, multiple Ukrainian cultural figures, curators, politicians, historians, scholars, and artists have tried to show Western cultural institutions that Russian culture is political and aligned with Russian imperialistic ideas. After three years of continuous horrors perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine, one would think these issues should be self-evident — but unfortunately, they are not.""

Although ""Victory Day"" has yet to be widely released, an image displayed on Photo London's website depicts a young military conscript wearing the historic St. George Ribbon.

The black and orange ribbon has been a military decoration since the times of the Russian Empire and was later mainly associated with commemorating Eastern Front veterans of World War II. It has been banned in Ukraine since 2017 after becoming one of the main symbols of Russia's war of aggression.

The Soviet army played an important role in defeating Nazi Germany, but during that time it was also responsible for a number of massacres, as well as deportations and forced relocations — atrocities that the Soviet government systematically attempted to cover up. Under Putin, Russia has distorted the history of World War II even further by using the accomplishments of the Soviet army as a means to ""justify"" Russia's war against Ukraine, who they depict as Nazis.

""The Russian state and society failed to recognize the war crimes and genocide the Soviet Union committed during World War II,"" Ziyatdinova explained.

""The glorification of these symbols in this exhibition normalizes them together with the past and current war crimes, instead of questioning what the Soviet Union and Russian state have done wrong.""

At the time of this publication, neither the exhibitor A/political nor the Photo London Fair replied to the Kyiv Independent's request for comment. 

""Victory Day"" is not the first of Rubchinskiy's projects since 2014 that blur the line between art and pro-Russian propaganda.

His 2014 book ""Crimea/Kids"" is a romanticized portrayal of youth in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Promoting the book in the months leading up to Russia's illegal annexation, he was already speaking of the peninsula as Russian. 

""All these kids were born in a new country, and because of the internet, they feel the same as other young people in London, China, or Japan. That's why it's interesting for me to see how these young kids born in an informational context manage to keep this kind of Russian spirit, this Russian view on things,"" he told German media outlet 032c in January 2014.

Speaking to British magazine Dazed in September 2014, already several months after the illegal annexation, he called Crimea's youth movement ""a new Russia.""

For natives of the Crimean peninsula like Ziyatdinova, who cannot return home as long as the Russian occupation continues, the depoliticization of the occupation — during which people have been not only forced from their homes but also arbitrarily jailed for opposing it — is especially painful.

It is wrong to publish a book on Crimea ""with an emphasis on the Russian legacy on the peninsula, ignoring the ethnic persecutions, the military force and extensive propaganda used during the occupation,"" Ziyatdinova said.

""This book pretty much lies within the soft Russian propaganda claiming the newly occupied territories (as their own).""

Despite repeatedly claiming to be above politics, Rubchinskiy has occasionally let slip his belief that Russia suffers from biased media portrayal. In a 2018 article for British media outlet i-D, he lauded the World Cup for spotlighting Russia on the global stage.

""The World Cup is a unique reason to come to Russia and see what's going on here by your own eyes,"" he said. ""Sometimes you should check for yourself and decide your own feelings about things rather than believe other people's opinion from the media.""


Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine also became a launchpad for Rubchinskiy's fashion collection Duval, which he tweeted about on Feb. 25, 2022 — just one day after the war began. 
    

At this point — four years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and the unlawful annexation of Crimea — Ukrainian political prisoners, including filmmaker and writer Oleh Sentsov, were already suffering harsh conditions in Russian detention, with Sentsov declaring a hunger strike to coincide with the international sporting event to demand the release of all Ukrainians imprisoned by Russia. 

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine also became a launchpad for Rubchinskiy's fashion collection Duval, which he tweeted about on Feb. 25, 2022 — just one day after the full-scale war began. 

His one-word tweet, ""Duval,"" framed on the brand's website as ""a statement of rebellion against the war,"" turned a tragedy for millions of Ukrainians into the Russian fashion designer's personal branding. 

Such a move is part of the bigger issue which critics see with Rubchinskiy's work — namely, how it exploits post-Soviet trauma, repackaging collective pain as aesthetic currency.

""It is a space where pain, collapse, and violence experienced in the post-Soviet world are transformed into consumable images — rendered as aesthetic or nostalgic resources, easily instrumentalized,"" Ukrainian visual artist Yana Kononov explained in a post on Instagram on May 18.

""(Rubchinskiy's) work functions as a conduit for ideological slipperiness — capable of satisfying both authoritarian desire and Western taste for the 'critically charged'.""

In October of last year, just days before the U.S. presidential election, Head of the McCain Institute Evelyn Farkas told the Kyiv Independent that a Donald Trump victory would be the ""worst-case scenario"" for Ukraine.

In the months since, a victorious Trump has taken office, dismantled the global post-World War II security architecture, blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting Russia's full-scale invasion, and left Ukraine in limbo, all without securing a peace deal.

The Kyiv Independent sat down with Farkas at the Kyiv Security Forum on May 8 to ask her if that worst-case scenario had come true, or if there was still some hope left for Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent: When we last spoke, you said a Trump election victory was the ""worst-case scenario"" for Ukraine — are we now in it?

Evelyn Farkas: I imagined an administration that turned its back on Ukraine. And we aren't there yet.

It remains to be seen ultimately what position the United States takes. Our government has not clearly delineated — aside from saying that we want to make peace — what our position is on the definition of peace. 

It seems to me it's part of a negotiating strategy — where you don't tell anyone what you really want and you confuse everyone.

It's not a negotiation strategy that I would employ (but) it could potentially work. But it does, of course, make people nervous about what the ultimate objective is because it hasn't been clarified.

If the ultimate objective is not to support Ukraine, then that is the worst-case scenario because it means that Russia will not be stopped. 

Russia will then turn its aggressive attention to other neighboring states — first the ones that used to be part of the Soviet empire, and then it will threaten Europe, and ultimately the United States. 

The Kyiv Independent: Have you noticed a shift in rhetoric from the White House in recent weeks towards Russia?

Evelyn Farkas: As I've said all along, my view is to stay open-minded and give the administration the benefit of the doubt until they make some definitive statement one way or the other. Then we can judge it.


Vladimir Putin doesn't want an end to the war because it will likely mean the end of his political existence, if not his actual existence.
    

But right now, I am encouraged by the fact that the vice president and even the president have indicated impatience with Putin.

And maybe there's a dawning realization that in this world that Vladimir Putin is not stronger after Prigozhin marched on Moscow, and he's weaker economically, politically, militarily, and heavily dependent on China.

In this world, Vladimir Putin doesn't want an end to the war because it will likely mean the end of his political existence, if not his actual existence, because there will be a lot of angry veterans running around Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The Kyiv Independent: Why do you think it has taken the White House so long to realize this?

Evelyn Farkas: Probably because there are competing interests. There are those who really want to bring the war to an end and do it in a way that's sustainable, that looks like a victory for the president, not a defeat. Because there are some versions of a peace agreement that would look like a defeat for President Trump and for the United States.

And then there are others who are interested in making deals with the Russian elites, Putin and his oligarchs. And the people interested in making deals probably have the upper hand.

And so initially, at least, I think the impatience and the overwhelming desire to make business deals were impacting their diplomacy more in the beginning. 

And now it seems that the reality is becoming understood — you can't just go and make business deals. You can't just quickly make peace so you can make business deals. That's not going to work. 

The Kyiv Independent: How much has this peace process been driven by people's personal interests rather than America's interests? 

Evelyn Farkas: It's hard to say from the outside, but it is disconcerting to see a lack of a clear separation between the governance, the business of the American people, and the special interests of people working in the administration.

The Kyiv Independent: What do you think of U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff's performance? 

Evelyn Farkas: I think he was a peculiar choice because he's not a seasoned diplomat, and I don't really know whether he's a seasoned business deal broker either. 

And so he seems to have been enlisted to try to maybe charm Putin and entice him with some offers, perhaps business offers. But that hasn't worked.

The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that Witkoff was the one who was charmed? 

Evelyn Farkas: I can't say, I don't know him. Of course, he was repeating things the Kremlin told him, and we know that the Kremlin sells a bunch of propaganda and lies. 

So he was either charmed by them, or for some other reason, he felt like he needed to repeat their propaganda and really omit some of the truth when he spoke publicly.

The Kyiv Independent: Here in Ukraine, at some moments during Trump's term, it has seemed like the U.S. might not only abandon Ukraine, but outright betray it by giving Russia everything that it wants — was that felt by Ukraine supporters in the U.S.?

Evelyn Farkas: I think for pro-Ukraine people in the United States, there was a lot of concern around statements like 'Ukraine can't ever become part of NATO', that 'Crimea was always Russian.'

Those kinds of statements are a betrayal of Ukraine and its interests.

And frankly, they are a betrayal of our interests, because our interest is in stopping Putin's neo-imperial aggression, and getting a just, lasting peace for Ukraine.


""The American people feel very clearly that Ukraine was and is the victim, and Russia was and is the aggressor.
And that is not articulated clearly from the White House.""
    

So, yes, we were alarmed by those statements because they seemed to indicate that that was the private negotiating position of the administration. Again, not a lot has been made public.

And of course, when the issue of the Coalition of the Willing was raised by the Europeans, led by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the reaction from the White House was non-committal. And that's also disturbing because you can't have a deterrence of Putin, and that is to say, a lasting peace for Ukraine, without the United States military to back it up. 

The Kyiv Independent: Do you think Trump and Zelensky's relationship is OK now, or could we see it revert to a time similar to the infamous Oval Office showdown?

Evelyn Farkas: You can't rule it out. I was shocked by the treatment of President Zelensky in the White House. It was appalling.

I think a lot of it is tactics, although, of course, Trump (does) seem to have this preference for Russia over Ukraine that goes all the way back to the 80s when he visited Moscow.

The Kyiv Independent: What can Democrats do, if anything, right now to help Ukraine? 

Evelyn Farkas: Continue to work with Republicans who want to support Ukraine.

(Republican Senator) Lindsey Graham has a sanctions bill that has a veto-proof majority. There should be more efforts like that, more bipartisan legislation. 

The Democrats...  I wish sometimes they would be more honest about things that we did wrong, things that we might have done better, in order to actually give the Republicans an incentive to do more right now in Ukraine. 

Politicians rarely do that, though. 

And the last thing that they can do is continue to speak to their constituents. And then listen to their constituents, because there are a lot of constituents who care and who want America to do the right thing when it comes to Ukraine and other places in the world. 

The Kyiv Independent: Do you get the sense that American public opinion differs very wildly from the opinions that we get out of the White House on Ukraine? 

Evelyn Farkas: Yes. The polls show that there's still a majority of Americans in favor of supporting Ukraine.

But in the White House, it's unclear. And I think the American people feel very clearly that Ukraine was and is the victim, and Russia was and is the aggressor.

That is not articulated clearly from the White House.

Russian authorities have detained nine residents of Stavropol Krai, accusing them of plotting an attack on police officers during May 9 celebrations on behalf of a ""terrorist group,"" the Federal Security Service (FSB) said on May 19.

Eight of the detainees are minors, according to the Russian Investigative Committee.

A teenager from the Andropovsky district was accused of joining an unspecified ""international terrorist organization"" via the Telegram messaging app and recruiting eight other people, including seven teenagers aged between 14 and 16.

The FSB claimed that the detainees planned to attack police officers during the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, which Russia commemorates on May 9 with opulent military parades.

Russian authorities have managed to thwart the plot targeting a municipality in southwestern Stavropol Krai, the statement read. The suspects are in detention and awaiting trial.

Russia's claims could not be independently verified, as the country often uses its legal system and sham trials to oppress real or perceived opposition.

When the Liberal Party is in trouble, it sometimes recruits a former public servant to save the day. Prime Minister Mark Carney is just the latest example.

Mackenzie King was deputy labour minister and then minister of labour, before leading the Liberal Party from opposition (where it had been for a decade) to forming government in 1921.

Lester Pearson served as a diplomat for many years before taking on the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1958, which had been defeated in the 1957 federal election after 22 years in power. 

And as we all know, Mr. Carney was governor of the Bank of Canada and of England, later replacing Justin Trudeau at a time when the Liberal Party appeared certain of defeat, then taking it to victory on April 28.

“I feel it has much to do with the Liberal belief that it is the nation's natural governing party,” James Rusk, a former correspondent for The Globe and Mail, pointed out to me. “Hence, it naturally turns when in trouble to those who know something about governing.”

Pearson and Mr. Carney share much in common, starting with the vital importance of Canada-U.S. relations.

Mr. Pearson got along famously with John F. Kennedy. And things started well with Lyndon Johnson. The prime minister agreed, at the president's request, to send Canadian troops to Cyprus on a peacekeeping mission in 1964. The next year, the two governments signed the Auto Pact, which eventually led to today's integrated North American automotive sector.

But Pearson discovered that the relationship with a president can swiftly change. Johnson was furious when the prime minister proposed in a 1965 speech that the Americans consider pausing their bombing campaign in Vietnam. “You pissed on my rug,” he reportedly yelled at Pearson when the two were at Camp David, grabbing him by the lapels.

Mr. Carney's challenge as prime minister is to preserve the integrated automobile sector made possible by the Johnson-Pearson Auto Pact. President Donald Trump appears determined to relocate the Canadian and Mexican automotive sectors to the United States, while also proposing that Canada become an American state.

During a meeting at the White House earlier this month, relations seemed cordial, but Mr. Carney apparently made no progress in changing Mr. Trump's mind. Tariffs and counter-tariffs are now part of the relationship.

Both Pearson and Mr. Carney achieved international fame before becoming Liberal leader. The former famously won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957, after helping broker an end to the 1956 Suez Crisis. The latter was governor of the Bank of England during Brexit, when Britain withdrew from the European Union.

Each displayed a great deal of flexibility, to use a charitable word. As opposition leader, Pearson opposed acquiring nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft missiles from the United States, until it became clear that he could get elected by reversing that position, and so he did.

Mr. Carney is devoted to the cause of fighting global warming. Yet his first act as Prime Minister was to cancel the unpopular consumer carbon tax.

Each faced a divided country. Pearson grappled with a restless Quebec that was questioning what place, if any, it should have in Canada. Mr. Carney confronts deep levels of alienation among many people in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Pearson was opposed by a Western Conservative populist, John Diefenbaker. Mr. Carney is opposed by a Western Conservative populist, Pierre Poilievre.

The two men were quite different personally. Lester Pearson was good-humoured and lacking pretension. Mr. Carney was described in The Guardian in March as being charming and confident, but also possessing a “volcanic temper.” He appears quite sure – even full – of himself.

Pearson knew little about economics and cared even less, entrusting the nation's finances to his friend Walter Gordon. As finance minister, Gordon presided over a botched attempt at greater economic independence from the United States. Mr. Carney, with his PhD in economics from Oxford (a university Pearson attended as well), is seeking to preserve the integrated Canada-U.S. economy that Gordon tried to weaken.

The federal government balanced its books during the Pearson years. The Carney government aims to continue the deficits established by the government of Justin Trudeau, whose father Pierre was recruited by Pearson for Cabinet, and engineered to be his successor.

Pearson is regarded as one of Canada's most successful prime ministers, establishing public health care and pensions, while giving Canada the Maple Leaf flag. Mr. Carney's legacy remains to be discovered.

He should think himself grateful were he one day to be compared favourably with that other public servant who became prime minister.

In the coming week, the Republicans' battle to shape a measure that cuts both spending and taxes will take centre stage. The U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, on May 18.Annabelle Gordon/Reuters

In a profession that the American public considers full of low-lifes, there's a struggle under way over who has the high road.

That's the key question this week for Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, as they battle to produce the “big, beautiful” spending bill that President Donald Trump considers one of his highest priorities.

It's also the principal philosophical question for Democrats, without the White House power base for five of the past eight years and with minority status in Congress. They are engaged in a parallel struggle over how to get out of their post-Joe Biden funk and lure back from the GOP the blue-collar voters who were the nucleus of the New Deal coalition. 

Stymied late last week on deporting migrants by the Supreme Court he packed with three appointees – all of whom voted to halt his policy – Mr. Trump is looking for a big domestic victory to pair with what he considers the artful deals he made with his trip to the Middle East. That presidential voyage had more the air of a state governor's 1980s trade mission to Asia than earlier presidential visits to the Middle East by Republicans from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush, which generally were aimed at festering international issues and had underpinnings of diplomacy rather than commerce. 

In the coming week, the Republicans' battle to shape a measure that cuts both spending and taxes will take centre stage. The GOP battle of the deficit bulge will allow Democrats to stand aside for a rare pleasant moment and watch their partisan rivals tear each other apart over which Republicans are the purest on budget issues, which are the more loyal MAGA foot soldiers, and which have the more virtuous views of the purpose of political power itself.

Naturally, the political figures who are engaged in this triptych of tussle all think they have the high road, when in real life politicians regard the high road the way Robert Frost did in a beloved 1915 poem: The Road Not Taken.

“Claiming the high ground has a long, rich tradition,” Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, who has been in Congress for 49 years, said in an interview. “The Republicans have the high ground when they talk about rooting out waste and enhancing government efficiency, but when it comes to cutting student loans and slashing Medicaid they're on shaky ground with tens of millions across the country.”

This week it will be fight time – and showtime – on Capitol Hill. 

Even if, in a rare 10:00 meeting Sunday night, the House budget committee finesses the issues separating the Republicans, there likely will be a fight on the floor of the chamber.

The Republicans need 217 votes in the House. Though avoidance is a time-honoured, favoured political tactic, this chore cannot be avoided. Mr. Trump wants the House to pass a spending bill this week. It then must pass the Senate, where it will be tested by different GOP schisms.

The Republicans have 220 House members, meaning they can afford only three defections. More than double that number – an estimate, because it's impossible to know which lawmakers will bend and which won't – consider themselves “budget hawks.” They are resolute, for now, in demanding steep cuts in spending, especially in Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. Also at issue: the timing for implementing work requirements for Medicaid and the elimination of clean-energy tax credits, a priority in the oil belt. 

Passing a spending bill with these moving parts would be tough enough in ordinary circumstances. 

But this is a period when Republicans, now in thrall of the Trump notion that reform is an insufficient tactic when destruction of established political conventions and agencies is more meritorious, believe there is righteousness in rebellion. To many of them, the budget cuts in the package endorsed by the House leadership reflect their colleagues' timidity, are insufficiently deep, and are too protective of established precepts and programs. 

Then there is the President, who advocates deep program cuts but also deep tax cuts. He's not an old-time-religion anti-deficit evangelist. He's a preacher of the low-tax gospel.

The combination of all that makes compromise, in olden times the lubricant of legislation, odious – and thus elusive.

That's without adding the argument – gaining some support in a party seeking to consolidate its appeal to the poor and striving, once the heart of the Democrats' winning coalition – that cutting health care for the poor is bad politics, and also bad morals. That argument will be more prominent when the measure reaches the Senate.

The Democrats aren't immune to intraparty intransigence, even though it was Michelle Obama who coined the phrase “When they go low, we go high” at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

Their fight is whether to veer into the middle lane of American politics or to turn sharply left.

The left-leaning purists believe the high road (and a return to power of the Democrats) consists of protecting the poor, boosting the prospects of the middle class, supporting ethnic and gender minorities, and fighting the plutocrats and the oligarchs – a word suddenly prominent in the party – whom they believe Mr. Trump personifies.

The self-proclaimed realists, on the other hand, believe Americans are recoiling from the liberal orthodoxy and identity politics that have come to define the Democrats in this age. The disdain for Mr. Trump the two groups share isn't a strong enough bond to permit them to plot a road ahead.

No wonder a YouGov poll last month showed politicians more often are disliked than liked by Americans, with Democrats only slightly less disliked than Republicans. And, according to the Gallup Poll, three out of five Americans have very little or no confidence in Congress.

A statue of Britain's late Queen Victoria, outside Windsor Castle in Windsor, west of London on May 7, 2019.ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images

John Turley-Ewart is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail, a regulatory compliance consultant and a Canadian banking historian.

Monday, Victoria Day, is the past‘s shout-out to the present. The current moment makes that shout-out all the more poignant: A reminder from Victorian era Canadians that they forged a working federation while laying rails to hang an economy on. They were nation builders. 

Queen Victoria, whom the day honours, was a strong proponent of Confederation in 1867. She told a Canadian delegation she took the “deepest interest in it” because she believed it would make her North American provinces “great and prosperous.”

And such was the dream. By 1876 the Intercolonial Railway was in place, connecting the economies of the Maritimes, Ontario and Quebec. Treaties were being signed with Plains First Nations and Dominion Land Surveys were developed in Western Canada to divide land into parcels of one square mile for farming and inexpensive homesteads. 

Canada was a new frontier for investment. Capital flowed from Britain, new banks and insurance firms were founded. Immigrants were arriving. In November of 1885 the greatest infrastructure achievement of Victorian Canada was completed, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Using iron spikes, workers fastened a transcontinental economy to the land from the Atlantic to the Pacific. 

The work was hard, the idea of Canada caught people's imagination, but the gap between its promise and the economic reality gave reason for many to think Canada was a failed project. Despite completing the CPR, the economy wobbled, banks failed, and Ottawa's coffers ran low. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians moved south to the United States in the 1880s and early 1890s.

While Canada's current Liberal Prime Minister, Mark Carney, rightly said “never” to the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state in his recent visit to the White House, some Liberals in the late 1880s said “maybe” to the idea back then.

The union that Queen Victoria presided over, after all, was an alliance of strangers. There was little truck or trade between the three-and-a-half million people spread across a giant continent. Most provinces were more familiar with their U.S. neighbours than each other.

The appeal of late 19th-century America to Canadians of the time rings familiar today. Carnegie, Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Henry Ford – the billionaires of their day were the faces of a modern industrial economy that produced skyscrapers, the modern corporation, modern steel production, modern finance, the petroleum industry and the beginnings of the auto industry.

In contrast, Canada seemed a motley crew of regions that trains happened to roll through from time to time. The promise of a national economy was not a reality. 

What changed?

Investments that farmers in Ontario and Quebec were making in new equipment and farming methods to improve productivity in the late 1880s and 1890s began paying off as the 20th century approached. The result was bumper crops and bumper profits from sales to export markets that also spread to the Prairies. This reinforced the demand for new farm equipment, driving added manufacturing capacity and innovation in the process.

The knock-on effect could be seen in the growth of banking and the demand for engineers, lawyers and a professional managerial class. With more deposits coming from farmers in Ontario and Quebec, there was more capital to support larger, complex projects that continued to give momentum to productivity improvements, including two new national railways built between 1900 and 1912.

Mining for gold, silver and other minerals took off in Ontario and B.C. Developing efficient sources of energy, such as hydroelectric power in Ontario and Quebec helped electrify cities while making it easier to produce steel as well as pulp and paper.

Today, Canada is in the kind of economic ebb that tested the country in the late 1880s. If Canadians who built the economic foundations of Canada in the three decades after Confederation could speak, they would tell us that national infrastructure isn't enough. Building productive businesses is equally important if you want the prosperity Queen Victoria believed Canada was capable of.

Germany has tightened its border controls, turning away asylum seekers — but police say this can't last. Meanwhile, an Iraqi couple is on trial in Bavaria, accused of enslaving two Yazidi girls. Follow DW for the latest.

The German Police Union (GdP) is warning that intensified border checks and asylum rejections cannot go on much longer amid staff shortages and suspended training.

GdP chief Andreas Rosskopf said the measures rely on adjusted rosters, canceled leave, and paused training.

Over 1,000 riot police are currently deployed at the borders after Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt recently tightened controls, with turnbacks up by nearly a half.

Meanwhile, an Iraqi couple are on trial in Germany accused of enslaving and abusing two Yazidi girls.

Here's a roundup of top news stories from Germany on Monday, May 19.

 

A narrow majority of German residents support replacing the current daily working hours limit with a weekly cap, according to a new YouGov survey.

The poll, conducted for dpa, found that 38% of respondents are in favor of the proposed change, 20% are opposed, and 37% are neutral.

The proposal, part of the new German government's coalition agreement, would swap the existing eight-hour daily limit for a more flexible weekly model. Employees could then work longer hours on fewer days — for example, four 10-hour days instead of five eight-hour days.

Supporters cited flexibility as a key advantage. Of those in favor, 82% said the model would allow for longer weekends. About 44% also noted potential benefits for employers, who would no longer be restricted by the daily cap.

Critics voiced concerns about productivity and worker well-being. Two-thirds of opponents said productivity drops after eight hours, and 61% warned that longer shifts could overburden employees. Around 40% also feared reduced time for family and leisure.

When asked to choose between four 10-hour days and five eight-hour days for the same pay, 37% preferred the four-day week, while 28% opted to stick with the current model.

A manhunt is underway in Germany after a knife attack outside a bar in the western city of Bielefeld that left several people injured. 

A police spokeswoman in the North Rhine-Westphalian city says the search for the 35-year-old is ongoing. There are currently no new findings. None of the four seriously injured are in critical condition, the spokeswoman said.

According to investigators, the man is said to have randomly attacked revelers outside a bar in downtown Bielefeld with a knife early Sunday morning, injuring at least five people. He then managed to escape. The suspect, who is from Syria, reportedly left behind a bag that contained personal documents and a bottle containing a liquid that smelled of gasoline.

Police and the public prosecutor's office said they are investigating ""in all directions."" 

According to a report in the Bild newspaper, investigators believe it is likely that the suspect did not act spontaneously, but had planned an attack.

Five people between the ages of 22 and 27 were injured in the attack. Four of those attacked were considered seriously injured, one of them temporarily in critical condition. 

The German news agency dpa said the revelers were soccer fans after the city's Arminia Bielefeld soccer club won its match on Saturday to become third division champions.
 

Working women in Germany are more than four times more likely to work part-time than men, with nearly half of the female working-age population doing so.

The 49% part-time rate is compared to only 12% of men who are not working full-time.

By 2024, a total of 29% of the working population in Germany will have worked part-time, the Federal Statistical Office announced in Wiesbaden on Monday.

The employment rate for 15 to 64-year-olds was just over 77% last year. For men, the rate was 81%, around seven percentage points higher than for women, at 74%. 

The gap between men and women has narrowed significantly over the past 20 years: For example, the employment rate for women has increased by around 15 percentage points since 2005, from just over 59%. The increase for men was less pronounced at just under 10 percentage points.

German Labor Minister Bärbel Bas called for better working conditions for women in Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper over the weekend. ""Employers must shape the world of work so that more mothers can work full-time,"" she said.

An Iraqi man and his wife, both accused of being so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS) militant group members and enslaving two Yazidi girls, are set to appear in court in Germany.

The 43-year-old man and 29-year-old woman face charges at the Munich Higher Regional Court, including genocide, human trafficking, and crimes against humanity.

Prosecutors say that in 2015, the man bought a 5-year-old Yazidi girl as a dowry for his wife, at her request. The child was allegedly held captive by the couple in Iraq and Syria for over two years, during which she was subjected to forced labour, sexual abuse, humiliation, and torture.

In October 2017, the couple allegedly bought a second Yazidi girl, aged 12, who endured similar abuse. 

Both girls were later transferred to other IS members in November 2017. While the older girl was eventually freed after a ransom was paid, the fate of the younger child remains unknown.

The couple were arrested in Bavaria in April 2024 and have been in custody since.

IS aimed to establish a theocratic state under Sharia law during the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.

German prosecutors argue the couple's actions were part of IS's systematic rape of Yazidi women and girls — a strategy designed to dismantle the group's continuity and identity.

Germany has emerged as a key prosecutor of IS war crimes that took place in Iraq and Syria under the principle of universal jurisdiction.

Germany's intensified border checks and the rejection of asylum seekers cannot continue for much longer, the country's police union has warned.

Andreas Rosskopf cited a lack of personnel and the suspension of training programs as the main reasons.

Rosskopf, chairman of the German Police Union (GdP) police union, told the Funke Media Group in comments published Monday that the current measures were only sustainable because duty rosters had been adjusted, training sessions paused, and officers' overtime leave canceled.

""The police can only keep up these intensive checks for a few more weeks,"" Rosskopf said, noting that more than 1,000 riot police officers had been deployed in border areas for several days.

Shortly after taking office earlier this month, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt ordered stricter border controls, allowing authorities to turn back migrants even if they seek asylum.

According to Dobrindt, the number of people turned away has increased by nearly 50% since the changes were introduced.

Rosskopf said the union supports the government's efforts to reduce irregular migration through enhanced checks by the federal police.

Guten Tag and welcome to our coverage of developments in Germany on Monday, May 19, 2025.

Germany's enhanced border checks cannot go on for much longer, the country's major police union has warned. 

GdP police union chief Andreas Rosskopf says the measures are currently relying on temporary fixes, such as canceled leave and suspended training.

Germany's new Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt recently tightened controls as part of the new conservative-led coalition agreement to cut irregular migration.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","NATO corruption probe 'reminder' of defense boom risks","https://www.dw.com/en/nato-corruption-drones-defense-arms-procurement-ukraine-eu/a-72562793","Mon, 19 May 2025 04:36:26 GMT","

The military alliance's procurement agency is under scrutiny for deals on arms and munitions. In a sector with notoriously patchy oversight, defense boom corruption risks are very real.

Revelations of an unfolding corruption investigation involving staff and ex-staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) have continued to emerge, with a total of five detentions — two in Belgium and three in the Netherlands — made public so far.

The Belgian public prosecutor reported the first detentions late Wednesday, saying they concerned ""possible irregularities"" in contracts awarded to buy ammunition and drones via NATO.

The Belgian authorities said in a statement that NSPA employees or former employees in Luxembourg may have passed information to defense contractors. ""There are indications that money obtained from these illegal practices would have been laundered, partly by setting up consultancy companies.""

A short time later, Dutch authorities announced that they had made three arrests, including of one 58-year-old former Defense Ministry official whose previous job had ""involved international procurement contracts.""

In Luxembourg, the public prosecutor's office confirmed that documents had been seized in the Grand Duchy and said that the investigation had also spread into Italy, Spain and the US, coordinated by the EU justice agency Eurojust.

At the recent NATO meeting in Antalya, Turkey, the military alliance's secretary-general, Mark Rutte, told reporters that it was the agency itself that initiated investigations. ""We want to get to the root of this,"" Rutte said.

With a staff of more than 1,500 people, the NSPA is headquartered in Luxembourg and has sites in several other European countries. As well as providing logistics support for NATO operations or missions, it can also negotiate defense contracts on behalf of the member states.

Such joint procurement initiatives are supposed to save national governments money by efficiently bundling demand. According to NATO, the agency itself operates on a ""no-loss, no-profit"" basis.

Last year, the NSPA signed a nearly $700-million (€624 million) contract for Stinger anti-aircraft missiles on behalf of several member states. Former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced the deal in May 2024, without naming the countries involved, in comments reported by the Reuters news agency.

For defense expert Francesca Grandi of watchdog Transparency International, the ongoing NATO probe, whatever its outcome, is a ""precious reminder"" of the importance of thorough oversight of how public money is spent on defense. ""This case really is timely, in a way, because it reminds us of the importance of transparency.""

For NATO, the timing is somewhat unfortunate. Eyeballing Russia's massive military buildup amid its ongoing war with Ukraine, NATO countries are in the midst of a huge defense spending boom likely to last years.

At an upcoming NATO summit, under pressure from US President Donald Trump, the 32 countries look set to commit to spend at least 3.5% of their gross domestic product.

This would be a huge step up from the current target of 2%, as well as the current average proportional GDP expenditure of 2.7%. In 2024, the alliance collectively spent $1.3 trillion on defense, according to NATO figures published last month.

Meanwhile, the European Union, whose members make up two-thirds of NATO, is teeing up for a major spending spree. The European Commission has announced a plan to use the EU's excellent credit rating to borrow €150 billion ($168 billion) that could help the 27 EU members invest €800 billion more in defense.

With additional hundreds of billions set to flow to the defense industry in the next five years, public institutions will likely come under enormous pressure to manage risks of potential corruption.

Worldwide, the defense sector is particularly prone to corruption due to the high levels of secrecy that shroud governments contracts, the large amounts of money at stake and the sensitive nature of negotiations, Grandi explained.

Europe is no exception. At national and EU level, many of the transparency mechanisms that are supposed to help root out other public procurement processes often do not apply to defense and security.

For example, the European Parliament does not have its normal budgetary oversight over money sent to Ukraine for its defense needs through the European Peace Facility. More than €10 billion has already been allocated to Kyiv through the mechanism, which is outside the EU budget.

In general, Transparency International is very concerned about the lack of policymaker attention to transparency and oversight it sees in the burgeoning defense spending wave, Grandi said. At the same time, defense industry lobbying is on the rise.

""The risk from a lack of oversight is that we end up with a defense architecture that is not ensuring the security of its citizens as it should do, that is marred in inefficiencies, that wastes money, but also that creates space for abuse of power, for undue influence,"" she warned.

Putin said he agreed with Trump to work with Ukraine on memorandum on possible peace accord

Here are the main headlines on Russia's war in Ukraine on Monday, May 19:

We are getting more information on the remarks Russian President Vladimir Putin made to reporters about his phone call with US President Donald Trump.

Putin described the conversation with Trump as ""frank and meaningful."" 

""It was very informative and very open and overall, in my opinion, very useful,"" Putin told Russian media after the call, saying it lasted ""more than two hours.""

He said Russia was in favor of a ""peaceful settlement"" of its war in Ukraine. 

Putin said compromises would need to be found to suit both parties. 

""We have agreed with the president of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord, defining a number of positions, such as, for example, the principles of settlement, the timing of a possible peace agreement,"" Putin told reporters near the Black Sea resort of Sochi.

The phone call between US President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin has concluded.

It lasted over two hours, several Russian state-run news agencies reported. 

According to the Russian news agency RIA, Putin described the call as very informative and useful. Another Russian news agency, TASS, reported that Putin stated Russia and Ukraine must find compromises that are suitable for both sides.

Ahead of US President Donald Trump's call with his Russian counterpart, Vice President JD Vance said Trump is ""more than open"" to walking away from trying to end the war if he feels Vladimir Putin isn't serious about negotiation.

Vance said Trump would press Putin on whether he was serious about negotiating an end to the conflict.

""It takes two to tango,"" Vance said, adding, ""if Russia is not willing to do that, then we're eventually just going to have to say, this is not our war. It's Joe Biden's war, it's Vladimir Putin's war.""

When asked by a reporter whether Trump views Putin as a good guy or a bad guy, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US president ""has made his feelings about both sides of this war quite clear.""

""He wants to see it end,"" she added.

US President Donald Trump is speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine, the White House said. 

Following this conversation, Trump is scheduled to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In a statement released minutes before US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart were due to speak Moscow seemed to dash hopes for a quick breakthrough.

""There is quite a lot of painstaking work ahead, and in some areas it may be a long process,"" Kremilin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

He added that ""the settlement involves a large number of nuances that need to be discussed.""

Last week, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Istanbul for their first direct negotiations in nearly three years. However, the talks concluded without any agreement on halting hostilities.

Trump, who has long touted his credentials as a dealmaker, has pledged to end the war swiftly, a promise that is now facing a critical test. 

US President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak with his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, at this hour.

According to the White House, he will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy once his call with Putin concludes.

""He's grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday ahead of the call.

""He has made it clear to both sides that he wants to see a peaceful resolution and ceasefire as soon as possible.""

When asked whether Trump hopes to arrange an in-person meeting with the Russian leader, Leavitt said, ""the president would certainly be open to that.""

Separately, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were no current plans for a direct meeting between Putin and Trump.

Leavitt said the White House would make a readout of the calls available later in the day. 

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul spoke with his  Chinese counterpart Wang Yi about Russia's war in Ukraine. 

""Russia's war in Ukraine affects core European interests,"" German Foreign Ministry said after their phone call, adding: China has ""a responsibility for global peace."" 

The discussion was their first since Wadephul took over as foreign minister earlier this month. 

German government spokesman Christian Wagner said the call was focused on German-Chinese relations. 

Last week, Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in parliament on Wednesday that he was concerned about the ""growing closeness between Beijing and Moscow.""

Merz also called for ""de-risking,"" a term used to describe reducing dependence on China. 

Chinese media reported that Wang told Wadephul Monday that Berlin and Beijing should prevent the ""undermining of normal bilateral cooperation in the name of so-called 'de-risking.'""

The Kremlin said Monday that the phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump would start at 5 p.m. Moscow time (14:00 UTC).

Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, said Russia ""highly valued"" Trump's efforts for peace. 

""It is preferable to achieve our goals through political and diplomatic means, of course,"" Peskov added. 

Trump said when he first announced the call would take place, he would also speak with NATO leaders and Zelenskyy afterward. 

""The subjects of the call will be, stopping the 'bloodbath' that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, and trade,"" Trump had said. 

The call comes after the first direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in three years last week, although their meetings in Istanbul ended without a commitment to a ceasefire.

It's also seen as a test for Trump, who had long claimed on the campaign trail that he would quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House before his reelection.

Russia's prosecutor general outlawed Amnesty International Limited as a so-called undesirable organization. 

In a statement, the prosecutor general described Amnesty International Limited's London office as a ""center for the preparation of global Russophobic projects,"" and accused it of advocating for Ukraine.

Involvement with an ""undesirable organization"" is criminalized under a 2015 law. More than 200 entities, including US government-funded broadcaster RFE/RL and international environmental organization Greenpeace, are classified as such. 

Finland's Defense Ministry announced that it would fund ammunition for Ukraine using proceeds from frozen Russian assets.

The ammunition will be purchased from Finnish industry ""to boost employment at home and [send] to Ukraine to help its defense,"" said Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen.

""This is a great example of the Finnish defense industry's abilities, and it shows that our investments into ammunition production capacity are paying off,"" he said.

Finland, which borders Russia, has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. In light of Russia launching the war in February 2022, the Nordic country joined NATO after decades of military non-alignment.

A US delegation met with newly inaugurated Pope Leo XIV on Monday as Washington ups diplomatic efforts to halt the war in Ukraine. 

The Vatican said there was ""an exchange of views on some current international issues, calling for respect for humanitarian law and international law in areas of conflict and for a negotiated solution between the parties involved.""

Pope Leo had vowed ""every effort"" to help bring peace to Ukraine, while the Vatican offered to host any peace talks.

Vance spoke with some European leaders at Leo's inaugural mass on Sunday, and with Zelenskyy about possible sanctions against Russia.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Zelenskyy that a batch of US-made Abrams tanks are ""on their way"" to Ukraine, according to public broadcaster ABC. 

On Sunday, Zelenskyy met Albanese in Rome, where the two discussed defense support for Ukraine. 

""I'm grateful for Australia's comprehensive support, for the Abrams tanks that are helping our warriors defend Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said after their meeting. 

The delivery of the pledged tanks to Ukraine had been stalled due to reported US hesitation.  

In a separate report, ABC quoted unnamed US officials who were questioning whether the tanks were suitable for Ukraine's needs. 

The US had already sent 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine which were later deemed too difficult to operate without detection or were coming under attack in drone warfare. 

Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles on Monday said: ""We've been working very closely with Ukraine, very closely with the United States, to see this shipment occur and to see the tanks be on their way."" 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held a phone call with US President Donald Trump on Sunday. 

The four are also planning to have a follow-up call with Trump ""immediately"" after he speaks with Putin on Monday, the German government said. 

A spokesperson for the British government said the leaders also discussed possible sanctions on Russia if Moscow does not ""seriously agree"" to a ceasefire and peace talks. 

Macron wrote on social media that Putin ""must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire proposed by President Trump and backed by Ukraine and Europe."" The French president did not directly mention any talk of further sanctions on Russia. 

Trump had earlier said the call with Putin would include not only the war in Ukraine, but also trade.

This Monday we're keeping an eye on the scheduled phone call between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, after direct talks between Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy failed to materialize. 

Trump's vice president, JD Vance, is meeting with newly inaugurated Pope Leo XIV today. Ukraine is likely to be a topic on their agenda.

Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.

The former president's spokesman said Mr Biden was diagnosed after a small lump was found during a routine physical examination, and requires “further evaluation”.

“Last week, president Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,” he said.

“On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.”

He added: “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.

“The president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”

On Monday morning, Mr Biden posted an image of himself and Dr Jill Biden, which read: “Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learnt that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.”

Responding to the news, Donald Trump said: “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis.

“We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”

Kamala Harris, Mr Biden's former vice-president who took over as the Democratic candidate when he dropped out of the election, said she and her husband Doug Emhoff were “saddened” by the news of his diagnoses.

“Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery,” she said.

Sir Keir Starmer said he wished Mr Biden a “swift and successful treatment”.

The Prime Minister said: “I am very sorry to hear President Biden has prostate cancer.

“All the very best to Joe, his wife Jill and their family.”

The diagnosis comes after Mr Biden, 82, spent a day in hospital in Philadelphia last week after the lump was discovered.

Towards the end of his presidency, Mr Biden was plagued by allegations that he was not mentally or physically fit enough to serve another term.

A post shared by Kamala Harris (@kamalaharris)

He dropped out of the 2024 presidential election after a catastrophic debate with Mr Trump.

The former Democrat leader, the oldest-serving president in US history, was given a clear bill of health by his doctor last year.

In February last year, Dr Kevin O'Connor said there were “no new concerns” with the president's health.

“The president feels well, and this year's physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,” Dr O'Connor had said at the time.

Prostate cancers are given a score called a Gleason score that measures, on a scale of 1 to 10, how the cancerous cells look compared with normal cells.

Mr Biden's cancer has been given a Gleason score of 9, which means illness is classified as “high-grade”, according to Cancer Research UK.

When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones.

Metastasised cancer is much harder to treat than localised cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumours and completely root out the disease.

However, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Mr Biden's case, they can be susceptible to treatment that deprives the tumours of hormones.

In 2022, Mr Biden made a “cancer moonshot” one of his administration's priorities with the goal of halving the death rate of a disease that had killed his older son, Beau.

Mr Biden had kept a low profile since he left office in January but, in recent days, he rejected concerns about his age.

In their upcoming book Original Sin, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson alleged that aides shielded the public from the extent of Mr Biden's decline while serving as president.

According to the authors, the president at one stage forgot the name of actor George Clooney and was closely managed by his wife, who allegedly protected the president from criticism and finished his thoughts for him.

Mr Biden said the allegations were “wrong” and “there's nothing to sustain that”.

The explosive book has sparked a fresh wave of criticism from Democrats for initially seeking re-election despite concerns about his age.

Former Democrat representative Beto O'Rourke accused Mr Biden of having “failed this country in the most important job that he had”.

Long before the June presidential debate, polls showed the majority of Americans, including most Democrats, believed Mr Biden was too old to serve a second term.

“It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,” Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy told NBC News on Sunday, hours before Mr Biden's diagnosis was announced.

Barack Obama, the former US president, said: “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe.

“I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.”

Hillary Clinton said: “I'm thinking of the Bidens as they take on cancer, a disease they've done so much to try to spare other families from. Wishing you a speedy, full recovery.”

Tim Walz, Ms Harris's 2024 running mate, said Mr Biden was “a truly decent man and a friend” and he and his wife are “wishing him all the best”.

David Axelrod, Barack Obama's former adviser who called for Mr Biden to drop out of the election in 2023, said the diagnosis comes “at such a stressful time for president Biden” in light of the fresh allegations.

“The rehashing of all of that can't be pleasant for him, but this supersedes all of that obviously,” Mr Axelrod told CNN.

“Whatever your political persuasion, whatever your feelings are about how his career ended, whatever you think, this is a good and decent man who has served his country and we're all pulling for him.”

Eric Adams, the New York Mayor whose relationship with Mr Biden had become terse in recent years over the immigration crisis, wrote on X: “Just hearing the news of former President Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis.

“I hope all Americans join me in sending him and his family prayers as they navigate the road ahead with this medical team. We are all hoping for a speedy recovery.”

Pete Buttigieg, who was Mr Biden's transportation secretary, called the former president “a man of deep faith and extraordinary resilience”.

Rishi Sunak, the former prime minister, echoed Sir Keir's sentiments, wishing Mr Biden “all the best” on his treatment.

“So sorry to hear the news that President Biden has prostate cancer,” he said.

“Too many men are struck by this disease. We must continue to raise awareness of the danger it poses.”

A ruling in the attorney general's favor could affect 12 million permanent legal residents currently living in the US.

During an appellate court hearing last week, a lawyer for the Trump administration argued that Attorney General Pam Bondi has the authority to revoke a person's green card at any time, for any reason she sees fit — even if they have lived lawfully in the United States for decades. 

Department of Justice (DOJ) attorney Lindsay Murphy made the argument before a three-judge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday in a case involving Mohammad Qatanani, a Palestinian-born Muslim imam who has lived in New Jersey since the mid-1990s.

Qatanani initially applied for a green card in 1999, but was denied that status in 2006, after federal officials discovered that he had been arrested, detained, and tortured in 1993 by Israeli officials who claimed he had ties to Hamas. Qatanani has denied the allegations.

He appealed that decision and was granted permanent residence status in 2008, after which the government continued to appeal his legal right to live in the U.S. In 2020, an immigration judge ruled in his favor, but in 2021, the DOJ's Board of Immigration Appeals unilaterally reversed the ruling, rescinding his green card. Qatanani appealed that decision, prompting the hearing that was held last week.

Two of the judges on the panel seemed skeptical of the Trump administration's arguments, while the third judge, a Trump appointee, appeared open to them.

U.S. Circuit Judge Arianna Freeman inquired whether an attorney general could rescind a person's green card “even 10, 20 years later,” to which Murphy responded affirmatively.

“The regulation doesn't impose any time limit, so yes,” Murphy said, arguing that the attorney general, as head of the DOJ, has the authority to determine, on their own, whether to revoke green cards from immigrants like Qatanani.

Freeman questioned that rationale. “That's an extraordinary position for the government to be taking, don't you think?” Freeman said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Cheryl Ann Krause also criticized Murphy's argument.

“Don't we need some kind of principal limit if we're going to adopt the government's position here?” Krause asked. “What, if any, limit is there on the attorney general reviewing the adjustment of status going back 50 years?”

If a shift in policy like this is allowed, it could affect up to 12 million permanent legal residents currently living in the U.S.

Legal experts have similarly disputed the idea that the DOJ or the attorney general can revoke a green card unilaterally without granting a person their due process rights.

“The law contained within the Immigration and Nationality Act is clear. The Department of Homeland Security cannot unilaterally ‘revoke' a permanent resident's status,” Amelia Wilson, assistant professor of Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University, told Newsweek.

Wilson added that the government “bears the burden of proving by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the permanent resident should have their status taken away. At that point, it is the immigration judge — and only the immigration judge — who can effectively strip an individual of their green card.”

Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies must be tied to new subsidies that raise living standards for working and poor people.

The bad news on climate change is plentiful. For one, there is no sign of a decline in global carbon dioxide emissions and the Earth is getting hotter faster than ever before, despite constant pledges of government action. And now, of course, the second Trump administration is implementing policies that represent the biggest attack on nature, climate and people ever.

Yet, as world-renowned progressive political economist Robert Pollin shows in this exclusive interview with Truthout, there are also hopeful signs on the climate front. There is indeed an energy transition underway. Pollin also tackles the challenge that fracking represents, which is still widespread across the U.S. energy landscape, and the problem with the persistence of fossil fuel subsidies. In this context, he advances a concrete green transition program for phasing out fracking operations in the state of Pennsylvania and proposes alternative measures of support for working people and the poor to meet their energy needs.

Pollin is Distinguished University Professor of Economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He is the author of scores of books and academic articles, and was selected by Foreign Policy magazine as one of the “100 Leading Global Thinkers for 2013.” The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

C.J. Polychroniou: Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased by nearly 70 percent since 1990 and hit a record high of 37 billion tons in 2023. And now the Trump White House wants to increase oil and gas production, which is a further blow to the urgent task of rapidly reducing the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. Considering this, is it realistic to expect that CO2 emissions can be reduced by 45 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050? 

Robert Pollin: The goals of reducing global CO2 emissions by 45 percent relative to the 2010 level of about 33 billion tons and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 was first advanced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in a 2018 report called “Global Warming of 1.50C.” The IPCC is a UN agency focused on advancing credible research on all aspects of climate change, including, in particular, what we need to accomplish to stop the ever-deepening calamities resulting from rising average global temperatures, such as what we saw only a few months ago with the devastating fires that devoured major sections of Los Angeles. In this 2018 report initially, and in several subsequent studies, the IPCC has been making the case that achieving their 2030 and 2050 CO2 emission reduction targets was necessary to prevent the average global temperature from rising by more than 1.50 Celsius than the global average between 1850 and 1900 — i.e., the pre-industrial level.

Given that global CO2 emissions have not fallen at all since the 2018 IPCC report came out, it is clear that the world will not succeed in bringing emissions down from the current level of 37 billion to about 18 billion tons in the next 4.5 years. This was obvious even before Donald Trump returned to the White House in January and launched his campaign, as promised, to obliterate any and all policies, regulations or even any words in any federal government documents that in any way gesture toward a U.S. climate stabilization program. Thus, in February, The Guardian reported that, “The Trump administration is stripping away support for scientific research in the US and overseas that contains a word it finds particularly inconvenient: ‘climate.'” As just one follow-up in March, Lee Zeldin, Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator, pronounced that, “Yesterday was the most consequential day of deregulation in American history. …Today marks the death of the Green New Scam.”

And yet, even in the face of these assaults from Trump and company, we can still point to some positive developments on which we build.

First, while it is true that global CO2 emissions have not fallen since 2018, they also have risen only slightly since 2013, from 35 to 37 billion tons. This is while overall global economic activity — as measured by global GDP — has expanded by 31 percent. So there is some evidence emerging — absolutely too slowly to be sure, but emerging nonetheless — of global CO2 emissions decoupling from overall economic activity.

Second, the average costs of generating electricity from solar and wind power have plummeted since 2010, making them the low-cost alternatives, without subsidies, relative to fossil fuel energy. Thus, on average, generating electricity from onshore wind sites was 23 percent more expensive than fossil fuel alternatives in 2010, but was 67 percent cheaper in 2023. Electricity from solar panels was, on average, 414 percent more expensive than fossil fuel alternatives in 2010, but was 56 percent cheaper in 2023.

Moreover, global investments in renewable energy reached about $2 trillion in 2024. This was about equal to 2 percent of 2024 global GDP. According to my own estimates, and those of other researchers, we need to reach an annual clean energy investment level of about 2.5 percent of GDP per year, every year, to achieve a zero-emissions global economy by 2050. So, at least as of this past year, we have started to approach that necessary investment scale.

One of the most important components of this overall renewable investment expansion is that small-scale solar electricity installations — i.e., mini-grids — are growing rapidly in rural sub-Saharan Africa. This is where, at present, roughly 80 percent of the 680 million people throughout the globe still have no access to electricity.

Finally, within the U.S., clean energy investments were expanding rapidly while Joe Biden was still in office, induced in large part by the Biden-era programs such as the Inflation Reduction Act. Thus, even in West Virginia, a state that is very poor, still dependent on its fossil fuel industry, and deep red in its politics (Trump won West Virginia in 2024 with 70 percent of the vote), $5.3 billion had been committed by the time Biden left office to build a low-emissions steel mill; a battery storage equipment manufacturing facility; a renewable energy microgrid industrial site; a hybrid vehicle transaxle manufacturing plant; and multiple solar farms. Trumpite bluster aside, I am guessing that the people of West Virgina are not inclined to chase these projects out of the state, even allowing that the word “climate” is likely to slip into some of the documents supporting them.

Many countries across Europe have banned fracking, but hydraulic fracturing remains at the heart of the U.S. energy landscape. Even Kamala Harris opposed a fracking ban during her 2024 presidential campaign, after having supported a ban during her brief initial presidential run in 2019. How do we move away from fracking without disrupting the economies of those states that rely heavily on fracking operations?

Fracking is a technology used to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations, such as sandstone, limestone, or shale rock deposits. This technology is employed as a means of increasing the rate at which oil and gas can be extracted profitably from such rock formations. But fracking operations also generate severe environmental and health impacts through water and soil contamination as well as noise pollution. This is why five U.S. states have banned fracking (California, New York, Washington, Maryland and Vermont). But within the U.S., fracking operations continue in up to 30 other states, and are most extensive in Texas, Pennsylvania and North Dakota. In political terms, the case of Pennsylvania was most important for the 2024 election, since it was the largest and most important swing state over which Trump and Harris were competing for votes. The Harris campaign had obviously calculated that supporting a fracking ban was a strategic nonstarter, since they believed that a fracking ban would inflict major damage to Pennsylvania's economy.

In fact, the Pennsylvania economy would experience a major hit if fracking were banned and no large-scale alternative economic activities were introduced to substitute for the jobs and incomes that would be lost through shutting down fracking. But a fracking ban should not be understood as an isolated, one-off policy measure. It should rather be recognized as one component of a much larger green transition program, in Pennsylvania and everywhere else.

My own research with co-authors on this specific question of comparing the economic impacts of continuing with fracking versus advancing a green transition project in Pennsylvania produced the following major results:

Governments across the world continue to subsidize the production and consumption of fossil fuels, as you and co-authors show in a new extensive study. How large are global fossil fuel subsidies, and how should we understand the political economy of fossil fuel subsidies, given that there are obvious benefits in removing them? 

Fossil fuel subsidies constitute a massive obstacle to advancing a viable climate stabilization path, i.e., to reach zero global emissions by 2050. This is because they create perverse incentives, making it cheaper for consumers to continue purchasing oil, coal and natural gas to meet their energy needs and for producers to continue profiting off of selling the stuff. At the same time, fossil fuel subsidies represent a huge financial resource that could be mobilized to help pay for the transition to a global clean energy-dominant infrastructure. As of the most recent 2023 figures, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $1.1 trillion, equal to about 1 percent of global GDP. To put this figure in perspective, as noted above, I estimate that we need approximately 2.5 percent of global GDP per year devoted to clean energy investments to build a 100 percent clean energy, zero-emissions global economy by 2050. So, if we could transfer this 1 percent of global GDP out of subsidizing fossil fuels and into building a clean energy economy, those funds alone would cover roughly 40 percent of the entire funding level that is needed.

And yet, unfortunately, matters aren't quite so straightforward. In fact, it would be both undesirable and unrealistic to move all $1.1 trillion out of fossil fuel subsidies and into clean energy investments. This is because, in many countries, fossil fuel subsides provide critical support to low-income and working-class people, by reducing the costs these people must pay to meet their energy needs. As such, any workable program to phase out fossil fuel subsidies must also be committed to enacting alternative measures to maintain support for working people and the poor. Such alternative forms of support could include food, housing or cash subsidies. These alternative subsidies would have to be generous enough and maintained over time, so that, at a minimum, the overall living standards of working people and the poor would be defended when the fossil fuel subsidies are eliminated. Better still would be to make the alternative subsidies generous enough so that the living standards for working people and the poor would rise through the substitution of the alternative subsidies for fossil fuel subsidies.

In fact, in terms of providing the necessary money to support generous alternative subsidy measures, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies can release formidable levels of funds to both deliver generous alternative subsidies for working people and the poor, and to still provide large-scale funding for clean energy investments. This is because, by far, the largest beneficiaries of fossil fuel subsidies are high-income households and the fossil fuel corporations themselves — two groups who don't need or deserve such subsidy support but are nevertheless happy to pocket the money if governments continue to hand it to them.

I can illustrate this point by considering the case of Indonesia, which is one of the case studies we review in our study. As of the most recent 2023 data, total fossil fuel subsidies in Indonesia — including the funds received by both consumers and fossil fuel corporations — amounted to about $35 billion. This was equal to about 2.5 percent of Indonesia's 2023 GDP. Of the $35 billion total, we estimate that the poorest 10 percent of Indonesian households received an average of $110 in subsidies while the richest 10 percent received $1,248. That is, the richest 10 percent of Indonesian households received 11 times more support than the poorest 10 percent through the country's fossil fuel subsidy program. This massive disparity resulted because rich households spend much more money buying oil, coal, or natural gas than poor households, but all households — rich, poor, and those in between — are able to purchase all of their fossil fuel energy at reduced costs due to the country's subsidy program.

What if, as an alternative, all Indonesian households, at all income levels, received a cash, food or housing subsidy equal to what had been the fossil fuel subsidy amount received by the country's middle-income households? In that scenario, all Indonesian households would have received about $380. Subsidies for the poorest 10 percent of households would then have increased more than 300 percent. At the same time, under this alternative subsidy plan, Indonesia would still have freed up about $8 billion in funds that could then be channeled into building the country's clean energy infrastructure. This level of clean energy investments would amount to about a 500 percent increase over Indonesia's clean energy investment spending level for 2023.

The overall points that emerge from this Indonesia case are basically the same as with the program to eliminate fracking in Pennsylvania and establish a just transition program for the state's fossil fuel industry-dependent workers and communities. That is: 1) phasing out fossil fuel subsidies is an absolute imperative that must be accomplished as one centerpiece of a global climate stabilization program; and 2) for the fossil fuel phase-out to be accomplished according to any reasonable standard of social and economic justice, the overall project must include robust measures to defend and improve the living standards of working people and the poor.

GOP hardliners are reportedly pursuing an end to states' Medicaid expansions and an earlier start to work requirements.

Republicans pushed their massive reconciliation bill through the House Budget Committee late Sunday after striking a deal with GOP hardliners who tanked a vote on the package late last week, complaining that the measure's proposed cuts to Medicaid and other programs were not sufficiently aggressive.

The final vote on Sunday was 17-16, with the four Republicans who voted against the bill on Friday switching their votes to “present,” allowing the legislation to clear the committee.

Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one of the Republicans who switched his vote, said during Sunday's hearing that he is “excited about the changes we've made” — prompting Democratic committee members to ask, “What changes?”

“Do not be fooled,” Democratic Rep. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands said Sunday. “The ‘no' votes from certain Republicans on Friday were because the cuts were not fast or deep enough. In the back room, Republicans agreed to deeper and especially faster cuts to programs.”

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) wrote in a social media post after joining Norman in voting “present” that “after a great deal of work and engagement over the weekend,” the legislation “now will move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies under the green new scam” — a reference to clean energy tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Roy and other Republican hardliners are also reportedly pursuing changes that could force states to end their Medicaid expansions, which would strip coverage from millions and potentially kill tens of thousands of people per year.

In its current form, the Republican reconciliation bill would inflict the largest cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in U.S. history, slashing or eliminating benefits for millions by implementing strict work requirements and forcing many Medicaid recipients to pay more for coverage, among other changes — all while giving major tax breaks to the wealthy.

The legislation's Medicaid work requirements, which policy experts have condemned as cruel and ineffective, were slated to begin in 2029, but GOP hardliners want them to start immediately.

The changes sought by Roy, Norman, and other far-right Republicans must get through the House Rules Committee before the bill can reach the House floor. The GOP controls the panel, and both Roy and Norman are members.

Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said following Sunday's vote that “Republicans have spent months lying about their plan to make the largest cuts to healthcare and food assistance in American history.”

“Kicking 13.7 million people off their healthcare apparently wasn't enough for House Republicans,” Boyle added. “The only reason this vote passed tonight is because they've plotted behind closed doors to hurt even more families while refusing to share this backroom deal with the American people. This fight isn't over, and we're going to make sure every American knows exactly how they've been betrayed by Donald Trump and the Republican Party.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theepochtimes.com","Supreme Court Weighs Trump's Birthright Citizenship Challenge","https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-court-weighs-trumps-birthright-citizenship-challenge-5859161","Mon, 19 May 2025 10:57:33 GMT","

The United States' highest court this week seemed divided over whether lower court judges had overstepped their authority in blocking the Trump administration's attempts to limit birthright citizenship.

Federal judges had put a nationwide block on President Donald Trump's attempt to remove automatic citizenship status from children born in the United States to immigrants with noncitizen status.

The question at hand is whether the federal judges were allowed to do this. The Trump administration argues they do not, and have overstepped their jurisdiction in this matter.

The decision will also determine the limits of presidential power and whether a president can make such decisions, which will then determine the authority of judges in blocking Trump's agenda on a much broader level in other cases where he is facing legal challenges.

The United States' governance system is based on a series of checks and balances where the president enforces laws that Congress has made, and the Supreme Court interprets them and can even overrule them if it deems the laws unconstitutional.

Since Inauguration Day, Trump has signed 151 executive orders, which are directives by the president ordering the government to take specific actions. Their limitations, however, are that they cannot overrule existing federal law or statutes created by Congress.

President Joe Biden signed 162 executive orders during his term, and President Barack Obama signed 277 executive orders during his eight years of office. Trump signed a total of 220 during his entire first term.

Critics of Trump argue that he is overstepping his presidential authority on a number of decisions.

The president declared a national emergency on Jan. 20, vowing to solve the country's illegal immigration crisis and fulfilling one of his campaign promises to stop an “invasion” at the border.

Trump has vowed to end “birth tourism,” in which he says illegal immigrants are giving birth in this country so that the children will be U.S. citizens.

According to Pew Research Center, the illegal immigrant population was at a 15-year high of 11 million in 2022, while border encounters have been soaring in recent years.

U.S. southern border apprehensions reached a high of 370,883 in December 2023, before dropping in 2024, according to Customs and Border Protection data.

Then in 1898, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Wong Kim Ark, who was born in the United States but was denied reentry after leaving to visit China. The justices said a child born in the United States became a citizen at birth. This set the precedent for birthright citizenship.

Trump argues that the amendment was misinterpreted, and the act of birthright citizenship doesn't necessarily apply to all children born in the United States, particularly immigrants who entered unlawfully or people on a temporary visa.

The statement from the Constitution in question reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

The president has argued that the phrase “the jurisdiction thereof” should be interpreted as meaning that the person has sworn allegiance to the country, and to qualify, one parent would need to be a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident.

The United States is one of about 30 countries that currently offer automatic citizenship by birth. Neighbouring Canada and Mexico do the same.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

An early-morning crash has torn one family apart, Toronto police said Sunday as they announced three children had died in a collision allegedly caused by an impaired teen driver.

Police revealed details at a news conference hours after the crash, which took place shortly after midnight at the eastbound off-ramp at Renforth Drive and Highway 401.

Acting Insp. Baheer Sarbanandan said a 19-year-old driving a Dodge Caravan eastbound on the highway was allegedly speeding while exiting at Renforth Drive. The driver allegedly lost control, went over a raised median and collided with a Chrysler Pacifica minivan that was facing northbound while stopped at a red light.

This was “a tragic collision that took away three children's lives,” Sarbanandan said.

Inside the minivan were a mother, her four children and a male acquaintance of the family.

Sarbanandan said two of the children—a 15-year-old and 13-year-old—were pronounced dead at the scene.

A six-year-old was taken to a nearby hospital and declared dead some time later.

The 40-year-old man behind the wheel, a 35-year-old woman and a 10-year-old child are currently in hospital and are in stable condition. Their names were not immediately released.

Police said 19-year-old Ethan Lehouillier of Georgetown, Ont., was arrested at the scene and is facing 12 charges, including three counts of impaired driving causing death and three counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm.

“We educate the public of the dangers of drinking and driving and this is a result: a family is torn apart,” said Sarbanandan.

He added one person's decision to drive impaired wound up being “a fatal decision.”

Police are appealing to witnesses who saw the Dodge Caravan travelling eastbound on the 401 to come forward with information. They are also looking for dashcam footage, Sarbanandan said.

The crash comes nearly a decade after a comparable incident in September 2015 in which another impaired driver caused the deaths of three children and their grandfather.

On Sept. 27, 2015, Daniel Neville-Lake, 9, his brother Harrison, 5, and sister Milly, 2, and Gary Neville, 65, died after the crash in Vaughan, Ont. The children's grandmother and great-grandmother were also seriously injured.

Marco Muzzo was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2016 to four counts of impaired driving causing death and two of impaired driving causing bodily harm. He is also under a 12-year driving ban.

Muzzo was granted full parole in February 2021 and subjected to a number of conditions including that he stay out of Brampton, Ont., and the Regional Municipality of York.

Jennifer Neville-Lake, the children's mother, made a post of “grief and solidarity” with the victims of Sunday's crash in an afternoon Instagram post.

I'm heartbroken after hearing the news,“ she wrote in the caption to a photo depicting several pale yellow and blue packets of forget-me-not, sunflower and moonflower seeds. ”I am so so sorry.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Every year, illicit gold worth more than $30 billion flows across the globe, including gold originating in conflict zones and authoritarian states. Much of it is smuggled to gold-trading centers such as Dubai or Hong Kong before silently entering the global market. Unlike drug trafficking, the trade in illicit gold does not register to many in the West as an emergency because its primary victims are not in wealthy countries. But this trade is underwriting deadly crises around the world. It is financing both sides of the Sudanese civil war; the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela; transnational criminal networks, such as Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, which the United States recently designated a foreign terrorist organization; multiple armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and Russia's war in Ukraine.

Over the past decade, gold has nearly tripled in price, reaching record highs earlier this month. One can smuggle more than $1 million worth of gold in nothing more than a briefcase, and demand for it is always strong because, unlike critical minerals, gold is universally valuable. Illicit gold can also be melted and enter formal markets with gold that is legally mined. As a result, profiteers are searching for and extracting gold under worsening humanitarian and environmental conditions.

The illicit gold trade directly affects U.S. national security because it is fueling armed conflicts and transnational criminal enterprises. And because the gold is being laundered into global supply chains, it threatens global business risks for banks, tech companies, and jewelers. The United States, global financial institutions, various regulators, and U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom and the European Union have the capabilities to help curb this trade. They must use them.

These players should help the largest gold-trading centers, where most illicit gold is laundered—principally the United Arab Emirates but also China, India, Switzerland, and Turkey—reform. The UAE is of particular concern. In 2022, the country imported and refined an estimated 400 tons of smuggled gold before selling it on global markets. Banks and regulators may find willing local partners: some of the trading centers are facing financial hurdles as a result of smuggling and other money-laundering issues, and they want to increase their credibility in the global financial system. If they meet certain due diligence standards, banks and regulators should offer them financial incentives, including positive evaluations and memberships to global gold organizations, which would improve their reputation and increase their share of global trade.

The United States, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, should also work with the gold industry to establish and lead a public-private illicit gold initiative that can publish real-time data on the gold trade and independently monitor and certify trading centers. Rubio, together with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, should create an illicit-gold task force that can investigate and sanction gold-trafficking networks and exchange data on these networks with banks and refiners. In the absence of such measures, illicit gold will further infiltrate global markets and fund war and criminal gangs.

Although artisanally mined gold provides a livelihood for mining communities in many countries, many small-scale mines situated in conflict areas or authoritarian states frequently employ children as young as eight years old and damage the environment by using corrosive chemicals, including mercury and cyanide. Gold from such mines is then usually smuggled to neighboring countries for initial refining before being shipped or smuggled to a refinery in a global gold-trading center—most often Dubai or Hong Kong. There, it gets made into bars or jewelry and laundered into the world supply chain.

The massive scale of the global gold trade—more than $380 billion in 2024—makes illicit gold very valuable to the criminal groups and repressive regimes that sell and smuggle it and to the traders and refiners who buy it. As a result, illicit gold is increasingly a driver of war. In Sudan, for instance, where gold makes up 70 percent of exports, the ability of the country's warring factions to purchase weapons is heavily dependent on their procuring and selling illicit gold. That fact did not stop the UAE from importing $1 billion in Sudanese gold in 2023. The largest gold mine in Sudan is controlled by a company linked to the UAE's royal family. According to investigations by the United Nations and TheNew York Times, the UAE even provided weapons to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces—which the U.S. government determined has committed genocide in Sudan—in part to ensure access to the country's gold. Abu Dhabi denies this involvement.

Such trade also helps sustain the repressive regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which sold more than $1 billion of illicit gold to UAE companies in 2020. Armed groups in the region that commit human rights abuses and deforest the Amazon rainforest, including Tren de Aragua, also mine and traffic illegal gold to the tune of $2.2 billion per year.

Russia's involvement in the illicit gold trade spiked after many Western states sanctioned Russian gold following the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The measures have forced Russia, the world's second-largest producer of gold, to try to smuggle out its product and source additional gold from illicit sources, including both sides of the Sudan conflict. The UAE's imports of Russian gold—$2.5 billion in 2023—have fueled Moscow's war economy.

Gold also drives the escalating conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Congolese forces are fighting an insurgency by the Rwandan-backed M23 movement. In 2022, the Congolese and Emirati governments set up a de facto gold-trading monopoly in eastern Congo that was worth $1.9 billion and likely included trade in conflict gold, according to UN experts. This arrangement, however, cut out Rwanda, angering Kigali; afterward, M23 forces, armed by the Rwandan government and supported by up to 12,000 Rwandan troops, took over the swaths of eastern Congo that include its gold mines. Rwanda set up a refinery and exported a record $1.5 billion worth of gold in 2024, despite the fact that the country has nearly no domestic production. In 2024, Uganda, which also supports the M23, likewise exported a record $3.4 billion of gold, including gold from eastern Congo. The development group Swissaid estimates that between 32 percent and 41 percent of the gold produced in sub-Saharan Africa in 2022 may have been illicit—far above the global average. Nearly all the illicit gold exported from this region flows to the UAE.



Like many cash transactions, the illicit gold trade is insufficiently monitored by governments and industry. There is also no system for sharing real-time data on gold traffickers, meaning bodies that have the power to sanction entities moving illicit gold are often behind in tracking them. The only publicly available data on where gold is traded is two years old, by which time illicit gold has left its country of origin and been laundered into the global supply chain. These data gaps allow countries that have little or no domestic production to buy and sell illicit gold without consequence.

There have still been attempts to better regulate this trade. In 2012, for instance, the London Bullion Market Association, an international trade association for gold made up mainly of global banks and refiners, created a due diligence system to audit refineries for high-risk gold—or gold that may have been mined illegally or in a conflict zone—in their supply chains. There's a nascent auditing system for mines, too. Certain regions, including the Great Lakes region of Africa, have set up intergovernmental processes to certify whether mines are conflict free and devoid of child labor. In 2024, the private sector introduced a system by which refiners, miners, and industry associations can share data.

There have also been budding attempts to hamper the beneficiaries of smuggling. Beginning in 2020, the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force placed the UAE on its so-called gray list of higher-risk countries, in part because of the country's trade in illicit gold. This threatened to diminish the UAE's access to the global financial system; after Abu Dhabi heavily lobbied task-force countries and introduced a few reforms, the task force removed the UAE from its gray list. That same year, the London Bullion Market Association began pressuring the governments of international gold-trading centers—China, India, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UAE—to reform their gold-buying practices. This resulted in some changes. The UAE, for instance, passed a law requiring independent audits for its refiners, suspended 30 of them for not keeping proper records, and introduced a new corporate tax on gold dealers.

The United States and Europe have started to take slightly more aggressive action, too. The European Union has kept the UAE on its own gray list, marginally affecting the country's credit risks and capital flows. In 2024, the United Kingdom and the United States sanctioned a $300 million gold-laundering network operating in Hong Kong, Russia, and the UAE, and, earlier this year, also sanctioned a UAE-based conglomerate, which includes a gold company, for supporting the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces.

Although these measures are starting to produce some welcome changes, illicit gold continues to flow through trading centers, and the vast majority of illicit traders remain unimpeded. This is because the implementation of these measures is insufficient and uncoordinated and because there are not nearly enough concrete consequences—including sanctions or prosecutions—for illicit-gold traffickers and the refiners that purchase from them.

It is essential to address the illicit gold trade before it grows into an uncontrollable black market for criminals, traffickers, armed groups, and rogue regimes that threaten U.S. national security and the integrity of the global financial system. But key gold-trading centers have incentives to reform. These centers want full access to the global financial system. The Financial Action Task Force will reevaluate the UAE in 2026, creating an urgency for the Emiratis to curb the illicit-gold trade that takes place in their country. The task force should stringently examine Abu Dhabi's requirements for importers and bullion dealers bringing in gold from high-risk countries, perhaps by requiring a financial paper trail for all imported gold and the implementation of due diligence audits. It should also call to end cash-for-gold transactions above minimal amounts.

The trading centers also seek greater legitimacy in global gold markets in order to sell more gold and improve their international reputation, especially in the face of new refining competition in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Entities such as the London Bullion Market Association could provide these trading centers with benefits—such as accepting some of their refiners as members—if, for example, they adequately reformed and implemented their cash-for-gold and customs policies. If they failed to do so, they would instead be cut off from the association's market. In 2022, both the London Bullion Market Association and the World Gold Council launched a gold-bar integrity program that uses blockchain technology to make gold transactions more traceable. They could offer to include UAE-based refineries in their program if those facilities agreed to follow much stricter due diligence and transparency measures; this would open the refineries up to the London Bullion Market Association's massive market and help them gain prestige in the global gold trade.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has an important role to play, too, as a platform for governments, the private sector, and civil society to coordinate and share information on illicit gold. Banks and jewelers must also enhance their due diligence efforts by, for example, red-flagging gold exported from trading centers known to buy and sell illicit gold, banning cash transactions above small amounts, and requiring proof of payment for all gold imports as opposed to only certificates of origin, which are easy to fake.



When he was a senator, Rubio called the illicit gold trade a “direct threat” to U.S. national security because of how it was strengthening the Maduro regime and demanded that Washington choke it off. Now, as a central figure of the Trump administration, Rubio has an opportunity to do so. He should help lead a public-private illicit gold initiative, partnering with the London Bullion Market Association, the World Gold Council, bullion and central banks, and allies such as the United Kingdom and the EU. The resulting entity should publish real-time data related to the gold trade, which would help curb smuggling by allowing banks and refiners to instantaneously cut off high-risk illicit gold,independently monitor trade centers to catch smugglers, and certify relevant centers as conflict free. The U.S. government should work with the customs department of the UAE, the government of which is already a strategic partner, to identify gold-smuggling patterns and companies and help indict and prosecute bad actors.

Rubio and Bessent should also establish a U.S. government illicit-gold task force to investigate and sanction gold-trafficking networks. Recent sanctions against such networks, including British and U.S. sanctions against UAE-based companies and EU sanctions against a Rwandan refinery, are a good start, but to have a global effect these sanctions must be more far-reaching and coordinated. As part of the task force, the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network could issue alerts, exchange information with banks and refiners to stay updated on traffickers, and encourage trading entities to file reports on suspicious transactions. The State Department could also encourage shippers and jewelers to share any information they may have on smuggling networks.

Rogue actors are increasingly profiting from illicit gold. But if the U.S. government works together with industry and key allies, it can help end this deadly trade and bolster its own security interests. Targeting the system's pinch points—refineries, trading centers, and the governments that allow illicit trade—is the place to start.

DANIEL WALDENSTROM is Professor of Economics at IFN Stockholm and the author of Richer and More Equal: A New History of Wealth in the West.

 Daniel Waldenstrom

Spend a few minutes browsing political commentary or scrolling social media and you will discover a seemingly settled truth: inequality in the West is soaring, the middle class is being hollowed out, and democracies stand on the brink of oligarchy. The idea is seductive because it fits everyday anxieties in many Western countries—housing has grown increasingly unaffordable, billionaire wealth mushrooms unfathomably, and the pandemic exposed yawning gaps in social safety nets. Yet the most influential claims about inequality rest on selective readings of history and partial measurements of living standards. When the full balance sheet of modern economies is tallied—including taxes, transfers, pension entitlements, homeownership, and the fact that people move through income brackets across their lives—the story looks markedly different. Western societies are not nearly as unequal as many believe them to be.

This is not a call for complacency. Concentrated economic power can distort markets and politics; pockets of deep poverty persist in rich countries; and in the United States, the top of the distribution has indeed sprinted ahead of the rest. But focusing only on the eye-catching fortunes of tech founders or hedge-fund managers obscures a quieter, broader transformation: households across the income spectrum now own capital on a scale unimaginable to earlier generations, and basic measures of well-being in Western societies—including life expectancy, educational attainment, and consumption possibilities—have improved for nearly everyone.

Getting the facts right matters because bad diagnosis breeds bad prescriptions. If governments assume that capitalism is inexorably recreating the disparities of the Gilded Age, they will reach for wealth confiscations, price controls, or ever-larger public sectors funded by fragile tax bases. If, instead, the evidence shows that free-market economies have enriched middle classes by expanding asset ownership, that entrepreneurs' fortunes are associated with advances shared with the broader public, and that much of the post-1980 rise in recorded inequality reflects methodological quirks, then a different agenda follows: states should encourage ambition, protect competition, widen access to wealth-building, and ensure that public services complement—not smother—private prosperity. In short, before treating inequality as an existential crisis, it is worth double-checking the thermometer.

The prevailing narrative about inequality—popularized by the economist Thomas Piketty in his bestselling 2014 book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century—depicts a U-shaped curve. In this view, the extreme concentration of income and wealth among a narrow elite in the early twentieth century was broken only by the world wars and taxes on capital. The turn toward market liberalization around 1980 unleashed a second wave of plutocracy. Charts of top-income shares appear to confirm the story: since 1980, the top one percent's slice of pretax income has surged, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. Add the proliferation of celebrity billionaires, the stagnation of median wages, and the eruption of high-profile corporate scandals, and the picture seems complete.

Three kinds of evidence underpin this interpretation. First are tax-return data that track pretax market income: salaries, dividends, and realized capital gains. These show widening gaps because high earners captured disproportionate gains from globalization and digital technology. Second are surveys of household wealth that measure who owns stocks and real estate; when asset prices boom, wealthy portfolios balloon. Third are particular statistics that make headlines—the many CEOs paid hundreds of times more than average workers, or the eight men who together are richer than half the world—and feed public outrage.

But such evidence has limits. Starting the clock in 1980 is rhetorically convenient because inequality was then unusually low, following decades of steep taxation and stringent regulation that had dampened entrepreneurship and curtailed many ambitious career paths. Today's levels, although higher than those of the late 1970s, are far below those of the pre–World War II era when taxes were much lower than they are today. In addition, most estimates of income inequality have actually plateaued in the last two decades. Likewise, focusing on pretax income ignores the consequences of progressive taxation and, crucially, the vast public spending on health care, education, and pensions that disproportionately benefits lower- and middle-income households. Finally, wealth surveys often exclude mandatory pension assets and undercount owner-occupied housing—the two largest stores of middle-class wealth.

Recent work on U.S. income distribution by the tax economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter shows that correcting for underreported income at the bottom, income shifted into tax-deferred retirement accounts, and welfare transfers flattens the trend dramatically: in the United States, the top one percent's share of after-tax income is only slightly higher today than it was in 1960, nowhere near the doubling implied by estimates presented by Piketty and his co-authors. Europe's picture is flatter still, thanks to heavier redistribution and less winner-take-all compensation at the top of the corporate ladder.

The canonical data tell only part of the story, and the least flattering part at that. A growing body of scholarship reassesses the long-run distribution of wealth by adding what earlier studies neglected. Three findings stand out.

First, private wealth has exploded—but so has broad ownership of it. Reconstructed national balance sheets for France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States show real per-adult wealth roughly tripling since 1980 and rising more than sevenfold since 1950. Crucially, an increasing share of that capital sits in the homes and pension funds of ordinary households. In 1900, assets held by the elite—agricultural domains and shares in industrial or financial corporations—dominated; today, residential property and funded retirement accounts represent the majority of private assets. That shift parallels mass homeownership: in most Western countries, 60 to 70 percent of households now own the roof over their heads—an equity stake unavailable to their great-grandparents. Most workers hold pension claims in mutual funds or index funds, granting them the high returns of stock markets at low risk—what amounts to financial democratization.

Second, wealth concentration has fallen—not risen—over the past century. In Europe, the top one percent now owns barely a third of the share it held in 1910, right before the beginning of the transformative era of world wars, democratization, and the growth of governmental capacity, and since the 1970s that share has been essentially flat, even as real wealth—that is, wealth adjusted for inflation—has tripled with rising asset prices. The United States shows a clearer uptick beginning in the 1970s, most visible among the spectacular fortunes of tech and finance titans, whose gains have outpaced even the impressive wealth growth of the middle class. Yet U.S. concentration remains closer to its 1960 level than to its pre-1914 peak. The dominant quantitative fact of the century, therefore, is not a new Gilded Age but a dramatic wealth equalization propelled by mass asset ownership.





Third, the fact that people move through different income brackets over the course of their lives should temper typical measures of inequality. So, too, should the effects of welfare payments. Annual snapshots lump graduate students with retirees living off savings, making income and wealth gaps appear wider than lifetime consumption gaps. When studies in different countries instead follow individuals over time, they typically find that within only a few years, half the households in the bottom income decile have climbed to higher levels. Many top-decile households can drop to lower rungs of the ladder after business or investment setbacks. Government welfare programs further compress differences. In Sweden, when public pension entitlements are capitalized and added to assessments of personal wealth, this alone cuts the measured wealth inequality—known as the Gini coefficient—by almost half. In the United States, the market's redistributive role is smaller, but when Social Security, Medicare, and employer-provided health insurance are treated as in-kind income, median households fare far better than raw wage data suggest.

These facts undermine the image of an inexorably widening chasm between a plutocratic elite and the rest. Yes, superstar entrepreneurs have amassed fortunes measured in tens of billions. But that outcome signals success, not failure: they furnished goods and services that millions freely bought. Their booming companies also supply jobs, higher wage earnings, and substantial tax revenue—directly through profits and payrolls and indirectly by raising the broader tax base. Over the past four decades, life expectancy in advanced economies (including in the United States despite the much-noted increase in “deaths of despair”) rose roughly six years, high school completion became nearly universal, and personal computers once reserved for elites went mainstream.

Those who typically bemoan the rise of inequality don't correctly weigh the size and division of the pie. Rising real incomes and higher asset values are preconditions for mass prosperity and for a well-funded public sector. Even advocates of government intervention should champion efficient growth: every percentage point of GDP adds billions to tax revenue. The West's most durable path to fairness, then, is to scale up the channels through which ordinary households acquire assets—including affordable housing supply, portable retirement accounts, and low-fee index funds—and to keep markets open so new firms can challenge incumbents.

That perspective should also moderate calls for annual taxes on the stock of net wealth, which have recently been proposed by some politicians and researchers, and have even been discussed officially at G-20 and UN meetings. These so-called wealth taxes are problematic because they hit illiquid assets, forcing entrepreneurs or farmers to borrow or liquidate. Scandinavian experience of such taxes shows that they produce meager revenues, come with high administrative costs, and encourage capital flight. If capital is to be taxed, a more efficient and equitable way is to tax capital income—such as dividends, realized gains, and corporate profits.

Misreading inequality courts several risks. It diverts energy from the real challenges to Western economies, which include lax productivity growth, aging populations, and the imperatives of climate adaptation. These problems will strain public budgets. But excessive state-centrism and confiscatory wealth taxes impede capital formation and make financing those tasks harder, not easier. Misunderstanding inequality also breeds regressivity: taxing housing wealth indiscriminately can hit asset-rich but cash-poor retirees; taxing private firms can force sales to multinational giants with cheaper credit. And it corrodes trust: when citizens hear that capitalism benefits only the elite—even as their own living standards rise—they may grow cynical about official statistics and susceptible to populist cures worse than the disease.

A more accurate reading of the data supports a balanced agenda. To be clear, excessive wealth concentration poses risks—most notably to political integrity. Transparent rules for campaign financing and party contributions are essential to minimize the undue influence of money. Core welfare services, such as education and health care, should not become overly dependent on private funding, otherwise they would tie the quality of care to personal wealth—and in the process deepen inequality. The solution is not to curb wealth itself but to safeguard the integrity of political institutions and ensure equitable access to public goods.

States should celebrate entrepreneurial success and foster competition by reducing regulatory burdens—especially those that disproportionately affect smaller and younger firms. Taxation on labor income should be modest enough to incentivize hard work and also allow for the accumulation of new wealth, while capital taxation should target income rather than wealth or inheritances. Public investment should focus on building the capabilities that let households become stakeholders—education, infrastructure, and a rules-based climate that rewards risk-taking. Such an agenda accepts that inequality can coexist with, and even flow from, broad prosperity. Frustration with privilege should be channeled into reforms that expand opportunity rather than cap success.

This agenda advances neither laissez-faire complacency nor egalitarian maximalism. It is an acknowledgment that the West's most remarkable achievement is not the fortune of a Jeff Bezos or Bernard Arnault but the mundane riches enjoyed by millions whose grandparents lived without antibiotics, central heating, or college degrees. Policymakers would do well to remember that progress before they diagnose calamity—and nurture the conditions that make it possible: secure property rights, open markets, and an efficient public sector powered by the very economic growth its advocates sometimes disparage.

            China announced anti-dumping duties as high as 74.9% Sunday on imports of POM copolymers, a type of engineering plastic, from the United States, the European Union, Japan and Taiwan.
    


            The Commerce Ministry's findings conclude a probe launched in May 2024, shortly after the US sharply increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, computer chips and other imports.
    


            POM copolymers can partially replace metals such as copper and zinc and have various applications including in auto parts, electronics and medical equipment, the ministry has said.
    


            In January, the ministry said initial investigations had determined that dumping was taking place and implemented preliminary anti-dumping measures in the form of a deposit starting from January 24.
    


            According to Sunday's announcement, the highest anti-dumping rate of 74.9% was levied on imports from the United States, while European shipments will face a 34.5% duty.
    


            China slapped 35.5% duties on Japanese imports, except for Asahi Kasei Corp, which received a company-specific rate of 24.5%. A general duty of 32.6% was placed on imports from Taiwan, while Formosa Plastics received a 4% tariff and Polyplastics Taiwan 3.8%.
    


            Hopes have risen that the US-China trade war is easing after the two sides said they had agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs in a 90-day truce, a deal that state mouthpiece the Global Times said on Friday should be extended.
    


            The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group of nations warned of “fundamental challenges” facing the global trading system in a communique on Friday after a meeting in South Korea.

Bullying only leads to self-isolation, Xi says day after US-China tariff truce



            On Monday, Asian shares slipped as a mixed bag of Chinese economic data showed the domestic economy was struggling even as US tariffs began to bite into exports. Growth in China's industrial output and retail sales slowed in April, as a trade war threatened to dampen momentum in the world's second-largest economy.
    


            However, the impact of tariffs on China's economic activity has yet to cause significant pain, as industrial output fared better than economists' expectations and unemployment eased.
    


            Industrial output in April grew 6.1% from a year earlier, slowing from 7.7% growth in March, official data showed. The data released by the National Bureau of Statistics surpassed expectations for a 5.5% increase in a Reuters poll of 24 analysts.
    


            Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 5.1% in April, slowing from a 5.9% increase in March. Economists had expected retail sales to grow 5.5%.
    


            Fixed asset investment expanded 4.0% in the first four months of 2025 from the same period a year earlier, compared with expectations for a 4.2% rise. It grew 4.2% in the first quarter.
    


            Property investment fell 10.3% in the first four months of 2025 from a year earlier, following a drop of 9.9% in the first quarter, official data showed. Property sales by floor area shrank 2.8% in January-April from the previous year, after declining 3.0% in the first three months. New construction starts measured by floor area were down 23.8%, versus a 24.4% slump in January-March.

Follow:


            It was at this very tournament a year ago, Scottie Scheffler made national headlines following his arrest.
    


            A year later, the World No. 1 won his first PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, trading in a mugshot and a jail cell for the famous Wanamaker Trophy.
    


            He finished Sunday's final round at 11-under par, five strokes ahead of Bryson DeChambeau, Davis Riley and Harris English.
    


            Despite bogeying on the final hole, Scheffler celebrated by spiking his hat on the ground, embracing his caddie, Ted Scott, and then quickly found his wife, Meredith, and son in the crowd.
    


            It is the 28-year-old Scheffler's third career major win with the first two coming at the Masters in 2022 and 2024.
    


            Scheffler told CNN he felt “a little on the ropes” on the front nine.
    


            “This golf course will keep you on your toes,” Scheffler said. “It was weird because at 7, 8, 9, I felt like I hit really good tee shots. And I looked up and it was 30 yards left where I was looking which was a bit unsual. Making the turn, I kind of squared my shoulders up and I hit a really good tee ball at 10, a really good tee ball at 11. After that, I did a really good job at executing on a lot of fairways, a lot of greens. Played a really good nine holes when I really needed too.”
    


            Scheffler added that it was ‘really hard to put into words” when asked by CNN's Patrick Snell to reflect on his journey from his first major win, to becoming father and now winning his third major.
    


            You know (Meredith) and I were talking this morning, we still feel like we're in high school. I feel like we're in high school yesterday. We just started dating and all of a sudden you know life out here is pretty cool right now,” Scheffler said.
    


            “This is a lot of fun. But at the end of the day life at home for us is pretty much the same. You know we have a pretty good little life and we have great friends at home and I'm looking forward to getting home and celebrating with them.”
    


            Scheffler also joins Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus as the only players to win three career majors and 15 PGA Tour titles.
    


            The 2025 season did not start off too kindly for Scheffler.
    


            A self-described “stupid” Christmas day injury resulted in surgery on his hand, forcing him to delay the start of his season.
    


            Scheffler would make his season debut in late January at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in Northern California. He would then go winless until two weeks ago, when he took home a victory at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson at TPC Craig Ranch in McKinney, Texas.
    


            Scheffler joined Seve Ballesteros as the only golfers in the past 100 years to win each of his first three majors by more than three strokes.
    


            But it wasn't an easy round for world's best.
    


            Scheffler came into the fourth and final round with a three-stroke lead but after three bogeys in the front nine, his lead quickly disappeared.
    


            LIV Golf star Jon Rahm surged ahead of him, with the Spaniard looking to win his third major.
    


            However, the 2021 US Open and 2023 Masters winner, completely faltered in the back nine especially on Quail Hollow's infamous Green Mile where he bogeyed once and double-bogeyed twice to fall to 2-over par on the day and a tie for 8th place.

            As Rahm fell, Scheffler arose past his early struggles, sinking back-to-back birdies on holes 14 and 15 to reclaim the lead and never looked back.
    


            The 30-year-old, former Arizona State Sun Devil Rahm, said this was a position he has never been in when asked how he would “heal” from this.
    


            “I think it's the first time I've been in position to win a major that close and haven't done it. The only times I think I've been in the lead in a major on a Sunday, I've been able to close it out, and this is a very different situation,” Rahm told reporters after the round.
    


            “So I don't know exactly. But if it's ever a time, that's what family's for is the best. Luckily I'm going to get home maybe on time to get the kids to bed or not, I'm not sure. To them, whatever I did today, win or lose, they don't care. So that's always a good perspective. … But I just need to get over it, get over myself. It's not the end of the world. It's not like I'm a doctor or a first responder, where somebody if they have a bad day, truly bad things happen. I'll get over it. I'll move on.”
    


            Following the win Sunday, Scheffler quipped he had a few “jokes” that he would keep to himself about his experience last year with the arrest.
    


            Despite being pressured to say them, Scheffler said it was “not a good idea” but expanded on why it was “sweet” to be sitting with the trophy a year later.
    


            “Last year sometimes, it still doesn't almost feel real. It really doesn't. It's just one of those deals that I really don't know how to describe it. But I can tell you it's very sweet sitting here with the trophy this year,” Scheffler added.
    


            Last year, Scheffler was arrested trying to drive around the scene of a fatal crash ahead of his tee time at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky.
    


            He had been charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer and the lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, Jefferson County court records showed. The charges were later dismissed.
    


            In what Scheffler called a “severe miscommunication in a chaotic situation,” adding he held “no ill will” toward the detective who arrested him, he ultimately finished eight shots behind the winner, Xander Schauffele, for a share of eighth place.
    


            Scheffler can begin his quest for a fourth career major win next month at the US Open at the Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pennsylvania.

            • Two people were killed and more than a dozen others were injured after a Mexican Navy training ship struck the bottom of the Brooklyn Bridge, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams.
    


            • The ship, called Cuauhtémoc, was carrying 277 people when it “lost power” and struck the bridge, Adams said. It was on a global goodwill tour and en route to Iceland at the time of the incident Saturday night, officials said.
    


            • The ship was moving in the “wrong direction,” a senior city official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, pointing in part to the current of the East River.
    


            • City officials earlier said “mechanical issues” may have caused the ship to strike the bridge, ﻿though the cause of the collision remains under investigation.
    


Our live coverage of the collision has ended. Get the latest here.



            In Xalapa, Veracruz, the home of América Yamilet Sánchez has become a place of mourning, with flowers and the soft glow of candles surrounding her portrait.
    


            Family and friends gathered on Sunday to honor the 21-year-old naval cadet, one of two people killed when the Mexican Navy training ship Cuauhtémoc struck the Brooklyn Bridge. The incident has left her loved ones demanding answers.
    


                    “It's impossible for something so serious to not be thoroughly investigated,” Gael de la Cruz, a relative of Sánchez, told Reuters. “What happened there is illogical. There must be someone responsible.”
                





            Sánchez's mother, Rocio Hernandez, told Reuters that she is in communication with US authorities regarding the repatriation of her daughter's body.
    


                    “The US coroner already told me that yes, everything is ready … and I'm waiting for that,” she said.
                





            The local city council of San Mateo del Mar, in Oaxaca, Mexico, has identified the second victim of Saturday's training ship crash at the Brooklyn Bridge as Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos.
    


            In a Facebook post, the city council said they lamented the passing of the sailor and expressed their “heartfelt condolences to his family and other loved ones.”
    


            Maldonado Marcos is the second victim identified by Mexican Authorities from Saturday's crash. Earlier, the governor of the Mexican State of Veracruz identified the first of the victims as cadet América Yamilet Sánchez.
    


            “All my love, support and solidarity to her family,” she said in the post while wishing the injured a “speedy recovery.”
    


            The team of investigators on the ground in New York City with the National Transportation Safety Board, “is comprised of experts in nautical operations, marine and bridge engineering and survival factors,” the agency said in post on X Sunday evening.
    


            “The NTSB team is assembling in New York City to conduct a safety investigation into the Mexican Navy training ship, Cuauhtémoc,” the post said.
    


            The agency is expected to hold a news conference Monday at 3 p.m. ET, the post added.
    


            The governor of Veracruz Mexico has identified one of the victims of Saturday's training ship crash as cadet América Yamilet Sánchez.
    


            In a social media post, Gov. Rocío Nahle said she “deeply” laments the passing of Sánchez, of Veracruz.
    


            “All my love, support and solidarity to her family,” she said in the post.
    


            She also wished the injured a “speedy recovery.”
    


            Family members have built an altar for Sánchez with flowers and photos in her hometown of Xalapa, Veracruz.
    


            A senior city official familiar with the investigation tells CNN most crew members of the Mexican sailing ship will depart tonight for a flight back to Mexico.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc's sailors are expected to be bussed from the site around 6 p.m. for a flight at 11 p.m., the official told CNN.
    


            The city will provide a convoy of public buses to escort the crew to John F. Kennedy International Airport, the official said.
    


            A handful of crew members will remain aboard the ship, the official said.
    


            Officials are also waiting for Mexican Navy authorities to arrive at the site so they can join the investigation.
    


            Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the scene Sunday an agency spokesperson said. The investigators are on the scene as of 4:56 p.m. ET.
    


            A cadet and a sailor died after a Mexican Navy training ship hit the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters on Sunday.
    


            Sheinbaum said the injured cadets are “getting better,” and that Mexico's Naval Secretariat would issue a statement on the matter later on, according to a video of her comments published by El Universal newspaper.
    


            The president referred to the collision as “an accident,” and said Mexican and American authorities are still investigating.
    


            A 50-yard “safety zone” has been established around the area where the damaged Mexican Navy training ship is docked after it crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, the US Coast Guard said in a news release Sunday.
    


            Other ships sailing around Pier 36 on the East River have been asked to “proceed at slow speed” as the NYPD provides 24/7 patrols in the safety zone, the news release detailed.
    


            A safety zone was also established from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Manhattan Bridge after the crash Saturday night, and commercial traffic in the area was suspended, Coast Guard officials said.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc experienced damage to all three of its masts in the caught-on-video crash, the Coast Guard confirmed.
    


            Two crewmembers died in the incident, and the Coast Guard extended its condolences to their loved ones.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday that investigators must determine if budget cuts and program cancellations by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency contributed in any way to the Mexican Navy training ship crashing into the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night.
    


            “I have the general sense of a DOGE dysfunction in parts of the Coast Guard,” Schumer said at a news conference on the federal budget. “We know that there has been meddling by the Trump administration into the Coast Guard staffing, and now we need to know how this meddling might have impacted the events of last night, from a command, communication and local coordination level.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Schumer suggested that if understaffing was an issue at the Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Services, which monitors vessel movements on water similar to the FAA's control towers for aircraft, it might have contributed to the failure to prevent the accident.
    


            “After being fully briefed on last night's Brooklyn Bridge accident, one thing is very clear,” Schumer said. “There are many more questions than answers as to how the accident occurred and whether it could have been prevented.”
    


            While investigators look into the crash of a Mexican Navy training ship into the Brooklyn Bridge, local authorities are focused on moving the ship so it can be repaired.
    


            “The (National Transportation Safety Board), the Coast Guard, the government of Mexico are now working on finding a way forward with the investigation, but that's still in the early stages of that,” Zach Iscol, the New York City Emergency Management commissioner, told CNN.
    


                    “And so right now over the next couple of days, our main focus is moving the ship safely to another location where it can begin repairs and then get it back on its way.”
                





            The ship is currently docked at Pier 36, where it was towed overnight after striking the bridge. Many members of the crew spent Saturday night on the ship, while the injured were cared for at hospitals.
    


            While there is some damage to the underside of the bridge, it is not structural and transportation inspectors have determined the bridge is safe, Iscol said.
    


            The Mexican Navy secretary pledged his support to the families of those killed and injured when one of its training ships crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


                    “I deeply regret what happened during the maneuver of the Training Ship Cuauhtémoc,” Secretary Raymundo Pedro Morales Ángeles said on X Sunday. “My commitment to the well-being of the naval personnel and their families is absolute.”
                





            Two crew members died after falling from the ship's masts, authorities said.
    


            “From the first moment, the protocols for medical care, institutional support, and direct support for the wounded and their loved ones were activated,” he said, adding the naval command is in contact with each affected family.
    


            Morales Ángeles also ensured that investigations into the incident will be “promptly followed up with total transparency and responsibility.”
    


            He thanked Mexican and US authorities for their support.
    


                    “I value and appreciate the displays of solidarity expressed by the governments and navies of friendly nations,” he added.
                





            Crew members were seen leaving the Cuauhtémoc on Sunday morning after staying onboard overnight.
    


            The ship was docked at Pier 36 after it hit the Brooklyn bridge on Saturday evening, leaving at least two people dead and injuring more than a dozen others.
    


                    “A lot of the crew members remained on the ship last night,” Zach Iscol, commissioner for the New York City office of emergency management, told CNN. “A number of them have been in the hospital and remain in the hospitals, and then we have the two who lost their lives.”
                





            After the Cuauhtémoc hit the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, FDNY officials called for “all hands” to help with the incident.
    


                    “It looks like it hit the Brooklyn Bridge, and it drifted under the Manhattan Bridge,” one FDNY official can be heard saying in dispatch audio.
                





            Officials with the FDNY Brooklyn can be heard discussing the incident in dispatch audio from Broadcastify.
    


                    “It looks like a sailboat was going under the Brooklyn Bridge, hit something over there with the mast broken off and is drifting under the Manhattan Bridge with people on the boat,” one official said.
                





            Units from FDNY Manhattan received an “all hands” call to assist with the injured.
    


                    “Your box is gonna go to an all-hands; they have multiple serious patients coming to your location and we're gonna go to all hands,” one official said.

            Authorities are looking into exactly how a Mexican Navy training ship on a goodwill tour struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night, killing two crew members who fell from the ship's masts and leaving about 20 others injured.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a go-team to the site of the crash to investigate, the agency said Sunday, with their arrival expected late afternoon. The ship's voyage data recorder may reveal critical information about the crash.
    


            The ship, the Cuauhtémoc, was carrying 277 people en route to Iceland when it lost power and struck the bridge, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said.
    


            The ship was moving in the wrong direction when it hit the bridge, a senior city official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Cuauhtémoc's captain said he lost steering of the vessel after the rudder stopped working, according to the senior official.
    


            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexican authorities are supporting the injured and monitoring the situation.
    


            The Mexican Navy training ship that struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday was moving in the “wrong direction,” a senior city official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc had been docked at Pier 17 in Manhattan, just down the river below the Brooklyn Bridge. As it made its way out of the harbor, it was supposed to make a stop at a Bay Ridge fueling dock before heading out to sea on its way to Iceland, the official said.
    


            “It was the current that took it under the bridge,” the person said. “It wasn't supposed to be headed in that direction.”
    


            Officials from different city agencies are meeting Sunday morning to determine the next steps in the response and the investigation.
    


            According to the senior official, Cuauhtémoc's captain has told investigators he lost steering of the vessel after the rudder stooped working.
    


            “They had some sort of mechanical issue, they lost power so without being able to use the rudder, they could not steer,” the official said, cautioning all information is preliminary and subject to change.
    


            The city is also investigating the role of a tug boat that can be seen in video appearing to lead the Cuauhtémoc through the river.
    


            The senior official said city divers are expected to go into the water today to inspect the Cuauhtémoc's rudder to determine if the ship can be moved.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc's crew spent the night on the ship, the senior official said. Now, city officials are working to get them off the ship and home to Mexico, the person said.
    


            The city's Office of the Medical Examiner is also working to repatriate the bodies of the two victims, the senior official said.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a “go-team” team to New York, where a Mexican Navy training ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge, according to a post Sunday by the agency's X account.
    


            The team is expected to arrive late Sunday afternoon.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc is docked now at Pier 36, where the Mexican Navy training ship was towed overnight after striking the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


            The ship's three masts are visibly damaged, with the splintered tip of one mast hanging at an angle, its sail twisted around it.
    


            Early Sunday morning, a group of seven crew members dressed in sailors' uniforms boarded the ship. There has otherwise been minimal visible activity onboard so far.
    


            Onlookers have been walking the pier throughout the morning, trying to get a glimpse of the damaged ship, but the area is blocked off to the public, and a police patrol boat has been watching over the ship.
    


            Cuauhtémoc's collision with the Brooklyn Bridge comes just 16 months after a massive cargo ship plowed into Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024.
    


            The incident caused the 1.6-mile structure to crumble, plunging cars and people into the frigid water below. The Singaporean-flagged container vessel, named Dali, lost power, veered off course, and smashed into the bridge, killing six construction workers.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc is not the first ship to hit the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


            In 1921, the schooner Edward J. Lawrence hit the bridge while being towed beneath it. In 1935, a German freighter, Tirpitz, struck a steel girder on the bridge, bending three of the ship's four masts. In 1986, a freighter from South Korea grazed the bottom of the bridge, The New York Times reported.
    


            The voyage data recorder from the Mexican Navy training ship that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday will provide crucial information about what went wrong, one transportation expert told CNN.
    


            The data recorder will likely provide investigators with information about both the ship's mechanics, including any “control input” and when power may have been lost, said Mary Schiavo, CNN transportation analyst and former US Department of Transportation inspector general. It may also provide information about the river itself, such as the water's depth and its currents.
    


            Investigators may already have that information and be in the process of reviewing it, Schiavo said. They will also need to examine whether communication was lost at any point, she added.
    


            Mexico will be involved in the National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the incident, Schiavo said, noting the US agency is used to performing large-scale, international investigations.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc departed Acapulco on the Pacific coast of Mexico on the morning of April 4, according to a news release from the Mexican Secretariat of the Navy.
    


            The mission was “exalting the seafaring spirit, strengthening naval education, and carrying the Mexican people's message of peace and goodwill to the seas and ports of the world,” according to the release.
    


            Plans for the voyage included calling on 22 ports in 15 countries in 254 days. The crew was scheduled to spend 170 days sailing and 84 days in port, according to the Mexican Navy.
    


            Stops included various Caribbean destinations such as Kingston, Jamaica, and Havana, Cuba, as well as Mexican ports, New York, and cities in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Iceland, the news release said.
    


            The trip boasted the highest number of women in the crew, with 64 women and 213 men among the 277 members.
    


            The navy said Cuauhtémoc has traveled the oceans and seas of the world for 42 years, with more than 43 generations of “Captains, Officers, Cadets, and Sailor personnel” on board.
    


            The Mexican Navy ship had been docked at the South Street Seaport Museum for five days of public viewing prior to it hitting the Brooklyn Bridge, according to the museum's website.



            A spokesperson for the New York City-area Sail4th 250 events told CNN that the ship “welcomed dignitaries and media” as part of its New York stop on its global tour.
    


            The sailing ship was expected to join the parade of international tall ships to celebrate America's 250 anniversary on July 4, 2026, the spokesperson said, in what the event is calling “the largest-ever flotilla of tall ships from around the world.”
    


            The Cuauhtémoc ship is a steel-hulled three-masted barque that's around 300 feet long and 160 feet tall, according to a 2024 press release from one of its training cruises.
    


            Government documents show the Brooklyn Bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet.
    


            Video shot by bystanders on Saturday showed the Cuauhtémoc's masts hitting the underside of the bridge and breaking as the vessel passed underneath, with pieces falling down toward the deck.
    


            Two people have died and two remain in critical condition, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said. Everyone is believed to be accounted for, officials said.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc sailing ship was used for training by the Heroic Naval Military School, an elite military academy in Mexico, according to last year's press release.
    


            Mexico has referred to the ship as a diplomatic symbol of its country abroad.
    


            The ship, as of last year, had visited 212 ports in 64 countries with 756,085 nautical miles sailed, the latter equivalent to making 35 trips around the world, the release said.
    


            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent her condolences to families of the two crew members killed when a Mexican Navy sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday.
    


            “We are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the Cuauhtémoc Training Ship, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our sympathy and support go out to their families,” Sheinbaum said in a post on X early Sunday.
    


            Sheinbaum said the Mexican Navy is supporting those injured in the incident, and that the Mexican ambassador to the United States and Mexican Consulate General were supporting the navy.
    


            “We are monitoring the situation, and the Secretary of the Navy will continue to provide updates,” she added.
    


            Mexico's US ambassador was at the scene alongside New York officials late Saturday after the Cuauhtémoc struck the Brooklyn Bridge. The ship had been in New York as part of a global goodwill tour and was departing for Iceland at the time of the incident.
    


            The Mexican Navy training ship that struck the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday was moved to a nearby pier to allow passengers to disembark, according to a law enforcement official.
    


            About 250 people were still on the Cuauhtémoc after its masts struck the underside of the bridge, the official said.
    


            The ship has since been moved to New York's Pier 36.
    


Remember: The tall ship was departing from Pier 17 and heading out to open sea en route to Iceland when it struck the underside of the bridge, officials earlier said.
    


            Video of the Mexican Navy training ship shortly after it struck the Brooklyn Bridge shows people hanging from at least one of its masts.
    


            At least one person is seen clinging from a rope on the top-most rung of one mast, while several others on the top two rungs can be seen crawling to the center part of the mast. A few individuals can be seen climbing a ladder to reach those stuck.
    


            On tall ships like the Cuauhtémoc, it is a ceremonial tradition for sailors to climb the masts and rigging when departing or arriving into harbor.
    


            At least two people were killed in the incident, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The two individuals fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said.
    


            Officials said that nobody has been declared missing.
    


            Flavio Moreira was walking with his family along the Brooklyn promenade when the Mexican sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


            Moreira said the area was busy with people enjoying the warm Saturday evening. At first, he enjoyed seeing the Cuauhtémoc tall sailing ship in the East River, he said.
    


            “But it just kept coming closer and closer to us, and at some point, I was like, I don't think that's right,” Moreira told CNN's Ben Hunte.
    


            Moreira said there was “a bit of commotion” when the ship's masts hit the bridge but “also a lot of people started recording like me because it was just such a surreal experience.”
    


            From the shore, Moreira said he could see people on the boat struggling after the collision.
    


            “We could see some people being kind of dragged. There was some, I believe it was some of the staff, they were on the top of the boat. And they were swinging around, back and forth as soon as the ship hit the bridge,” he said.
    


            “The ship was just so close to us, so we could see all those people really struggling to just like holding onto something to… don't fall from the boat,” he added.
    


Correction: A previous version of this post misspelled Ben Hunte's last name.



            More than 100 fire and emergency medical service (EMS) personnel responded to the scene where a Mexican Navy sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, according to the New York City Fire Department.
    


            The NYFD said in an email to CNN it received the call that a ship had struck the bridge around 8:39 p.m. on Saturday.
    


            “Once the marine units arrived on scene, we knew, initially, we knew immediately that we had a serious incident with a boat striking the bridge,” Chief of Training Michael Meyers said in a FDNY post on X.
    


            Dual command posts were set up on the Brooklyn and Manhattan sides of the river and marine units were assisting in the emergency response, Meyers said.
    


            In its email to CNN, the department said personnel from 25 units was deployed, including 106 fire and EMS workers.
    


            “The police, fire and EMS did a tremendous job of working together to get everyone off of that ship safe,” said Meyers.
    


            The cause of the collision remains under investigation.
    


            At least two people were killed and about 20 injured when a Mexican Navy training ship carrying 277 passengers struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, officials said.
    


            Dramatic video shows the Cuauhtémoc's masts hitting the underside of the bridge and breaking as the vessel passes underneath, with pieces falling down toward the deck.
    


            Here's what we know:
    


What happened: The incident occurred around 8:20 p.m. local time as the captain was departing from New York's Pier 17. The ship's masts struck the bridge, breaking on impact and sending debris falling onto the vessel's deck. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the ship “lost power” and struck the bridge. City officials earlier said “mechanical issues” may have caused the incident, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation.
    


Casualties: Mayor Adams said at least two people were killed in the incident. The two individuals who died fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. Nineteen people were injured, with two seriously, Adams said. The Mexican Navy said a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals.
    


The bridge: There was no visible damage to the Brooklyn Bridge, which was left structurally intact by the incident. Traffic was temporarily closed in both directions for about 40 minutes, but was later reopened. Inspections remain ongoing.
    


The ship: The Cuauhtémoc is a training sailing ship of the Mexican Navy and a diplomatic symbol of Mexico abroad. Known as the “Ambassador and Knight of the Seas,” the ship was in New York as part of a global goodwill tour and was en route to Iceland at the time of the incident. The Cuauhtémoc was built in Spain in 1981 and acquired by the Mexican Navy to train cadets and officers. It regularly takes part in major regattas around the world. It had been docked at the South Street Seaport in New York since Tuesday.
    


            At least two people were killed when the Mexican Navy sailing ship Cuauhtémoc struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams.
    


            “At this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,” Adams wrote on X.
    


            The two individuals who died fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said.
    


             The ship has since been moved to New York's Pier 36, the official added.
    


            City officials earlier said “mechanical issues” may have caused the ship to strike the bridge, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary.
    


            The cause of the collision remains under investigation.
    


            Videos posted on social media show the moment the mast of a Mexican Navy training ship struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday evening.
    


            The ship, bedecked with white lights and flying a large Mexican flag, can be seen sailing closer to the edge of Brooklyn Bridge Park when its mast strikes the bottom of the bridge, snapping at parts and falling onto the deck below.
    


            Crewmembers of the ship, Cuauhtémoc, can be seen clinging on to the mast after the incident. Bystanders on the dock can be heard screaming and seen in the videos running away from the scene.
    


            There appears to be no damage to the bridge.
    


            The Mexican Navy training ship that struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday evening likely suffered a “mechanical issue” that forced the captain to lose power, police said in a news conference.
    


            “The captain that was maneuvering the ship lost, I guess, power of the ship,” Chief Wilson Aramboles of the NYPD Special Operations Bureau told reporters Saturday evening.
    


            Aramboles added that there were “some mechanical issues” that “probably” caused the ship, Cuauhtémoc, to strike the bridge.
    


            Officials warned that the information provided is preliminary and subject to change. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation into what happened.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc was leaving New York and heading out to sea en route to Iceland when it struck the underside of the bridge.
    


            Aramboles said a number of sailors were on top of the ship's masts and were injured in the incident.
    


            New York City's famous Brooklyn Bridge was closed for about 40 minutes following the ship accident, according to a post on X from NYC's official emergency notification system.
    


            “The bridge is open at this time after our preliminary inspection,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Saturday evening.
    


            All lanes had previously been closed, the agency said on X at 10:06 p.m. ET.
    


            By 10:48 p.m. ET, the bridge has reopened, the agency said on X while letting people know to expect delays.
    


            New York City Mayor Eric Adams said 19 people were injured after a Mexican Navy training ship carrying 277 passengers struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


            Four people have “serious” injuries, Adams said, adding “all passengers were safely removed.”
    


            The Mexican Navy said a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals.
    


            Adams said that city officials are working closely with Mexican officials on response efforts.
    


            A Mexican Navy training ship struck the bottom of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, according to police and the Mexican Navy.
    


            The sailboat hit the bridge around 8:26 p.m. and multiple people are being “aided,” a New York Police Department spokesperson told CNN.
    


            A total of 19 people were injured, including four people with “serious” injuries, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters from the scene.
    


            “During the departure maneuver of the Cuauhtémoc Sailboat in New York, an incident occurred with the Brooklyn Bridge that caused damage to the Training Ship, temporarily preventing the continuation of the training cruise,” the Mexican Navy said in a post in Spanish on X.
    


            “The status of the personnel and material is under review by naval and local authorities, who are providing support,” the post added.
    


            New York emergency officials said they're responding to an incident at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. “The situation is developing and details are not confirmed at this time,” NYC Emergency Management said on X.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to strip legal protections from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation.

The court's order, with only one noted dissent, puts on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept in place Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans that would have otherwise expired last month. The justices provided no rationale, which is common in emergency appeals. 

The status allows people already in the United States to live and work legally because their native countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife.

A federal appeals court had earlier rejected the administration's request to put the order on hold while the lawsuit continues.

The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals President Donald Trump's administration has made to the Supreme Court, many of them related to immigration. Last week, the government asked the court to allow it to end humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, setting them up for potential deportation as well.

The high court also has been involved in legal battles over Trump's efforts to swiftly deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act. 

The administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending the temporary protected status for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians. That status is granted in 18-month increments.




The protections had been set to expire April 7, but U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ordered a pause on those plans. He found that the expiration threatened to severely disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and could cost billions in lost economic activity.

Chen, who was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama, found the government hadn't shown any harm caused by keeping the program alive.

But Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on behalf of the administration that Chen's order impermissibly interferes with the administration's power over immigration and foreign affairs.

In addition, Sauer told the justices, people affected by ending the protected status might have other legal options to try to remain in the country because the “decision to terminate TPS is not equivalent to a final removal order.”

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters or civil strife.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she would have rejected the administration's emergency appeal.

Israel has launched a new wave of air and ground operations across Gaza, and the army ordered the evacuation of the enclave's second-largest city, Khan Younis, where Israel carried out a massive operation earlier in the war that left much of the area in ruins.

The Israeli military released a video on Monday showing what they say are troops operating in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile after a nearly three-month blockade and warnings by global experts of impeding famine, Israel says it will allow a limited amount of humanitarian aid into Gaza even as it launches “extensive” new ground operations there.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the Israeli military was entering the Gaza Strip “with force”. “As we promised, we have launched a powerful campaign against Hamas,” said Netanyahu.

Doctors worked to treat injured children on Monday at a hospital in southern Gaza. A group of Palestinian men also sat by the wrapped body of a leader of the armed wing of a Palestinian militant group which said he was killed in a shootout during an Israeli operation in Khan Younis.

Palestinians began evacuating Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis on Monday after Israel ordered its evacuation. Israel has stepped up its offensive in Gaza in what it says is a bid to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages abducted in the October 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The first few aid trucks have entered Gaza following nearly three months of Israel's complete blockade of food, medicine and other supplies, Israel and the United Nations said Monday, as Israel acknowledged pressure from allies.

Five trucks carrying baby food and other desperately needed aid entered the territory of over 2 million Palestinians via the Kerem Shalom crossing, according to the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, COGAT.

The U.N. called it a “welcome development” but said far more aid is needed. Food security experts last week warned of famine in Gaza. During the latest ceasefire that Israel ended in March, some 600 aid trucks entered Gaza each day.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his decision to resume limited, “basic” aid to Gaza came after allies said they couldn't support Israel's renewed military offensive if there are “images of hunger” coming from the Palestinian territory.

The U.N. humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, said the first few trucks were a “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.” He said an additional four U.N. trucks were cleared to enter Gaza. Those trucks may enter tomorrow, according to COGAT.

Fletcher added that given the chaotic situation on the ground, the U.N. expects the aid could be looted or stolen, which has been a growing problem as the blockade continued and resources became increasingly scarce. He urged Israel to open multiple crossings in northern and southern Gaza to permit a regular flow of aid.




Israel over the weekend launched a new wave of air and ground operations across Gaza, and the army ordered the evacuation of its second-largest city, Khan Younis, where Israel carried out a massive operation earlier in the 19-month war that left much of the area in ruins.

Israel says its offensive is a bid to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Hamas has said it will only release them in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. 

Netanyahu said Monday that Israel plans on “taking control of all of Gaza,” as well as establishing a new system to distribute aid that circumvents Hamas. He has said Israel also will encourage what he describes as the voluntary emigration of much of Gaza's population to other countries — something that Palestinians have rejected.

The Trump administration has voiced full support for Israel's actions and blames Hamas for deaths in Gaza, though in recent days it has expressed growing concern over the hunger crisis.

President Donald Trump — who skipped Israel on his trip to the region last week — voiced concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, as did Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

In a video statement posted to social media, Netanyahu said Israel's “greatest friends in the world” had told him, “We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you.”

Netanyahu said the situation was approaching a “red line” and a “dangerous point,” but it was not clear if he was referring to the crisis in Gaza or the potential loss of support from allies.

The video statement appeared aimed at pacifying anger in Netanyahu's nationalist base at the decision to resume aid. Two far-right governing partners have pressed Netanyahu not to allow aid into Gaza.

At least one of them, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, appeared to be on board with the latest plan.

“No more raids and going in and out, but conquering, cleansing and remaining until Hamas is destroyed,” he said. “We are destroying what is still left of the strip, simply because everything there is one big city of terror.”

Aid into Gaza would be “minimal,” Netanyahu said, and would act as a bridge toward the launch of a new aid system in Gaza. A U.S.-backed organization will distribute assistance in hubs that will be secured by the Israeli military.

Israel says the plan is meant to prevent Hamas from accessing aid, which Israel says it uses to bolster its rule in Gaza.

U.N. agencies and aid groups have rejected the plan, saying it won't reach enough people and would weaponize aid in contravention of humanitarian principles. They have refused to take part.

According to aid officials familiar with the plan, it will involve setting up distribution points mostly in southern Gaza, forcing many Palestinians to move south once again. The recent ceasefire saw hundreds of thousands return to homes in the north.

The war has displaced around 90% of its population, most of them multiple times.

Israeli special forces disguised as displaced Palestinians meanwhile launched a rare ground raid into Khan Younis early Monday, according to local residents.

The forces killed Ahmed Sarhan, a leader in the armed wing of the Popular Resistance Committees, in a shootout, the group said. Palestinian witnesses said his wife and daughter were detained.

The forces drove in on a civilian vehicle and carried out the raid under cover from heavy airstrikes. At least five other people were killed, according to Nasser Hospital.

Also on Monday, an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp killed five people, including a woman and a girl, and wounded 18, mostly children, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties.

The Israeli military said it struck militants in what it described as a Hamas command center in Nuseirat.

The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's retaliatory offensive, which has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.

After the government terminated his legal status in the U.S., one student abruptly lost his laboratory job in Houston and, fearing detention, he returned to his home country in south Asia on a one-way ticket.

The Trump administration later reversed course in its expansive crackdown on international students, but there was a major obstacle. The student cannot return because his American visa was revoked. 

Without it, he's “stranded,” said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

As the government begins reinstating students' records, many face a daunting and complicated path toward rebuilding their lives. For those who left, there is no guarantee they can return. Others have faced challenges reenrolling in school and returning to jobs.

Mental anguish from their ordeals linger, as do feelings of vulnerability. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has expanded the grounds for terminating a student's legal status, leaving many to fear they could be targeted again.

A total of more than 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the U.S. canceled this spring, with little notice or explanation. In court hearings, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI-run database that contains the names of suspects and people who have been arrested, even if they were never charged with a crime or had charges dropped.

At a court hearing last week in Oakland, California, lawyers for international students sought a nationwide injunction they said would protect their clients and others across the country.




But government attorneys said that wasn't necessary because ICE was mailing status reactivation letters to affected students. It likely will take two weeks for all students to receive their letter, which can then be shared with universities and employers, assistant U.S. attorney Elizabeth Kurlan said.

The plaintiffs' lawyers said the letter is meaningless, arguing ICE's new policy suggests student records can be terminated on a whim. There's also no evidence ICE has asked the State Department to restore revoked visas, the plaintiffs' attorneys said.

The man in Houston left within about a week of learning his legal status had been terminated. Around that time, he also received an email that the visa he used to enter the U.S. had been revoked. He believes his termination stemmed from a 2021 fraud case that was dismissed.

Over nearly a decade he had built a life in the U.S., where he was enrolled in “optional practical training,” which allows foreign students to stay and work for up to three years on their student visas. In his home country, he is now looking for work and living with his mother.

The wait time for a U.S. visa interview is at least a year, he said. 

Even if he got another visa, returning would be complicated because of his financial situation. He had a car loan and credit cards in the U.S. that he can't afford to pay after losing his job, and his credit score has since dropped, he said. 

“Revoking a visa or revoking a SEVIS status does not just affect the educational side of things, it affects the whole life,” said the student, who has struggled with feelings of loneliness and also grief over his father's recent death.

SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students' compliance with their visa status. 

Students who left the country may not have known their rights or had the resources to hire a lawyer, said Ben Loveman, an immigration attorney. They now will have a harder time being reinstated, he said. 

“There were huge consequences,” Loveman said. 

For a Nepali programmer in Texas who had his status terminated, the ordeal brought up a mistake he thought he had left in the past. 

The programmer, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear or retaliation, was arrested four years ago for drunken driving. He said he took responsibility for his actions, performing community service hours, serving probation and paying fines. The judge told him the records could be sealed after two years, but the case appears to explain why he was targeted by immigration authorities.

“I followed everything,” he said. “If they're going to take it all, at least give me due process.”

His status has since been restored, and the programmer, who is on an OPT program, has gone back to his job. But the episode hasn't faded from his mind. 

If the right opportunity emerged in another country like New Zealand or Canada, he said he would take it and leave.

A student at Iowa State University who also requested anonymity out of concern about being targeted, said he is looking for options to leave the U.S., after what he describes as a “dark period.” 

The Ph.D. student said his status termination pushed him to a mental breaking point. He had a plane ticket back home to Bangladesh reserved. He hardly left his apartment, and when he did, he felt he was being followed.

He attributes his termination to pending charges against him for marijuana possession, but he said he hadn't been convicted. 

After his status reinstatement, he restarted a teaching assistant job he had lost. Then, he had to catch up on grading almost three weeks of assignments for dozens of students.

While he's relieved to get back to school, he's confident about his decision to leave by the end of the year — either for home or Europe. The degree is not worth the risk of another status termination, he said.

“How much should I suffer to continue here?” he said.

The parity era continues in the NBA.

The New York Knicks haven't won an NBA championship since 1973. The Indiana Pacers won their most recent title that year — in the ABA. The Oklahoma City Thunder franchise has one title in its history, that coming in 1979 when the team called Seattle home. And the Minnesota Timberwolves have never even been to the NBA Finals.

Meet the NBA's final four.

When Commissioner Adam Silver hands one of those teams the Larry O'Brien Trophy next month, it'll mark a league first — seven championship franchises in a seven-year span.

There hasn't been a back-to-back NBA champion since Golden State in 2017 and 2018. From there, the list of champions goes like this: Toronto in 2019, the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020, Milwaukee in 2021, Golden State in 2022, Denver in 2023 and Boston last season.

It's the longest such run of different champions in NBA history; Major League Baseball, the NHL and the NFL have all had longer ones, and not too long ago, either.

But for the NBA, this is different. The league wanted unpredictability, especially after four consecutive Cleveland-vs.-Golden State title matchups from 2015 through 2018.

And things have been highly unpredictable since. No matter what the Finals matchup is this year, the NBA will be seeing 11 conference-champion franchises in the span of seven seasons.

“We've still got eight more wins to achieve our ultimate goal,” Minnesota coach Chris Finch said. “We've still got two more series. We're only halfway there.”

The season is over for 26 of the NBA's 30 clubs. But the fun stuff is just starting.

The Western Conference finals — No. 6 seed Minnesota vs. No. 1 seed Oklahoma City — begin Tuesday night in Oklahoma. The Eastern Conference finals — No. 4 seed Indiana vs. No. 3 seed New York — begin Wednesday night in Manhattan. The Wolves lost the West finals last year; the Pacers lost the East finals a year ago.

“You've got to have big dreams,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “You don't know how often you're going to be in this position.”

Indeed, the championship window for teams doesn't seem to be staying open as long as it did in the past.

Boston was a huge favorite to win its second straight title; the Celtics didn't get out of Round 2, in part because they couldn't hold onto big leads and in part because Jayson Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in that series with the Knicks.

“Upset or not, whatever it is, we beat a great team,” Knicks guard Jalen Brunson said. “They obviously lost a huge piece ... but they're still a great team.”

Damian Lillard tore an Achilles tendon in Round 1, ending Milwaukee's hopes. Cleveland, the top seed in the East, bowed out in Round 2 against Indiana after a slew of Cavs were dealing with health issues. Stephen Curry strained his hamstring; that was all it took to doom Golden State's chances in Round 2 against Minnesota.

“He's our sun,” Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. “This is a solar system. He's our sun.”

And now, the NBA solar system is about to see new star holding the trophy.

There is nobody left in these playoffs who has been an NBA Finals MVP. Not even close.

In fact, there are only seven players left — Indiana's Pascal Siakam, Aaron Nesmith and Thomas Bryant; Knicks teammates P.J. Tucker, Cam Payne and Mikal Bridges; and Oklahoma City's Alex Caruso — who have appeared in a Finals game. And most of those appearances didn't add up to much; Siakam is the only player left in these playoffs with more than 100 Finals points.

So, who will the next Finals MVP be? Maybe Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Canadian guard and likely MVP from the Thunder? The “Mr. Clutch” award winner, Brunson from the Knicks? Anthony Edwards, the presumed next face of the league from the Timberwolves? Tyrese Haliburton, the dazzling guard and Olympic gold medalist who keeps getting overlooked by everyone outside of Indiana?

None of them would be surprise choices.

“Our ultimate goal isn't just the Western Conference finals,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “You've got to go through there to get there.”

If the NBA's final four was its own league this season, taking just the head-to-head results between those four clubs would suggest the Thunder are the clear favorite.

Oklahoma City went 6-2 against the other three conference finalists, while New York and Indiana both went 3-4 and Minnesota went 3-5.

The Thunder swept the Pacers and Knicks, and the Pacers swept the Timberwolves.

As far as the head-to-heads going into the conference finals, Oklahoma City and Minnesota split four meetings — with the Timberwolves outscoring the Thunder 475-472 — while the Knicks went 2-1 against Indiana, with all three games decided by at least 11 points.

“You can feel good about it, feel however you want to feel about it,” Haliburton said of getting to this point. “But at the end of the day, we're not done. We know we all have a bigger goal at mind. Our goal wasn't just to get to the Eastern Conference finals and be done. Our goal is to win a championship.”

LONDON, Ky. (AP) — Officials in Kansas and Texas were evaluating damage on Monday after tornadoes touched down overnight, just days after more than two dozen people were killed in storms that swept through parts of the Midwest and South.

Kentucky was hardest hit by last week's storms. A devastating tornado damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles, left many homeless, and killed at least 19 people, most of them in southeastern Laurel County. 

“We have 1,001 things going on. But we're managing it. And we're going to get it all cleaned up,” said London Mayor Randall Weddle at the city's small airport, which was a beehive of cleanup after it took a direct hit from a tornado. Officials were using it as a base to get water, food, diapers and other supplies out to the community.

Meteorologists predicted a fresh “multi-day” mix of dangerous weather conditions across the central U.S. with heavy rains, thunderstorms and potential tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. 




The Kentucky storms emerged from a weather system Friday that killed seven in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said. Damage assessments were underway Sunday as Kentucky readied its request for federal disaster assistance, Gov. Andy Beshear said.

In London, city worker Ashley Taylor was back at work Monday loading doughnuts to take to a hospital and dispatch center even though there was a tarp on her roof. She was lucky — the houses across her street were destroyed late Friday night.

She survived the storm with nine other people and three dogs in the crawl space of a neighbor's home,

“We prayed like never before — and just thankful for everything God did for us,” Taylor said.

Laurel County Fire Major Leslie Leatherman was one of the dead from the area. His fellow firefighters found his body shielding a woman who was yelling for help in a field near a destroyed subdivision. It turned out to be his wife and officials aren't sure if he knew who he was protecting in all the darkness and chaos, the fire department said on social media.

The city of Greensburg, Kansas, said on social media Monday morning that there were power outages but it was safe after the “storm scare.” In 2007, Greensburg was slammed by an EF5 tornado that was more than 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) wide and packed winds up to 205 mph (330kph), leveling more than 90% of the town of 1,400 and killing 12. 

A powerful tornado tore through Reno County, Kansas, late Sunday, moving through rural areas and into the small community of Plevna, county Emergency Management officials said in a news release on Monday. The tornado damaged several homes, trees and utility poles, then continued to cause damage for about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north and east of the city. Damage was extensive, but no injuries or deaths were reported, officials said. 

A National Weather Service team planned to head out Monday to survey Plevna tornado damage, said Andy Kleinsasser, a meteorologist with the service's office in Wichita. There were no known injuries or fatalities, Kleinsasser said. The tornado started in Stafford County and cut a path that was at least 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) long through Reno County, he said. 

In the western part of Kansas, Interstate 70 was reduced to one lane near Grinnell, a town of 260 people, because of tornado damage and downed power lines. 

In St. Louis, Mayor Cara Spencer said five people died, 38 were injured and more than 5,000 homes were affected on Friday. About 130 miles (210 kilometers) south, a tornado in Scott County killed two people, injured several others and destroyed several homes, Sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media.

In Texas, possible tornados caused significant damage in Mingus and Gordon about 70 miles (112 kilometers) west of Fort Worth. Schools were damaged and classes canceled the rest of the week. No injuries or deaths were reported.

About 1,200 tornadoes strike the U.S. annually, and they have been reported in all 50 states. Researchers found in 2018 that deadly tornadoes were occurring less frequently in the traditional “Tornado Alley” of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in parts of the more densely populated and tree-filled mid-South. 

The Trump administration has massively cut staffing of National Weather Service offices, with outside experts worrying about how it would affect warnings in disasters such as tornadoes.

The office in Jackson, Kentucky, which was responsible for the area around London, Kentucky, had a March 2025 vacancy rate of 25%; the Louisville, Kentucky, weather service staff was down 29%; and the St. Louis office was down 16%, according to calculations by weather service employees obtained by The Associated Press. The Louisville office also was without a permanent boss — the meteorologist in charge — as of March, according to the staffing data.

Experts said any vacancy rate above 20% is a critical problem.

LONDON, Ky. (AP) — Residents in Kentucky and Missouri sifted through damage in tornado-stricken neighborhoods, still on edge Sunday for more severe weather ahead after storms that killed more than two dozen people as they swept through parts of the Midwest and South.

Kentucky was hardest hit as a devastating tornado damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles about and left many homeless. At least 19 people were killed, most of them in southeastern Laurel County. 

Meteorologists predicted a fresh “multi-day” mix of dangerous weather conditions across the nation's midsection with heavy rains, thunderstorms and potential tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service.

The weather service confirmed a “large and extremely dangerous” tornado Sunday afternoon near Mingus, Texas, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Fort Worth. Significant damage but no immediate casualties were reported in Palo Pinto County, which includes Mingus, a sheriff's office dispatcher said.

Forecasters warned of hail the size of tennis balls in that area, and damaging hail elsewhere in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.

Jeff Wyatt's home of 17 years was destroyed along with much of his neighborhood in London, Kentucky.

On Sunday, the family returned to the wrecked home to collect photos, baby blankets and other keepsakes.

“It happened so fast,” said Wyatt, 54. “If we would have been there 10 seconds longer, we would have been gone with the family room.” 




Survivors and their supporters picked through the debris in London on Sunday, wary about new forecasts. Severe storms were possible for Kentucky on Monday and even more so on Tuesday, the weather service said.

Zach Wilson, whose parents' home was destroyed, said he was “terrified” another storm would ruin the remaining salvageable items scattered across their property — or even worse, destroy another community.

“If I had to tell anybody it would be to listen to every word that the National Weather Service kicks out and take every warning seriously,” Wilson said. 

The Kentucky storms emerged from a weather system Friday that killed seven in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said. The system also spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, brought punishing heat to Texas and temporarily enveloped parts of Illinois — including Chicago — in a pall of dust on an otherwise sunny day. 

The weather service said parts of Missouri and Kansas could see severe thunderstorms, golf ball-sized hail and wind gusts up to 60 mph (97 kph) into Monday. 

In London, Kentucky, Ryan VanNorstran huddled with his brother's large dogs in a first-floor closet as the storm hit his brother's home Friday in a neighborhood along Keavy Road where much of the destruction in the community of nearly 8,000 people was centered. VanNorstran was house-sitting.

He said he felt the house shake as he got into a closet. Then, a door from another house crashed through a window. All the windows blew out of the house and his car was destroyed. Chunks of wood had punched through several parts of the roof but the house avoided catastrophic damage. When he stepped outside, he heard screaming. 

“I guess in the moment, I kind of realized there was nothing I could do. I'd never really felt that kind of power from just nature,” he said.

Damage assessments were underway Sunday as the state readied its request for federal disaster assistance, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said.

The governor announced a 19th storm victim, a woman from Russell County. Of 10 people hospitalized for weather-related injuries, three remained in critical condition. 

“A lot of Kentuckians are hurting right now,” Beshear said on X, touting fundraising efforts to help with funerals and rebuilding. “If you're able to help, please do.” 

He said parts of two dozen state roads were closed, and some could take days to reopen. 

About 1,200 tornadoes strike the U.S. annually, and they have been reported in all 50 states. Researchers found in 2018 that deadly tornadoes were occurring less frequently in the traditional “Tornado Alley” of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in parts of the more densely populated and tree-filled mid-South. 

In St. Louis, Mayor Cara Spencer said five people died, 38 were injured and more than 5,000 homes were affected. 

“The devastation is truly heartbreaking,” she said. 

A tornado struck in Scott County, about 130 miles (210 kilometers) south of St. Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying several homes, Sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media.

The storms hit after the Trump administration massively cut staffing of National Weather Service offices, with outside experts worrying about how it would affect warnings in disasters such as tornadoes.

The office in Jackson, Kentucky, which was responsible for the area around London, Kentucky, had a March 2025 vacancy rate of 25%; the Louisville, Kentucky, weather service staff was down 29%; and the St. Louis office was down 16%, according to calculations by weather service employees obtained by The Associated Press. The Louisville office also was without a permanent boss — the meteorologist in charge — as of March, according to the staffing data.

Experts said any vacancy rate above 20% is a critical problem.

Law enforcement officers are throwing their support behind President Donald Trump's plan to end taxes on overtime.

FIRST ON FOX: Police officers are rallying behind a provision in President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" to end taxing overtime work, which they say would have a favorable ripple effect on officer retention and morale. 

""No tax on overtime, it would be a huge advantage to law enforcement across the country,"" one officer said in a White House video shared with Fox News Digital. 

Another added, ""We work sometimes 100 plus hours a pay period. It's a lot of time taken away from the family. So that would be pretty special.""

Republican lawmakers are in the midst of hashing out the details of the sweeping legislation that would fund Trump's agenda through the budget reconciliation process. The legislation jumped its latest hurdle to move along to passage late Sunday evening, when lawmakers on the House Budget Committee voted to advance the bill. 

Trump has called on Republicans to swiftly pass the legislation, touting that it will lower taxes and provide larger paychecks for Americans, while also securing the border. Trump specifically directed congressional Republicans to permanently extend his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and implement new policies eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and retirees' Social Security.

National Police Week is celebrated each May. (White House)

Trump touted from the campaign trail that not taxing overtime pay would serve as ""more of an incentive to work,"" and bolster retention of employees who receive overtime pay as their paychecks would not be whittled down by taxes. 

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a Monday press conference that not taxing tips would lead to an average tax cut of $2,000 per individual, which Leavitt said will be a boon ""for our nurses, our police officers and all those who work overtime to make ends meet across our country.""

""Put simply, President Trump's one big, beautiful bill will be a boon for working class America,"" she said. ""This one big, beautiful bill is also pro-family, it will increase the child tax credit to $2,500 per child, establish optional savings account for newborn babies with a $1,000 credit added and strengthen paid family leave. This bill also delivers historic tax relief to America's seniors by allowing middle and low income Social Security recipients to deduct an additional $4,000 in payments from their taxable income."" 

Officers in the White House video touted that eliminating taxes on overtime would serve as an extra dose of ""appreciation"" to law enforcement. 

Police departments nationwide saw morale and staffing crater in 2020 and the following years as left-wing cities answered calls from activists to defund the police following the death of George Floyd while in police custody on Memorial Day 2020. Many liberal cities soon walked back budget plans slashing police department funding as crime waves washed over the nation, stretching from sky-high murder rates to teenagers repeatedly carrying out carjackings.

Police officers endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to end taxes on overtime. 

""If there was no tax on overtime … we'd be working about as hard as we currently do, but we would have that appreciation that goes along with it,"" one officer in the video said.

The police officers continued that removing taxation on overtime would likely lead to senior officers sticking around in the job longer to help train the next generation of law enforcement, while also giving younger officers extra cash in their pockets to raise their young families on an officer's salary.

""To have something like this in play would just help senior officers, perhaps stay a little bit longer to help be that guidance for that department, that community, to help teach those policy and procedures that we know of and to help with the retention,"" one police officer said.

""So know from the president on down, this administration stands behind you guys,"" Vice President JD Vance said during a law enforcement breakfast Wednesday at the vice president's residence. ""We love you guys. We know that you're out there doing a good job for us. And I think that moral leadership matters just as much as the public policy. But from this administration, you're, of course, getting it both.""

American Olympic rugby star Alev Kelter will face a judicial hearing and potentially lengthy suspension after being sent off in a women's rugby test on Saturday for stamping on the head of an opponent.

 Team USA was playing against Australia, who went on to celebrate a 27-19 victory in Saturday's contest.

Upon a video review, referees issued a red card around the 79th minute of action in the Pacific Four Series test. Officials determined Kelter forcefully stamped on the head of Australian center Georgie Friedrichs.

Microphones picked up a referee saying, ""Twelve, blue (Kelter), is going to receive a permanent red card because this is thuggery, it is deliberate and it is very dangerous foul play.

""She's clearly stamped on the head of the Australian player. That's reckless, that's dangerous and she's going off.""

Foul play in rugby that involves contact with the head is treated with extreme seriousness. Rugby, like many contact sports, has changed its rules in an effort to limit the danger of concussion and other head injuries.

FOX Weather correspondent Katie Byrne joins 'America Reports' live from Indianapolis Motor Speedway as severe weather risks loom over several states in the region.

A rookie driver celebrated an unlikely pole victory for the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. 

While Team Penske was disqualified before the final two rounds of qualifying, Robert Shwartzman won the pole.

The 25-year-old was driving for PREMA Racing and became the first Indy 500 rookie to qualify for the pole since 1983. Shwartzman, who has dual nationality in Israel and Russia, initially raced under the Russian flag. He currently competes under the Israeli flag, which makes the Tel Aviv native the first driver from Israel to make ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.""

Until Shwartzman's win, Teo Fabi was the last rookie to qualify for the Indy 500 pole. Coincidentally, he was an Italian — just like Prema, which was also founded in 1983. Prema is established in Europe and races in the Formula 2 series. It made its IndyCar debut this season.

Prema is the first team making its debut in the Indy 500 to land on the pole since Mayer Motor Racing put Tom Sneva there in 1984.

The event also marked Shwartzman's racing debut on an oval. He said the victory felt like a dream.

""Honestly it feels like I'm dreaming. I just had it in my dreams when I was going how would it feel to do such a good job in quali,"" he said. ""It's the Indy 500. It's the main race of the year. Honestly it feels unbelievable.""

Shwartzman had been pursuing a career in Formula 1 and was part of the Ferrari development program as well as its reserve driver from 2021 until the end of last season. Prema then nabbed him for its two-car team.

Former Arizona Supreme Court Judge Andrew Gould discusses the United States Supreme Court blocking the Trump administration's deportations of suspected Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act on 'Fox Report.'

The Supreme Court on Monday lifted an injunction against the Trump administration, allowing it to move ahead, for now, with its plans to end protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants in the U.S.

The decision is a victory for the Trump administration, allowing it to move forward with its plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protections for hundreds of thousands of people who came to the U.S. through parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. 

The TPS program provides legal status and work permits for these individuals.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., urges her Republican colleagues to vote for President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful' bill and weighs in on leaked audio of former President Joe Biden's interview with a special counsel on 'Fox Report.'

President Donald Trump's ""one big, beautiful bill"" survived a key hurdle in the House of Representatives on Sunday night, putting it one step closer to a chamber-wide vote later this week.

It comes after a rebellion by four House conservatives upended plans to advance the bill on Friday morning.

Lawmakers on the House Budget Committee were summoned back to Washington for a 10 p.m. meeting to vote again on the bill. It passed the panel in a nearly party-line vote, 17 to 16, with four Republicans voting ""present.""

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., made a surprise appearance in the committee room shortly before the vote began, telling reporters there would likely be ""minor modifications"" to the final bill before disappearing into a back room with the four GOP holdouts who sunk the bill on Friday morning.

Johnson later signaled confidence in another set of remarks to reporters just as the vote began, ""I think what is about to happen here is that every member, every Republican member, will give a vote that allows us to proceed forward, and we count that as a big win tonight.""

The speaker said he expects to have ""productive discussions"" with various factions of the House GOP, adding, ""I am absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it in accordance with our original deadline."" 

Four conservative House Freedom Caucus members on the committee blocked the bill from advancing on Friday, with the fiscal hawks seeking assurances that stricter crackdowns on Medicaid and green energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) would be in the final bill before a House-wide vote.

The four conservatives voted ""present"" in an effort to move discussions forward on Sunday night after getting those assurances from House GOP leaders.

Advancing the legislation through the House Budget Committee is a largely procedural move. Lawmakers have signaled that some changes will be introduced as amendments in the House Rules Committee, the final gatekeeper before a House-wide vote, sometime early this week.

Notably, two of the Budget Committee fiscal hawks who demanded further changes – Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. – also sit on the House Rules Committee.

""Tonight, after a great deal of work and engagement over the weekend, the Budget Committee advanced a reconciliation bill that lays the foundation for much needed tax relief, border security, and important spending reductions and reforms.  Importantly the bill now will move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies under the green new scam,"" Roy said in a statement after the vote.

Norman, meanwhile, told Fox News Digital that the four conservatives got those assurances from House GOP leaders in writing.

The House Budget Committee passed a framework earlier this year with ""instructions"" for various other committees to enact Trump policies under their jurisdictions. 

Following House and Senate-wide votes on their frameworks, House committees began crafting those policies, which have now been put back together into the massive bill the House Budget Committee advanced on Sunday night.

Republicans are working to pass Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party controlling both Congress and the White House to pass vast pieces of legislation while completely sidelining the minority – in this case, Democrats.

It does so by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, lining up with the House's own simple majority. The legislation must adhere to a specific set of rules, however, including only items related to federal spending, tax, and the national debt.

Trump is having Republicans use the legislation to enact his campaign promises on tax cuts, immigration, energy, defense, and raising the debt limit.

And while quelling Friday's GOP mutiny is a victory for House Republican leaders, lawmakers will still have to sit through high-stakes negotiations on any changes made to the bill before the House Rules Committee considers it.

Conservatives are opposed to aspects of the legislation's crackdown on Medicaid, which Republicans have said they are only trimming for waste, fraud, and abuse. But Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied people are not set to kick in until 2029, and conservatives have argued that it was a large window of time for those changes to be undone, among other concerns.

They're also pushing for a more aggressive effort to repeal green energy tax subsidies passed in the former Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). 

The respective pushes have pitted them against moderates wary of significant Medicaid cuts, and Republican lawmakers whose districts have businesses that have benefited from the tax relief.

Meanwhile, moderates in high-cost-of-living areas have also pushed for larger state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps, which red state Republicans have largely dismissed as subsidies to high-tax blue states.

The Republicans in those seats, however, have argued that it's an existential issue for their districts, where GOP victories were critical to winning and holding the House majority.

But even after it passes the House, Republicans there likely won't be done with the ""big, beautiful bill"" – Republican senators have already signaled they are likely going to make changes to the bill.

Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that House and Senate leaders were ""in close coordination"" on the final product, adding, ""we hope that they don't make many modifications to it.""

Any changes will have to go through the House again; identical bills must pass both chambers before getting signed into law by Trump.

Republican leaders have said they hope to get a bill on the president's desk by Fourth of July.

Colin Cowherd reacts to Rory McIlroy winning the Masters in a playoff thriller and completing the career Grand Slam. 

Rory McIlroy completed his career Grand Slam last month. The reigning Masters champion recently arrived in Charlotte for the second major of the 2025 season, the PGA Championship. 

McIlroy ended the tournament in a three-way tie for 47th place, finishing the major at 3-over. Sunday, the final day of the tournament, also marked McIlroy's fourth consecutive day of declining to speak with members of the media assembled at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte.

Speculation swirled that the Northern Irishman avoided making any public statements to the press in light of the situation with his driver leading up to the tournament. The United States Golf Association (USGA) ruled that McIlroy's driver was non-conforming. The ruling forced McIlroy to make a switch.

McIlroy's name was linked to the failed the test and eventually became public knowledge, likely via a leak. USGA policy prevents the organization from disclosing the name of any player who receives a failed test.

SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER WINS FIRST CAREER PGA CHAMPIONSHIP

McIlroy was ultimately just one of multiple competitors who was forced to make an equipment change for the PGA Championship.

Xander Schauffele, who won last year's PGA Championship, hinted that Scottie Scheffler also had to make a change.

""I think Scott is winning the tournament, and I think he switched to his backup, too,"" Schauffele told Golfweek. ""See, you don't even know, because he's so good. We can deal with it because the (equipment) reps are so good now.""

Scheffler and McIlroy are endorsed by TaylorMade. As of Sunday evening, the brand had not released a public statement about the golfer's drivers.

Schauffele said that testing every competitor's clubs helps ""protect the integrity of the field.""

""I think they should test everyone's driver,"" he said. ""It's not right to just test 50 guys. It just doesn't make sense if you're in it for the spirit (of the game). The whole point is to protect the integrity of the field. If you don't test everyone across the board, I don't think you're protecting the whole field.""

Amid the controversy, the PGA of America released a statement.

""We can confirm that the USGA was invited to do club testing at the PGA Championship, at the PGA of America's request,"" the statement read in part. ""That testing program is consistent with the same level of support that the USGA provides to the PGA Tour and other championships, as part of their regular programs for driver testing. The standard process is for about a third of the field to be randomly tested under the program. That was the case at Quail Hollow this week. Finding driver heads that have crept over the line of conformance is not an unusual occurrence, especially for clubs that are hit thousands of times over a long period of time.""

Scheffler went on to win the PGA Championship on Sunday to earn the third major victory of his career.

President Donald Trump is calling for “a major investigation” into former Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign over allegations that she paid off celebrities such as Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, and Bono to endorse her for president. 

“HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump posted on Truth Social. “WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN'T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? … AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???”

Springsteen's production company, Thrill Hill, was paid about $75,000 for “travel and production” by the Harris campaign for his October performance at one of her rallies. Beyonce's production company was paid $165,000, and Oprah Winfrey's production company was paid $1 million to cover the cost of Harris's town hall with the media personality. 

“I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Candidates aren't allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment. In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds. IT'S NOT LEGAL! For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,' this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!”

He later accused Harris of paying Beyonce $11 million for the endorsement, though that number has not been found on any Federal Election Commission reports and is unsubstantiated. 

HOW KAMALA HARRIS PLOWED THROUGH $1 BILLION

Between Oct. 17 and Election Day, Nov. 5, the Harris campaign paid entertainers nearly $900,000, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis.

Trump's post comes as Harris is mulling a bid in California's governor race. An April poll shows that 31% of California voters would back Harris, and 49% of Democrats would support her.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) issued a statement on Sunday speculating that the Mexican navy training ship that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge could have been avoided. It was an accusation that drew the ire of the Department of Homeland Security.

In a post on X, Schumer insinuated that cuts implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency could have contributed to the crash in New York City. 

“With the Brooklyn Bridge strike last night,” Schumer began his post. “I'm fighting for answers about whether Trump and DOGE have impacted water traffic control.”

Minority Leader Schumer's accusations that a hiring freeze led to the U.S. Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Services not being adequately staffed are FALSE. The US Coast Guard has been fully supported and been exempt from hiring freezes. Additionally, this incident had nothing to do… https://t.co/BR4iJX2oX9

“We know they've been meddling with U.S. Coast Guard staffing,” the senator added. “Trump relieved Admiral Linda Fagan as Commandant of the USCG, and that position is still vacant.”

Schumer didn't explain how the DOGE cuts could have contributed to the crash. The Trump administration's decision to relieve Adm. Linda Fagan is unrelated to the DOGE cuts or traffic control problems.

“And the hiring freeze has limited the ability for the USCG to staff up the Vehicle Traffic Service, that's their traffic control operation that acts like Air Traffic Control but on water,” Schumer wrote. “We need action for our national security, infrastructure protection, and public safety.”

The DHS rejected Schumer's insinuations and rebuked the senator. 

“Minority Leader Schumer's accusations that a hiring freeze led to the U.S. Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Services not being adequately staffed are FALSE,” the DHS wrote on X. “The US Coast Guard has been fully supported and been exempt from hiring freezes. Additionally, this incident had nothing to do with Vessel Traffic Services — when a ship loses propulsion in a high current area, the vessel needs to engage all capabilities to stop and ideally tugs are nearby to support.”

The DHS then questioned Schumer's knowledge of such nautical matters and criticized him for misleading people.

“We encourage Minority Leader Schumer to get his facts straight before he misleads the American people,” the DHS added.

REPUBLICANS MUSCLE THE ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' OUT OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

Initial reports of the crash do not align with Schumer's accusations. The Associated Press reported on Sunday night that “turbulent waters” might have been to blame as the vessel was operating in the East River, as a 10 mph wind gust was happening. Additionally, the ship was in an area where the “tide had just turned, and a fast current was heading up the East River.”

The National Transportation Safety Board is analyzing the details of the crash, according to the Associated Press. The investigation's results are not expected to be ready for several months. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Despite a hiccup in the Budget Committee, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Republicans deserve praise for quickly moving President Donald Trump's “one big, beautiful bill” through the committee process. It now seems on track for passage before Memorial Day.

But as much progress as the House has made toward making individual tax rates from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 permanent, spending reductions in the bill have been pushed far into the future, some of them until after Trump leaves office, while all new tax loopholes are opened immediately. It's easy to give concessions and hard to make people do what's right, but that is the job voters sent their representatives to Congress to do, and in this, they are failing. 

Both parties play games with spending programs that are notionally temporary to massage their costs down. But just because it is a bipartisan charade does not mean the GOP should get away with it this time around. The sheer number of proposed temporary measures and the delayed spending cuts would make the bill less of a landmark accomplishment and more of a temporary Band-Aid — one big, beautiful punt into Neverland.

On the spending side, two of the largest cuts have been put off until a year after Trump leaves office, and another has been pushed beyond the next midterm congressional elections. The Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied adults, which would save $301 billion over 10 years, do not apply until 2029, and the repeal of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act spending, saving $193 billion, also doesn't kick in until that year. That gives monopolist hospital chains and green energy lobbyists four more years to get the cuts reversed. States have two years to undo the bill's food stamp cost-sharing requirements, which save $128 billion and don't kick in until October 2027.

These delays are the biggest “tell” that Congress members are thinking more about retaining their jobs and the prestige of being on Capitol Hill than they are of what is good for the country. 

On the tax goodies side, Trump's campaign promise of “no tax on tips” made it into the bill, and naturally, this fiscal candy is to be made available immediately. It is, equally predictably, supposedly phased out after 2028 so that the lost revenue does not upset the math of the bill's supposed bottom line number. But who really believes that Congress, in four years, will allow the big tax hike on service workers that would take place if tips were taxed again? Trump's “no tax on Social Security” promise did not make it into the legislation, but a boosted standard deduction, raised to $4,000 for people over 64, did. Even though that policy starts immediately and runs only through 2028, it still came with a $72 billion price tag.

People who are wealthy enough to itemize their taxes but still need to take out loans for their cars will be able to deduct $10,000 a year in car interest loan payments. How expensive are these cars that people pay $10,000 a year in interest? Apparently, the Congressional Budget Office believes enough people will qualify for this new loophole that it will deliver $58 billion in benefits through 2028 before it expires.

All this fiscal chicanery is an insult to voters' intelligence and bad policy. A good tax code is simple, transparent, neutral, and stable. The TCJA moved the tax code excellently in the right direction by closing loopholes and lowering rates. Its one fault was that it was not permanent (thus being somewhat unstable), but the “one big, beautiful bill” fixes that for the individual tax rates. Unfortunately, everything else in the legislation is the opposite of good tax policy. 

IN PRAISE OF TRUMP'S MR. FIX IT, MARCO RUBIO

The legislation creates new loopholes that complicate the tax code and favor some taxpayers over others. These are almost all temporary, making the code much more unstable. 

Compromises often have to be made to pass legislation, and a perfect policy goal can become the enemy of a good policy outcome. However, as Republicans look forward to using the reconciliation process next year, we hope their final product is closer to the simplicity of the TCJA, and not the mess that has become the one big, beautiful punt.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former President Barack Obama extended his well wishes to former President Joe Biden on Sunday evening. 

Biden's office announced earlier in the day that the 46th president had received a serious prostate cancer diagnosis. Biden was Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. 

Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery.

“Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family,” Obama said in a post on X. “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery.”

During his last year in office, in his final State of the Union address in January 2016, Obama launched the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. Before the speech, Biden had been working on several initiatives with Congress to increase resources for the National Institutes of Health to try to end cancer. During the 2016 speech, Obama tasked then-Vice President Biden with an initiative to find a cure for cancer. 

“Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer,” Obama said at the time. “Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.”

Biden commenced his “Moonshot” initiative with a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, one of the world's leading cancer research facilities. Biden applauded the program's efforts and highlighted the progress that had already been made, including the breakthroughs and work at the Abramson Cancer Center.

“You're on the cusp of some breakthroughs,” Biden said then. “In my terms, not your medical terms, we are at an inflection point in the fight against cancer.”

By October 2016, Biden was leading the Cancer Moonshot Task Force and increasing the funding for cancer research at the NIH.

In 2022, while president, Biden brought back the “Cancer Moonshot” to continue working to cure cancer. The initiative focused on cutting “the cancer death rate by at least half by 2047, preventing more than four million cancer deaths, and to improve the experience of people living with and surviving cancer.” It included forming the nation's first-ever Cancer Cabinet.

Biden made pursuing a cure for cancer an important part of his work, particularly after his son, Beau Biden, died from brain cancer in January 2015.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Owner of Trump-themed shop facing eviction, ordinance violations","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3411133/owner-trump-themed-shop-local-officials/","Mon, 19 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The owner of a Trump-themed souvenir shop outside Chicago is facing off with local officials who she says are targeting her store with code violations for political reasons. 

The Trump Truth Store in the suburban Village of Huntley, about 50 miles northwest of Chicago, sells an array of “Make America Great Again” merchandise, patriotic apparel, and anti-authoritarian attire. Stationed outside the store's entrance is a life-sized inflatable of President Donald Trump. The beloved, cartoonish blow-up of the 47th president, his lips pursed as if he were mid-quip, has helped the Trump Truth Store become a staple among conservatives in the community.

It's also the subject of a brewing legal battle.

Lisa Fleischmann opened the Trump Truth Store in a small shopping strip off Route 47, a largely rural state highway running through Huntley Village, in December 2023, attracting a steady flow of Trump supporters from all over town and beyond.

A year and a half later, Fleischmann's increasingly popular Trump Truth Store could be closed down — or at least kicked out of the commercial property, known as Huntley Towers — over building code violations and citations related to local sign regulations.

According to McHenry County Circuit Court records reviewed by the Washington Examiner, the storekeeper, now facing four claims of ordinance violations and the threat of eviction, is accused of violating village signage rules and breaching multiple municipal building codes in a civil case brought by her landlord, Ricky Lynfield.

Over the past six months, the Village of Huntley has hit Ricky Lynfield with several tickets concerning code infractions that Fleischmann allegedly committed. Ricky Lynfield, in turn, is threatening to evict the Trump Truth Store's owner and operator for repeatedly refusing to abide by the company's compliance requests to take down her outdoor decor of pro-Trump paraphernalia.

The plastic POTUS look-alike and its backdrop of Trumpy flags, signs, and banners all violate the village code, according to Huntley authorities, who are arguing that their placement blocks the public right-of-way.

Fleischmann said she's sticking up for small businesses, “the little guy,” against unfair and unequally applied rules that the town selectively enforces. Fleischmann said she thinks village officials, who she said “might not be fans of Trump,” are receiving a flood of phone calls from people who don't like Trump either, spurring them to take action against her.

That's why the Trump Truth Store was singled out, Fleischmann said in an interview with the Washington Examiner. “They say it's not political. However, everything else leads to it, because they're only getting mad at me.”

She noted that many other businesses along Illinois Route 47 are able to place products outside, pointing to big-box retailers like Walmart and Ace Hardware, which had “pallets and pallets and pallets of malt” in the parking lot all winter.

The landlord's lawyer Joe Gottemoller, formerly a GOP precinct committeeman, noted that a permit is typically mandatory for these sort of “sidewalk sales” put on by the businesses Fleischmann mentioned.

“This is not about President Trump,” Gottemoller, a Republican who is also a member of the McHenry County Board, said of the eviction filing to the Washington Examiner. “This is about a woman who's decided she doesn't have to comply with the local laws.”

In a statement sent to the Washington Examiner, the Village of Huntley said the sign ordinance is “intended to preserve and enhance the village's appearance, ensure that signs are compatible with surrounding land uses and buildings, and protect public safety.” There are no other businessesin Huntley with signage similar to that of the Trump Truth Store, the statement said.

“Her sidewalk has got so much stuff that there's no place for people to walk on it,” added Gottemoller.

Fleischmann, on the other hand, said that pedestrian traffic is not obstructed in any way by the items in question. “I have people with wheelchairs that come in here every single day,” Fleischmann countered, “and no one has ever said anything that they couldn't get through.”

For Fleischmann, the eye-catching Trump inflatable is a nonnegotiable, along with the thick, vinyl banner adorning the storefront. Both bring in business, she said, the former providing a fun photo op and the latter letting patrons know that the Trump Truth Store is there.

Huntley officials said they've attempted to work with Fleischmann for the past year to installa permanent sign that complies with the village's sign ordinance. Fleischmann, however, “insists on maintaining signage in violation of the ordinance,” their statement said.

Fleischmann stressed that she does not fault her landlord, who appears to be caught in the crosshairs, for the legal feud. Rather, the village officials are to blame, she said.

“He's very young,” Fleischmann remarked. “I think he's definitely being bullied. They've just been harassing him so much. He just doesn't know what to do.”

Fleischmann said the village has been calling him nonstop in what she sees as an intimidation campaign. “It's not his battle,” she said. “It's my battle.”

Gottemoller said his client has no particular interest in forcing Fleischmann to vacate the premises.

However, “she's left him with absolutely no choice but to evict her,” he said. “He has no desire to evict her. Just go get a sign permit, for crying out loud.”

While she could move to another site, which she intends to do anyway once this ordeal is over, or even operate online, Fleischmann acknowledged, the physical presence of her brick-and-mortar locale is integral to her mission.

She had set up the Trump Truth Store in hopes of fostering a sense of community in Huntley and igniting much-needed dialogue about issues important to Illinoisans who otherwise would not openly express their political beliefs for fear of backlash.

As a supplier of pro-Trump garb, the shop encourages Trump supporters to sport such swag proudly, signaling to the “silent majority” that they are not alone.

Fleischmann's venture has received an outpouring of support from fellow conservatives. “Freedom of commerce, freedom of expression. No more shall we hide,” one Yelp reviewer in nearby Aurora wrote.

“Everybody's afraid to show which side they're on,” Fleischmann said.

Fleischmann, a self-described “Trumplican” and three-time Trump voter, has been met with pushback from political opponents since setting up shop.

“The minute I opened my doors up,” Fleischmann recalled, “they were walking into my store, going, ‘Who gave you permission to be here? What board member approved this?' I'm like, I don't need a board member to move my store. And they could not get that through their heads.”

More recently, a man sent her a picture of his genitalia, she said.

A bench trial in Fleischmann's eviction case is scheduled to take place on the morning of June 11 before Judge Suzanne C. Mangiamele, who ran as a Republican when she won the 2024 judicial circuit race.

There is a status conference on Tuesday to show the court that Fleischmann has indeed found legal counsel: Trump-aligned attorney David Shestokas, who is offering his services pro bono. In 2020, Shestokas was part of the Lawyers for Trump team in Pennsylvania, where he organized ballot-processing observers, conducted provisional ballot hearings as the president's representative before electoral boards, and collected affidavits regarding election irregularities.

Regardless of the case's outcome, Fleischmann envisions relocating to a larger retail space, a dream she had prior to this standoff. There was never a need to launch legal action against her since she had “every intention” of moving out of Huntley Towers, Fleischmann said, so the litigation seems senseless.

“You know how many kids love this store?” Fleischmann said. “If they had a choice between Chuck E. Cheese and the Trump store, so many of them would pick the Trump store.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The chainsaw ethos of President Donald Trump's cost-cutting department is giving way to a more methodical, and modest, operation as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the group's de facto head, steps back from the national spotlight.

Musk, tapped to lead Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, barreled into Washington in January with few constraints and a mandate to slash $2 trillion in spending. His staffers, a hodgepodge of young programmers and longtime confidants, embarked on a quest to cull tens of thousands of federal jobs and shutter entire agencies.

But the department soon morphed into a lightning rod of controversy. Employees were fired in blanket cuts that swept up nuclear weapons and disease outbreak personnel, prompting agencies to scramble to rehire them.

DOGE engaged in dramatic standoffs at shuttered agency buildings, repeatedly evicting leadership with the help of law enforcement.

Four months into DOGE's creation, and with Musk refocusing his attention to his business empire, his blitz has transitioned into something more orderly.

Cabinet secretaries have begun a slower consolidation of their departments without the tumult of Musk's firing spree. DOGE continues to cancel federal contracts, claiming $170 billion in savings to date, but is now doing so in coordination with agency heads.

Gone are Musk's “five things you did this week” email threats that spawned the first signs of resistance from Trump's new Cabinet.

Musk, an informal adviser to Trump and his largest 2024 donor, still plans to stay involved in DOGE and will keep his West Wing office. But his time at the fore of the department is already coming to an end, prompting existential questions about the agency.

DOGE lacks another leader with the same weight and force of personality — its acting administrator, Amy Gleason, is considered a figurehead — while the durability of his rollback will be decided in the coming months by the two other branches of government.

The Supreme Court could overturn, or side with, the federal judges who have frozen much of DOGE's work. Congress will also vote on whether to codify Musk's efforts through a series of White House rescissions requests.  

In his absence, Republicans who support Musk's vision of rooting out “waste, fraud, and abuse” have become preoccupied with other pursuits, chiefly passing Trump's tax-cut-and-border agenda.

“Is that still going on?” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said of DOGE with a smirk.

He and other members of the Senate DOGE Caucus have stopped meeting, according to several senators, after a flurry of interest in January, while Musk himself made an informal exit two weeks ago, when he gave a series of interviews with national press.

“It just doesn't have the same punch as it did at the beginning,” Cramer said. “It was so big coming out of the blocks that it's sort of like throwing a grenade in the middle of the room, and then, you know, picking all the pieces up afterwards.”

Musk still plans to devote a day or two a week to DOGE, allowing him to stretch his 130 days as a special government employee well past May, but has dedicated an increasing share of his time to his companies.

Musk's pivot came after Tesla's revenue dropped 9% in the first quarter, a three-year low fueled in part by his foray into politics.

Musk waxed philosophical about his pending departure from DOGE in an April interview with a small group of reporters, likening himself to a religious leader whose movement would survive him.

“DOGE is a way of life. Like Buddhism,” Musk told the New York Times.

“Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?” he said. “Was it not stronger after he passed away?”

Musk has struggled to live up to the grandeur of that statement. His declaration that DOGE would slash “at least” $2 trillion from the federal budget shrank to $1 trillion by the time Trump took office.

To date, the $170 billion in savings on DOGE's “Wall of Receipts” are plagued by reported inaccuracies or inflated estimates.

Yet DOGE is indisputably the brainchild of Musk and will continue to be staffed by employees plucked from his companies and Silicon Valley.

DOGE was first envisioned as a blue-ribbon-style commission that would offer recommendations to the president, with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy as its co-leader. But it quickly became a full-fledged agency guided by Musk's management style, undertaking the same deep layoffs he pursued upon taking over and rebranding Twitter.

Ramaswamy left to run for governor of Ohio on Inauguration Day, though some reports suggest Musk forced him out.

In total, Musk estimates that about 100 employees work for DOGE, with senior members leading outposts at various federal agencies. Most come from the tech sector and skew younger and male.

Staffers have focused on canceling diversity grants Musk deemed to be “woke” alongside longer-term, less controversial projects, such as modernizing the government's paper retirement system and closing unused credit card accounts.

Agencies have been instructed to coordinate with DOGE on downsizing plans, while its staffers have also begun helping immigration authorities use government datasets to track illegal migrants.

Steve Davis, who has worked for Musk since 2003, when he was one of the first employees hired at SpaceX, is considered his top lieutenant. Brad Smith, a healthcare entrepreneur, and Chris Young, a GOP political consultant, round out his leadership team.

Outside of DOGE, Musk has a natural ally in Russ Vought, the White House budget director who this month released a “skinny” budget proposing $163 billion in cuts to the federal government.

Vought has a higher profile in the Trump administration, owing to his role in Project 2025 and original stint as budget director in Trump's first term. But he has dismissed the notion that Musk will be passing the DOGE torch to him as a media fiction.

“Look, a lot of editorial writers and news reports, I think, have been over their skis with regard to me being named for DOGE,” Vought told Fox News on Wednesday, calling the department a partner to his work at the Office of Management and Budget.

Gleason, the acting administrator, manages a small subset of holdover technologists from the U.S. Digital Service, a White House department that Trump used as a shell for DOGE, according to ProPublica.

Musk's influence, nearly unchecked in the early days of Trump's second term, had begun to wane weeks before his decision to step back. The Senate confirmed most of his Cabinet secretaries by February, depriving Musk of the leadership vacuum that had given him control in the first place.

When Musk started to demand that all federal employees list five tasks they performed each week, threatening to terminate anyone who did not reply to his email, select agencies told their staff to ignore him.

Trump, facing blowback from his agency heads, then placed limits on Musk's firing spree in early March, telling them it was their decision who gets cut.  

Trump later placated an incensed Scott Bessent, the head of the Treasury Department, after Musk installed his choice for IRS administrator. That administrator was soon removed and replaced with Bessent's deputy.

The shift in power suggests a diminished role for DOGE in reorganizing the government, though it continues to push boundaries. This past week, DOGE unsuccessfully tried to embed in the Government Accountability Office and a second office on workplace rights, both of which fall under the purview of Congress.

Yet departments have also found a synergy with Musk's staffers, integrating them into agencywide overhauls that meet Trump's cost-cutting mandate.

In April, Rubio announced plans to eliminate 132 offices and 700 positions at the State Department. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a 20% reduction in the number of four-star generals and admirals.

DOGE has also inspired offshoots at the state level, with Republican governors like Florida's Ron DeSantis establishing task forces to review government spending.

It will ultimately be up to the courts to decide whether Musk's more sweeping cuts survive. The Supreme Court handed Musk a win in April, allowing his firing of probationary workers, a class of employees who lack full job protections, at six Cabinet agencies to move forward.

But there is still a second freeze on a broader class of employees. On Friday, the Trump administration asked the high court to lift that order, issued this month by a federal judge in California.

The Supreme Court is also weighing whether federal judges can impose nationwide injunctions, a type of ruling that has stymied DOGE's ability to carry out its layoffs, access government systems, and cancel federal contracts.

Republican-appointed justices, who hold a 6-3 majority on the court, appear inclined to rule in the Trump administration's favor, though litigants would still have other avenues to challenge DOGE's actions.

In Congress, DOGE could face resistance from a crop of centrist Republicans uncomfortable with the sweeping nature of DOGE's rollback. The White House has conceded its cuts will need to be approved by lawmakers and initially planned to send its first rescissions request, aimed at canceling billions in foreign aid, in late April. 

But the request has yet to be sent to Republican leadership, signaling it could face trouble in the House or Senate.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said Thursday that the White House had not indicated when it would send over its $9.3 billion package, and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), the top GOP appropriator in the Senate, predicted it would be delayed until after Trump's agenda is passed through Congress, likely in July or August.

Collins, one of two Senate Republicans to torpedo Trump's last rescission in 2018, has registered concerns about a clawback in AIDS funding.

“I think it's pretty obvious that it's being held up until after the budget resolution,” she told the Washington Examiner. 

In the meantime, Republicans deny their partnership with DOGE is over. Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL), one of the few Democrats to join the House DOGE Caucus, last week declared the group “dead,” and in a brief interview claimed Musk never involved lawmakers in its efforts.

“Look, the caucus is a complete failure. We had two meetings in five months,” he said. “We weren't included in any of the conversations. It was all done in the executive branch.”

Rep. Aaron Bean (R-FL), the co-chairman of the caucus, disputed that account, calling the trillion-plus in spending cuts wrapped into Trump's “big, beautiful bill” evidence of collaboration. He cited further consultations with Vought, Musk, and Vice President JD Vance on the rescissions.

“Rest assured, we are here for the long haul, and our work is far from finished,” Bean said.

QATAR GIVES TRUMP RED CYBERTRUCK MOTORCADE EN ROUTE TO DOHA

In his exit interview, Musk suggested that DOGE, scheduled to disband on July 4, 2026, could still achieve its more ambitious goals and might even stay active for the remainder of Trump's term. But he simultaneously conceded its success is partially out of his control, blaming the “inertia” of Washington for the modest savings thus far.

“It's sort of, how much pain is the Cabinet and this Congress willing to take? It can be done, but it requires dealing with a lot of complaints,” Musk said at the White House.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Peter identified sources of frustration and indignity that might bother virtually any German: how one navigates banking, taxation, health care, law.

Last week, Germany arrested Peter Fitzek, 59, an anti-government figure also known as King Peter I, the Son of Man, the Messiah. Historically, attempts to arrest messiahs have met with mixed results, so to stay on the safe side, the Interior Ministry not only rolled up Fitzek and three conspirators but also shut down his whole operation, known as the Kingdom of Germany. Subjects of King Peter deny the legitimacy of the Federal Republic of Germany and, over the past 13 years, have built up a counter-state with its own institutions. “In Germany, just like in the rest of the world, we have a lot of problems,” Peter told me in 2023. “These problems could not be solved in the old system, so we needed a completely new one.” A healer, a martial artist, and practitioner of dark arts, Peter has no royal lineage and instead takes his authority from the spiritual plane. The German government alleges that he ran unregulated financial systems, and they banned his group outright.

Peter was born in East Germany in 1965. East Germany was poorer than the West then and remains so decades after unification, in 1989. Its failure to catch up economically has led to resentment by many easterners, who consider themselves neglected and forgotten. The far-right Alternative for Germany party, which now controls a quarter of the seats in the German Parliament, campaigned in the East on promises to increase the region's political power. The AfD lost and was officially accused of extremism. The center-left coalition that won is now cracking down on the broader movement of eccentric political discontents. Peter, it seems, was a familiar type of East German from that generation—too old to learn the ways of the new Germany, and too ambitious to be satisfied watching others succeed where he failed. According to a profile in Bloomberg Businessweek, Peter spent his early adulthood getting outwitted in business by West Germans, originally as the bilked investor in a slot-machine racket.

When I met Peter two years ago, he had recently acquired a castle and invited me to join him there, in an annoyingly remote Saxon village called Eibenstock, near the Czech border. The journey took four hours from Berlin, and upon leaving the Autobahn and skidding around mountain roads, I began to appreciate the significance of the remoteness. Eibenstock is far from Germany's equivalent of coastal elites. It is like Montana or Idaho: You can do what you please, safe in the knowledge that few witnesses will see you doing it. It was quiet and empty with many private areas secluded by spruce and firs. I noticed a few tourists on a winter hike, and at the foot of the castle I had coffee at a tiny restaurant with the unimprovable name Goulash Cannon.

Peter came into his castle's echoing, wood-paneled entryway, sporting a ponytail, pulled back tight and short, and wearing a monogrammed shirt with the words Kingdom of Germany in gold cursive on the breast. In this respect and others, he resembled Steven Seagal, another aging martial artist with delusions of divinity and grandeur. Peter then guided me to a sparsely furnished sitting room for my royal audience. He began, unbidden, by laying out proof that his kingship had been recognized internationally. This proof took the form of boarding passes that various airlines had honored, listing his name as “Peter of Germany.” He had a “Kingdom of Germany” passport that looked official enough, and had passed inspection, he said, at various borders. All of the airline documents I saw were from within the Schengen area, which means he could travel freely anyway. An airline agent had probably rolled his eyes and let him board his flight to Majorca. When I think of entities capable of conferring royal status, I do not think of Ryanair.

His education, he said, began under the tutelage of a contract killer he met in 1989. The man understood spirituality, Peter said, and knew how to hypnotize people and take their money. Peter read up on magic, philosophy, religion, history, and finally law, before he concluded that there was an “order to creation,” something beautiful and true, an existence freed of the corruption and disappointment of the Federal Republic of Germany. “I slowly became aware that there is a Creator,” he told me, and that this Creator had endowed him with spiritual powers that proved his divine right to rule. “I have sat as near to God as you sit to me right now,” he said. He determined that “true Christianity has never existed,” and that he had been sent to establish it. He fell in love with a woman who could move objects with her mind and set them on fire; he spent time with holy men in India; he discovered cold fusion; satanists detected his growing powers and sent assassins after him. “I am lord of the spirits. I have an invisible army. I cannot be harmed.”

At first, he said, he tried to improve German democracy by working within the system. “Before I founded the Kingdom of Germany, I ran as a candidate for the Bundestag. I had previously talked to a lot of members of the Bundestag as well as members of the state parliament for many, many hours,” Peter told me. He said he saw how decisions were made—and how fruitless was any hope of changing a system that had grown beyond the ability of even the most patient citizen to affect. “The system interlocks in others,” he said. “It is a nested system, where you can't change individual segments because then they don't fit with the rest.”

Foremost among his frustrations were the modern bureaucracies that seemed designed not to serve citizens and help them prosper but to frustrate and enslave them. “The health system, the pension system, the monetary system, and the banks all have problems,” he told me. “They cannot be solved in the system. So a new one has to be started.”

He said he examined the law and found that the position of Kaiser, supposedly abolished, remained vacant. All it needed was a suitable claimant—and having been anointed by the Creator, he claimed legal succession in 2009. “We had to claim this legal succession if we wanted to establish a new system throughout Germany and not do what the Allies, the Americans, imposed on us,” Peter said. Photos of his official coronation in 2012 show him in faux-ermine robes.

“We in the Kingdom of Germany take the view that there is a divine order of creation,” Peter said. “The state should be a reflection of this order of creation, and should be a completely just society or community, like nothing hitherto seen on this planet.” He conducted seminars for his followers, to show off his and his fire-starter girlfriend's ability to leave their bodies, perform feats of physiological impossibility like slowing their heartbeats, and commune with the archangels Uriel and Metatron. To see this is to believe, he said. “The Creator sent me here to be able to establish the Kingdom, and people can choose freely whether to join.” In 2016, the state imprisoned him for taking supporters' money in what appeared to be a totally unregulated banking scheme. An appeals court freed him after two years, and he insisted to me that his willingness to go to prison proved his divinity. “Only someone who has been called by God does that.”

Under Peter's watch, the Kingdom practiced a kind of primitive democracy, with—crucially—a banking and insurance system totally disconnected from that of the rest of the world. But the details of how Peter ran his kingdom are irrelevant, if colorful. He said the Kingdom will choose his successor by election. “My son, for example, will not succeed me,” he told me, unless the young man exhibits supernatural powers like his father's and convinces other citizens of his eligibility.

Peter had identified sources of frustration and indignity that might bother virtually any German: how one navigates banking, taxation, health care, law. People of much greater education and sophistication than Peter have found themselves at the mercy of these systems, and treated most heartlessly by them. Germans have a slang term, Überzwerg, which means “head dwarf,” and refers to the petty tyrants in modern bureaucracies who ruin your day by demanding forms in triplicate and inflict other minor hassles that keep you from getting something as simple as a credit card issued or a cavity filled. Navigating modern, complex bureaucratic states is difficult but comes easier if you had an elite education in a big city—the Überzwergs' natural environment.

To people without this background, and who fail in business or politics in consequence, others' success may look like the result of magic, fraud, or conspiracy. Peter resorted to at least the first of these and probably all three. In his castle, he described spiritual warfare with ghosts and devils. Who is an Überzwerg but a devil sent to torment you—and in the cruelest way, by taking human form and swearing up and down that he is no devil at all, only the most mundane creature, with a nameplate on his desk and a time clock on his wall? And if you discover that you are living in a premodern, enchanted world, why not go all the way and declare yourself king by divine right?

The direction our conversation took next was as predictable as it was repulsive. Peter's ultimate prescription to treat the diseased system of money and power was to get rid of the cabal of satanic Jews that has taken over the world outside his Kingdom. He said he did not mind Jews per se but objected to the usurers and tricksters who start and encourage all the world's great wars, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine; who deny his status as their redeemer; and who are conspiring to steer us all to the apocalypse.

Peter had my attention when he talked about pyrokinesis, and he had my sympathies when grousing about bureaucracy. But Jews run the world through a network of banks and Chabad houses is the most tired claim an extremist (especially a German one) can make. It was then that I lost interest and started thinking about whether the Goulash Cannon would still be loaded and ready to fire a late lunch into my face. On the way out the door, Peter stamped my passport with a Kingdom of Germany royal seal and signed it with a scribble: Peter I, Son of Man, Imperator.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

“Turbo cancer” claims are back.

It took just a few hours for devotees of the “Make America healthy again” movement to question former President Joe Biden's prostate-cancer diagnosis. Tumors of the prostate are the most common serious malignancy identified in men: Even aggressive ones like Biden's are diagnosed roughly 25,000 times a year in the United States. Although Biden's condition is conventional, a certain segment of the public has been beguiled into blaming mainstream medicine for every unexpected death or health-related tragedy it comes across. The anti-vaccine community, including the group formerly led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has spent years promoting the idea that mRNA vaccines for COVID regularly push tumors into overdrive. (Rare anecdotes aside, there is no evidence to support this fear.) Now, predictably, the claim is cropping up again on social media. “Prostate cancer takes years to metastasize to bone unless super aggressive or turbo cancer,” the Kennedy-endorsed physician Craig Wax suggested.

That an 82-year-old man who had aged out of prostate-cancer-screening tests has been found to have an advanced malignancy should not be surprising. In my experience as a doctor who diagnoses cancer, many tumors are discovered out of the blue. Prostate cancer in particular may not become apparent until an individual goes to his doctor with a minor complaint—in Biden's case, urinary symptoms, according to the announcement—only to have further testing discover the worst. (Biden's cancer isn't curable; people with Stage 4 disease like his live for about three years on average—although the outlook is worse for men who are more than 80 years old.)

Cancer is an enigmatic disease, one that is simultaneously influenced by genetics, environment, personal habits, the aging process, and—not to be discounted—bad luck. But its muddled nature can be uncomfortable for those who share the view that nearly all sickness is preventable with virtuous behavior and a clean environment. According to Kennedy, the current leader of the U.S. health-care system, tumors are a product of not only the vaccines in our arms, but also the fluoride in our water, the toxins in our school lunches, the signals from our phones, and surely many other ubiquitous aspects of modernity. Indeed, in MAHA land, cancer is not just a misfortune, but a cover-up. Before he became health secretary, Kennedy ominously suggested that doctors might find its cause in the “places they dare not look.”

It's not just Kennedy. Trump's health-care team routinely draws from the logic of this wellness-paranoia complex. Last year, Marty Makary, who has since become the FDA commissioner, told a group of MAHA wellness influencers convened by Senator Ron Johnson that cancer is a consequence of “low-grade chronic inflammation” induced by a poisoned food supply. (Years ago, he also speciously declared that undetected medical errors were a leading cause of death.) Casey Means, Trump's new nominee for surgeon general, has claimed that “the biggest lie in healthcare” is that high blood sugar, malignant tumors, and clogged arteries “are totally different diseases requiring separate doctors and pills for life.” The truth is “simpler than we are told,” she said. (Buy her book to find out what it is.) And Mehmet Oz, the former lifestyle guru and current Medicare administrator, recently informed Americans, “It's your patriotic duty to be as healthy as you can. It's our job to help you get there, make it easy to do the right things.” Never mind that you can do everything right and still get sick. (For now, none of the administration's major health officials has weighed in on Biden's diagnosis.)

Read: Did a famous doctor's COVID shot make his cancer worse?

Joe Biden is no stranger to tough luck. His son Beau died of a brain tumor at age 46 in 2015, leading to Biden's participation in a government-funded “cancer moonshot” to combat the condition. The moonshot initiative was an old-fashioned approach to medicine, one that sought to ameliorate illness through advances in science and technology. RFK Jr. and his MAHA acolytes are naturally suspicious of this approach. Now their weird discomfort with disease—and their outré views on cancer in particular—is being refracted through a sea of false, indecent speculations. No, Biden's cancer was not “courtesy of the mRNA shot.” One can only hope that the government's bevy of vaccine skeptics will be able to resist the siren's call to join in saying otherwise.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The cartoonist has spent a lifetime worrying. In a new graphic novel, she finds something like solace.

Listen to more stories on hark

In the opening scene of Spent, billed on its cover as a “comic novel,” Alison Bechdel's cartoon avatar, also named Alison, has rearranged her sock drawer in an effort to stave off “the feeling of impending doom.” Ever since she was born on the page four decades ago, Bechdel's fictional self has regularly journeyed between insecure and panicked, conveyed by the artist through subtle downturns in her tiny dash of a mouth. She perseverates about impending nuclear war, environmental disaster, “patriarchal death culture,” girlfriends cheating on her, the local gay bookstore where she works closing down.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

For fans who have followed Bechdel from underground lesbian cartoonist in the 1980s to best-selling author of Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic, and then watched with amazement as her life on the page went 3-D in a multiple–Tony Award–winning musical, the doom-tinged update in Spent will not come as a shock: She can still get pretty freaked out.

Bechdel's latest title refers to late-stage capitalism, the semi-facetious frame for the book (which is broken into “episodes” titled “The Commodity,” “The Process of Exchange,” and so on), but like almost everything else in her graphic storytelling, the title is also self-referential: It describes her age and her state of exhaustion, and perhaps hints at a concern that aging lesbians might not command much of an audience. Cartoon Alison now has lines under her eyes and graying hair, though otherwise she looks more or less as she did 40 years ago: butch haircut, eyes wide and worried, hunched shoulders, and, even in her 60s, the air of a teenage boy who does and doesn't want to be picked for the team.

So imagine my surprise when, toward the end of Spent, after Alison has suffered through months of writer's block, a public-speaking flop, an awkward trip to Hollywood, an encounter with her Donald Trump–loving sister, and a couple of anxiety dreams, I came to this caption (spoiler alert): “Alison experiences an unfamiliar sensation. Could it be … happiness?”

The last scene, a full double-page drawing, finds Alison sitting on the grass at sunset outside her Vermont house, watching a bird do loops in the sky. If you look closely at the reclining figure, you can see that her mouth is unmistakably upturned. Over the decades, I've come to know the many moods of Bechdel's avatar, and not all are dark. There's also sardonic, horny, intellectually lit up. But relaxed? That brand of happiness feels new, and now ? Signs of real-world doom crop up everywhere in Spent, including in Alison's dreams. Yet as the novel winds down, a palpable calm arrives.

Bechdel's gift as an artist is evoking the spirit of the moment through expressions, gestures, the way two bodies lean subtly toward or away from each other. More often than not, her scenes feel too claustrophobic to linger on. But this one is a wide and soothing expanse of tamed nature, and I studied it closely for clues. Up the hill stands a barn, sturdy and welcoming, and nearby, playful goats are happily entertaining themselves. The birds are chirping (“twittertwittertwitter,” “peent!,” “twitter”). The reeds in the foreground look like they're dancing. Alison is with her girlfriend, Holly, surrounded by friends. I felt at first confused, then seduced, and ultimately … jealous? What does Alison Bechdel know that we don't? And how, for all these years, in a remote corner of Vermont and mostly stuck in her own head, has she figured out just what to say to the rest of us?

Bechdel began publishing her comic series Dykes to Watch Out For in the '80s, the same decade that Alan Moore's Watchmen and Art Spiegelman's Maus appeared. Graphic novel was just emerging as a term (Moore dismissed it as pompous marketing-speak for “Big Expensive Comics”). The men were writing and drawing about war and murder; Bechdel wanted to focus on her friends. She has given several explanations over the years for why she landed on DTWOF, all of them personal: Comics still had something of an outsider aura that resonated with the lesbian separatist crowd she hung out with. Also, comics did not resonate with her highbrow mother, an English teacher and a talented amateur pianist. But mostly Bechdel talks about being unable to find her own quotidian queerness reflected in any artistic form, so she created one.

The strip, which was serialized in more than 50 alternative newspapers for 25 years, could be as soapy as Friends and Sex and the City, but with a lot fewer men and meat products, and almost no shopping. The Alison character, the neurotic hub of the collective, went by “Mo.” Coming of age in an unnamed midwestern city, she and her activist friends had sex, broke up, ate Szechuan vegetable pulp, and complained about the “Republican lynch mob.” When Mo would have panic attacks, her friends would suggest that she “cut back on the Earl Grey.” In “The Rule,” which ran in 1985 and soon inspired a cultural trope, two women discuss what movie to see, and one lists her three requirements: It has to feature at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. This became known as the Bechdel Test, and no matter how many times Bechdel says that the list was a joke, Reddit still loves it. (In the strip, by the way, the pair can't find such a movie, so they go home.)

By the end of Dykes to Watch Out For's run, in 2008, a gay character was the lead in one of the aughts' most popular network sitcoms, and gay marriage had been legalized in two states. For decades, Bechdel had captured queer life with pitch-perfect mocking-insider's affection, and then she made a career turn that might have seemed a cultural retreat of sorts: She decided to let Mo morph into “Alison,” the protagonist of a pair of family memoirs. But the more Bechdel turned inward, the more famous she got, and along the way, fame gave her something new to feel ambivalent, even panicked, about.

Read: Call it the ‘Bechdel-Wallace Test'

Nothing about the central, bewildering tragedy in Bechdel's 2006 breakout, Fun Home, suggests an obvious mainstream hit: In 1980, months after 19-year-old Alison came out as a lesbian to her parents, her father, who'd been sleeping with men but hiding it, got hit by a truck—or, Bechdel intimates, put himself in the path of a truck. But Bechdel achieved the alchemy of memoir at its best, making her singular experience so specific and vivid that it became generalizable.

Although she didn't call it that, her subject was emotional neglect. Early on, we learn that her father was “monomaniacal” in his dedication to restoring the old Gothic Revival house they lived in. If one of the children couldn't hold up a mirror or a giant Christmas tree long enough to suit their decorator father, he might hit them. “I grew to resent the way my father treated his furniture like children, and his children like furniture,” Bechdel wrote. She portrayed a man besieged by his own demons, and then, in Are You My Mother? A Comic Drama (2012), a mother who couldn't be bothered to pay attention. And who among us can't relate to some version of parental dysfunction? A bit later, her sometimes-exhausting internal monologues arrived on Broadway in song form, which aired out the neurosis. The effect was to turn Fun Home into a gentler story of self-discovery.

Spent is not technically autobiographical, although I've come to think of it loosely as the third in a trio of memoirs: Moving beyond Bechdel's biological family, it revolves around her chosen family, which feels genuinely more fun and more like home. The main character is, again, Alison. Her girlfriend shares the name Holly with Bechdel's real-life partner (Holly Rae Taylor), and the setting is Vermont, where they actually live. But Holly's job has been tweaked, and their friend circle consists of various fictional characters from DTWOF—older now, some saddled with jobs and progeny, all as libidinous as ever—who live together in a group house as part of a “longitudinal study on communal living” (invented, as far as I know, but perfectly plausible in Vermont).

While the group house cycles through comic sexual and domestic dramas, Alison is nearby nursing her most recent anxiety—her growing fame. Bechdel isn't purely making this up: Taylor has remarked in the past that Bechdel craves fame, even as she finds that craving pathetic—and she's astute enough to know that famous people lamenting the burdens of fame are insufferable. So in this latest version of her avatar, she's created an Alison whose dilemma parodies contemporary celebrity culture, while also parodying herself, the author.

Read: Alison Bechdel's sad, funny, sprawling memoir Are You My Mother?

In the novel version, her memoir hasn't been turned into a brilliant Broadway musical but has instead become a schlocky TV series controlled by a showrunner who loves explosions and dragons. Alison's friends at the group house invite her over to watch episodes together (“Hollywood in da house!”), and she sits cross-armed on the couch, looking miserable. In the meantime, Holly (an artist and the owner of a composting-bin company in real life) is getting ever more famous through her viral wood-chopping videos, which both annoys Alison and makes her jealous, particularly as people in their Vermont town start to recognize Holly first. (The caption of Alison's dream one night: “Must … generate … content …”)

To escape the pain of having her name linked to commodified junk, Alison decides to write her own television series, and lands on the idea of a reality-TV approach to showing “people how to free themselves from the grip of consumer capitalism and live a more ethical life!” Out in Hollywood, her pitch to all the major networks initially seems to be a hit, and the grip of the entertainment complex only tightens. Over at the group house, the queers continue to protest and organize, all the while still obsessing over sexual arrangements that we now call bisexual polycules.

Which one of these worlds—the capitalist vortex or the polycule-friendly group house—is more real? Life at the house seems more entertaining, but is that just a foolish fantasy designed to trick us into thinking that there is safe harbor somewhere? Or even worse, a dangerous fantasy at a time when funding a longitudinal study on communal living could get your whole university canceled? I started to wonder where Bechdel was leading us. Read too much news and you're in the vortex. Retreat too much and you're lost in a bubble. Or maybe that's just black-and-white thinking, as therapists like to say. Maybe what she has learned over time, which many of us haven't quite, is that although you can never outrun your own anxiety, you'll never be sorry about taking a break from your own head to indulge in some friend drama next door.

Four decades ago, Bechdel stumbled into chronicling an outsider niche during the Reagan era, and she has since grown into a lesbian icon on a national stage. She weathered the AIDS crisis, has witnessed the Obergefell v. Hodges watershed and the mainstreaming of RuPaul, and now finds herself in a country where state lawmakers are trying to undo gay marriage. In Spent, she shows Alison alone at her desk trying to work on her next book, but instead obsessively Googling marauding militias, monkeypox, Musk. Meanwhile, at the group house, they take turns weighing in on the train wreck that is modern politics while playing a rollicking game of cards. “I see your abortion pill ban …” says one player, “and I raise you armed white supremacists protesting drag queen story hour in Ohio!”

Maybe if you and your friends have been worrying and talking about the patriarchal death spiral for decades, you've built up more stamina than the average person. You've probably learned by your 60s that you can't stop the spiral, or stop fretting about it either. You have, though, discovered that solidarity can really help (even if you're not the most sociable person)—and that you can show the rest of us that working the worry into a game of cards with old friends once in a while is more than fine.

“Where had her youthful idealism gone?” Alison asks herself at one point, a question in the air these days. Bechdel's trajectory suggests an answer: Idealism is still simmering, especially in a rich life lived among others, and it's still there partly because it isn't necessarily a drop-everything call to gear up for crisis. Even as Bechdel gets more famous, and the world keeps spinning forward and backward, her real life hasn't changed much. She has remained a semi-loner who sticks to a rigid routine in rural Vermont, which includes making morning coffee for Holly; tirelessly photographing herself in positions she intends to draw; working long hours at her desk, only sometimes productively—and watching her world.

From the July/August 2014 issue: Why are all the cartoon mothers dead?

A graphic novelist, unlike a regular novelist, has to leave room for the pictures. The neurotic inner monologue can take up only so much of the page. The cartoon Alison is situated in a space outside herself, with Holly, and goats, and neighbors. On that last, restful page of Spent, the caption reads: “And she knows that whatever happens in those coming days, she will get by with a little help from her annoying, tenderhearted, and utterly luminous friends.” Mind you, these are not Bechdel's real friends. They are creations she's lived with for decades. In that way, though, they are just as concrete as her actual friends, and still standing after all these years, just like the trees, the reeds, and the birds. Still standing.

Ukrainians are confident that they can continue fighting, even without the same level of American support.

On Saturday, I asked Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, in western Ukraine, whether he expected the Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul to lead to a cease-fire. “No,” he told me. Later, I asked the audience at the Lviv Media Forum whether any of them expected a cease-fire soon. About 200 journalists and editors were in the room. No one raised their hand. Many laughed.

Over several days in Lviv I didn't meet anybody who believed that the Russian president wants to end the war, or that he will negotiate to do so in Istanbul. Ukrainian reasoning is straightforward: Vladimir Putin has never said he wants to end the war. The propagandists on Russian state television have never said they want to end the war. The Russian negotiating team in Istanbul did not say it wanted to end the war. On the contrary, the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, told the Ukrainians, “We fought Sweden for 21 years. How long are you ready to fight?” (The Great Northern War, to which Medinsky was presumably referring, concluded in 1721. Also, Medinsky is best-known not for any battlefield heroics but for rewriting school textbooks).

At the same meeting, the Russians demanded that Ukraine withdraw from land that Ukraine controls; threatened to annex more provinces, something they have been trying and failing to do for three years; and insulted a member of the Ukrainian delegation, who lost a nephew in the fighting. “Maybe some of those sitting here at the table will lose more of their loved ones,” Medinsky sneered.

Ukrainians find none of this surprising, because they have been listening to this kind of language for three years. What they do find surprising is the American president's tolerance for what looks to them like open mockery. President Donald Trump says he wants a peace negotiation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepared for a peace negotiation. The Russian president turned it into a farce, and will likely proceed with the farce, stringing out Trump for as long as possible and agreeing to more phone calls and meetings in order to avoid new sanctions, distract attention from Russia's ongoing war crimes, and make the U.S. appear weak.

Tetiana Kotelnykova: I've seen how this plays out for Ukraine

I will not here offer a full explanation for why Trump does not understand the game that Putin is playing, one that is obvious to absolutely everyone else. I will note only that Trump repeatedly misunderstands Putin, overrates his alleged friendship with Putin, and often attributes to Putin motives that are really his own. “Putin is tired of this whole thing,” Trump said on Fox News. “He's not looking good. And he wants to look good.” In reality, it is Trump who is tired of “this whole thing,” Trump who's not looking good, and Trump who wants to look good.

Putin, meanwhile, has redirected his entire economy toward military production, in the manner of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany. He has created a regime so repressive that people are afraid to use the word war in public. He regularly sacrifices hundreds or even thousands of men to gain 100 yards of territory. What that looks like to other people can hardly be of much interest to him.

For all of those reasons, Ukrainians believe the war will continue, and the prospect no longer scares them. Partly this is because they have no other choice. Unlike the Russians, who could withdraw from the battlefield and go home at any time, the Ukrainians cannot withdraw from the battlefield. If they do, they will lose their civilization, their language, and their freedom. Under Russian occupation, the mayor of Lviv and the journalists at the Lviv Media Forum would end up in prison or dead, just like their murdered and imprisoned colleagues in Russian-occupied Ukraine today.

More to the point, Ukrainians are confident that they can continue fighting, even without the same level of American support. The Ukrainian army is not retaking territory, as it did in the autumn of 2022, nor does it have plans for a major new counteroffensive. But neither is it losing. The tanks and heavy equipment that Ukraine needed from others don't matter as much as they did two years ago. The Ukrainians still need American intelligence and anti-missile defenses to protect civilians in their cities. They still get weapons and ammunition from Europe. But on the front line, this conflict has become a drone war, and Ukraine both produces drones—more than 2 million last year, probably twice that many this year—and builds software and systems to run them. In February, a Ukrainian unit deployed the first of what it hopes will be several hundred fighting robots. Last month, a Ukrainian sea drone took down a Russian airplane. One brigade has designed a drone that can reliably take out a Shahed, the Iranian drones that are used to kill Ukrainian civilians.

Phillips Payson O'Brien: Heads, Ukraine loses. Tails, Russia wins.

The Russians have also ramped up drone production, and in that sense this war truly is an arms race. But the Ukrainians, for the moment, are making up for their narrower resources with greater accuracy. In April, Ukrainian drone brigades reported hitting 83,000 Russian targets—vehicles, people, artillery, radar, and other objects—which is 5 percent more than the number they said they hit in March. The army now runs contests, measuring which brigades hit the most targets with the greatest accuracy. More resources go to the winners, creating more incentives to innovate.

The results are visible on the ground. Remember, if you can, the panic that accompanied news reports from Ukraine nine months ago: The city of Pokrovsk was about to fall, a calamity that many believed might precipitate the collapse of the whole front line. But Pokrovsk did not fall. The Russians continue to attack that region: On May 15 alone, Ukrainian soldiers based on the Pokrovsk front line repelled 74 separate assaults and offensive actions. But in recent months, the front line has hardly moved.

All of that helps explain the nonchalance, even the humor, with which many Ukrainians now talk about the war, as well as their assumption that they will keep fighting no matter what happens. While in Lviv, I also went to visit Superhumans, one of the city's two rehabilitation centers for veterans and war victims. Like the front line, this is also a place of innovation and ambition. Perhaps this will sound strange, but I also found it to be a place of optimism and hope: A brand-new, well-designed facility where technicians make bespoke artificial limbs, surgeons restore hearing and vision, and experts in movement and psychology help badly injured people readjust.

Tom Nichols: Trump's plan to sell out Ukraine to Russia

The rest of Ukrainian society has also readjusted. Even the border guards have readjusted. Three years ago, in the spring of 2022, the train journey from Warsaw to Kyiv was long and stressful. The train stopped and started, taking a circular route to avoid bombed-out tracks. Customs officials at the border spoke tersely, tensely, asking questions about passports and purpose. On the return, volunteers were waiting to help process Ukrainian refugees, some boarding trains to hand out sandwiches.

Last week I again crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border twice, this time in a car. On the way into Ukraine, we waited a few minutes for border guards to look at our passports and check their computers. They told jokes, smiled, and then waved us on. No one was terse or tense, because no one is anxious or afraid. On the way back there were no refugees or volunteers. No one gave us sandwiches.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Trump is promising tax cuts and a new golden age. Here's what's really inside it.

by  Andrew Prokop

President Donald Trump's second term has so far been dominated by his aggressive use of executive power — but now, he's finally trying to get something through Congress.

This week, Republicans in the House of Representatives will attempt to pass what Trump has deemed the “one big, beautiful bill.” It is the centerpiece — really, the only major piece — of Trump's legislative agenda. He's trying to stuff everything he wants into this, in hopes of ramming it through both the House and Senate on a party line vote. 

Trump wants a few main things from the bill. First is preventing the “Trump tax cuts” he passed back in 2017 from expiring at the end of the year. Second is passing, in some form, a bunch of new tax breaks he promised during the campaign, such as “no tax on tips.” Third is spending a bunch more money on immigration enforcement and the military. Fourth is an increase in the debt ceiling (the limit on new debt the government can issue, which Congress periodically has to agree to raise).

All this is quite expensive, so how will Republicans pay for it? Mostly, they won't: The vast majority of it will be unpaid for and just increase the debt, while other costs will be hidden with gimmicks. But the House GOP has proposed paying for some with deep cuts to Medicaid, clean energy, student loans, and food stamps, among other areas.

The problem is that Republicans have narrow majorities in both chambers and deep disagreements on policy. Fiscal hawks are demanding deeper spending cuts. Some Republicans have complained about the Medicaid cuts; others dislike the clean energy cuts. One key group is demanding the rollback of a Trump tax hike that mostly hit affluent people in blue states back in 2017 — an expensive change that would blow up the bill's budget math.

So right now, the big, beautiful bill is a big, ugly mess. But even if Republicans resolve their differences and pass something, it may not get much prettier. Trump is proceeding as if we're still in the low-inflation, low interest-rate environment of the 2010s. But things are different now, and running up the deficit yet again may have some painful economic consequences.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

Let's walk through what's in the House version of the bill, starting with the big things Trump and Republicans want.

In his first year as president in 2017, Trump's major legislative accomplishment was his tax bill that lowered rates for most people. To make that bill look less costly, Republicans used the time-honored trick of setting those new lower tax rates to expire eventually — at the end of 2025. 

So if Congress does nothing, most Americans' income taxes would increase next year. Because this would be quite unpopular, the political world believes this extension is by far the most likely provision to make it into the final bill. It's a “must pass.”

Policy-wise, keeping these lower tax rates in place is nothing new, it just continues the (irresponsible) status quo. From a budgetary perspective, though, it's by far the most expensive thing in the bill — it would increase the deficit by about $4 trillion over the next decade. 

During the campaign, Trump promised to do various nice-sounding things, including ending taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security income. House Republicans' bill tries to at least somewhat make good on these promises, adding new tax deductions for tipped income and overtime income, and a higher standard deduction for seniors.

But because these are expensive, the GOP is playing even more blatant games with the budget math than usual: They're setting these new tax breaks to expire at the end of 2028. Basically, Trump is creating a huge budget mess for his successor to clean up (as a Simpsons episode predicted he would back in 2000).

There's one more twist here. Trump funded the old 2017 tax bill in part by hiking taxes on affluent blue-state people, by sharply limiting the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. House Republicans from New York and California have long loathed this policy and they're pushing hard to roll it back as much as they can. The problem is that doing so is very expensive, so GOP leaders are resisting.

Then there's Trump's new spending priorities: immigration and military spending. Trump wants about $50 billion for his border wall and other border facilities, and billions more for US Customs and Border Protection. He also wants money for his planned “Golden Dome” missile defense shield, shipbuilding, munitions, and other military priorities.

The debt ceiling is the legal limit on new debt the US government can issue; every few years we get close to hitting it, and Congress has to raise it — or else risk an economic crisis if we do hit it. This typically leads to bipartisan negotiations, posturing, and in some cases high-stakes political showdowns. 

Trump is not interested in dealing with Democrats on this, so he's just throwing it in this bill. (Doing this adds another element of urgency to try to force squabbling Republicans to unite: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the debt ceiling must be raised by mid-July.)

Over the next decade, extending the old Trump tax cuts would cost about $4 trillion. Plus, his new tax breaks (for four years) and his military and border spending, would cost another $1 trillion — so the cost of the bill is about $5 trillion.

Most of this, again, just won't be paid for. But Republicans are proposing some spending cuts to pay for some of it — a little less than half. Their top targets are Medicaid, clean energy, student loans, and food stamps.

The House GOP proposed new Medicaid policies that, in practice, would amount to steep cuts and make more than 7 million people uninsured, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

These policies include work requirements for Medicaid recipients (who aren't seniors, pregnant, disabled, or caregivers). They also include several other new requirements for paperwork and eligibility checks. Critics say that these added hurdles will inevitably result in many rightfully qualifying recipients losing their coverage — and argue that that is likely the point.

The bill also would punish states that use their own money to fund health coverage for unauthorized immigrants by cutting their federal Medicaid funds. (Fourteen mostly blue states and the District of Columbia currently fund coverage for children even if they are undocumented.) 

The House bill would roll back many of the new tax credits that the Biden administration created for clean energy, including credits for electric vehicles, clean power production, energy efficiency, and even nuclear power. Critics say this could badly hurt or even decimate a booming industry, and that it would hurt the fight against climate change by marking low or zero-carbon energy more expensive.

The bill also overhauls the student loan program, creating bigger and costlier requirements for repayment of loans, limiting future loan availability, and ending certain loan or repayment programs.

Finally, the House GOP is also proposing deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps. It would require states to start paying a share of the program's costs — between 5 percent and 25 percent, depending on their payment error rates. It would also expand work requirements, already in place for many recipients, to 55- to 64-year-olds.

Many of these cuts are controversial, even among some Republicans, and it's unclear which will make it into the final version of the bill. But currently, House GOP fiscal hawks are saying all this isn't enough, and they're demanding even steeper cuts, saying it would be completely irresponsible to add so much to the deficit otherwise.

While many of the cuts they're proposing would target the most vulnerable and seem cruel, they have a point about the deficit. Trump and GOP leaders are proceeding as if conditions are similar to 2017 — a time when interest rates were low, inflation was low, and Trump could pass a big deficit-increasing tax cut bill with few negative economic consequences. And indeed, both parties have tuned out warnings about the deficit and debt for years.

But conditions have changed. The US just went through a period of its highest inflation in decades. Interest rates remain high, in an attempt to prevent such inflation from roaring back. US Treasury bond rates are also high, which many interpret as signaling investors are concerned about the budget deficit. Years of big spending are adding up, and interest payments on the debt are rising.

All that is to say that a big budget-busting bill could be much more damaging to the economy than it was in 2017. And yet Republicans appear to be going full steam ahead anyway. It remains to be seen whether they can actually come to an agreement and pass a bill — but even if they do pull it off, they should be wary of getting what they wish for.

The competing visions for good child care, explained.

by  Rachel Cohen

America's lack of affordable child care has brought a long-simmering question to a boil: What exactly makes child care “good”? 

Everyone wants quality care for kids, and the need for child care or preschool to be considered “high quality” has been embraced by researchers, providers, parents, and policymakers for years. But with rising costs and uneven availability, parents, providers, and policymakers find themselves increasingly divided over whether “quality” should be measured by caregivers' credentials or by toddlers' happiness, by structured learning outcomes, or by parent preference. 

Progressives generally champion credentialed and well-paid teachers, academic standards, and standardized ratings as essential for aiding children's development. Conservatives counter that such requirements inflate costs while devaluing the nurturing care that parents and community caregivers provide.

The answer to the question of what “quality” means shapes everything from household budgets to workforce participation to children's school readiness — yet there is no clear consensus on what exactly that entails or how to measure it.

“People know it when they see it, but it's hard to define,” said Josh McCabe, director of social policy at the Niskanen Center think tank.

As regulations shift with political winds, the question has become more salient: Who defines quality, and at what cost to kids, families, and society?

States have sought ways to measure, improve, and communicate the components of quality to parents and providers alike. Their solution: developing rating systems that attempt to boil aspects of child care settings down into simple metrics, much like hotel or restaurant reviews.

Over the past two decades, such Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) have become the primary method for assessing child care quality. These systems, which vary significantly across states, award ratings based on multiple dimensions, including teacher qualifications (such as holding a child development associate credential or a degree in early childhood education); learning environments (including safe teacher-to-child ratios, classroom cleanliness, and availability of age-appropriate books and toys); administrative practices (like documented emergency procedures and business management systems), and the caliber of child-adult interactions (measured through classroom observations). 

By 2020, nearly all states had implemented some form of QRIS, though participation remains voluntary in many areas. These systems vary widely — some use star ratings (one to five stars), others use tiers or categories. States prioritize different elements: Some emphasize school readiness, others focus on health and safety, cultural responsiveness, or infant and toddler care. Financial incentives also differ, with states offering a variety of supports, technical assistance, and bonuses for higher scores.

The evidence is mixed, though, on whether these ratings actually predict better outcomes for children. “If we're looking at what supports children's well-being and development, it's the quality of the interactions, the relations with the caregiver,” Steven Barnett, senior director of the National Institute for Early Education Research, told me. Yet these critical interactions carry relatively little weight in some QRIS systems, overshadowed by structural features that are easier to quantify and less costly to implement. 

The QRIS ratings nonetheless drive real behavior. “The scoring matters in that providers and parents react to it,” McCabe said. “But like the US News and World Report rankings, I don't know if it actually makes them better colleges or students.”

A 2019 Department of Education study found that children who attended higher-rated programs according to QRIS did not have better developmental outcomes than those attending lower-rated ones. This echoed earlier research that found that the overall QRIS ratings were less predictive of child learning than a single measure of teacher-child interactions.

“Quality, in some sense, can take many different forms, and perhaps it should, because child care and early learning is not one-size-fits-all.”

Further research found “little evidence” that adopting QRIS in Head Start improved quality when measured against the Head Start Program Performance Standards — the quality benchmarks the federal preschool programs must meet. QRIS showed no significant boost to teacher qualifications or teacher-child interactions. More troublingly, research found that QRIS adoption actually increased annual teacher turnover — potentially undermining the very stability that quality programs need.

These rating systems can also create a troubling cycle, said Hailey Gibbs, associate director of early childhood policy at the Center for American Progress. Lower-rated programs receive fewer resources, making it even harder for them to improve. Gibbs notes there's “valid criticism” that QRIS systems often lack cultural sensitivity and tend to disregard the perspectives of enrolled families when adjudicating which programs are good or bad.

This fundamental tension — between standardized measurement and the complex, relationship-based reality of quality care — remains at the heart of ongoing debates about how best to ensure positive outcomes for America's youngest children. As sociologist Zach Griffen notes of performance measurement across other sectors like health care and K-12 schooling, quality assessment tools can be “wildly successful in policy research at the same time as they fall apart in real-world applications.”

While the QRIS measure of “quality” might be contentious, the stakes are high because quality itself does seem to really affect kids' life trajectories. Back in 2000, the National Academies of Sciences published a 600-page report concluding that both nurturing parenting and caregiving relationships were essential for early childhood development, and that well-designed programs could help improve the lives of kids growing up in poverty in particular.

Another landmark federal study tracked more than 1,300 children from infancy through adolescence. Emerging from the contentious “day care wars” of the 1980s over whether maternal employment and non-parental care harmed children, the researchers found that “higher-quality” care predicted better cognitive and language development. The study highlighted responsive adult-child relationships as the most critical quality factor, with elements like staff ratios and group sizes also playing important roles.

These early studies established a foundation for understanding quality, but even today early childhood experts describe different visions. Ruth Friedman, who directed the Office of Child Care during the Biden administration, defines quality as care that ensures safety, engaging activities, and “nurturing, consistent, and well-compensated caregivers who support development across multiple domains — including language, early math and science, social-emotional, and physical growth,” she told me. 

Some advocates stress that trained caregivers are essential for building the kind of stable, high-quality workforce that children need. “All teachers need to have a foundational knowledge of child development…[with] formal education and training in early childhood education,” the Center for American Progress wrote in a “Quality 101” report published in 2017. 

Other experts say the growing demand for professional training devalues the kind of care offered by parents, grandparents, and other informal community leaders. “What we realize [matters] is the quality of the relationship and [that isn't] typically things you can measure in a simple way, like a child-adult ratio,” said Jenet Erickson, a professor of religious education at Brigham Young University and a researcher of maternal and child well-being. “It's just not as simple as having trained caregivers. … We need more flexibility in who can provide care, so families can say, ‘We really like this neighborhood grandmother because of the way she relates to our children, and we're less concerned about whether or not she got a degree in human development.'”

There is perhaps more agreement, however, on what constitutes unacceptably poor care. Gibbs identified warning signs that cross cultural boundaries: “disorganized or unsafe spaces…young children wandering aimlessly.” These align with the National Academies' findings about the lowest-quality settings: caregivers ignoring children's bids for attention, few appropriate toys, and children spending time “unengaged with adults, other children, or materials.” 

Finding the balance between acceptable care and parent preferences can be tricky, especially when public funding is involved and lawmakers pursue multiple policy objectives at once, like promoting child development, supporting moms in the workforce, advancing educational equity, and even broader social concerns like reducing crime or increasing GDP.

The Center for American Progress has grown somewhat less prescriptive about quality since it published its “Quality 101” report in 2017. “Quality, in some sense, can take many different forms, and perhaps it should, because child care and early learning is not one-size-fits-all,” Gibbs told me, noting that some home-based child care options “are extremely high quality” yet nevertheless are sometimes “viewed as second tier to school-like center-based care” when it comes to state ratings. 

The landscape of child care quality measurement appears poised for significant shifts. The Build Back Better Act, proposed during the Biden administration, represented perhaps the most ambitious federal effort to date to elevate child care quality standards nationwide. 

States would have been required to develop tiered QRIS frameworks aligned with the federal Head Start preschool standards, and mandate child care provider participation in QRIS to receive federal money. Most significantly, payment rates would have been directly linked to quality ratings — so child care programs achieving higher QRIS scores would have received higher reimbursement rates. 

However, with the transition to a new administration, a fundamentally different approach is emerging, as states move to reduce restrictions conservatives see as driving up costs without improving outcomes or access.

This regulatory rollback fits within a broader conservative vision reshaping child care — one that prioritizes less expensive home-based programs over professionally staffed centers, de-emphasizes academic credentials and curricula, and often encourages more mothers to stay home to raise their children. As Idaho Rep. Rod Furniss argued when promoting his deregulation bill, “perhaps the most important” small business is the home day care, “where moms can stay home and supplement the household income and watch a few kids.”

This approach also aligns with principles outlined in the American Enterprise Institute's 2024 “Three Principles for Conservative Early-Childhood Policy,” which advocated for subsidizing “lower-cost” options while keeping “children connected to their families.”

Conservatives specifically warn against what they call the “Bill de Blasio model” — folding early childhood education into the credentialing, unionization, and compensation structure of K-12 teachers. This approach, which many progressive advocates view as essential for stable and quality care, is viewed by many on the right as a recipe for unsustainable costs.

As control shifts in Washington, the very definitions of quality that have guided policy for decades may soon change. But the core questions remain unresolved: What matters most in determining quality and how do we capture it? How should we balance measurable outcomes with family preferences? What trade-offs between quality, affordability, and access are Americans prepared to make? And ultimately, what kind of care do American children deserve?

﻿What happens when the federal government will no longer respond to a local health crisis?

by  Dylan Scott

For many months now, the city of Milwaukee has been grappling with a lead poisoning crisis that has forced at least four schools to temporarily close and dozens more to undergo rigorous inspections.

It began on January 13, when Milwaukee first notified parents at one grade three to five school that a child had tested positive for high levels of lead in their blood. Local health officials determined the lead exposure did not occur at the child's home, which left their school as the obvious culprit. 

City investigators found chipped lead paint and lead-laden dust throughout the school building; press and government reports indicate that the school district has struggled to keep up with paint maintenance requests, due to a lack of funding and manpower. Local officials soon realized they had a big problem on their hands, as the vast majority of the city's school buildings (roughly 125 out of 150) were built before 1978, when lead paint was banned. 

Lead, a dangerous neurotoxin that can lead to development problems in children after prolonged exposure, has now been detected in at least nine public schools, and at least four students have tested positive for high lead levels in their blood. So far, no children have been hospitalized for acute lead poisoning, which can be life-threatening, but the affected kids continue to be monitored. Several buildings have been temporarily closed so workers can do a deep clean. Milwaukee has been inspecting all of its public schools for lead, with the goal of completing the review by September.

Normally, cities navigating such a crisis could depend on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for federal support. When the lead poisoning was first detected in January, at the tail end of the Biden administration, city health officials were immediately in contact with the CDC environmental health team, which included several of the country's top lead poisoning experts, Milwaukee health commissioner Mike Totoraitis told me. A group of federal experts were planning a trip to the city at the end of April.

But not anymore. In early April, the Trump administration denied Milwaukee's request for support because there was no longer anybody on the government's payroll who could provide the lead poisoning expertise the city needs.

On April 1, the lead exposure team within the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health was laid off as part of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s massive restructuring of the federal health department. The planned trip was canceled, and no federal officials have stepped foot in Milwaukee since to aid in the response. 

“We were talking to [the federal experts] multiple times each week,” Totoraitis said, “before they were let go.”

Milwaukee has pushed ahead with its own inspection and free blood testing clinics. The city reported on May 13 that it had replaced 10,000 lead water service lines, in an attempt to remove another possible source of exposure for local children. But they still have 55,000 more left to go, and local officials have said they would need state or federal funding to finish the job. (It is estimated to cost the city about $630 million.)

Ordinarily, Totoraitis said, the CDC experts would serve as the city's subject matter experts, guiding them through their epidemiological investigations. Federal officials are especially adept at the detective work that can determine whether a child was exposed at home or at the school. Milwaukee officials had recent experience with lead exposures in homes but not in schools; they were relying on federal expertise to interpret lead dust levels that were found during the school inspections. Without them, they've been left to navigate a novel and dangerous health threat on their own.

“They were there for that sole purpose of having some of the best subject matter expertise on lead poisoning, and it's gone now,” Totoraitis said. “Now we don't have any experts at the CDC to reach out to.”

In this uncertain new era for public health, Milwaukee's experience may become all too common: a city left to fend for itself amid an emergency. What in the past might have been a national scandal could become all too routine.

When I spoke with Totoraitis, he was already contemplating the next public health problem he would have to deal with. “If we have a new emerging health issue, that I don't have internal expertise on and neither does the state, we don't have anyone to call now,” Totoraitis said. “That's a scary endeavor.”

He can't be sure what kind of help he will be able to get from the federal government as the restructuring at the US Department of Health and Human Services continues. The department just rehired hundreds of health workers focused on workplace safety, but other teams, including the lead team, have not been brought back.

The turmoil makes it harder for local officials to keep track of which federal experts are still on staff, where they are located, and who has actually been let go. But the message is clear: President Donald Trump and his senior deputies want state and local governments to take on more of these responsibilities — without a helping hand from the feds.

The US public health system has been set up so that the state and local health departments are the front line, monitoring emerging problems and providing personnel in a crisis. The federal government supplies insights that state and local officials probably don't have on their own. That is what Totoraitis was depending on; Milwaukee was inexperienced with lead exposures in large public buildings before this year's emergency. (One of the laid-off CDC scientists has since sought to volunteer to help Milwaukee, as Stat recently reported; the person told me they were hoping to help with community engagement, which federal officials would usually assist with.)

Health crises happen all the time. Right now, there is a small tuberculosis outbreak in Kansas; a Florida town experienced the unexpected spread of hepatitis last December. A dozen people have been hospitalized in a listeria outbreak. And the US is currently facing its largest outbreak of measles in decades, with more than 1,000 people sickened. At one point, local officials said that the federal government had cut off funding for the outbreak response as part of a massive clawback of federal funds at the end of March, although the CDC has since sent additional workers to West Texas where the outbreak originated.

There used to be little doubt the federal government would step up in these scenarios. But Totoraitis warns that Milwaukee's experience of the past few months, left to fend for itself in an emergency, could soon be repeated elsewhere.

“Let's say next year this time, St. Louis is in a similar situation — they could call us, but we don't have the bandwidth to consistently support them,” Totoraitis said. “This unfortunately is a great example of how quickly changes in the federal government can affect local government.”

Kids are being poisoned by lead. Trump is letting it happen.

Kennedy, Trump, and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency gleefully cut 10,000 jobs from US health agencies this spring. The cost of those losses will be felt every time a city is confronted with an unexpected health threat. Today, in Milwaukee, families are facing the fear and uncertainty of lead exposure — and they know federal help isn't coming. As one Milwaukee mom told ABC News recently: “It really sends the message of, ‘You don't matter.'”

Welcome back! In case you missed it, our new newsletter, Tech Memo, written by the great Alistair Barr, launched on Friday. Check out the first edition here. And if you aren't already, subscribe here.

In today's big story, we're looking at Big Tech's obsession with cutting out middle managers and flattening their orgs.

What's on deck

Markets: When companies like Facebook and Zillow IPO, they turn to this man

Tech: How one of the hottest coding startups almost died.

Business: Gen Z is turning to blue-collar jobs.

But first, no longer stuck in the middle.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.

Technology can quickly become outdated, but it's a job title in tech that's an endangered species: the middle manager.

Big Tech is flattening its ranks to thin out layers of management in a bid to reduce bureaucracy, writes Emma Cosgrove, Tim Paradis, Eugene Kim, and Ashley Stewart.

Middle managers have had to keep their heads on a swivel for a while. At the end of last year, BI's workplace expert Aki Ito detailed Corporate America falling out of love with the role.

But the tech industry has taken the trend into overdrive, as is often the case. From Microsoft to Intel and Amazon, companies are shedding managers to make themselves as quick and lean as possible.

The biggest immediate impact of flattening orgs is managers overseeing more workers. Some argue that will limit micromanagement. Others say you'll burn out the managers who are left behind.

Big Tech is willing to take its chances, though.

As Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last fall: ""I hate bureaucracy.""

""The goal again is to allow us to have higher ownership and to move more quickly,"" Jassy added.

Big Tech's middle-management purge speaks to a larger trend: Let the stars shine and get rid of anyone else.

Part of tech companies' efficiency push is to identify top performers and weed out underachievers.

With that approach, you could argue there is less of a need for managers. No weak links in the chain means managers don't have to do as much hand-holding. Get out of the way and let your top performers do what they do best.

This isn't a foolproof strategy, though. Someone being extremely capable at their job doesn't always correlate with them being an easy employee to manage. In fact, sometimes the opposite can be true.

But what other options do these tech giants have? The pressure from startups like OpenAI and Anthropic is undeniable. Their smaller size also gives them a massive leg up to move quickly.

And when it comes to AI, speed is the name of the game. Meanwhile, middle managers seem to only be slowing companies down.

1. Trump's ""Big, beautiful bill"" could cause some big chaos. Market pros say the president's tax bill would add $4 trillion to the US deficit, stoking mayhem in the bond market. That means another Trump vs. bond market showdown could be headed our way.

2. Bankers tell startups wanting to go public: ""Go, go, go."" Startups like Hinge Health put their IPO plans on hold when Trump introduced sweeping tariffs. Now that the stock market has recovered, bankers are telling companies to go public while they still can.

3. This ""hick from Ohio"" is a big deal for IPOs. Pat Healy could be the forefather of getting stock exchanges to compete for the right to get a company to list with them. From free Davos advertising to NFL star appearances, here's how Healy lands companies major marketing perks.

1. ""Appstinence"" is a virtue. Raised in the age of the smartphone, a growing cohort of people, mostly millennials and Gen Zers, are opting for dumb tech instead. As the evidence of our collective phone addiction adds up, even tech lovers are embracing the digital detox movement.

2. How Silicon Valley's favorite startup came back from the edge of disaster. StackBlitz was at death's door when Anthropic released its AI model Sonnet 3.5 in 2024. That led StackBlitz to create Bolt.new, a product that could write code based on prompts written in English — and the company's gold mine. BI's Alistair Barr has the full story.

3. Is AI coming for teachers? Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn thinks so. On a recent podcast appearance, he told venture capitalist Sarah Guo that schools will still be necessary in an AI-driven future — but mostly just for childcare. He thinks AI will do the actual teaching.

1. Gen Z is dyeing white collars blue. The cost of college is skyrocketing, and the white-collar job market is unstable. That's led many young people to turn to trades instead, which can offer six-figure salaries and have a high demand for workers.

2. Selling a merger to Trump? MAGA-ify it. Cable giant Charter is merging with Cox, posing a bigger rival for Comcast. The merger still needs the green light from the Trump administration, and it seems like Charter is leaning into pro-American rhetoric to get it, BI's Peter Kafka writes.

3. LA investor Jessica Mah is in a legal battle with DGV investor Justin Caldbeck and two ex-employees. In a lawsuit, Mah has accused Caldbeck of sexually harassing her, which he denies. The lawsuits against Mah, meanwhile, accuse her of misusing company funds, harassment, and age discrimination, BI's Rob Price reports.

The US government lost its last triple-A credit score from a major international ratings firm after a downgrade by Moody's Investors Service on May 16, in a bleak milestone for the world's largest economy. 

Explaining the move, Moody's analysts cited more than a decade of inaction by successive US administrations and Congress to arrest a trend of large fiscal deficits. The government's debt-interest costs ballooned when inflation spiked in the aftermath of Covid-19, and are forecast to reach $1 trillion this year, up from $263 billion in 2017, according to Congress's Government Accountability Office.

In this article

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced it will acquire ""substantially all"" of 23andMe's assets for $256 million.

The drugmaker participated in a bankruptcy auction for 23andMe, a once high-flying genetic testing company that filed for for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March. Regeneron is buying 23andMe's Personal Genome Service, Total Health and Research Services business lines, according to a release.

""We believe we can help 23andMe deliver and build upon its mission to help people learn about their own DNA and how to improve their personal health, while furthering Regeneron's efforts to improve the health and wellness of many,"" Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's president, said in a statement.

Regeneron will not buy the company's telehealth subsidiary, Lemonaid Health, which 23andMe had acquired for around $400 million in 2021. Lemonaid Health will be shut down, but Regeneron has offered to employ all staffers of the acquired business units, according to the release.

The deal is still subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Pending approval, it's expected to close in the third quarter of this year, according to the release. 

23andMe rocketed into the mainstream because of its at-home DNA testing kits that gave customers insight into their family histories and genetic profiles. The five-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. At its peak, 23andMe was valued at around $6 billion.

The company struggled to generate recurring revenue and stand up viable research and therapeutics businesses after going public, and it's been plagued by privacy concerns since hackers accessed the information of nearly 7 million customers in 2023.

In its bankruptcy proceedings, 23andMe required all bidders to comply with its privacy policies, and a court-appointed, independent ""Consumer Privacy Ombudsman"" will assess the deal, the companies said.

Several lawmakers and officials, including the Federal Trade Commission, had expressed concerns about the safety of consumers' genetic data through 23andMe's sale process. The privacy ombudsman will present a report on the acquisition to the court by June 10.

""We are pleased to have reached a transaction that maximizes the value of the business and enables the mission of 23andMe to live on, while maintaining critical protections around customer privacy, choice and consent with respect to their genetic data,"" Mark Jensen, 23andMe's board chair, said in a statement.

In this article

Bath & Body Works has a new chief executive officer, its second in less than three years.

The personal care, home and beauty retailer has named Daniel Heaf as its new CEO, effectively immediately, succeeding Gina Boswell. Heaf was most recently Nike's chief strategy and transformation officer until his role was eliminated by the sneaker giant's new CEO, Elliott Hill.

Boswell joined Bath & Body Works as CEO in December 2022 from consumer products giant Unilever. In March, Bath & Body Works disclosed Boswell would undergo surgery and take a leave of absence lasting a period of ""several weeks.""

Heaf will be introduced to the company at headquarters Monday and met with top executives Sunday, fresh off the plane. Heaf moved to Columbus, Ohio — near the company's headquarters — just this weekend, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details.

Boswell led Bath & Body Works in the post-pandemic era, returning the company known for its scented soaps and lotions to profitable revenue growth. The retailer is uniquely positioned in today's trading environment as the vast majority of its supply chain is in North America, reducing its exposure to President Donald Trump's broad tariffs.

Still, the retailer is looking for ""acceleration,"" according to the person familiar, specifically aiming to resonate more with tweens and capture even more men. The company also wants to expand its international reach.

Before his role as chief transformation and strategy officer at Nike, Heaf was the former head of Nike Direct where he oversaw 45,000 employees and 9,000 stores in 41 countries. He also previously led Burberry's digital transformation.

In connection with the new CEO announcement, Bath & Body Works on Monday preannounced first-quarter results. Both revenue and profit surpassed the company's estimates.

Revenue grew 3% year over year to $1.42 billion. Earnings per share of 49 cents topped the year-ago 38 cents and exceeded Bath and Body Works' guidance. The retailer is reaffirming its previous full-year guidance assuming a 10% tariff on goods from China, but excluding any other tariff changes.

Chinese imports are currently subject to 30% tariffs.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a slew of announcements and revealed new products on Monday that are aimed at keeping the company at the center of artificial intelligence development and computing. 

One of the most notable announcements was its new ""NVLink Fusion"" program, which will allow customers and partners to use non-Nvidia central processing units and graphics processing units together with Nvidia's products and its NVLink. 

Until now, NVLink was closed to chips made by Nvidia. NVLink is a technology developed by Nvidia to connect and exchange data between its GPUs and CPUs.

""NV link fusion is so that you can build semi-custom AI infrastructure, not just semi-custom chips,"" Huang said at Computex 2025 in Taiwan, Asia's biggest electronics conference.

According to Huang, NVLink Fusion allows for AI infrastructures to combine Nvidia processors with different CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ""In any case, you have the benefit of using the NV link infrastructure and the NV link ecosystem.""

Nvidia announced Monday that AI chipmaking partners for NVLink Fusion already include MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip, Astera Labs, Synopsys and Cadence. Under NVLink Fusion, Nvidia customers like Fujitsu and Qualcomm Technologies will also be able to connect their own third-party CPUs with Nvidia's GPUs in AI data centers, it added.

Ray Wang, a Washington-based semiconductor and technology analyst, told CNBC that the NVLink represents Nvidia's plans to capture a share of data centers based on ASICs, which have traditionally been seen as Nvidia competitors. 

While Nvidia holds a dominant position in GPUs used for general AI training, many competitors see room for expansion in chips designed for more specific applications. Some of Nvidia's largest competitors in AI computing — which are also some of its biggest customers — include cloud providers such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, all of which are building their own custom processors. 

NVLink Fusion ""consolidates NVIDIA as the center of next-generation AI factories—even when those systems aren't built entirely with NVIDIA chips,"" Wang said, noting that it opens opportunities for Nvidia to serve customers who aren't building fully Nvidia-based systems, but are looking to integrate some of its GPUs.

""If widely adopted, NVLink Fusion could broaden NVIDIA's industry footprint by fostering deeper collaboration with custom CPU developers and ASIC designers in building the AI infrastructure of the future,"" Wang said. 

However, NVLink Fusion does risk lowering demand for Nvidia's CPU by allowing Nvidia customers to use alternatives, according to Rolf Bulk, an equity research analyst at New Street Research.

Nevertheless, ""at the system level, the added flexibility improves the competitiveness of Nvidia's GPU-based solutions versus alternative emerging architectures, helping Nvidia to maintain its position at the center of AI computing,"" he said. 

Nvidia's competitors Broadcom, AMD, and Intel are so far absent from the NVLink Fusion ecosystem.

Huang opened his keynote speech with an update on Nvidia's next-generation of Grace Blackwell systems for AI workloads. The company's ""GB300,"" to be released in the third quarter of this year, will offer higher overall system performance, he said. 

On Monday, Nvidia also announced the new NVIDIA DGX Cloud Lepton, an AI platform with a compute marketplace that Nvidia said will connect the world's AI developers with tens of thousands of GPUs from a global network of cloud providers.

""DGX Cloud Lepton helps address the critical challenge of securing reliable, high-performance GPU resources by unifying access to cloud AI services and GPU capacity across the NVIDIA compute ecosystem,"" the company said in a press release.

In his speech, Huang also announced plans for a new office in Taiwan, where it will also be building an AI supercomputer project with Taiwan's Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group, the world's largest electronics manufacturer. 

""We are delighted to partner with Foxconn and Taiwan to help build Taiwan's AI infrastructure, and to support TSMC and other leading companies to advance innovation in the age of AI and robotics,"" Huang said.

In this article

Chinese technology giant Xiaomi will invest at least 50 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) over the next 10 years to develop its own chips, CEO Lei Jun said in a Weibo post on Monday.

It's the latest move by a Chinese firm to double down on home-grown technology amid the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China that has seen Washington cut off access to some semicondcutors for companies in the world's second-largest economy.

The 50 billion yuan investment starts from 2025, a Xiaomi spokesperson confirmed. Lei added the company is looking to make a splash at an event on Thursday, when it takes the wraps off the Xring O1 — a so-called system-on-chip that will power Xiaomi's upcoming smartphone.

The Xring O1 is based on a 3 nanometer manufacturing process, one of the most advanced on the market. For comparison, Apple's A18 Pro chips inside the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max smartphones are built on the same process.

A system-on-chip, or SoC, is a type of semiconductor that contains different components that help run a device, such as a smartphone. This could include parts such as memory and a wireless connectivity.

Until now, U.S. firm Qualcomm has been the main supplier of SoCs for Xiaomi's flagship smartphones through its Snapdragon-branded semiconductors.

On Thursday, Xiaomi is expected to launch a new smartphone and tablet, as well as electric car. It's unclear what devices will contain the new Xring O1.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told CNBC on Monday that Xiaomi's latest step is not expected to impact his business.

""We remain a strategic supplier of chips for Xiaomi, and most important, I think Qualcomm Snapdragon chips are used in the Xiaomi flagships and will continue to be used in the Xiaomi flagships,"" Amon told CNBC.

Very few smartphone companies globally design their own SoCs, given the expense and difficulty of the process. Apple, Samsung and Huawei are among the few players that have launched their own chips. Many other vendors rely on products from companies like Qualcomm and MediaTek.

But a big advantage to self-designed chips is the ability to more closely integrate hardware and software to offer a differentiated experience from competitors.

The Xring O1 is not Xiaomi's first SoC, having released the Surge S1 in 2017. Lei said that, due to various reasons and setbacks, the research and development of SoCs was suspended. Xiaomi has launched other types of semiconductors such as those for better management or imaging, but the Xring O1 would mark the company's return to a fundamental smartphone component.

Best Buy stock could be poised to add to its rally in response to cooling trade tensions between the U.S. and China, according to UBS.

""Some uncertainty lingers, but favorable tariff developments and sales momentum should support shares,"" analyst Michael Lasser wrote in a Friday note. ""While BBY's stock has rallied a bit in response to temporarily lowered tariffs on Chinese imports, we still see a risk-reward that's tilted to the upside.""

Shares are down more than 15% in 2025, but have advanced roughly 8% so far in May. Stock in the retailer surged 6% last Monday following news that the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on each other from their highest levels.

Even if the current tariff level of 30% on China remains in place, that is still a workable situation Best Buy can effectively navigate, Lasser added.

""A ~30% tariff on Chinese imports and a lower rate for certain CE products should create a much more manageable backdrop for the retailer,"" the analyst said. ""Even if temporary, it should put the co. in a better position to control inventory flow and pricing of its products over the next few months.""

After a bout of panic buying, more consumers are prepared to rein in their spending and live with less, recent studies show. Even President Donald Trump suggested that Americans should be comfortable with fewer things.

""[Americans] don't need to have 250 pencils,"" Trump said on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""They can have five.""

According to a study by Intuit Credit Karma, 83% of consumers said that if their financial situation worsens in the coming months, they will strongly consider cutting back on their non-essential purchases.

Over half of adults, or 54%, said they'll spend less on travel, dining or live entertainment this year, compared to last year, a new report by Bankrate also found. The site polled nearly 2,500 people in April.

""Moving forward, people may not be able to absorb these higher prices,"" said Ted Rossman, Bankrate's senior industry analyst. ""It sort of feels like something has to give.""

While many Americans are concerned about the effect of on-again, off-again tariff policies, few have changed their spending habits yet. Up until now, that is what has helped the U.S. avoid a recession.

Because it represents a significant portion of Gross Domestic Product and fuels economic growth, consumer spending is considered the backbone of the economy.

""Consumers are still spending despite widespread pessimism fueled by rising tariffs,"" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist of the National Retail Federation. ""While tariffs may have weighed on spending decisions, growth is coming at a moderate pace and consumer spending remains steady, reflecting a resilient economy.""

However, now the economy is ""at a pivot point,"" according to Kleinhenz.

""Hiring, unemployment, spending and inflation data continue in the right direction, but at a slower pace,"" Kleinhenz said in a recent statement. ""Everyone is worried, and a lot of people have recession on their minds.""

Trump's tariffs jump started a wave of declining sentiment, which plays a big part in determining how much consumers are willing to spend.

""Any time there is this much uncertainty, people tend to get a little more cautious,"" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. 

The Conference Boards' expectations index, which measures consumers' short-term outlook, plunged to its lowest level since 2011. The University of Michigan's consumer survey also showed sentiment sank to the lowest reading since June 2022 and the second lowest in the survey's history going back to 1952.

""The cumulative effects of inflation and high interest rates have been straining households, contributing to record levels of credit card debt and causing consumer sentiment to plummet,"" Rossman said.

Tack on the Trump administration's resumption of collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans and many Americans, who are already under pressure, will suddenly have less money in their pockets.

As it stands, roughly half — 47% — of U.S. adults would not consider themselves financially prepared for a sudden job loss or lack of income, according to recent data from TD Bank's financial preparedness report, which polled more than 5,000 people earlier this year.

Another 44% of Americans said they think about their financial preparedness every single day.

Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich warned that the tariffs from President Donald Trump's economic policy agenda could signal the end of American influence in the world.

In a recent episode of ""The Bottom Line,"" Reich, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said when global investors, including Americans, started pulling their money out of Treasury bills and away from U.S. dollars after the tariffs were announced, America's standing in the world may have wavered.

The U.S. dollar and Treasury bills are the safest places in the world to hold money, Reich said. If that changes, the U.S. would ""lose power and we would also lose a lot of wealth in this country,"" he said.

""Having the dollar be the reserve currency helps all of us Americans here because we get, in a sense, a free ride,"" Reich said. ""We get the benefits of the rest of the global economy investing in us."" He questioned why the Trump administration would want to create policies that end this American hegemony sooner than might have otherwise happened.

Reich also said the tariffs are hardest on Americans with lower incomes.

""Every consumer, effectively, is poorer,"" he said. ""It is a regressive tax in the sense that consumers who have lower incomes ... have to pay a larger portion of their incomes in the form of this tariff tax.""

Sharing the costs of hosting U.S. troops in allied countries has been a favorite topic of U.S. President Donald Trump since his first term in the White House.

But as more countries try to eke out a deal to escape the spectre of tariffs in his second term, Trump is making his own moves: bundling negotiations on trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing into a single comprehensive deal, which he called ""one-stop shopping.""

One such country in his sights is South Korea, which is home to about 28,500 U.S. troops known as U.S. Forces Korea. On April 8, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had discussed ""payment for the big time Military Protection we provide to South Korea,"" among other issues, with then-acting president Han Duck-soo.

""We are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. ""ONE STOP SHOPPING"" is a beautiful and efficient process!!!"" Trump wrote.

While South Korean officials have reportedly said that defense payments are off the table, the country's two leading presidential candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have hinted that they are open to discussing a defense cost-sharing agreement.

However, analysts told CNBC that a transactional approach wouldn't necessarily work in the U.S.'s favor.

At the Munich Security Conference in February, then-Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said, ""It has been said that trade and security are two sides of the same coin, and one assumes that as trade dependencies shift, security alliances will follow.""

But, the image of the U.S. in Asia, Ng said, ""has changed from liberator to great disruptor to a landlord seeking rent.""

The U.S. president is likely to bring defense payments up in trade talks, Bruce Bennett, Professor of Policy Analysis at the RAND School of Public Policy, told CNBC.

""It's the way he does business,"" Bennett said. ""So it's not like he definitely wants to bring troops home, but it is a matter that he wants the recognition and the acceptance of responsibility from our allies,"" he added.

This was the stance espoused by U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, who said in a 2024 interview that U.S. Forces Korea should be overhauled to be ""more relevant"" to handling China, as opposed to North Korea.

One way South Korea could ""pay more"" is by investing in its forces and buying more U.S. military equipment, Bennett said.

This will enable the South Korean military to plug any capability gaps while allowing U.S. Forces Korea to focus more on China, he added.

""[If] the Korean government says we're volunteering to ...raise our budget by $3 or $4 billion, we're going to use it to buy equipment so that the U.S. can have a shift in focus, I think that would go a long way to meeting the President's interests.""

South Korea spent 2.6% of its GDP on defense in 2024, more than the global average of 2.5%, and one of the highest in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

In 2025, the country allocated 61.25 trillion South Korean won ($43.83 billion) for defense, or a 3.1% increase from the year before.

However, such a transactional approach will damage U.S. credibility, Hoshik Nam, assistant professor at the Department of Sociology and Political Science at Jacksonville State University, said.

Using the deployment of U.S. forces as leverage in trade negotiations could lead close allies to perceive U.S. commitments as less credible, Nam added.

""In the long term, this position could reframe the U.S. as an isolated superpower.""

South Korea wasn't required to make any financial contribution in its original 1966 agreement with the U.S on troops stationed in the country, known as the Status of Forces Agreement.

Cost sharing only became a feature of the alliance in 1991, when Seoul agreed to share some of the burden of stationing U.S. troops in three areas, namely logistics, local labor, and military construction.

Nam explained that South Korea's rapid economic growth from the 1960s created the conditions for cost-sharing.

""Both countries also agreed that their relationship should move beyond a simple aid-provider and recipient dynamic,"" he noted.

The funds provided by the South Korean government also created local jobs and helped local industries, Nam said.

""Regarding construction, most projects are carried out by Korean construction companies. In terms of logistics, the equipment, services, and facilities are all supplied by Korean companies,"" Nam highlighted.

In October 2024, Seoul agreed to raise its contribution for hosting U.S. troops by 8.3% in 2026, to 1.52 trillion won ($1.13 billion).

However, Trump's 'one stop shopping' stance to bundle trade with defense agreements could throw the latest cost-sharing agreement by the Biden administration into jeopardy, given that the 2024 agreement covers the period of 2026-2030.

Some ambitious Gen Z professionals are leading the return-to-office trend, eager to climb the corporate ladder, learn from their older peers and upend stereotypes about their generation.

Born between 1997 and 2012, many members of Gen Z started their first jobs in the midst of the pandemic. As remote and hybrid work became the new norm, the youngest generation at work were often scapegoated for the rise in empty offices, facing a flurry of criticism for being lazy and shirking in-person work.

Recently, JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon complained that while he has been working seven days a week since the pandemic, ""the zoomers don't show up."" Zoomers refers to Gen Z. Meanwhile, British businessman Lord Alan Sugar, 78, urged young workers to get back into the office saying they ""just want to sit at home.""

However, contrary to those accusations, young workers up to the age of 24 are coming to the office an average of three days a week, higher than all other age groups, per a recent global study of 12,000 employees by real estate firm JLL.

Additionally, Gen Z report craving more in-person interaction, with 91% of Gen Z desiring a balance between virtual and in-person opportunities to connect with colleagues and grow professionally, per a survey of nearly 2,000 U.S. adults by events company Freeman.

Although young workers enjoy the benefits of remote work and flexibility, they view the office as ""a launchpad for their careers,"" Dan Schawbel, a managing partner at research firm Workplace Intelligence said.

CNBC Make It interviewed three Gen Zers about how being in the office is helping them get ahead.

Gen Z have been said to have made several corporate faux pas in recent years from channeling the ""office siren"" aesthetic to using TikTok slang like ""ick,"" due to their inexperience. The office provides an environment for young workers to get to grips with corporate norms from communication skills to dress codes.

Trust specialist, Sophia Thibault, said the pandemic hit in the middle of her first year in college affecting her ability to socialize. So when her first job at MRHFM law firm required her to be in the office five days a week, she welcomed the opportunity.

""At first it was a little annoying having to be in office every single day, but I think it helped me really transition into the workforce,"" the 24-year-old said.

Being around colleagues 40 hours a week helped develop Thibault's ability to interact with a diverse group of people and pick up habits like corporate lingo, buzzwords, and the dress code by observing others — much of which can't be learned ""behind a computer screen,"" she said.

""Overall, my friends who I graduated with, like being in office because we have no idea really how to be a professional adult,"" she said.

Max Ranzato, a 28-year-old associate lawyer based in New York, agreed with Thibault's view and recalled getting his first job out of college as a life science recruiter which shifted from full-time in the office to remote work after a year, because of the pandemic. Ranzato said remote work stalled his learning as his manager wasn't there anymore to give him advice.

""Once it switched to remote, you lost all of the fun and perk of being a recruiter and then it just went to cold-calling people all day alone, not talking to anyone, not eating lunch with anybody, not really making friends,"" he said. ""I definitely think working from home is very lonely.""

But for Gen Z, working in an office isn't just about filling the gaps in their corporate knowledge, it's also about getting ahead.

""I want to be highly successful,"" said Ranzato, who now works at a law practice and commutes 90 minutes from Queens to New Jersey four days a week just to be in the office.

""So I walk to the subway, take the subway to Penn Station to get the train, take a train to Newark, New Jersey, and then I Uber to the office,"" he explained. ""It sounds very intense, but I don't mind it.""

Ranzato, who estimates his commute costs between $600 - $800 monthly, says it's worth it because as an ambitious lawyer hoping to make partner one day, he feels that his ""learning grows exponentially while being in the office.""

In the office, Ranzato interacts with partners every day, observing their behavior and communication style in meetings and asking the questions he needs. ""I just want to be paid well and be surrounded by the people that are going to guide my future. How can I learn when I'm not here with them?""

His Gen Z friends who are accountants or engineers feel the same way and hope to be recognized by higher-ups. ""They want money. They want to level up. They want to do what their bosses are doing,"" he said.

Schawbel explained that the office environment accelerates career progression via ""immersion,"" which is harder to replicate through a screen.

Thibault said in her former job at law firm MRHFM, she and her Gen Z colleagues were always in the office, and were extremely motivated. ""We were on top of our work...and everyone in the office knew if you needed somebody to work on something, 'give it to the three girls, they'll get it done.'""

Molly Gilbride, a 25-year-old media relations specialist in Seattle, said she's ""confused"" when Gen Z are accused of being lazy and shirking the office because in a prior role, Gen Z were the core group of workers coming into the office.

""I think we value flexibility and the choice to be in the office, but that's not to say we don't like going into the office because it's too much work,"" she said.

Even Gen Z workers who love being in the office, appreciate one or two work-from-home days a week, signaling an evolution of the traditional 9-5.  

""The future is overwhelmingly leaning toward hybrid,"" Schawbel said. ""It's about the best of both worlds.""

Gilbride's current company allowed her to transition to a remote job due to personal issues, but she misses being in the office because it added a bit of ""diversity"" to her week.

""The flexibility of remote work is fantastic and it's what I needed in my life at this moment in time, but I am trying my best to get back to a place where I can be hybrid because I love going to the office.""

Ranzato also enjoys his work-from-home Fridays because the ""freedom"" allows him to do the dishes, cook lunch, or fold clothes. With billable hours, he can make up his hours throughout the week, customizing the structure to fit his life.

TikTok content creator Gigi Robinson believes ""hybrid is the future."" The New York-based 26-year-old doesn't work a full-time job because she lives with multiple chronic illnesses and regularly commutes hours for treatments during the working week.

Robinson was studying at the University of Southern California when the pandemic hit and studying became strictly remote. ""Serendipitously, Covid happened, and all of a sudden, the accessibility tools that I was once begging for: Can I Zoom into class? Can I do remote hand in? were accessible to everybody. And I was like, 'well, why was this so hard before?'"" 

Robinson, who now runs a fully remote internship program at one of her companies, believes that remote work offers accessibility for people like herself.

Remote Gen Z workers are not just slacking off, Thibault pointed out. She spoke of her surprise when an older colleague once mentioned that he sits by his pool when working from home.

""When I'm working from home, I'm not sitting in my pool...I wouldn't be swimming in my pool during work hours and I wouldn't blatantly be telling co-workers that,"" she said.

""I feel like Gen Z, we want to prove ourselves, this is our first chance to work and be professionals and we are very money-motivated and motivated by feedback, new positions… so that is what is driving us to work harder [and] be in the office. But also when we're at home, we're working hard as well.""

The U.K. and European Union announced a landmark deal to reset relations Monday after Britain's acrimonious exit from the bloc in 2020.

British officials said the signing of the agreement — which covers a range of matters including security, energy, trade, travel and fisheries — with EU officials in London marked a ""historic day"" for the two sides, and a ""new chapter"" in their relationship after years of tense post-Brexit relations.

Here are some key takeaways from the deal and how it will affect British consumers and businesses:

Firstly, the deal will make it easier for British food and drink to be imported and exported as it reduces red tape for businesses which have led to lengthy lorry queues at the border. Some routine checks on animal and plant products will also be removed completely, allowing products like British sausages and burgers to be sold back into the EU again.

When it comes to security and defense, the U.K. and EU agreed on a new partnership paving the way for the U.K. defense industry to participate in the EU's proposed new £150 billion ($200 billion) ""Security Action for Europe"" defense fund.

Fisheries was a big (and thorny) part of the talks ahead of the summit. This new deal extends fishing rights for EU trawlers in U.K. waters until 2038, an agreement particularly coveted by Brussels as an existing deal was due to expire next year.

British holidaymakers will be cheering at least one aspect of the deal, which will enable them to use more ""eGates"" in EU airports rather than having to have their passports physically checked when they travel to the continent. That agreement should end what the government described as ""the dreaded queues at border control.""

Some issues are not entirely resolved, however, including a ""youth experience scheme."" Both sides said they would work toward a deal that would make it easier for young people to live and work across the continent.

The program will be designed to enable young people to work and travel freely in Europe again, but will be capped and time-limited, mirroring existing schemes the U.K. has with countries such as Australia and New Zealand.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other senior officials in London for the much-anticipated U.K.-EU summit on Monday.

Both sides praised the rapprochement reached at the gathering, which took place against a backdrop of unpredictable global dynamics and changing alliances.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press conference following the summit that the deal was ""historic"" and ""the message we're sending to the world today is ... that we in Europe stick together.""

European Council President António Costa echoed that sentiment, stating that the agreements ""mark not just progress but ... the start of a renewed and strengthened strategic partnership"" on trade, migration and security.

Starmer said the deal was a ""win-win"" for both sides. ""Britain is back on the world stage, working with our partners, doing deals that will grow our economy and putting more money in the pockets of working people,"" he remarked.

The Trump administration's recent shift toward U.S. isolationism regarding global affairs — and particularly those more acutely affecting Europe, such as the war in Ukraine — piled pressure on the U.K. and European Union to agree on a deal.

But the U.K. government is also in a tricky position given the increased public support for Reform UK, the party belonging to Brexit architect, Nigel Farage.

Starmer's popularity has fallen to its lowest level on record, with just 23% of Brits polled having a favorable view of the prime minister, according to YouGov research released last week, while positivity toward Farage and Reform UK has risen.

One of the biggest stumbling blocks leading up to the U.K.-EU summit was access that EU boats have to fish in U.K. waters, with a post-Brexit deal on fishing rights set to expire in 2026 and France and Denmark pushing for those rights to be extended.

The problem for the Labour government was how to agree on thorny issues like this, without looking like it's returning to a pre-Brexit partnership.

It insisted on Monday that it had not rowed back on Brexit, saying the deal ""meets the red lines set out in the government's manifesto – no return to the single market, no return to the customs union, and no return to freedom of movement.""

But critics of the deal, including Farage and Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, reacted with dismay as details of the deal emerged earlier on Monday morning, with the latter saying: ""We're becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again.""

Over $600 million in crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated since late Sunday as bitcoin (BTC) staged a sharp rally past $106,000 in the wee hours, only to reverse course and dump back to near $103,000, catching both bulls and bears off guard.

The move began around 21:00 UTC on Sunday, when bitcoin spiked more than $2,500 in less than an hour — a pattern that can be attributed to thin weekend liquidity and potential algorithmic buying triggered by technical levels.

Such price action was a textbook short squeeze followed by aggressive profit-taking or stop-run. A short squeeze happens when traders betting against a price (short sellers) are forced to buy the asset as it rises, to cover their losses, which pushes the price even higher and often very quickly.

The sudden move wiped out over $460 million in long positions and $220 million in shorts, across futures tracking majors like ether (ETH), solana (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE). 

The liquidation wave was notable for occurring during traditionally quiet weekend hours, an unusual event that marks forced selling or buying activity by a major player.

SOL, DOGE and XRP prices are down more than 4% in the past 24 hours, data shows, with the broad-based CoinDesk (CD20) down more than 2%.

The volatility follows a week of macro uncertainty, with Moody's cutting the U.S. credit rating on Friday and inflation fears resurfacing after mixed economic data. The downgrade also led to U.S. 30-year treasury yields breaching the 5% mark.

While crypto has broadly benefited from renewed institutional inflows and spot ETF momentum, traders remain cautious at current price levels, as reported.

Bitcoin is flat over the past week, but the recent failure to hold above $106,000 — a key psychological and technical level — may signal near-term resistance, FxPro's Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk last week.

Meanwhile, some traders anticipate higher volatility in the days to come in a warning sign for those looking to leverage their bets.

“Investors are shifting capital to Bitcoin as concerns grow over a pending US spending bill that could add trillions in debt and push for higher Treasury premiums,” Haiyang Ru, co-CEO of the HashKey Business Group, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

“But while bitcoin hovers just below new highs, we anticipate more market volatility as traders prepare for new trade deals and a final version of the fiscal policy,” Ru added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Proposes Design to Make Running Nodes Easier","https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/05/19/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-proposes-design-to-make-running-nodes-easier","Mon, 19 May 2025 12:18:28 GMT","

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new design to reduce the hardware burden for running a network node, framing it as a step toward a fully decentralized network that doesn't require sophisticated infrastructure to help maintain.

In a blog post published on Sunday, Buterin introduced the concept of “partially stateless nodes,” allowing users to store only a subset of Ethereum's data, rather than the entire blockchain that clocks in at over 1.3 terabytes (TB). 

The proposed goal is to allow everyday users, not just institutions, to run nodes on personal devices. A node is an electronic device that connects to a blockchain network to help verify transactions and keep a copy of the ledger.

Currently, operating a full Ethereum node requires significant disk space, often over 1 TB, making it impractical for most users. While third-party services offer access to blockchain data, they come with privacy and censorship trade-offs, Buterin noted.

Instead, his new model suggests letting each node store only the data most relevant to the user, while verifying other parts of the chain on demand using cryptography.

The “local-first” approach mirrors a library system: you keep the books you use often, and borrow the rest when needed.

“This type of node would give the benefits of direct local access to the state that a user needs to care about, as well as maximal full privacy of access to that state,” Buterin wrote.

The system would also allow users to configure what data their node stores, like common smart contracts, tokens, or specific apps, using a simple onchain setting. Users wouldn't need to store Merkle proofs (the complex cryptographic trees that secure blockchain state), as only raw data suffices.

The proposal builds on the ongoing implementation of EIP-4444, which aims to limit node history storage to 36 days, with older data distributed across the network using erasure coding — ensuring the chain remains permanent without burdening any single operator.

The proposal is still in its early stages, but it could shape the next phase of the network's decentralization roadmap.

Bitcoin hit $106,000 before slipping 3.8% to $102,450 in a matter of hours

Ethereum tumbled 4.3% on Monday to $2,400, prompting $264.4 million worth of liquidations

The Federal Reserve warned that Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to rise, with Walmart also increasing its prices due to the trade war.

Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin has had a volatile start to the week as it rose 2.5% from $103,850 to $106,500 before slumping 3.8% to $102,450 on Monday.

With Bitcoin's major moves $178.46 million worth of positions have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass, with a fairly equal split between long and short positions.

This comes as a class action lawsuit was filed against MicroStrategy, the firm led by Michael Saylor that is bullishly acquiring Bitcoin, claiming that the firm is misleading investors—a matter of hours later the company announced the acquisition of $764.9 million worth of BTC.

Plus, an Australian judge ruled that Bitcoin is a form of money, according to the Australian Financial Review. That will potentially open the door to Bitcoin being exempt from capital gains tax.

Meanwhile, Ethereum has tumbled 4.3% on the day from $2,500 to $2,400 after what was considered a great month for the second largest cryptocurrency. As such $264.40 million worth of Ethereum positions have been liquidated, according to CoinGlass, with $205.28 million of these being longs.

This follows a month of green action for most of the crypto industry, as President Trump's trade war appears to be coming to a close.

At the start of May, the U.S. and the UK agreed on a trade deal in what the UK Treasury minister called a “huge relief.” Then, last week, China reached an agreement with the States prompting a major roll back in tariffs between the countries.

However, inflation concerns have resurfaced following the Federal Reserve keeping its benchmark interest rate at 4.25% to 4.50%, with no sign of an immediate shift in policy—despite criticism from Trump. The Fed also warned that the risk of higher inflation and unemployment were rising due to Trump's tariff war.

These concerns were compounded last week by Walmart announcing plans to raise prices this month, due to the impact that tariffs had on imports.

This may explain why Bitcoin has had such a surprisingly volatile week. It hit a weekly low of $101,750 on Tuesday followed by multiple peaks and troughs before hitting $106,500 high on Monday, and slumping back to $102,450 hours later.

Despite Bitcoin's 1.4% drop on the day, according to CoinGecko, it remains just 5.8% from its all-time high of $108,786 hit in January of this year. Ethereum, by comparison, is still 50.9% from its all-time high of $4,878 achieved in 2021.

A closely followed crypto analyst is predicting Ethereum's (ETH) path to all-time highs, as well as updating his outlook on two other big altcoins.

Trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 786,500 followers on the social media platform X that he's expecting ETH to start making a run to $4,800 with anything below the $2,400 level a bargain for bulls.

“Anything sub $2,400 on ETH is, after this big move upwards, a steal before we'll start to run of towards the ATH's (all-time highs) for Ethereum.”

At time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,387, nearing Van de Poppe's high time frame support area.

The trader is also keeping an eye on decentralized blockchain oracle service Chainlink (LINK). According to Van de Poppe, LINK is most likely a solid play looking ahead, with the $14 level being a potential entry point for bulls.

“It would be great if LINK holds this first level of support.

If buying pressure comes in here, that's a sign of continuation.

What is the next level?

Around $14.

All in all, I think that we'll start up a new cycle and LINK is a good one to monitor.”

LINK is trading for $15.01 at time of writing.

Lastly, the analyst is keeping tabs on Sei (SEI), a layer-one blockchain focused on speed and efficiency. Van de Poppe believes the Solana (SOL) challenger is close to igniting a new leg up.

“SEI flipped the level at $0.19 and continued to run upwards, almost to the level that we wanted it to touch at $0.29.

Standard pullback since, and I think that we'll be ending the correction relatively soon.”

SEI is worth $0.22 at time of writing.

Share this article

Bitcoin needs to break through $110,000 and rally toward the $150,000–$200,000 range on rising trading volume for the alt season to begin, said BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes in a recent interview with Fortune Crypto.

“I think that happens sometime in the summer or early third quarter, and then the rotation starts into various altcoins,” Hayes noted, when asked what level Bitcoin needs to reach to trigger an altcoin rally.

Alt season describes the market phase where altcoins outperform Bitcoin, historically occurring after BTC rallies when traders shift capital from BTC into altcoins seeking greater upside.

Bitcoin has led the market in recent weeks, but altcoins have been slower to respond.

According to Hayes, unlike the explosive altcoin rally of 2021, where nearly every token surged regardless of fundamentals, the next cycle will likely be more selective.

He believes a new narrative will drive attention and speculative trading in specific assets, but warns that many “dino coins” are unlikely to recover.

“A lot of those coins have high FDV, low float, no customers, no revenue, just some CEX listings, that went down 95%, I don't really see why those should do well in the next cycle,” he added.

Hayes, who now manages the Maelstrom fund after receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump earlier this year, expects Bitcoin to climb toward $200,000 in its next surge and reach $250,000 by the end of the year.

He projects Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2028, just as Trump's term is set to conclude.

Bitcoin logged its highest weekly close on May 18, finishing above $106,000 and extending its winning streak to six consecutive weeks. The rally has been fueled by persistent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and steady corporate demand.

On Sunday, Bitcoin briefly touched $107,000 before pulling back. At the time of writing, it was trading near $103,000, around 6% below its all-time high of $109,500, set in January.

Hayes maintains a large position in gold, he revealed during the interview, with around 20% of his portfolio allocated to the asset.

His holdings include physical gold stored in a vault as well as substantial investments in gold mining equities, which he believes remain undervalued despite the metal's rising prices.

On Ethereum versus Solana, Hayes favors Ethereum's prospects. The analyst believes that Ethereum's underlying fundamentals and ecosystem strength make it a better bet than Solana in the near future, despite its recent price struggles and the criticism it faces.

“I think that Ethereum could outperform Solana in this next sort of 18-24 months bull run,” he said.

Bitcoin once again shakes the market. By crossing the $105,000 mark, the iconic crypto returns to levels it hadn't reached since January. This surge, accompanied by a rise in the main altcoins, reignites speculation: a simple technical rebound or the start of a new bullish cycle? In a rapidly changing geopolitical context and as investors regain their appetite for risk, signals multiply… but their interpretation remains uncertain.

Bitcoin surpassed the symbolic threshold of $105,000 this Sunday, a first since January 2025. An important psychological barrier, which brings the queen of cryptos to less than 3% of its all-time high ($108,786), reached on the day of Donald Trump's inauguration. This renewed strength – +2% over 24 hours and +25% over one month – seems to be part of a cautious optimism, favored by the easing of the American trade war.

But beware, the current euphoria might mask a more nuanced reality. Because while the trend is upwards, it is also accompanied by a troubling phenomenon: Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto ecosystem is decreasing.

In other words, its market share is eroding as altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, or Dogecoin gain ground. For some analysts, however, this dynamic does not signal the arrival of a sustainable altcoin season. It rather reflects a temporary appetite for risk assets in an still fragile context.

Short position liquidations, which exceeded $128 million in a single day, demonstrate a harsh market for pessimists. Contrarian traders have learned the hard way: betting against this bullish trend can be very costly.

While BTC attracts the spotlight, attention also shifts to other players. XRP climbs nearly 4%, nearing $2.43, while Ethereum advances 3.5% to $2,563. As for Dogecoin, it leads with an impressive 8% rise, reaching $0.232.

This renewed interest in altcoins is explained by several factors. First, the classic ripple effect: when Bitcoin goes up, investors turn to the “smaller” tokens seeking higher yields. Next, increased confidence in the crypto sector as a whole, fueled by a calmer geopolitical context, notably Trump's retreat on some economic fronts.

But this euphoria could well be short-lived. Macroeconomic uncertainties, lingering geopolitical tensions, and possible volatility resurgence could bring investors back to Bitcoin, the crypto market's safe haven. In other words, if strong winds blow, altcoins could sink again.

Granted, Bitcoin's dominance is eroding. But believing this heralds a lasting reshuffling of the cards would be premature. Historically, altcoin season phases occur only after a sustained accumulation phase and Bitcoin stabilization. Yet, we are still in the midst of speculative frenzy.

Seasoned investors know: when adrenaline rises, crowd movements can create illusions. A rapid rise does not guarantee solid consolidation. If the economic or political climate were to tighten, the market could quickly turn defensive, refocusing flows on Bitcoin and leaving other cryptos behind.

Bitcoin flirts with its all-time high, and the whole crypto market seems carried by a wind of optimism. But signals remain mixed. Between rising altcoins and underlying tensions, the time calls less for celebration than for strategic vigilance.

 Franklin's new Payroll Treasury Yield lets companies earn DeFi yields on idle payroll funds using audited smart contracts and full self-custody. 

Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.

The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.

Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.

These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.

“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.

“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.

Franklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.

Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.

“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.

She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.

The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.

However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi's audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.

Interest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.

On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.

On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.

Stanford Blockchain and AI Conference Poster

In mid-March, Stanford University hosted a Blockchain and AI conference, bringing together professors, startup CEOs, and venture capitalists (VCs). The central theme of the event was the integration of two major technologies: blockchain and AI. However, the conference could have placed greater emphasis on Bitcoin and AI, given Bitcoin's dominance in the market and the emerging innovations on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.

One of the main challenges with the conference was that blockchain and AI have largely evolved as separate disciplines—with different investors, entrepreneurs, academics, and communities. While the idea of merging the two fields was ambitious, many speakers remained focused on their own domain, failing to establish clear connections between them. Perhaps a more fitting title would have been the Blockchain OR AI Conference.

For example, a venture investor presented an overview of the AI industry, showcasing impressive advancements in image, audio, and code generation. Meanwhile, a DeepMind researcher discussed adversarial machine learning, a phenomenon where slight manipulations to input data can drastically alter an AI's output. One striking example involved modifying just a few pixels in an image of a cat—causing the AI to misclassify it as guacamole.

On the blockchain side, discussions focused on various protocols, but much of the technology remains highly experimental—or, in some cases, entirely non-existent. Blockchain-AI integrations are still in their infancy, with practical implementations yet to emerge.



One of the more insightful contributions came from Dan Boneh, an applied cryptographer at Stanford. He discussed SNARKs (succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) and zero-knowledge proofs, which address a fundamental cryptographic problem: proving knowledge of a computation in an efficient way.

This principle is well-established in both blockchain and cryptography. For example: It's computationally expensive to factor a large number into its two prime components, but verifying via multiplication is computationally cheap. It's expensive to find a block header whose hash meets a target threshold, but verifying that it does is inexpensive.

This asymmetry between computation and verification is critical in blockchain systems, where nodes constantly validate the work of others. In Bitcoin, nodes verify signatures and miners' proof of work. SNARKs extend this concept, enabling cryptographic proofs that are verifiable without revealing sensitive data.

As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, a major challenge will be verifying computation while preserving privacy. Many hesitate to upload sensitive data to OpenAI due to concerns over data security.

This creates a market demand for privacy-preserving verification—a mechanism that allows users to prove an AI model executed a computation correctly without revealing the underlying data. Such a solution could unlock AI applications across healthcare, defense, and finance, where data security is paramount. This will likely become a multi-billion-dollar industry in the next decade.

Interestingly, this concept originates from blockchain via networks to implement such cryptographic techniques. As Boneh pointed out, the idea of one machine cheaply verifying the expensive computation done by another emerged out of Bitcoin. But it may have a second, large application in AI.

I hope to see future conferences place a greater emphasis on Bitcoin's contributions to these fields. BitVM, for example, leverages ideas from zero-knowledge proofs to create bridges between Bitcoin and new Layer 2 protocols—potentially enabling AI agents to interact with Bitcoin's ecosystem.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Paddle Finance, the multi-asset DeFi protocol for bespoke assets, has introduced NFT Money Market, an innovative NFT lending system designed to provide scalable, secure, and capital-efficient liquidity. This launch is paired with a strategic integration with bitsCrunch, a leading provider of NFT analytics and pricing infrastructure. Together, the partnership enables a more intelligent and transparent NFT lending experience on the Berachain network.

NFT Money Market is a market-specific lending model that allows NFT holders to secure instant liquidity by borrowing against their assets through isolated pools. Unlike traditional peer-to-peer lending, where loan terms are matched manually, the NFT Money Market's Peer-To-Pool enables users to interact with automated liquidity pools tailored to individual NFT collections and settlement tokens.

Each pool is uniquely configured based on:

This model significantly reduces systemic risk. Because each pool is isolated by both asset and collateral type, risk remains contained within that market, even if other pools experience high volatility or liquidation events.

NFT holders can deposit their assets into PaddleFi's vault system and borrow funds almost instantly, as long as their loan terms remain within the allowed thresholds. Lenders, on the other hand, contribute capital to specific NFT markets they trust and receive iTokens (interest-bearing tokens) that represent their share in the pool and accrue yield over time.

All loans are open-ended, meaning they can be repaid at any time, offering maximum flexibility to users. If a borrower's position exceeds the defined borrowing limit for that specific market, only their NFT collateral in that pool becomes subject to liquidation. Other assets in unrelated markets remain unaffected.

NFT holders have long faced challenges accessing liquidity due to the non-fungible nature of their assets, inconsistent pricing mechanisms, and limited support from traditional DeFi platforms.

The NFT Money Market directly addresses these issues by eliminating the need for manual loan matching and reducing wait times. Its isolated pool design shields lenders from broader market volatility, while dynamic pricing and tailored collateral parameters improve capital efficiency.

With open-ended loan durations, borrowers can access liquidity without strict repayment timelines, making the system both flexible and user-friendly.

PaddleFi's integration with bitsCrunch's Price Index API brings critical improvements to how NFT collateral is evaluated and managed. The API delivers real-time pricing data, enabling precise calculation of borrow limits and collateral thresholds. It also supports more accurate liquidation logic by factoring in current floor prices and market volatility.

Additionally, bitsCrunch's cross-chain compatibility allows for consistent asset valuation across networks, helping PaddleFi capture liquidity beyond Berachain. This partnership enhances PaddleFi's infrastructure with institutional-grade risk tools and paves the way for NFTs to be used in advanced financial applications like insurance, asset swaps, and structured products.

The NFT Money Market feature will debut on Berachain, focusing initially on high-volume, high-velocity collections such as Steady Teddys, Bullas, and Yeetards. Each collection will have its own lending pool, reducing exposure to unrelated risks and enhancing lender confidence.

The platform's roadmap also includes expansion to Base and other EVM-compatible chains, like Matchain and Apechain, enabling cross-chain NFT liquidity.

With the NFT Money Market as a kick start, PaddleFi is expanding into economic models that increase bespoke asset liquidity and trading volume without affecting market prices. The protocol is also moving deeper into RWAFi, enabling real-world assets to be used alongside NFTs and tokens.

Combined with its push across Berachain, Base, and other chains, PaddleFi is building toward becoming the economic layer of the multichain ecosystem.

Paris Saint-Germain has partnered with blockchain data company Matchain to launch PlayerID, a next-generation platform designed to change how professional athlete data is handled. 

PlayerID creates a secure digital identity for each athlete, collecting their career data into one AI-powered platform. This system enables athletes to manage their own data, granting access to different stakeholders like coaches, analysts, and agents as needed. One of the core ideas behind the platform is giving athletes full ownership and control over their data — a major shift from traditional systems where data is often siloed or controlled by teams and leagues.

By using PlayerID, agents and clubs gain access to high-quality performance insights that can help them plan player development strategies more effectively. The platform includes tools for evaluating progress, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and making better decisions around training and career moves.

Another key benefit of PlayerID is the way it connects different departments within a sports organization. Performance data, medical updates, and commercial insights can be shared more easily between teams, creating smoother workflows and more unified strategies across sporting and business operations.

PlayerID also includes predictive features that use data analysis to anticipate performance outcomes and injury risks. This helps staff make better training plans and reduce chances of physical setbacks.

The platform was initially developed for internal use at Paris Saint-Germain but is expected to be rolled out to the wider sports world. It reflects a growing trend in professional sports to use data more responsibly and efficiently — not only to boost performance but also to protect player health and career longevity.

Par Helgosson, Head of PSG Labs, said: “With PSG Labs, we're not just adopting innovation – we're co-creating it with the best partners in the industry. PlayerID is a concrete example of how data and technology can responsibly support athletic performance and career growth.”

Earlier this week, Coinbase and its sweepstakes administrator agreed to the terms of a class action
settlement in the matter of Suski v. Coinbase, Inc.
After nearly four years of litigation, including a trip to the United States Supreme Court, Plaintiffs
accepted $2.25 million dollars to settle their crypto sweepstakes
lawsuit.

It is important for sweepstakes operators to ensure that their
promotions comply with applicable state and federal regulations. As
evidenced by Suski, misleading sweepstakes promotions can
result in the expenditure of a great deal of time and money in
responding to class action lawsuits and/or regulatory action.

In June 2021, Coinbase made the ""Dogecoin""
cryptocurrency available on its platform. To increase trading
volume, it hired a third party to administer a crypto sweepstakes
with a top prize of $300,000. As alleged, various prompts on
Coinbase's website informed users that, in order to
participate, they had to buy or sell $100 worth of
""Dogecoin"" on the Coinbase platform. Plaintiffs entered
the sweepstakes promotion and traded the cryptocurrency, as
instructed, for a shot at the top prize.

Only after entering the promotion, Plaintiffs claimed, did they
learn that there was an alternative, free means of entry
(""AMOE"") available to enter the sweepstakes. A separate
""rules and details"" page of Coinbase's website made
clear that consumers could also enter the sweepstakes by U.S. Mail
without trading cryptocurrency. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a
class action lawsuit in the Northern District of California,
asserting that, had Coinbase properly disclosed this AMOE, they
would not have paid money to enter the cryptocurrency
sweepstakes.

The Suski proceedings demonstrate just how time
consuming and costly prolonged sweepstakes-related litigation can
be. Before the merits of the lawsuit could even be determined,
Coinbase filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Motion was
denied; and three years of legal proceedings followed to determine
whether the court's denial was proper.

Businesses that are interested in running crypto sweepstakes
promotions should employ best practices to reduce the possibility
of finding themselves defending an action in a court of law. Among
other measures, sweepstakes operators must exercise caution when
drafting sweepstakes contest rules, as well as associated
disclosure and disclaimer language. For example, sweepstakes
contest rules and associated terms should always:

Sweepstakes regulations are quite complicated and differ from
state to state. As such, it is important that sweepstakes operators
and their marketing teams secure the services of experienced
sweepstakes attorneys prior to promotion launch.

BounceBit, a crypto infrastructure provider using features from both centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), has executed a bitcoin (BTC) derivatives trading strategy using BlackRock's yield-generating tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to enhance returns.

The strategy, to be rolled out to institutions and retail users, consisted of two main components: a bitcoin basis trade, involving a long position in the spot market while shorting futures, and a short position in BTC put options, both collateralized by BUIDL tokens.

The basis trade, also known as cash and carry arbitrage, alone generated an annualized yield of 4.7%, with put option writing contributing an additional 15%. Combined with the 4.25% return from BUIDL used as collateral, the total yield exceeded 24%.

Integrating BUIDL as collateral helped generate a higher return than strategies collateralized by stablecoins, which do not generate any return.

""This strategy allows investors to capture both Treasury Bill yields and funding rate arbitrage returns,"" Jack Lu, founder and CEO of BounceBit said in a press release exclusively shared with CoinDesk. 

""BounceBit bridges the gap between Western real-world asset issuers and Asian crypto trading infrastructure, providing new options for yield generation,"" Lu said.

BounceBit is the native BTC restaking chain secured by staking both bitcoin and BounceBit tokens. The network allows BTC holders to earn yields through native validator staking, DeFi ecosystem and a CeFi-like mechanism powered by Ceffu and Mainnet Digital. As of writing, cryptocurrencies worth over $500 million were locked on BounceBit.

BounceBit plans to roll out the BUIDL-collateralised strategy to institutional and retail users soon. ""The successful pilot is a proof of concept to our new product line BB Prime, which will be available to both retail and institutional users,"" BounceBit's spokesperson told CoinDesk.

""This strategy underpins BB Prime as a new class of CeDeFi applications built on top of RWAs which are traditionally troubled by a lack of utilities beyond just holding for t-bill yield, hindering mass adoption,"" the spokesperson added.

BUIDL, launched in March 2024 by Securitize and BlackRock, is a tokenized investment fund operating on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Aptos and Polygon. The token, currently boasting a market cap of $2.88 billion, is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds, boasting a stable value pegged at one dollar per token.

Over $600 million in crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated since late Sunday as bitcoin (BTC) staged a sharp rally past $106,000 in the wee hours, only to reverse course and dump back to near $103,000, catching both bulls and bears off guard.

The move began around 21:00 UTC on Sunday, when bitcoin spiked more than $2,500 in less than an hour — a pattern that can be attributed to thin weekend liquidity and potential algorithmic buying triggered by technical levels.

Such price action was a textbook short squeeze followed by aggressive profit-taking or stop-run. A short squeeze happens when traders betting against a price (short sellers) are forced to buy the asset as it rises, to cover their losses, which pushes the price even higher and often very quickly.

The sudden move wiped out over $460 million in long positions and $220 million in shorts, across futures tracking majors like ether (ETH), solana (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE). 

The liquidation wave was notable for occurring during traditionally quiet weekend hours, an unusual event that marks forced selling or buying activity by a major player.

SOL, DOGE and XRP prices are down more than 4% in the past 24 hours, data shows, with the broad-based CoinDesk (CD20) down more than 2%.

The volatility follows a week of macro uncertainty, with Moody's cutting the U.S. credit rating on Friday and inflation fears resurfacing after mixed economic data. The downgrade also led to U.S. 30-year treasury yields breaching the 5% mark.

While crypto has broadly benefited from renewed institutional inflows and spot ETF momentum, traders remain cautious at current price levels, as reported.

Bitcoin is flat over the past week, but the recent failure to hold above $106,000 — a key psychological and technical level — may signal near-term resistance, FxPro's Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk last week.

Meanwhile, some traders anticipate higher volatility in the days to come in a warning sign for those looking to leverage their bets.

“Investors are shifting capital to Bitcoin as concerns grow over a pending US spending bill that could add trillions in debt and push for higher Treasury premiums,” Haiyang Ru, co-CEO of the HashKey Business Group, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

“But while bitcoin hovers just below new highs, we anticipate more market volatility as traders prepare for new trade deals and a final version of the fiscal policy,” Ru added.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new design to reduce the hardware burden for running a network node, framing it as a step toward a fully decentralized network that doesn't require sophisticated infrastructure to help maintain.

In a blog post published on Sunday, Buterin introduced the concept of “partially stateless nodes,” allowing users to store only a subset of Ethereum's data, rather than the entire blockchain that clocks in at over 1.3 terabytes (TB). 

The proposed goal is to allow everyday users, not just institutions, to run nodes on personal devices. A node is an electronic device that connects to a blockchain network to help verify transactions and keep a copy of the ledger.

Currently, operating a full Ethereum node requires significant disk space, often over 1 TB, making it impractical for most users. While third-party services offer access to blockchain data, they come with privacy and censorship trade-offs, Buterin noted.

Instead, his new model suggests letting each node store only the data most relevant to the user, while verifying other parts of the chain on demand using cryptography.

The “local-first” approach mirrors a library system: you keep the books you use often, and borrow the rest when needed.

“This type of node would give the benefits of direct local access to the state that a user needs to care about, as well as maximal full privacy of access to that state,” Buterin wrote.

The system would also allow users to configure what data their node stores, like common smart contracts, tokens, or specific apps, using a simple onchain setting. Users wouldn't need to store Merkle proofs (the complex cryptographic trees that secure blockchain state), as only raw data suffices.

The proposal builds on the ongoing implementation of EIP-4444, which aims to limit node history storage to 36 days, with older data distributed across the network using erasure coding — ensuring the chain remains permanent without burdening any single operator.

The proposal is still in its early stages, but it could shape the next phase of the network's decentralization roadmap.

 Chinese printer maker Procolored reportedly spread clipboard-hijacking Bitcoin malware via its official drivers in a supply chain attack that led to over $950,000 in stolen funds. 

Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored distributed Bitcoin-stealing malware alongside its official drivers, according to local media reports.

Chinese news outlet Landian News reported on May 19 that Shenzhen-based printer company Procolored has been distributing Bitcoin-stealing (BTC) malware alongside official drivers. The company reportedly used USB drivers to distribute malware-ridden drivers and uploaded the compromised software to cloud storage for global download.

A total of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000 have been stolen, according to the report. Crypto tracking and compliance firm Slow Mist described how the malware operates in a May 19 X post:

Landian News recommended users who downloaded Procolored printer drivers in the past six months to “immediately perform a full system scan using antivirus software.” Still, given the hit or miss nature of antivirus software, a full system reset is always the better option when in doubt:

The issue was allegedly first reported by YouTuber Cameron Coward, whose antivirus software detected malware in the drivers while testing a Procolored UV printer. The software flagged the drive as containing a worm and a trojan virus named Foxif.

When contacted, Procolored denied the claims and dismissed the antivirus tool flagging the drivers as a false positive. Coward turned to Reddit, where he shared the issue with cybersecurity professionals, attracting the attention of cybersecurity firm G-Data.

G-Data's investigation found that most of Procolored's drivers were hosted on the file hosting service MEGA, with uploads as old as October 2023. Analysis of those files confirmed that they were compromised by two distinct pieces of malware: backdoor Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a crypto stealer designed to substitute addresses in the clipboard with those controlled by the attacker.

G-Data contacted Procolored, with the hardware producer saying it deleted the infected drivers from its storage on May 8 and re-scanned all files. Procolored attributed the malware to a supply chain compromise, stating that the malicious files were introduced through infected USB devices before being uploaded online.

 Michael Saylor's Strategy bagged another 7,390 Bitcoin last week as prices rallied above $100,000 and also got hit with a class-action lawsuit, according to the company's latest SEC filing. 

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, the top corporate Bitcoin holder, acquired nearly $765 million of Bitcoin last week. The purchase came as the company faced a class-action lawsuit.

According to a May 19 announcement, Strategy acquired 7,390 BTC for about $764.9 million at an average price just under $103,500. Strategy reported a Bitcoin yield of 16.3% year-to-date. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor made his usual hint at the purchase in a May 18 X post. 

According to a May 19 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company was also the recipient of a class-action lawsuit. The suit accuses Strategy officials of having failed to represent the nature of Bitcoin investments accurately.

As of May 18, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC acquired for around $40.2 billion at an average price of $69,726 per coin. At current prices, the company's total holdings are valued at more than $59.2 billion, representing an unrealized gain of $19.2 billion, or 47%.

According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin traded at around $102,615 at the time of writing, up 20.3% over the last month.

In a recent SEC filing, the firm wrote that “a purported class-action lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia” against the company's executives. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, president and CEO Phong Le and executive vice president and chief financial officer Andrew Kang are all defendants in the suit.

Strategy officials are accused of “violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.” The filing states:

0xngmi, a pseudonymous developer at decentralized finance data platform DefiLlama, wrote in a May 19 X post that he believes the lawsuit has no basis. He explained that the suit “seems to be people complaining that [Strategy] understated how much money it could lose if BTC went down.” Still, he argued that the risks were not understated:

Strategy's Bitcoin treasury strategy has inspired other companies to follow in its footsteps. Last week, shares of luxury watchmaker Top Win surged more than 60% in premarket trading after the company said it would adopt a Bitcoin accumulation strategy and had changed its name to AsiaStrategy.

AsiaStrategy said that to implement its plan it is partnering with Sora Ventures, which previously partnered with Metaplanet in 2024 to create Japan's first corporate Bitcoin treasury. Metaplanet now holds more Bitcoin than El Salvador. Also last week, a Bahrain-based listed catering company with a $24.2 million market cap adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy in partnership with investment firm 10X Capital.

 A potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern suggests Bitcoin could retest $91,000 before any meaningful bullish breakout resumes. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin dropped over 4.5% on May 19, confirming a bearish divergence and threatening a break below $100,000.

Analysts highlight $97,000–$98,500 as key support that the bulls must hold. 

A potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern points to a retest of $91,000 before any bullish continuation.

Bitcoin (BTC) is down over 4.5% from its intraday high on May 19, falling to around $102,000 in its worst daily drop in over a month.

BTC's drop accompanied downside moves elsewhere in the risk market, prompted by Moody's latest downgrade of the US government due to a rising budget deficit and the lack of a credible fiscal consolidation plan.

The decline confirms a bearish divergence and, combined with other technical factors, raises the risk of a BTC price breakdown below $100,000, a key support level.

Bitcoin's price action showed technical weakness ahead of its May 19 sell-off. 

On May 19, BTC pushed to a new local high above $107,000, but its relative strength index (RSI) printed a lower high, confirming a classic bearish divergence. 

This discrepancy between price and momentum is often a precursor to a trend reversal, and in this case, it played out with a swift 4.5% intraday decline. Analyst Bluntz warned traders to “be careful with [placing] longs.”

Swissblock analysts observed that Bitcoin “grabbed liquidity” above the $104,000–$106,000 resistance range but failed to sustain a breakout. 

The rejection pushed the price back into a prior volume-heavy zone, with immediate support between $101,500 and $102,500 now under pressure. 

Swissblock identifies the $97,000–$98,500 range as a key downside target based on historical onchain volume and trading activity if the $101,500-102,500 area fails to hold.

On the three-day chart, Bitcoin is forming the right shoulder of a potential inverse-head-and-shoulders pattern. 

While typically bullish in the long term, this setup implies a short-term retest of the 50-period exponential moving average (50-period EMA; the red wave) near $91,000. 

The chances of such a drop have increased since BTC failed to close above the critical $107,000 neckline level, the same zone that triggered bearish reversals in December 2024 and January 2025.

A rebound from the $91,000 zone toward the neckline at around $107,000 could increase Bitcoin's odds of rising toward $150,000.

Accidental Alchemy, Flamingo Food Tornado, and Kosmos-482 Lands

Kosmos-482 crash-lands, physicists turn lead to gold and animals show some clever behaviors.

By Rachel Feltman, Allison Parshall, Fonda Mwangi, Jeffery DelViscio & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, this is Allison Parshall filling in for Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some of the latest science news.

First, an update on that doomed Soviet-era spacecraft Rachel mentioned last week. After spending more than half a century orbiting Earth, the Kosmos-482 probe made a crash landing on May 10. According to a post on the app Telegram from Russian space agency Roscosmos, the spacecraft crashed into the Indian Ocean somewhere west of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. Space.com reports that other space agencies have estimated different landing spots for the probe, from locations on land in South Asia to stretches of the eastern Pacific. We may never know exactly where Kosmos-482 finally came to rest. In any case, we haven't heard any reports of falling space junk causing harm to humans, so it seems likely the object crashed somewhere out of the way.

Now for some accidental alchemy. Despite the wishes of medieval scholars, there's no way to turn lead into gold, right? Wrong. Physicists at the Large Hadron Collider apparently did just that—very briefly, but still. The scientists published a description of this magical-sounding transformation earlier this month in the journal Physical Review C. 

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Here's how it worked: Scientists at CERN use the Large Hadron Collider to study the early universe by firing lead nuclei at one another at nearly the speed of light. Instead of smashing head-on, the nuclei usually pass very close to one another. In these near-misses, the powerful electric field from one nucleus can shake up the other. If the field is strong enough, it can knock out three protons from an incoming lead nucleus. Since gold has three fewer protons than lead, this transforms the lead into gold.

The researchers estimate that 89,000 gold nuclei are produced per second during these experiments. That means that between 2015 and 2018—the accelerator's second run, which is when the scientists collected this data—the collider produced 29 trillionths of a gram of gold. Unfortunately for any prospectors at CERN, those atoms tend to get obliterated in about a microsecond. Nature reports that another CERN accelerator also observed this alchemical reaction during a 2002 to 2004 run. But because that experiment used less energy, less gold was produced.

In public health news, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released last Wednesday indicates a massive drop in overdose deaths between 2023 and 2024. In the 45 years that the CDC has collected equivalent data, the biggest one-year dip seen previously was 4 percent in 2018, according to the Associated Press. Deaths dropped from about 110,000 in 2023 to roughly 80,000 in 2024, which represents a nearly 27 percent decrease. The AP reports that experts mentioned several possible factors behind the drop, including the increased availability of naloxone for treating overdoses.

It's important to note that, while this is promising news, we still have a long way to go. Overdose deaths are still higher than they were before the COVID pandemic, and overdose remains the leading cause of death for people in the U.S. between ages 18 and 44. If you don't already carry naloxone with you in case you encounter someone experiencing an overdose, consider looking into what resources your state and county offer for training and distribution. You can check out GetNaloxoneNow.org to find more information.

We'll wrap up with a couple of fun animal stories.

Let's start with flamingos. They're not exactly known for being very active. You're probably picturing the birds standing calmly in crystal clear water. But according to a study published last Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they're surprisingly busy just beneath the surface.

Similar to the way spiders use webs to trap prey, the study authors say, flamingos create little water tornados to coax food straight into their mouths.

First, the birds use their feet to churn sediment up. Then they jerk their heads up, turning those small whorls of sediment into vortexes. Meanwhile, the animals chatter their beaks to create even more water movement, pulling the swirling sediment into their mouths. From there, the flamingos can filter out tiny prey such as brine shrimp—but it seems like this filter feeding is a lot less passive than it looks.

In other animal news, it turns out that chimps use leaves for everything from first aid to bathroom hygiene. In a study published Tuesday in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, researchers describe their observations of two different communities of chimpanzees in Uganda. The researchers identified numerous instances of “self-care” using leaves, from dabbing wounds to packing them with chewed-up plant matter. The chimps sometimes offered this care to others, too. That's similar to behavior other researchers reported last year in orangutans over in Indonesia. Orangutans have also been seen applying juice made from saliva and the leaves of a plant with anti-inflammatory properties all over their bodies, which scientists suspect they might be doing to relieve joint and muscle pain.

Plants seem to be part of a larger wellness routine for chimps, too: the scientists also saw them using leaves to clean themselves up after pooping or having sex. The researchers even described one instance of what they called “prosocial postcoital penis wiping,” which means one chimp leant another a hand with intimate personal hygiene.

While these aren't the first documented cases of first aid in nonhuman animals—or even in chimps, who have been seen putting smashed insects in their wounds, possibly for medicinal purposes—scientists are excited to see evidence that medicinal plant use might be more widespread than expected among our close relatives. That could suggest that wound care goes way, way back in our evolutionary history.

That's all for this week's news roundup. Rachel will be back on Wednesday.

Visualizing Science: Illustration and Beyond

Where does the illustrator end and the infographer begin? How does data visualization fit in? And what does science have to say about the design decisions we make? 

By Jen Christiansen 

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

This article was published in Scientific American's former blog network and reflects the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American

In July I presented at the 50th anniversary conference of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators (GNSI). Here's a lightly-edited transcript of that talk, with an abridged set of companion images. 

***Thanks for including me in the annual meeting. Particularly this year, here in Washington, DC. Although I've been a bit of an absentee family member, this feels something like a homecoming, in that the first GNSI meeting I attended was also in Washington DC, 22 years ago.

With the goal of reinforcing connections between communities and to strengthen some of those family ties, I plan to use this time to prompt you to think about what you [scientific illustrators] can learn from—and teach to—a few different sub-disciplines within the broader orb of visual science communication. For example: Where does the illustrator end….

….and the infographer begin?

How does data visualization fit in?

And what does science have to say about the design decisions we make?

But first, I should provide some context. The thoughts to follow are very much rooted my own experiences. This is a bit of a reflection upon what I've observed over the last 20 years as an art director. This is not a comprehensive literature review or a rigorous look at the entire field of science visualization. These are musings related to my journey—rooted in the world of publishing—with shout-outs to some of the resources and communities that I've found helpful or thought-provoking along the way. I am inevitably going to get myself into some trouble, as I'm not a specialist in all of the sub-disciplines that I'll be speaking about. But I do work at the intersection of these sub-disciplines, and over time I have developed a set of resources that may be of interest to you.

As background, for context on what has shaped my point of view, I should say that I self define as a graphics editor, science communicator, and an infographer. I was trained primarily in traditional (or physical) media. Here's one of my first published scientific illustrations—ink drawings of hydrothermal vent shrimp mouthparts. It's one of the products of a few summers in college, working in a crustacea lab at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles.

But I did get a chance to dabble in the digital realm starting in the late 1980's with a Commodore Amiga, thanks to my high school art teacher, Robert Tartter. I then shifted over to tablets and virtual drawing at Smith College, where my instructor Gary Niswonger led exercises like blind contour figure drawing. Model in the middle of the room, our backs towards our monitors, and Wacom tablets in our laps.

As much as I loved my art and design courses, I also loved my courses in science. I resisted choosing one discipline at the expense of the other, and pursued a double major in geology and studio art. Then, a scientific illustration graduate program at the University of California, Santa Cruz (now hosted by California State University at Monterey Bay) caught my eye, and allowed me to officially merge the two disciplines under the tutelage of Ann Caudle, Jenny Keller, and Larry Lavendal. Instead of dedicating myself to a single scientific line of research, I'd help make other people's research accessible to wider audiences through a visual language.

I entered the publishing scene after graduate school, as an intern in the art department at Scientific American, thanks to my mentor, Ed Bell. This is my first illustration for the magazine; a watercolor cockroach. 

My internship turned into a full-time job, and as my role shifted from artist to art director, I found myself setting my watercolors and Rapidograph pens aside and turning to the computer as my primary tool. In 1998, I left Scientific American to work as an assistant art director, then a designer, at National Geographic. All the while, growing as an art director, and learning about print production from some of the best in the business. Five years later, I left DC and established a freelance science communication business, focusing mainly on magazine and book projects.

In 2007, I returned to Scientific American, where I'm now the senior graphics editor. Today, there are two of us on the graphics team, Amanda Montañez and me. We art direct all of the information graphics in the magazine, from data visualizations (like the sample on the left by Pitch Interactive), to illustrated explainers (like the sample on the right, by Cherie Sinnen). Occasionally we develop the final images ourselves, but most often we hire freelance artists, and manage the project.

We also manage digital versions of all the graphics for web and phone viewing, and Amanda develops graphics specifically for the web environment…

…but I'm going to remain rooted in print examples for what I'll be sharing today.

Editorial illustrations, like these examples by Maria Corte Maidagan and Jay Bendt, are art directed by other folks in the art department (design director Michael Mrak and art director Jason Mischka).

What's the difference? By my definition, information graphics are illustrations, built on a foundation of research, that exist primarily to convey information. Whereas editorial illustrations are thematic illustrations that are inspired by the text, and which entice readers to engage more fully with the magazine's content.

For example, for an article on the microbiome, illustrator Bryan Christie developed an opening image that is not a literal representation of the concept, but instead nods to the idea of a human as being defined by the microbes within. Bryan is telling a story with visual symbols and thoughtful composition. This is not an information graphic. Instead, it's a metaphorical illustration that nods to the theme of the text.

Within the article, Bryan and his collaborator Joe Lertola shift into information-graphic mode, using visual symbols and thoughtful composition to convey very specific information that is rooted in research. This is not an editorial illustration. It's an information graphic or explanatory diagram.

Some artists, like Bryan Christie, are comfortable in both of these worlds.

But this is where I reside, when it comes to my own illustration work and in my role as a graphics editor. 

That said, I can learn from, and often work with, artists who navigate both sides. For example, for an article on malaria vaccines, I built out the content plan and composition, shown here. 

But knew that it would take an adept artist to breathe life into the spread. So I hired the illustration team of Peter and Maria Hoey to develop the final rendering. Peter and Maria have a great way with icons and develop rich textures and depth in their editorial work, attributes that served this information graphic well.

Similarly, I leaned heavily on editorial illustrator Leandro Castelao's styling and color palette to make this schematic of interferometers feel like it belongs in a consumer magazine, and not a scientific journal…

…and Gavin Potenza's style provided a fresh look at a topic that lots of media outlets covered, giving us a stylistically distinctive timeline of Mars exploration.

When working on my own illustrations, I find that I sometimes get hyper-focused on details related to accuracy, and the illustration style can fall flat. Things can get very academic looking and anonymous really fast. Editorial illustrators like Jillian Ditner and Chad Hagen remind me that injecting the artist's voice and point of view and sense of style is OK, particularly in the context of a magazine.

Let's revisit this slide…

…and dive in further to some lessons learned and specific resources related to information graphics.

I tend to think of information graphics as a continuum, with figurative representations at one end and abstract representations on the other.

In the world of science visualization, you could argue that the full continuum can also be referred to as data visualizations. 

After all, essentially all of our work is rooted in data collection at some stage in the process: from bone length measurements in dinosaur reconstructions, …

…to meticulously documented laboratory experiments that build up to a more complete understanding of processes like photosynthesis …

…to representations of mathematical expressions, like Feynman diagrams…

…to straight-up plotting of the raw data itself, in chart form. 

But, outside of the world of science visualization, it may be more useful to think of the continuum like this:

When I flip through old issues of Scientific American, it strikes me that many artists worked across this full spectrum. Regular contributor Bunji Tagawa's body of work astounds me. Here's a small sample, to give you a glimpse at the breadth of his skillset. It ranges from figurative depictions of objects…

…to medical cutaways…

…technical schematics…

…and data visualizations. [For more, see “Remembering Bunji Tagawa” by Amanda Montañez].

But as a graphics editor at the magazine now, I find myself maintaining discrete freelance pools for each of the different points along the continuum. 

Perhaps this is an artifact of my own biases, but when I flip through old issues of Scientific American, it occurs to me that this increased specialization may also be in part due to the shifting tools of each of these areas. When the primary tool for developing representative illustrations, explanatory diagram, and data visualizations for print magazines was pen and ink, an artist could become a master at pen and ink, then explore different methods of problem solving in each of these areas. Here are more examples from Tagawa. Again, from organics…

...to technical cutaways…

…abstract representations of processes…

…and number-based plots. All in pen and ink.

As desktop publishing became ubiquitous and digital rendering tools diversified and became more widely available, it seems to me that the simple act of choosing a primary tool starts to define the edges of the artist's scope. As an art director, I find myself specifically looking for 3D artists to build physical objects, like this example by Don Foley.

And I look for artists like Tami Tolpa, who hone in on composition and the flow of information by iterating with tools like Adobe Illustrator for explanatory diagrams.

And data designers that build solutions with code for visualizing large datasets, like Jan Willem Tulp.

Each of these tools, mediums, styles and genres take lots of time to master, and tend to favor certain portions of the continuum.

Many of the conferences I attend and communities that I engage with seem to reinforce these divisions, by focusing on the tools. And it seems that artists that span more than one of these orbs are harder and harder to find. 

Perhaps that way of thinking about things is a bit overly dramatic. The reality is probably much more like this.

And perhaps this is a completely natural and fine state to be in—particularly since the primary tools for these different sub-disciplines have bifurcated over time. And perhaps there isn't value in trying to force discrete clusters to reconnect.

After all, some of my favorite recent Scientific American graphics are the result of bringing together different artists—plucking experts from each of those groups and matching them up to create a final image that draws upon all of their strengths, not forcing one artist to excel in all areas. For example, I love to take an artist who can develop spot illustrations with a stylus or pen, and pair them up with an artist who can custom code data visualization solutions, as in this example by Moritz Stefaner and Jillian Walters.

But it also applies to graphics like these, in which different pieces of the full story are simply better served by different types of visualizations and areas of artist expertise.

That said, I argue that even if you don't have the desire to work across the full continuum—or the time to dedicate to becoming proficient across the full continuum—there is lots to be learned from each of these clusters, and I'd love to see more cross pollination of ideas between them. I think we'd all benefit, if things looked more like this:

And even better, if things looked like this:

I'm not arguing that everyone along this continuum should learn how to code. Or that everyone along the continuum should build clay maquettes and paint from life. I'm arguing that we can—and should—learn how science visualizers from cross the full spectrum think through and solve problems.

In that spirit, I'd like to share some of the things that I've learned from individuals within these different clusters. 

First, I should note that at this web address: http://bit.ly/jenGNSI, you'll find a Google Sheet of more complete citations and links to sources that directly relate to the rest of my presentation. I'll be showing some examples from the magazine that exemplify the lessons that I've learned, but in many cases, I've absorbed those lessons through a variety of books, blog posts, presentations, podcasts and workshops. This Google Sheet will guide you to specific references that you might find inspiring as more context for each of the following points.

And at this web address: http://bit.ly/SciVizResources, you'll find a more general list of references that I've built in response to specific requests from students, scientists, and artists interested in learning more about scientific visualization—all the way from illustration to data visualization—as well as references related to the work I do as a science graphics editor.

Back to representative illustrations. Here are 5 key lessons that I've gleaned largely from the scientific illustration community.

Lesson number 1: Every detail is worthy of intense attention and care. Every feature should be observed and considered.

For a graphic about the impact of mosquitoes on public health, artist Immy Smith demonstrates that yes, a lineup of different mosquito species can, in fact, be visually interesting and informative…

…and reinforces the idea that different mosquito species are connected to different diseases in humans. Some of my colleagues were a bit skeptical at this plan—they worried that the mosquitos would all look the same. But the careful and exacting eye of artist Immy Smith revealed the variations between them. 

It's clear here that every pencil mark is intentional and considered. To my mind, the thoughtful and meticulous rendering of every single detail is a challenge to the reader to, in return, carefully and thoughtfully consider each insect depicted.

Lesson 2: Get your eyes on the subject matter

For an article on the American burying beetle, artist Kelly Murphy knew she'd need to render the insect from a variety of angles. Existing images online made for great references for top-down views. But in order to get a better look at the mouthparts and in order to more accurately represent the beetle in different positions, she tracked down a specimen at the California Academy of Sciences and spent some time photographing it from all angles.

Lesson 3: if you can't get your eyes on the subject matter, consider making an approximation.

Artist James Gurney's scenes are incredibly convincing in part due to the dimensional models he develops to inform his composition and lighting.

Lesson 4: There is power in photorealistic and hyper-real renderings

As Ed bell wrote in 2010, “Artist Ron Miller takes us on a journey to eight of the most breathtaking views that await intrepid explorers of our solar system. The scale of these natural wonders dwarfs anything Earth has to offer. What might we see and feel if we could travel to these distant domains? The artist's eye—interpreting data from probes such as NASA's Cassini, which is now exploring the Saturnian system, and MESSENGER, which has flown by Mercury three times and goes into permanent orbit next March—allows us an early visit to these unforgettable locales.”

Lesson 5: There is power in non-photorealistic renderings

Here, artist Carol Donner edits out non-essential details and employs transparency to create an aesthetically appealing and clear look at the heart. Unlike Ron Miller's objective in the view of Saturn, the goal here is not to help the reader to experience an environment. The goal here is to represent the behavior of an object.

As Ian Suk and his co-authors wrote in The Journal of Biocommunication, “Medical illustration, by its very essence, requires some degree of simplification and idealization of the subject. It is the role of the illustrator to visually educate the reader regarding a complex biomedical procedure, structure, or process in an aesthetic and efficient manner.”

Let's start to slide over more into the realm of information graphics and explanatory diagrams.

Lesson 1: There's power in knowing when and how to distort the physical form of your subject to best serve the informational content

This particular example was rendered by Bunji Tagawa. It's a variation on a classic schematic representation of the cardiovascular system. Rather than get caught up in the details of a human figure, the information is streamlined in a way that highlights the closed and circular flow of blood through the system. 

Lesson 2: Composition is key: the artist should be acutely aware of how they are guiding the reader's eye through an illustration

Here, John Grimwade very intentionally guides the reader's eye through the page with spare linework, selective color, and setting up the flow of action in a way that reinforces the flow of information.

Lesson 3: Text is vital. It is just as important as images.

Here, artist Emily Cooper presents an elegant set of four Atlantic Ocean views. Labels help orient the reader to a certain degree, and you can piece together parts of the story: We're looking at how winds and the gulf stream relate to temperature. But it's hard to sort out what the take-home message is.

That's where text comes in. The headline and annotation subheads immediately provide context.

The graphic aims to explain why winter is warmer in Europe, according to four different models. Through that lens, the reader is now primed to compare and contrast the four models.

Lesson 4: Welcoming gestures, in the form of relatable details or moments of joy, can engage readers

Nigel Holmes is an expert at including touches of humor and humanity to explanatory graphics. Here, he manages to inject life into a graphic about group theory and the mathematical underpinnings of symmetry. But the figures aren't simply decorative. They help reinforce the concept of the cube rotation around different axes.

Lesson 5: Context is key. Your audience and the goal of the information graphic should guide both content and style.

For an article on artificial photosynthesis, a scientist provided us with the reference material on the left. It's a schematic of the device they had developed to mimic the process. The image is perfectly serviceable for the scientist's peers, and for the context of a scientific paper. But for a consumer magazine, we needed to not only engage non-specialist readers, but also help them more immediately see the parallels between this technology and natural photosynthesis. Our version is on the right. Note that we introduced a photosynthesis primer of sorts for basic context. And the context of a consumer magazine granted us the freedom to go a bit more playful with the rendering style, making it a great match for botanical artist Cherie Sinnen.

Let's continue sliding over more into the realm of abstract renderings and data visualization.

Lesson 1: Fully explore your dataset. Then explore it some more.

For a graphic about changing bee populations over time, data visualizer Moritz Stefaner started by exploring the raw data, in forms ranging from bar charts to tables and heat maps to network diagrams, all in the service of examining the shape of the data through many different lenses. The data sketches on the left are just a small sample of the total. Only after he had thoroughly examined the data in different forms did he start to hone in on what final form might serve the data—and our readers—the best.

Lesson 2: It's OK to embrace complexity

But when presenting people with a complicated, layered, and rich look at a topic, always provide the reader the tools they need to interpret the visualization. Here, for an article on the evolution of mythical stories, the design studio Accurat presents many levels of data in a single visual. It's a complicated and rich data visualization, rooted in a complicated and rich dataset from a scientist. Some folks might argue that we're requiring too much effort on behalf of the reader. There's not a quick way to read this.

However, we set things up with a clear “How to Read this Figure” key, using informal language that you might use when talking a friend through the graphic. The idea being that once the reader dedicates a bit of guided effort into learning how to read things, they can then pop over and see a few annotated main takeaway points, then explore further on their own. This type of approach also allowed us to present the full dataset, rather than distilling things down into an over-simplistic summary.

Lesson 3: Novel forms can draw a reader in

For a piece on when babies are born, data scientist Zan Armstrong and visualizer Nadieh Bremer collaborated to develop this custom solution for the magazine. The information here could be presented in a more classic and linear chart form as well. But I doubt it would've captured the readers' attention nearly as well. The circles are not only captivating, but they also reinforce the cyclical nature of the data, like a clock. As with the complex example, however, the reader should be given a clear guide on how to read the graphic.

Lesson 4: But sometimes a straightforward line graph or bar chart is best

For this chart nugget on bias in coronary artery disease research, there was no need to push the boundaries or try to be clever. A straightforward and simple and familiar chart form was all that was needed.

Lesson 5: Your source data is not objective. Nor is it complete. 

I've included links to some great resources about this in my main reference list, but I think it's worth nodding directly to a few specific writings here.

As researcher, artist and software developer Catherine D'Ignazio writes in her post “What would feminist data visualization look like?”

“What's the issue? Feminist standpoint theory would say that the issue is that all knowledge is socially situated and that the perspectives of oppressed groups including women, minorities and others are systematically excluded from ‘general' knowledge…

…Until we acknowledge and recognize that power of inclusion and exclusion, and develop some visual language for it, we must acknowledge data visualization as one more powerful and flawed tool of oppression.”

And on the topic of missing data, artist and researcher Mimi Onuoha writes, “Datasets are the end product of classification systems, the clean outputs of intentional orderings. Datasets point to their own contrasts—specifically the things that we haven't collected…

…And if it is true that we make sense of the world through exclusion, then perhaps there is a special type of meaning to be found in the things that we leave out.”

These ideas have made me approach some projects with both more trepidation and clearer vision. For an article on infectious diseases, we hoped to give folks a sense of the global state of things. How have infectious diseases impacted public health over time and space? 

Art researcher Amanda Hobbs was a huge help on this front, doing a large literature survey and identifying some of the known pitfalls. We ended up using pretty standard and authoritative sources for the bulk of the spread: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization.

But even seemingly well-meaning authoritative sources can't control for data collection variations over time and space. And data collection methodologies are developed by individuals with inherent biases. So, I made sure to read the data documentation carefully, avoiding known pitfalls and making note of when methodologies changed. That helped guide decisions like the time interval we used, as well as some on-chart annotations. And we ran things by a few experts in the field for a reality check.

I'm still thinking that we should have done more to help readers understand that this sort of data is far from perfect. In the future, I plan to fight a little harder to keep more explanatory text intact. But we at least left a pretty clear crumb trail with the source citation, so that it's possible for people to inspect the original data for themselves.

And now, four bonus lessons from across and around the continuum.

Lesson 1: Question design “rules” 

Many of us can probably recite oft-quoted “rules” from well-known authors, like Edward Tufte's proclamation that “Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.” But how do we know that's true? And if it is true in one context, is it true in another? Perception scientists are steadily chipping away at some of these sorts of questions.

I'd encourage you to check out the Datastories podcast for interviews with some of those researchers, Robert Kosara's blog Eagereyes for leads on where else to look, and Kennedy Elliot's post entitled “39 studies about human perception in 30 minutes.”

Lesson 2: Share

I am often struck by how generous the data journalism community is when it comes to sharing visualization best-practices, story ideas, techniques, tools and resources. If you're interested in learning more, a great place to start is the Computer Assisted Reporting program of the Investigative Reporters and Editors organization.

A few more specific resources include Jennifer LaFleur's guide to bulletproofing your data…

….and ProPublica's “The Nerd Blog.”

Lesson 3: Create spaces for dialogue

The intersection of science and the fine and performing arts is a bit further outside of my personal wheelhouse, but I'm excited to continue to learn more about how artists and performers engage with broad audiences in different kinds of spaces. And I'm interested trying to figure out how to apply those lessons of engagement within my magazine work.

For more, I'd encourage you to check out SciArt Center, an online platform and event organization that promotes cross-disciplinary collaborations, art exhibits and events.

And for more information about the performing arts and science, see Jamé McCray's talk at the SciVizNYC conference in 2017, as well as one of the communities she references in that talk, SuperHero Clubhouse. As I mentioned a moment ago, I'm trying to figure out how to apply some of their lessons of audience engagement and dialogue within my magazine work.

But meanwhile, I'm trying to actively create spaces for dialogue for the science visualization community as a member of the organizing team of SciVizNYC. I'd love to see this model put into action in other locations. 

The idea for this event rolled out of conversations with medical illustrator Jill Gregory. She and I enjoyed visiting each other's workplace, to see how we each put our training in scientific illustration to use. We wondered if a roving meet-up event could work, in which a group moved from one office to another studio to another newsroom over the course of a day, seeing how different folks put scientific visualization to use in their daily work. As the idea grew, Jill and I were joined by co-organizers Christopher Smith, Amanda Montañez, and Ni-ka Ford. We ended up moving forward with a more traditional—and logistically easier—all-day event in a single location featuring 14 speakers. Our first event, in 2016, was free. We charged $35 a seat for our second event to discourage no-shows. But it was important for us to keep the cost of entry as low as possible, while still paying our speakers a small honorarium for their time. Thanks to funding from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we were able to make that happen. Our event brings together a wide variety of visual science communicators together—primarily from the New York City area—to learn about the topic from many different angles.

Which brings me to Lesson 4: We're stronger together

I'd like to tip my hat to platforms and communities that encourage idea and tool sharing. I've grown a great deal by seeing the data visualization community problem solve in real time on Twitter, watching panel discussions about technology and interaction through the lens of ethics at Eyeo Festival, listening to talks about the open web at OpenVisConf, learning about how visual journalists from around the world solve problems at the Malofiej World infographics Summit,….the list is too long to call them all out individually here, but I've included some of my favorites in my general resource list.

There's certainly already evidence of lesson crossover between communities. For example, the idea of using annotations in information graphics has infiltrated the data visualization world, as demonstrated by tools developed in 2017 by data visualization engineer Susie Lu. Her work facilitates annotation integration for charts built with code.

And you could argue that the photo-real versus non-photo-real dynamic in scientific illustration, is mirrored by the complex versus simple dynamic in data visualization.

But I think we still have so much to learn from each other, especially when it comes to the challenge of visualizing scientific uncertainty—a communications challenge that cuts across all areas of science, and thus, all areas of science visualization.

At the magazine, we often work with academics and research scientists. Communities that regularly fall back on conventions like error bars. And all too often, I faithfully reproduce those error bars (shown here in gray), figuring that adding a few labels might be enough to unpack meaning.

The same goes for confidence intervals, like these. I'm not convinced that I did enough here to really help the reader fully understand what they're looking at.

A few years ago, I had a pivotal conversation with a cartographer at a Gordon Research Conference for visualization in science and education. Diana Sinton (from Cornell University) caused me to step back, and think about how I depict uncertainty more critically. We kicked off a collaboration, with support by a mini grant funded by NASA that resulted in this poster presentation, in the hopes of adding another perspective to the broader conversation on visualizing uncertainty.

At the time, conversations with regards to uncertainty tended to swirl around climate projections, but more recently, I think it's fair to say that election forecasting has taken center stage.

We started by diving into the literature, and that got me wondering, in data visualization, do we lean too heavily on conventions like the whisker box plot, error bars, and violin plots? And are conversations about which of these approaches are better than others too circular in nature?

What if we borrowed from qualitative, rather than quantitative examples? At Scientific American, we deal with representing different types of uncertainty all the time across different disciplines in explanatory diagrams. Can we borrow from those, and apply to data visualization?

What if data visualizers took inspiration from scientific illustrators? And scientific illustrators took inspiration from data visualizers? Maybe we could work together to figure out more intuitive ways to represent statistical uncertainty.

Quantum mechanics, and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle seems like a great place to start. Specifically, the idea that “events at the atomic level cannot be observed with certainty.” It's worth underscoring that the uncertainty principle describes quantum behavior and uncertainty at the particle level. And isn't a perfect analogy for uncertainty at the macro or classical physics level. 

But I'm more concerned with how we *illustrate* the uncertainty associated with the idea. So I think that studying figures like this one, which depict quantum mechanics, can still be really useful beyond the quantum world.

I don't want to get too bogged down in the science behind many of these examples, and truth be told, I only have a fleeting grasp on some of the physics they represent. But I still think that they can be informative, and hopefully inspiring. On the left, the classical view of light as a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. On the right, light as viewed through the lens of quantum mechanics—in which that line fluctuates within a larger envelope of uncertainty (shaded region).

The level of uncertainty not only varies over space, but also varies over time. Here's a neat example of three different ways to visualize that concept.

Neuroscience is another field filled with uncertainty. Here, regions of the brain are labeled like mountain ranges on a map. No clear boundaries are drawn because the boundaries aren't precisely known.

Around 70 years later, some structures and functions are known with greater precision. But we still rely on fuzzy edges quite a lot.

Here's another strategy for dealing with the uncertain geography of the brain. The entire structure is abstracted.

And here, the brain is rendered realistically, but process arrows float above the structure, suggesting that the exact details of those interactions are still a work in progress.

I think that this one (from 1969) is my favorite. Brain inputs—A B and C—and outputs —X, Y, and Z—are more or less understood. However, “far less is known about the workings of regions in between, which make up most of the brain.”

And those of you working in the realm of animal reconstructions have to deal with the challenge of building forms based on incomplete information all of the time. Here, artist Rudolf Freund uses strong line-work to signal what is known, and lighter line-work to signal what is uncertain.

And many of us deal with illustrating processes that aren't yet fully understood, or hypotheses that aren't yet proven. Sometimes it may make sense to simply resort to the use of a question mark and inset box, to help flag that a particular interpretation is still not fully embraced.

I'm not trying to suggest that the samples I just shared are perfect examples of visualizing uncertainty. But I think it would be exciting to see how qualitative solutions in general might inform quantitative solutions, and vice-versa.

So with that, I'll end with a request.

I hope that you'll join me in thinking on the topic of visualizing uncertainty, as well as developing other ways of strengthening ties and sharing lessons across the broader world of science visualization.

 Thanks to Jonathan Corum for inspiring this transcript post format. If you made it to the bottom of this one, I think you'll find his “Design for an Audience: Science graphics at The New York Times” transcript an enjoyable and informative read.

Metrics details

Early work has found that large language models (LLMs) can generate persuasive content. However, evidence on whether they can also personalize arguments to individual attributes remains limited, despite being crucial for assessing misuse. This preregistered study examines AI-driven persuasion in a controlled setting, where participants engaged in short multiround debates. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 12 conditions in a 2 × 2 × 3 design: (1) human or GPT-4 debate opponent; (2) opponent with or without access to sociodemographic participant data; (3) debate topic of low, medium or high opinion strength. In debate pairs where AI and humans were not equally persuasive, GPT-4 with personalization was more persuasive 64.4% of the time (81.2% relative increase in odds of higher post-debate agreement; 95% confidence interval [+26.0%, +160.7%], P < 0.01; N = 900). Our findings highlight the power of LLM-based persuasion and have implications for the governance and design of online platforms.

Persuasion, the process of altering someone's belief, position or opinion on a specific matter, is pervasive in human affairs and a widely studied topic in the social sciences1,2,3. From public health campaigns4,5,6 to marketing and sales7,8 to political propaganda9,10, various actors develop elaborate persuasive communication strategies on a large scale, investing substantial resources to make their messaging resonate with broad audiences. In recent decades, the diffusion of social media and other online platforms has expanded the potential of mass persuasion by enabling personalization or ‘microtargeting'—the tailoring of messages to an individual or a group to enhance their persuasiveness11,12. The efficacy of microtargeting has been questioned because it relies on the assumption of effect heterogeneity, that is, that specific groups of people respond differently to the same inputs, a concept that has been disputed in previous literature13,14. Nevertheless, microtargeting has proven effective in a variety of settings15,16,17, and most scholars agree on its persuasive power15,18,19.

Microtargeting practices are fundamentally constrained by the burden of profiling individuals and crafting personalized messages that appeal to specific targets, as well as by a restrictive interaction context without dialogue. These limitations may soon fall off due to the recent rise of large language models (LLMs)—machine learning models trained to mimic human language and reasoning by ingesting vast amounts of textual data. Models such as GPT-4 (ref. 20), Claude21 and Gemini22 can generate coherent and contextually relevant text with fluency and versatility, and exhibit human or superhuman performance in a wide range of tasks23. In the context of persuasion, experts have widely expressed concerns about the risk of LLMs being used to manipulate online conversations and pollute the information ecosystem by spreading misinformation, exacerbating political polarization, reinforcing echo chambers and persuading individuals to adopt new beliefs24,25,26,27.

A particularly menacing aspect of AI-driven persuasion is its possibility to easily and cheaply implement personalization, conditioning the models' generations on personal attributes and psychological profiles28. This is especially relevant since LLMs and other AI systems are capable of inferring personal attributes from publicly available digital traces such as Facebook likes29,30, status updates31,32 and messages33, Reddit and Twitter posts34,35, pictures liked on Flickr36, and other digital footprints37. In addition, users find it increasingly challenging to distinguish AI-generated from human-generated content, with LLMs efficiently mimicking human writing and thus gaining credibility38,39,40,41.

Recent work has explored the potential of AI-powered persuasion by comparing texts authored by humans and LLMs, finding that modern language models can generate content perceived as at least on par with, and often more persuasive than, human-written content41,42,43,44,45,46. Other research has focused on personalization, observing consequential yet non-unanimous evidence about the impact of LLMs on microtargeting47,48,49. There is, however, still limited knowledge about the persuasive power of LLMs in direct conversations with human counterparts and how AI persuasiveness, with or without personalization, compares with human persuasiveness (see Supplementary Section 1 for an additional literature review). We argue that the direct-conversation setting is of particularly high practical importance, as commercial LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini are trained for conversational use50.

In this preregistered study, we examine the effect of AI-driven persuasion in a controlled, direct-conversation setting. We created a web-based platform where participants engage in short multiround debates on various sociopolitical issues. Each participant was randomly paired with either GPT-4 or a live human opponent and assigned to a topic and a stance to hold. To study the effect of personalization, we also experimented with a condition where opponents had access to sociodemographic information about participants, thus granting them the possibility of tailoring their arguments to individual profiles. In addition, we experimented with three sets of debate topics, clustered on the basis of the strength of participants' previous opinions. The result is a 2 × 2 × 3 factorial design (two opponent types, two levels of participant information, three levels of topic strength). By comparing participants' agreement with the debate proposition before versus after the debate, we can measure shifts in opinion and, consequently, compare the persuasive effect of different treatments. Our setup differs substantially from previous research in that it enables a direct comparison of the persuasive capabilities of humans and LLMs in real conversations, providing a framework for benchmarking how state-of-the-art models perform in online environments and the extent to which they can exploit personal data. Although our study used a structured debate format, it nonetheless serves as a valuable proof of concept for how similar debates occur online, such as in synchronous discussions on platforms such as Facebook and Reddit.

Participants (N = 900) recruited for our experiment were redirected to a custom-made web platform designed to support real-time interactive conversations (the platform was built on top of Empirica.ly51; see Supplementary Section 2.4 for details). The experiment's workflow is represented schematically in Fig. 1. In phase A, participants asynchronously completed introductory steps and filled in a short demographic survey, recording their gender, age, ethnicity, education level, employment status and political affiliation. At each clock trigger of a 5-min interval timer, all participants who had completed the survey were randomly assigned to a treatment condition and matched with an appropriate opponent. In addition, each participant–opponent pair was randomly assigned to one debate topic (a simple debate proposition, for example, “Should students have to wear school uniforms?”; see Supplementary Section 2.3 for the complete list) and a random role, either in support (PRO) or against (CON) the proposition.

a, Participants complete a sociodemographic survey (gender, age, ethnicity, education level, employment status, political affiliation). b, Every 5 min, participants who have completed the survey are randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions: Human–Human, Human–AI, Human–Human (personalized) and Human–AI (personalized). In the ‘personalized' conditions, the opponent can access information collected from the participant's survey. Participant and opponent then debate for 10 min on a randomly assigned topic, holding the PRO or CON standpoint as instructed. Topics are randomly drawn from sets of three levels of opinion strength (low, medium, high). c, After the debate, participants complete another short survey measuring opinion change. Finally, they are debriefed about their opponent's identity. Our key outcome is the change in participants' views on the debated topic from before versus after the debate.

After being matched, participants transitioned to phase B, which was in turn divided into four stages: (1) ‘screening' (1 min), where participants, without yet knowing their role, were asked how much they agreed with the debate proposition (on a scale from 1, ‘strongly disagree', to 5, ‘strongly agree') and how much they had previously thought about it; (2) ‘opening' (4 min), where participants articulated their main arguments coherently with the assigned role; (3) ‘rebuttal' (3 min), where they responded to their opponent's arguments; and (4) ‘conclusion' (3 min), where participants were asked to respond to their opponent's rebuttal or reiterate their initial points. The opening–rebuttal–conclusion structure is based on a simplified version of the format commonly used in competitive academic debates. After the debate, in phase C, participants asynchronously completed a final exit survey. They were asked again how much they agreed with the proposition and whether they believed their opponent was a human or an AI. Finally, they were debriefed about their opponent's true identity.

For each debate, the assigned topic was randomly drawn from 30 propositions encompassing salient US political and social issues. An online sample of 60 US residents manually validated and selected these propositions from a larger pool, recording also their agreement with each proposition. We divided topics into three clusters (low, medium, high) of 10 propositions each, on the basis of their average opinion strength (see Supplementary Section 2 for details and the full list of topics). In this context, ‘strength' intuitively reflects a topic's level of controversy or polarization and how easy it is to sway opinions about it. Each participant was assigned to 1 of 12 conditions in a 2 × 2 × 3 design:

The participant was assigned to debate either a human or a GPT-4 opponent.

The opponent (whether human or GPT-4) either did or did not receive sociodemographic information (gender, age, ethnicity, education level, employment status and political affiliation, as recorded in the pretreatment survey) about the participant. When the LLM was provided with personal attributes, we instructed it to ‘astutely use this information to craft arguments that are more likely to persuade and convince your opponent of your stance' (see Supplementary Section 2.5 for the complete prompts).

The debate topic belonged to the low-, medium- or high-strength cluster.

In each condition, 50 debates were held, yielding 600 debates and N = 900 unique participants, since Human–Human debates required two participants. Within each condition, we randomized topics such that exactly 5 debates argued about each topic.

We measured the persuasive effect of the treatment conditions described by measuring participants' agreements with their propositions before (Apre) and after (Apost) the debates. To frame changes in agreement as persuasive effects, we aligned the scores with the side (PRO or CON) ‘opposed' to the one assigned to the participant, that is, the one held by their opponent, by transforming them as follows:

resulting in the two variables \({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{pre}}}\) and \({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\). Implicitly, this transformation corresponds to the natural assumption that agreements get inverted around 3 (the ‘neutral' score) when debate propositions are negated. With this adjustment, \({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}} > {\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\) means that participants were persuaded to shift their opinion towards their opponent's side, whereas \({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\le {\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\) means that their opinion did not change or was reinforced towards their assigned side. By comparing the transformed agreement scores \({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\) and \({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\) using a partial proportional odds model52, we measure the causal effect of each treatment condition on the likelihood that participants are persuaded by their opponents. In particular, we consider as our main outcome the odds \(\frac{P({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}} > a)}{P({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\le a)}\) of obtaining higher post-treatment agreement, ∀ a ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. We chose this model because the outcome is ordinal and since our data do not satisfy assumptions of simpler ordinal regression models (see Supplementary Section 3 for details).

Our key finding is that GPT-4 performs as well as or better than humans in our debate task. We consider the first two dimensions of our design (human or AI opponents, with or without personalization), aggregating across all topic clusters. We report the results in Fig. 2, taking as a reference the Human–Human condition and examining the differences relative to it. Human–AI (personalized) debates show the strongest positive effect, meaning that GPT-4 with access to personal information had higher persuasive power than humans. We estimate that the odds of greater agreement with opponents is +81.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) [+26.0%, +160.7%], P < 0.01) higher in the Human–AI (personalized) condition compared with the Human–Human reference condition. Intuitively, this means that 64.4% of the time, personalized LLM debaters were more persuasive than humans, given that they were not equally persuasive (see Supplementary Section 3 for an explanation). For the Human–AI (+21.9%, 95% CI [−16.2%, +77.3%], P = 0.30) and the Human–Human (personalized) (−15.7%, 95% CI [−42.2%, +23.0%], P = 0.38) conditions, there is insufficient evidence to conclude a difference in persuasiveness between them and the Human–Human baseline, considering a 0.05 significance level. By contrast, the Human–AI (personalized) effect remains significant even when changing the reference category to Human–AI (P = 0.04). Remarkably, these findings provide evidence that GPT-4-based microtargeting strongly outperforms both non-personalized GPT-4 and human-based microtargeting, with GPT-4 leveraging personal information more effectively than humans (see Supplementary Section 5 for examples of complete debates showcasing effective use of personalization).

For each condition, the point estimates represent relative changes compared to the Human–Human reference in the odds of post-treatment agreement assuming higher values (see Supplementary Section 3 for more details). Horizontal lines indicate 95% CIs based on two-sided t-tests; n = 750. GPT-4 outperforms humans in the debate task when given participants' basic personal information (P < 0.01) and performs similarly to humans when not given personal information. Full numerical results, including intercepts, are reported in Supplementary Table 4.

To provide a more intuitive interpretation, we repeat our analysis using a simpler linear regression (see Supplementary Section 7 for details), a modelling choice that is statistically less appropriate for our setup (see Methods for a broader discussion) but that can intuitively provide some basic insights about the effectiveness of our treatments. We find that, on average, Human–AI (personalized) debates are associated with an increase of 0.36 (95% CI [0.12, 0.60], P < 0.01) in the difference \({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}-{\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\), with respect to the Human–Human condition. In contrast, the other two treatments again have non-significant coefficients.

Complementing the results concerning relative change, we also inspect the absolute agreement distributions (see Supplementary Section 8 for details). We find that debates tended to produce a backfire reaction for all conditions except Human–AI (personalized), reinforcing opinions toward the side assigned for the experiment instead of moving them toward the opponent's side. This trend is consistent with previous literature describing a hardening of pretreatment opinions when people express their ideas53 or are exposed to disagreeing views54, or finding opinion change to be highly affected by argument order55.

Figure 3 shows the results broken down by topic strength, fitting an independent regression per cluster. We observe that the effect of Human–AI (personalized) debates remains strong for the low- and medium-strength clusters, but drops below the significance level for high-strength topics (+64.2%, 95% CI [−14.7%, +216.1%], P = 0.14). Again, the effects across all clusters remain non-significant for the other conditions, exhibiting persuasive results indistinguishable from the Human–Human baseline.

For each condition, the point estimates represent relative changes compared to the Human–Human reference in the odds of post-treatment agreements assuming higher values. Horizontal lines indicate 95% CIs based on two-sided t-tests; n = 750. Full numerical results are reported in Supplementary Tables 5, 7.

Next, we investigate how arguments differ across treatment conditions by conducting a textual analysis of the generated writings to identify distinctive patterns. In Fig. 4, we report the distribution of prominent textual features extracted with LIWC-22 (ref. 56) (see Supplementary Section 10 for additional details). We observe that GPT-4 opponents tended to use logical and analytical thinking substantially more than humans. On the other hand, humans used more first-person singular and second-person pronouns and produced longer but easier-to-read texts, as measured by the Flesch Reading Ease score57. The difference in length and second-person pronoun usage can, at least partially, be explained by the specific prompts we chose (see Supplementary Section 2.5 for details), where we instructed GPT-4 to write only one to two sentences per stage and to refrain from directly addressing its opponent unless they do it first. There does not seem to be a difference induced by personalization, with distributions being very similar both between Human–Human and Human–Human (personalized) and between Human–AI and Human–AI (personalized). Analyses of underlying social dimensions and usage of persuasive strategies (Supplementary Section 10) confirm that GPT-4 heavily relied on logical reasoning and factual knowledge. At the same time, humans displayed more appeals to similarity, expressions of support and trust, and employed more storytelling.

Each violin is drawn using a kernel density estimate of the underlying distribution. Within each violin, a box plot is overlaid: the centre line indicates the median, the bounds of the box represent the first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3), and the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the interquartile range from Q1 to Q3. Points beyond this range are omitted; n = 750. Except for the Flesch Reading Ease score, all features were extracted via LIWC-22 (ref. 56), which provides a dictionary of words belonging to various linguistic, psychological and topical categories (see Supplementary Section 10 for additional details). ‘Analytic' is a metric of logical, formal and analytical thinking, ‘Clout' expresses language of leadership and status, ‘Authentic' measures perceived honesty and genuineness, and ‘Tone' is the degree of emotional tone. Flesch Reading Ease is a measure of how easy to read a text is, based on its average number of words per sentence and average number of syllables per word. Analytic, Clout, Authentic and Tone have been normalized to the [0, 1] range, Flesch Reading Ease scores were divided by 100, while the remaining categories were computed directly as frequencies across the entire text produced by each participant. Note that scales differ across panels representing counts and scores, and additionally for the Word count and the Flesh Reading Ease panels.

Finally, we turn to participants' perceptions of their opponents, recorded at the end of each debate by asking them whether they thought they had debated with a human or an AI. Figure 5 shows the distribution of answers and how the difference in pre- versus post-debate agreement (\({\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}-{\tilde{A}}^{{\rm{post}}}\)) depends on how participants perceived their opponents. In debates with AI, participants correctly identified their opponent's identity in about three out of four cases, indicating that the writing style of GPT-4 in this setting has distinctive features that are easy to spot. Conversely, participants struggled to identify their opponents in debates with other humans, with a success rate indistinguishable from random chance (P = 0.42 for a two-sided Binomial test; success rate 52.0%, 95% CI [47.3%, 56.7%], n = 450). Moreover, we notice that when participants believed they were debating with an AI, they changed their expressed scores to agree more with their opponents compared with when they believed they were debating with a human (odds of greater agreement with opponents +37.4%, 95% CI [+3.03%, +83.3%], P = 0.03; see Supplementary Section 12 for details). We emphasize that this observation is based solely on correlation and does not imply causation: it is unclear whether the difference in agreement change is motivated by participants' beliefs about their opponent or whether, conversely, those beliefs are caused by opinion change. For example, participants could have been more lenient in changing their agreement score towards their opponent when they believed they were facing an AI, because not having a human on the other side makes it unconsciously easier to accept that they have somewhat lost the debate. Conversely, participants could have also believed that their opponent was an AI because of how well their arguments were written. However, even if differences in agreement change were influenced by how participants perceived their opponent (in line with the first of the above two explanations), we find that treatment effects change very little when adding beliefs about opponents' identities as a control in our regression. Particularly, the Human–AI (personalized) condition still has a strong and significant effect (+70.2%, 95% CI [+17.8%, +146.0%], P < 0.01). Therefore, how participants perceived their opponent is not enough to explain the treatment effects, which instead seem more tied to the intrinsic capabilities of AI to generate better arguments. Lastly, we investigate the relationship between perceptions of opponents and textual covariates, finding that participants associated texts that are easy to read (P = 0.04) with human opponents (see Supplementary Section 12 for details).

a, Relative frequency of people's beliefs on whether they were debating with a human or an AI, by the real type of their opponent. b, Average difference in agreements after versus before the debates.

LLMs have been criticized for their potential to generate and foster the diffusion of hate speech, misinformation and malicious political propaganda. Specifically, there are concerns about the persuasive capabilities of LLMs, which could be critically enhanced through personalization, that is, tailoring content to individual targets by crafting messages that resonate with their specific background and demographics25,26,28.

In this paper, we explored the effect of AI-driven persuasion and personalization in structured online conversations, comparing the performance of GPT-4 with that of humans in a one-on-one debate task. We conducted a controlled experiment where we assigned participants to 1 of 12 treatment conditions, randomizing their debate opponent to be either a human or GPT-4, as well as randomizing access to personal information and the degree of opinion strength of the debate topic. We then compared reported agreements before and after the debates, measuring the opinion shifts of participants and, thus, the persuasive power of the arguments generated by humans and AI.

Our results show that, on average, GPT-4 opponents outperformed human opponents across every topic and demographic, exhibiting a high level of persuasiveness. In particular, when compared to the baseline condition of debating with a human, debating with GPT-4 with personalization resulted in a +81.2% increase (95% CI [+26.0%, +160.7%], P < 0.01) in the odds of reporting higher agreements with opponents (see Supplementary Section 3 for details). More intuitively, this means that 64.4% of the time, personalized GPT-4 opponents were more persuasive than human opponents, given that they were not equally persuasive (see Supplementary Section 3 for a detailed explanation). Without personalization, GPT-4 opponents were on par with human opponents (P = 0.30), and so were human opponents with access to personalization (P = 0.38). In other words, not only was GPT-4 able to exploit personal information to tailor its arguments effectively, but it also succeeded in doing so far more effectively than humans.

Our study suggests that concerns around personalization and AI persuasion are warranted, reinforcing previous results42,44,45,48 by showcasing how LLMs can outpersuade humans in online conversations through microtargeting. We emphasize that the effect of personalization is particularly remarkable given how little personal information was collected (gender, age, ethnicity, education level, employment status and political affiliation) and despite the extreme simplicity of the prompt instructing the LLM to incorporate such information (see Supplementary Section 2.5 for the complete prompts). Even stronger effects could probably be obtained by exploiting individual psychological attributes, such as personality traits and moral bases, or by developing stronger prompts through prompt engineering, fine-tuning or specific domain expertise. In this context, malicious actors interested in deploying chatbots for large-scale disinformation campaigns could leverage fine-grained digital traces and behavioural data, building sophisticated, persuasive machines capable of adapting to individual targets. We argue that online platforms and social media should seriously consider such threats and extend their efforts to implement measures countering the spread of AI-driven persuasion. A promising approach to counter mass disinformation campaigns could be enabled by LLMs themselves, generating similarly personalized counternarratives to educate bystanders potentially vulnerable to deceptive posts27,58. Early efforts in this direction are already underway, with promising results in reducing conspiratory beliefs thanks to dialogues with GPT-4 (ref. 59). Our analyses also provided initial insights into the mechanisms behind LLM persuasion. We found notable differences in the writing style between GPT-4 and human debaters. For instance, texts generated by LLM debaters were harder to read and had more markers associated with logical and analytical reasoning (Fig. 4).

Future work could replicate our approach to benchmark the persuasive capabilities of LLMs continuously, measuring the effect of different models and prompts and their evolution over time. Moreover, our method could be extended to other settings, such as negotiation games60 and open-ended conflict resolution, mimicking the structure of online interactions and conversations more closely. Other efforts could explore whether our results are robust to deanonymization, measuring what happens when participants are initially informed about their opponent's identity. A crucial point that also needs further investigation is why Human–AI (personalized) debates were significantly more effective than Human–AI debates, given that our descriptive analyses of textual features have found no meaningful variations between the two conditions. We hypothesize that this difference is not driven by changes in the writing style but rather by differences in the choice of issues brought up during the debates (see Supplementary Section 5 for an example of how this mechanism might unroll). However, the precise nature of the dynamics behind this process is still a very open question. In addition, we emphasize that prompting plays a big role in the textual signature exhibited by LLMs. Future work could experiment with prompts that instruct GPT-4 to be less reliant on logical reasoning and showcase more appeals to support and trust, mimicking the style of human debaters and potentially enhancing its persuasive capabilities.

Although we believe our contribution constitutes a meaningful advance for studying the persuasive capabilities of language models, we identify four key limitations.

First, the assignment of participants to debate sides was randomized, regardless of their previous opinions on the topic. This was crucial to identify causal effects under the logistical challenge of matching participants in real time. Still, it could have introduced substantial bias in that human arguments might have been weaker than those of LLMs simply because opponents did not honestly believe in the standpoint they were advocating for. To address such concerns, we fit a version of our model that considers opponents' pretreatment agreements as a control (Supplementary Section 13). We found the effect of opponents' agreements to be non-significant (P = 0.22), suggesting that our results might be robust to this limitation. In addition, we repeated our main analysis restricting our dataset to opponents arguing for a standpoint aligned with their previous opinions, finding again a strong and statistically significant effect for the Human–AI (personalized) condition (+122.8%, 95% CI [+6.2%, +367.3%], P = 0.03). Remarkably, this seems to suggest that people can play the role assigned to them with great credibility, even when defending positions they do not spontaneously agree with. Nevertheless, given the small size of this restricted sample, future work would be needed to validate our findings while enforcing matches between people on opposing sides of each issue.

Second, our experimental design forced conversations to have a predetermined structure, strictly following the stages and rules of a debate. While we believe that our setup captures the essence of many online interactions, where people reply to each other in an almost synchronous fashion or react to others' comments in real time, it still targets an artificial environment that can substantially diverge from the dynamics of online conversations, which evolve spontaneously and unpredictably. In addition, on our platform, conversations were entirely anonymized, making them different from the normal conditions under which humans interact. Therefore, we acknowledge that the ecological validity of our findings is limited, as it is unclear how our results would generalize to natural discussions on social networks and other online platforms. For this reason, our work should be seen as providing a proof of concept about LLMs' persuasive capabilities rather than a realistic evaluation of their persuasiveness in the wild, which remains an open question for future research.

Third, the time constraint implemented in each debate stage potentially limited participants' creativity and persuasiveness, decreasing their performance. This can be especially true for the Human–Human (personalized) condition, where the participants provided with personal information about their opponents had to process and implement it without any time facilitation.

Fourth, our experiment engaged human participants recruited through Prolific, who received financial incentives for completing debates and were aware of being in a controlled experimental environment. Although previous research has found Prolific to have the best data quality among competitors and research done using Prolific to be often generalizable61,62,63, the pool of workers active on the platform still differs in their sociodemographic distribution from both the overall US population and the user base of other online platforms and social media. Therefore, future work is needed to understand whether our findings can be reproduced using a more representative sample that accurately mimics the overall spectrum of human persuasive skills. In addition, it would be interesting to include human experts in our comparison, such as individuals involved in competitive debating, political campaigns or public communication.

Despite these limitations, we hope our work will stimulate researchers and online platforms to seriously consider the threat posed by LLMs fuelling divide, spreading malicious propaganda and developing adequate countermeasures.

Our platform was approved by EPFL's Human Research Ethics Committee (095-2023) and preregistered at https://aspredicted.org/DCC_NTP on 18 December 2023. Informed consent was collected from all participants. We recruited participants for our study through Prolific between December 2023 and April 2024, under the criteria that they were 18+ years old and located in the United States. The location requirement is motivated by the fact that most debate topics are deeply rooted in US national issues and would not resonate with different populations. To prevent skill disparity, each worker was allowed to only participate in one debate. The participant was paid €2.50 (US$3.15) and had a median completion time of 16 min, corresponding to a pay rate of about €9.40 per hour (US$11.80 per hour). Following recommendations from ref. 64, workers were explicitly informed that using LLMs and Generative AI tools was strictly prohibited and would result in their exclusion from the study. Regardless, coherent with our preregistration, we manually reviewed each debate and excluded 20 debates where at least one human participant showed clear indications of LLM usage (unrealistic values of words per minute, blatant evidence of ChatGPT's standard writing style) and plagiarism (as detected by DupliChecker, https://www.duplichecker.com/). In addition, we excluded 13 debates where at least one participant provided unacceptable (empty texts, nonsensical or few-word arguments) or incomplete answers. The number of people involved in rejected debates was not counted towards the total number of participants (N = 900), as the affected tasks were republished on Prolific and completed by other workers. In addition, to prevent participants from attempting a Turing test, we informed them that their goal was not to spot whether their opponent was a human or an AI but rather to be as persuasive as possible during the debate. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the total number of participants, but our sample size is similar to those reported in previous publications41,45,48,49. Our final sample (N = 900) was 49.6% male, 47.7% female, 2.7% other, with the following age distribution: 11.3% 18–24 years old, 34.1% 25–34, 23.7% 35–44, 17.3% 45–54, 8.7% 55–64, 4.8% 65+. Each participant was randomly assigned with equal probability to one treatment condition and one topic.

We selected the 30 topics used within our experiment using a three-step procedure (see Supplementary Section 2 for additional details): (1) we manually curated an initial pool of 60 candidate topics, drawing from various online sources under the criteria that propositions should be broad, easy to understand and to debate, and reasonably divisive. (2) We conducted a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, where N = 60 US residents annotated candidate propositions across three dimensions: agreement, knowledge and debatableness. (3) We filtered out the 10 topics with the most unanimous positions and the remaining 20 least debatable topics, narrowing down the pool to the final 30 topics. On the basis of the strength of ‘agreements' (the absolute deviation from the ‘Neutral' score), we divided those topics into three clusters (low-strength, moderate-strength and high-strength).

For all the regressions reported in the main text, we used a partial proportional odds specification52 to model the agreements post treatment in terms of agreements pre treatment and treatment conditions (see Supplementary Section 3 for additional details). This modelling choice was motivated by the fact that our outcome of interest, answers on a 1–5 Likert scale, is ordinal. Previous research has advised against using ‘metric' models such as linear regression for ordinal data, as the practice can lead to systematic errors65. For example, the response categories of an ordinal variable may not be equidistant—an assumption that is required in statistical models of metric responses66. A solution to this issue is the use of so-called cumulative ordinal models that assume that the observed ordinal variable comes from the categorization of a latent, non-observable continuous variable66, such as the partial proportional odds model52. We fit our debate dataset to such a model using a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno solver. For Human–Human personalized debates, we only considered participants who did not have access to their opponents' personal information, so that the setup is equivalent to Human–AI personalized debates. Instead, we extracted two data points from each Human–Human debate, corresponding to both participants. We computed standard errors using a cluster-robust estimator67 to adjust for interdebate correlations. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.

We indicated in our preregistration (https://aspredicted.org/DCC_NTP) that we would assign participants to 1 of 9 treatment conditions, resulting from the combination of three opponent-related conditions (Human–Human, Human–AI, Human–AI personalized) and three topic-related conditions (low-, moderate- and high-strength cluster), in a 3 × 3 factorial design. We additionally registered that we might carry out a Human–Human personalized condition on a sample of topics, conditional on resource availability. In the end, we decided to run the Human–Human personalized across all topics, with the same sample size and number of debates as the other conditions. Therefore, to simplify the main text's explanation, we reformulated it by framing it as a 2 × 2 × 3 design. For completeness, we report our originally planned 3 × 3 analysis in Supplementary Section 4. We found results to be consistent with those reported in the main text (cf. Figs. 2 and 3), with Human–AI personalized having a strong and statistically significant effect across all topic clusters.

Metrics details

The Po Plain in northern Italy is a critical agricultural region and one of the largest water users in the European Union. Recent dry conditions have put future water resource availability into question. This study examines spatio-temporal variations in groundwater storage observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and more than 1,000 groundwater wells from 2002 to 2022. We find that the rate of groundwater storage decline more than doubled from 2015 to 2022 as compared to the 2002–2022 rate. We also show that seasonal and long-term groundwater availability is strongly influenced by irrigation activities. Groundwater storage in irrigated areas is highly correlated to snow accumulation in the Alps and shows more stability as compared to non-irrigated areas, which experience dramatic declines during drought years. This indicates that inefficient irrigation practice, using water largely supplied by snowmelt, recharges underground aquifers and helps maintain high water tables, making aquifers underlying irrigated farmland resilient to the negative consequences of drought. These findings can help guide climate-driven adaptations to irrigation systems that account for the impact on groundwater recharge.

Metrics details

Wearable electronics, such as smart textiles, are of potential use in healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces and environmental analysis. However, the scalability and reliability of the technology is restricted due to challenges related to rapid material degradation, potential toxicity, high production costs and heavy computational workload. Here we report an acoustic-based smart textile technology. The approach, which we term SonoTextiles, uses piezoelectric transducers that are mounted at both ends of glass microfibres and act as transmitters and receivers of acoustic waves. The flexible glass microfibres act as acoustic waveguides and are embedded into the textile substrate, providing precise sensing by measuring wave propagation and energy loss along the fibre in response to stimuli such as touch and bending. We also use acoustic frequency selectivity and frequency-domain signal processing algorithms to enhance computational efficiency. Our acoustic textile is breathable, durable and stable under thermal fluctuations, and we show that it can be used in distributed tactile sensing, hand gesture recognition and respiratory rate monitoring.

Wearable electronics, such as smart textiles sensors, can enhance real-time interaction and perception across various environments1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Textile sensors can, in particular, be used for in situ healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces and environmental analysis9,10,11,12. Such textiles involve the integration of sensing technologies with fabric bases9,13. A variety of functional materials can be used to create these systems, including electromagnetic14, piezoelectric15, triboelectric16 and magnetoelastic17 materials, which are fabricated within the fibres through manufacturing techniques such as coating, spinning, printing and thermal drawing18,19,20,21,22,23. Acting as yarns, these functionalized fibres are spun into smart textiles by weaving, knitting or other structuring means9.

When incorporated into everyday clothing, the textiles can detect physiological and environmental factors such as pressure, strain, humidity, temperature and sound, and they should, ideally, be breathable, flexible and lightweight24,25,26,27,28. Smart textiles can be designed to harvest energy from environmental sources12 and physical activities (such as body movements)14 to power sensors and other electronic components24,29. These textiles can also be designed to emit optical or acoustic signals, providing real-time interaction between the wearer and external systems10,12.

For smart textiles to be of wider practical value, they must be washable, robust, safe, non-toxic and cost-effective9,30. However, the functional materials typically suffer from rapid degradation, which complicates their integration into garments that undergo frequent friction and washing9,31. Furthermore, complex manufacturing processes and the use of rare raw materials leads to high costs9,12. The use of materials such as graphene nanoribbons28, polypyrrole27 and barium titanate12 also creates potential health risks and requires extensive toxicity evaluations32, particularly for wearable applications targeted at children or pregnant individuals. Moreover, efficient in-situ computing is crucial for smart textiles, especially for array-based sensory systems that handle large data volumes9,30.

Acoustic technologies can offer non-invasive monitoring, biocompatibility, cost-effectiveness, versatility and straightforward integration10,33,34,35,36, and smart textiles based on acoustic technologies have previously been used in human–machine interfaces and biomonitoring. For example, piezocomposite single fibres woven into a shirt have been used to measure the direction of acoustic impulses and facilitate bidirectional communication between similar garments, enabling the auscultation of cardiac sound signals10. However, the approach involves complex fabrication processes to form the nanostructured piezoelectric composites and the fibres10. As an alternative, an all-nanofibre mechano-acoustic sensor based on a standalone thin film has been used for the continuous monitoring of mechano-acoustic heart signals36. The approach demonstrated high mechanical robustness and consistent performance, but functioned as a standalone thin film, without integration into textiles. A key advantage of acoustic sensors is their frequency selectivity37,38, which can provide a selective response33,39, channel frequency multiplexing40 and out-of-band noise suppression41.

In this article, we report an acoustic-based smart textile for human–machine interactions and healthcare monitoring. The technology, which we term SonoTextiles, uses piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) mounted at both ends of glass microfibres to transmit and receive acoustic waves. The flexible glass microfibres act as acoustic waveguides and are embedded into a textile substrate to provide guided propagation of acoustic waves. The textile detects external stimuli in real time by measuring acoustic wave attenuation and energy loss within the fibre waveguide. We use acoustic frequency selectivity and frequency-domain signal processing algorithms to reduce system complexity and improve computational efficiency. We also incorporate frequency division multiple access (FDMA), which is a technique with dedicated frequency band allocation that is widely used in telecommunications42, to reduce the number of sensors, electrical connections and wires required for distributed sensing applications. We show that the smart textile can be used for tactile sensing, hand gesture recognition and respiratory rate monitoring. Our approach is based on a cost-effective design that avoids complex manufacturing processes and advanced functional materials. The system is also breathable, durable, thermally stable and safe.

A waveguide is a device designed to direct waves along a predetermined path, effectively confining them to minimize energy loss over distances43. SonoTextiles operate on the principle of propagating acoustic waves, predominantly Lamb waves, within glass microfibre waveguides44,45. The acoustic energy loss during this propagation is sensitive to external stimuli, allowing the textile to function effectively as a sensing platform. The smart acoustic textiles distribute microfibre waveguides on everyday clothing as a wearable electronic device to complete various sensing and interactive applications, such as tactile sensing, smart gloves and respiratory monitoring (Fig. 1a). To demonstrate the mechanism, we first configured our system as a single-input single-output (SISO) system (Fig. 1b). The SISO system primarily comprises a transmitting PZT (\({T}_{x}\)), a receiving PZT (\({R}_{x})\), a glass microfibre and the textile substrate. The \({T}_{x}\) performs electroacoustic conversion, whereas the \({R}_{x}\) performs acoustoelectric conversion (see Methods for more details). The glass microfibre, woven into the textile substrate, is connected at one end to the \({T}_{x}\) PZT and at the other to the \({R}_{x}\) PZT, serving as the waveguide for \({T}_{x}\)-generated acoustic waves. When external stimuli, such as applied pressing forces from physical touch or contact, are applied to the smart textile, any resultant changes in the amplitude or energy of the received acoustic signal are detected by the \({R}_{x}\) PZT, as shown by the decay in acoustic wave amplitude in Fig. 1b. Specifically, acoustic waves in the microfibre waveguide attenuate and undergo significant energy loss due to the contact between glass microfibres and yarns or skin. Building on this foundational principle, we have developed various systems with specific functions, such as the fibre-array tactile sensing interface illustrated in Fig. 1c. The thin and flexible glass microfibres are integrated into the textile substrate along both warp and weft directions, forming a distributed tactile sensing interface where each intersection serves as an addressable touchpoint. Based on various applications, the layout of the glass-fibre waveguides can be customized with unique features to create diverse smart textile systems. Figure 1d shows an image of the SISO system, where the \({T}_{x}\) and \({R}_{x}\) PZTs can be seen, as well as the glass microfibre connected to the PZTs and woven into the black textile substrate (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for more details). Figure 1e shows a fibre-array tactile sensing interface that features 16 touchpoints arranged in a 4 × 4 grid.

a, Concept of the proposed smart acoustic textiles. The acoustic waves transmitted and received by the PZT transducers will propagate along the microfibre waveguide woven in the textile, completing various wearable sensing and interactive tasks. b, Illustration of a basic SISO system. The acoustic wave generated by the transmitting PZT (\({T}_{x}\)) is transmitted through the waveguide of the glass microfibre to the receiving PZT (\({R}_{x}\)). Acoustic waves in glass fibre experience natural attenuation due to contact with the yarn. When external stimuli, such as touch or bending occur, this contact is increased and brings additional acoustic energy loss, as reflected by the \({R}_{x}\) amplitude. c, Illustration of a tactile sensing array using a MISO pattern along both weft (latitude) and warp (longitude). The \({R}_{x}\) can determine which \({T}_{x}\) the acoustic wave is coming from based on the assigned frequency and can detect the coordinate being touched. See Fig. 3 for more information. d, Image of a SISO system. The glass fibre is woven into a textile substrate. e, Image of the sensing array.

To elucidate the mechanism and functionalities, we conducted tests using the SISO system as our initial framework. We first evaluated the propagation of sinusoidal acoustic waves at different frequencies (Supplementary Fig. 2). The evaluation is divided into two cases: using the SISO system of a single fibre without textile (Fig. 2a); and using the SISO system with a textile substrate (Fig. 2b). Our results showed that the \({T}_{x}\) and \({R}_{x}\) signal amplitudes were directly proportional across the tested frequencies of 100, 101, 102 and 103 kHz, suggesting the feasibility and robustness of the proposed microfibre waveguide for acoustic propagation within a wide frequency band (Fig. 2c,d). These frequencies were chosen based on the impedance characterization results of the selected PZT transducers for better piezoelectric performance (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Because the contact between the fibre and yarn causes more acoustic energy loss, the \({R}_{x}\) amplitudes in Fig. 2d are significantly lower than those in Fig. 2c. However, both show consistent and reliable input–output characteristics. Furthermore, when holding the \({T}_{x}\) amplitude constant, we observed that a frequency of 101 kHz produced a higher \({R}_{x}\) amplitude compared with the other selected frequencies. We attribute this to the resonance peaks in the PZT impedance characterization results. When multiple frequencies are used simultaneously, different \({T}_{x}\) amplitudes can be adjusted through excitation voltages to ensure consistent \({R}_{x}\) amplitude between the channels. Moreover, to further verify the robustness of the acoustic wave propagation mechanism in the fibre waveguide, we assessed the input–output characteristics of the SISO system under various weaving conditions on the same black textile substrate (Supplementary Fig. 4).

The fibre acts as the acoustic waveguide between the \({T}_{x}\) and \({R}_{x}\) PZTs. b, Image of a SISO system with the fibre woven into a black textile substrate.

The touch not only causes energy dissipation at the contact point between the finger and fibre, but also increases the contact stress between fibre and yarns, resulting in more energy loss, as reflected by the \({T}_{x}\) amplitude (AT) and \({R}_{x}\) amplitude (AR). g, Plot of \({R}_{x}\) reception peak-to-peak amplitude versus FP.

External forces, including pressing and bending, are common stimuli to which smart textiles must respond. To explore this, we initially investigated the impact of external pressing force on the SISO system by applying a single finger-touch, (Fig. 2e). The mechanism of pressing force sensing is shown in Fig. 2f. Contact between the finger and the glass fibre results in acoustic energy dissipation. In addition, the contact between the fibres and the yarns increases with touch, causing further energy loss. As shown in Fig. 2g, we observed that the \({R}_{x}\) peak-to-peak amplitude decreased from 65.0 to 6.7 mV (that is, an energy loss of 19.7 dB, see Methods for the calculation) as the applied pressing force increased from 0 to 14.7 N (Fig. 2e), demonstrating the sensitivity of the SISO system to external pressing forces (see Supplementary Fig. 5 for the experimental set-up). This SISO system notably exhibited exponential decay in amplitude during the initial phase of increasing pressing force, as indicated by the steep downward slope of the curve in Fig. 2g. As the pressing force increased from 0 to 7.8 N, the \({R}_{x}\) peak-to-peak amplitude decreased from 65.0 to 11.0 mV, resulting in an energy loss of 15.5 dB. By contrast, when the pressing force increased from 7.8 to 14.7 N, the \({R}_{x}\) peak-to-peak amplitude further dropped from 11.0 to 6.7 mV, with an energy loss of 4.3 dB. This shows that the textiles are highly sensitive to small-value external stimuli.

The capacity of a flexible wearable system to detect self-bending enhancement can be useful in monitoring human physiological states. Figure 2h demonstrates the SISO textile system's detection of bending angles. Bending-induced elastic deformation and the force exerted on the glass microfibre enhance the contact stress between the fibre and yarns, thereby increasing acoustic energy loss, as illustrated by the schematic analysis in Fig. 2i. The relationship between bending angle and \({R}_{x}\) signal amplitude is shown in Fig. 2j, demonstrating the SISO system's ability to detect its self-bending. From the change in the slope of the curve in Fig. 2j, we observed that the SISO system is particularly sensitive between bending angles of 90° and 120°, where the \({R}_{x}\) signal experienced an energy loss of 13.2 dB as the bending angle increased from 87° to 122°. The ability to sense external stimuli enables the expansion of the SISO system to include more complex acoustic textiles such as fibre-array tactile interfaces, smart gloves and physiological monitoring systems.

The sensing capability of the foremost SISO system is limited to a one-dimensional glass-fibre path and does not meet the two-dimensional requirements needed for many wearable devices. A viable solution to overcome this drawback involves arranging multiple independent SISO systems into a two-dimensional textile matrix. However, this approach necessitates a substantial increase in the number of PZTs, both as \({T}_{x}\) and \({R}_{x}\), increasing both system complexity and cost. To overcome this, our design integrates a multi-input single-output (MISO) system architecture with multiple inputs (\({T}_{x}\) PZTs) and a single output (\({R}_{x}\) PZT), aligned along the warp and weft directions (Fig. 1c). The MISO configuration allows multiple acoustic waveguides to be distributed across the textile substrate in both longitude and latitude directions, creating a two-dimensional sensing interface. Not only does this enable basic sensing of external stimuli using a single waveguide but it also facilitates detailed analysis of data across both axes to accurately pinpoint stimulation sites within the two-dimensional sensory array. However, a challenge in the MISO architecture arises when the signal at the \({R}_{x}\) PZT comprises a superposition of multiple \({T}_{x}\) signals, resulting in temporal overlap and interference. Addressing this issue requires the development of an alternative and suitable signal processing strategy.

FDMA, which is a foundational technology in telecommunications, assigns unique frequencies to multiple channels to enable simultaneous transmission without interchannel interference42. As we show in Fig. 2c,d, our smart textile has stable input–output performance at 100, 101, 102 and 103 kHz, which can be used for FMDA addressing. In the proposed MISO architecture, FDMA allocates those distinct frequencies to each glass-fibre waveguide in both the warp and weft directions. This implementation of FDMA enables fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based array addressing computations in the frequency domain, resolving the issue of multichannel interference of the superimposed signal in the time domain, while only using one \({R}_{x}\) PZT receiving signal. Each frequency is characterized by specific power or amplitude levels across the frequency spectrum, evaluated through FFT-based computations, in the reception end of the warp and weft \({R}_{x}\) PZTs.

When exposed to external stimuli, such as touch, a fibre waveguide in the affected channel shows an acoustic energy loss, which is typically greater than 6 dB, corresponding to a 50% reduction in amplitude compared with unaffected channels. To validate our approach, we conducted a MATLAB based simulation on a four-channel MISO system (Supplementary Fig. 6). This simulation employed short-time Fourier transform, which is essentially FFT applied with a window function, to provide detailed time–frequency analyses. We modelled both the stationary state and scenarios where the second channel experienced energy losses of 6 and 18 dB due to external stimuli. The lower peaks in single-sided amplitude spectra, along with diminished band brightness in time–frequency spectrograms, conclusively identified the second channel (101 kHz) as affected by external stimuli, demonstrating the efficacy of FDMA addressing (Supplementary Fig. 6).

We developed a wearable fibre-array tactile sensing system based on the FDMA-based MISO architecture. We integrated four glass fibres into a black textile substrate along both the warp and weft, forming a 4 × 4 sensing array with 16 touchpoints (Fig. 3a). This tactile sensing textile retains the substrate's inherent flexibility and breathability (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Furthermore, we configured a 4 × 4 array within a 10 mm by 10 mm square, (Fig. 3b). This compact miniature array, approximately the size of a human fingernail, addresses the challenges associated with small-scale wearable devices.

Its core array sensing area measures only approximately 10 mm by 10 mm, which is about the size of a human fingernail, as indicated by the dashed box. c, Schematic diagram of the 4 × 4 fibre-array acoustic textile system. Touch or a pressing force will affect acoustic wave propagation in specific channels along the warp and weft directions. The pressed point, indicated by the red dot, is at coordinates (4, 3). d, FFT-obtained single-sided amplitude spectra of \({R}_{x}\) 1 and \({R}_{x}\) 2 when the point with coordinates (2, 1) is pressed. The frequency f2 along the weft direction and the frequency f1 along the warp direction are blocked, and hence the peaks corresponding to f2 (\({R}_{x}\) 1) and f1 (\({R}_{x}\) 2) are nearly absent. e, Comparison plots of the number of sensors versus the array size between the MISO SonoTextiles array and the dot matrix array for an array with n × n touchpoints. f, Images, time–frequency spectrograms and FDMA addressing results for three different tactile sensing cases involving the 4 × 4 array system. Images on the left depict the number of pressing points applied: one, two and four, respectively. Corresponding spectrograms are shown in the middle column. The right column displays FDMA addressing matrices indicating the tactile perception results. Frequencies with normal amplitudes are designated with 1, whereas frequencies with significant energy loss (greater than 6 dB) are indicated by 0. When both the weft and warp directions exhibit 0, represented as 00 in the matrix, the corresponding coordinates signify the perceived touchpoint by this tactile sensing array. Scale bars, 10 mm.

Figure 3c shows a schematic of the 4 × 4 array, with MISO systems featuring four waveguide channels per axis. Each axis features four waveguide channels, each assigned a unique frequency— f1, f2, f3 and f4 at 100, 101, 102 and 103 kHz, respectively, using the same PZT transducers as in Fig. 2. Computations for the signals received by \({R}_{x}\) 1 and \({R}_{x}\) 2 are conducted separately, enabling simultaneous use of all frequencies across both directions. FDMA addressing is achieved by evaluating the amplitude of each frequency received by the two \({R}_{x}\) PZTs in the frequency domain.

External stimuli, such as touch or a pressing force, can disrupt the propagation of acoustic waves within specific channels and potentially stop them entirely. Figure 3d shows the FFT-derived single-sided amplitude spectra of \({R}_{x}\) 1 and \({R}_{x}\) 2, resulting from a pressing force applied at coordinates (2, 1). The pressing force almost completely obstructed the waveguide in the weft (\({R}_{x}\) 1) channel 2 at frequency 101 kHz (f2), resulting in the near absence of the corresponding 101 kHz peak in the spectrum with an acoustic energy loss of 21.9 dB. Similarly, the same pressing force affected wave propagation in the warp (\({R}_{x}\) 2) channel 1, leading to the absence of the corresponding spectrum peak (f1) with an acoustic energy loss of 19.6 dB. Analysis of data from \({R}_{x}\) 1 and \({R}_{x}\) 2 enabled the identification of pronounced acoustic energy loss in weft channel 2 and warp channel 1, and pinpointed the touched coordinate as (2, 1). This confirms the implementation of a fundamental FDMA addressing scheme within the tactile perception interface of this array.

Unlike traditional dot matrix arrays, which necessitate data computation for each sensor at every touchpoint, this FDMA-based MISO architecture simplifies processing by requiring frequency-domain computation for signals from just the two \({R}_{x}\) PZTs, enhances data processing efficiency. In addition, MISO systems can streamline the array system by using fewer sensors, which thus reduces the need for extensive electrical connections and wiring. Figure 3e shows comparison plots of the number of sensors versus the array size between the MISO SonoTextiles array and the dot matrix array. For an array with n × n touchpoints, the SonoTextile needs 2 × (n + 1) sensors, whereas the traditional dot matrix approach needs n × n sensors. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3e, when n exceeds three, the number of sensors needed in the dot matrix array is greater than that in SonoTextiles. Moreover, it is foreseeable that in larger-scale arrays, as n increases, the difference will become increasingly pronounced because n × n rises exponentially, demonstrating the advantages of the smart acoustic textiles in terms of simplifying system complexity by employing fewer sensors and thus reducing electric connections and wires (see Supplementary Fig. 7 for details).

We subsequently conducted comprehensive tactile perception experiments using the 4 × 4 array textile. Figure 3f displays images, time–frequency spectrograms and FDMA addressing results from three different tactile sensing scenarios involving both single and multiple pressed touchpoints. Pressing at (2, 1) yielded spectrograms for \({R}_{x}\) 1 and \({R}_{x}\) 2 that were consistent with those shown in Fig. 3d,e, respectively, with significant energy loss at 101 kHz (weft) and 100 kHz (warp). Similarly, pressing simultaneously at points (2, 3) and (2, 4), as well as at four points (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2) and (3, 3), produced corresponding spectrograms and FDMA addressing matrices that accurately detected all touched coordinates. The full results of these touch perception experiments on the 4 × 4 array are shown in Supplementary Video 3.

The hand, an integral sensory and executive body part, continues to be a key focus in the research of wearable technologies. Here we developed the SonoGloves that employs acoustic smart textiles to detect finger bending and facilitate hand gesture recognition. A basic SISO version of the glove is illustrated in Fig. 4a, with a more detailed schematic presented in Supplementary Fig. 8. A single glass microfibre is integrated along the index finger of the glove. The glove is equipped with \({T}_{x}\) and \({R}_{x}\) PZTs, enabling the transmission and reception of acoustic waves.

The white circular components are \({T}_{x}\) and \({R}_{x}\) PZTs for acoustic wave transmission and reception. b, Schematic representation of index finger bending sensing using the smart glove. c, Plot of finger bending angle (θ) versus \({R}_{x}\) peak-to-peak amplitude of the smart glove, showing a correlation. Data are presented as mean ± s.d. (n = 5) using the same glove, with uncertainty primarily arising from slight, unavoidable finger movements during repeated measurements. d, Illustration of gloves equipped with a MISO system. e, Image of the smart glove. Integrated glass microfibres run along the five fingers, and the five \({T}_{x}\) PZT elements are allocated different operating frequencies. f, Images of hand gestures performed with the smart glove for gesture recognition applications, along with the corresponding time–frequency spectrograms of \({R}_{x}\) received signals. The \({R}_{x}\) spectrograms accurately indicate the six gestures. Scale bar, 10 mm.

The glove can perceive index finger bending (Fig. 4b,c). Notably, when the finger bends, the fibre waveguide undergoes significant acoustic energy loss due to both self-bending (Fig. 2i) and the contact pressing force between the finger joint and glove. Figure 4c shows the relationship between the bending angle of the finger and the \({R}_{x}\) peak-to-peak amplitude. Maintaining a constant \({T}_{x}\) signal amplitude, we show that as the bending angle increases from 0 to 85°, the acoustic wave attenuates and decays exponentially, eventually leading to near-complete blockage of wave propagation and an acoustic energy loss of 18.8 dB.

Further advancing our technological suite, we introduced the gloves in a MISO system architecture (Fig. 4d,e and Supplementary Fig. 8). This variant integrates glass microfibres extending across all five fingers, each linked to one of five identical \({T}_{x}\) PZTs, which collectively converge at a singular \({R}_{x}\) PZT. The five \({T}_{x}\) PZTs are set to operate at distinct frequencies, enabling FFT-based FDMA addressing in the frequency domain: 175 kHz for the smallest finger, 177 kHz for the ring finger, 179 kHz for the middle finger, 181 kHz for the index finger and 183 kHz for the thumb. The operating frequencies here are higher than those used earlier, as a smaller-sized PZT transducer was employed to fit the dimensions of gloves (see Methods and Supplementary Note 1 for details). This design ensures the glove's flexibility, preserving the natural dynamics of hand movement for enhanced functionality.

With its MISO architecture, our acoustic smart glove can be used for interactive wearable applications, such as hand gesture recognition and potential sign-to-speech translation. We tested the glove's capability to discern numerical gestures from zero to five (Fig. 4f). For example, in the gesture for ‘1', the index finger is extended while the other four fingers remain clenched and wave propagation occurs exclusively through the index finger's channel. The corresponding time–frequency spectrogram, marked by a distinct band at 181 kHz specific to the index finger, is shown in Fig. 4f. Similarly, for the gesture representing ‘2', only the middle and index fingers are extended, facilitating wave propagation through these specific channels, as evidenced by two bands at 179 and 181 kHz in the spectrogram. Gestures for ‘0', ‘3', ‘4' and ‘5' accordingly show zero, three, four and five highlighted bands in their respective time–frequency spectrograms (Fig. 4f), each aligning with the number of extended fingers.

Wearable flexible electronics, designed for prolonged contact with the body, are ideal for real-time physiological monitoring. Using our smart acoustic textile technology, we have developed systems for monitoring arm muscle activity and respiratory rates, essential for contexts such as patient rehabilitation and athletic training. For example, Fig. 5a demonstrates an application of a muscle state monitoring with a SISO acoustic textile system woven into a close-fitting garment. This set-up tracks the expansion and relaxation of arm muscles in real time. When muscles such as the biceps brachii tense, they partially expand, increasing the contact pressing force between the skin and the acoustic textile, thereby enhancing acoustic wave propagation loss. Conversely, when muscles relax, the contact pressing force decreases, leading to reduced propagation loss. Figure 5b depicts time–frequency spectrograms of the \({R}_{x}\) received signals during states of muscle relaxation and tension, revealing a 25.6-dB energy loss in tense states compared with relaxed ones. The difference between the two spectrograms enables the real-time determination of muscle status. Figure 5c demonstrates continuous monitoring of the biceps brachii in periodic motion, showing that the \({R}_{x}\) amplitude varies periodically, with an average acoustic energy change of 25.0 dB.

A fibre woven into a close-fitting garment can detect muscle relaxation and tension states. b, Time–frequency spectrograms of \({R}_{x}\) received signals under muscle relaxation and tension states. The clear distinction of states can effectively indicate muscle status in real time. c, Results from monitoring of the arm muscles in periodic motion. The periodic variation in \({R}_{x}\) peak-to-peak amplitude effectively monitors muscle state. d, Illustration of abdominal breathing in the human body. An acoustic textile can use the rhythmic rise and fall of the belly to achieve respiratory monitoring. e, Image showing integration of a SISO system into the abdominal area of a cloth shirt. f, Spectrograms of \({R}_{x}\) received signals under exhalation and inhalation states. g, Abdomen movement sensing data measured during periodic breathing. The variation in \({R}_{x}\) peak-to-peak amplitude identifies the rise and fall of the abdomen, corresponding to exhalation and inhalation states. h, Continuous monitoring and diagnosis of simulated abnormal respiratory rate (in BPM). The periodic variation in \({R}_{x}\) peak-to-peak amplitude effectively monitors respiratory rate and could provide timely alerts for abnormal conditions such as tachypnea. Scale bars, 100 mm.

Another critical application is the real-time monitoring of respiratory rate, which is particularly vital for patients with respiratory ailments such as asthma. Figure 5d provides a schematic of abdominal breathing, which shows cyclical fluctuations with diaphragmatic movements during respiration. A SISO system, similar to the muscle monitoring set-up, leverages these rhythmic expansions and contractions for detailed respiratory monitoring, as detailed in Supplementary Fig. 9.

Our SISO system woven into the abdominal region of a form-fitting shirt, captures breathing patterns (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Video 4). Time–frequency spectrograms of the \({R}_{x}\) received signals, as illustrated in Fig. 5f, delineate the phases of exhalation and inhalation, revealing a 14.4-dB energy loss during inhalation. Furthermore, Fig. 5g highlights the monitoring of abdominal movements during periodic breathing, in which the \({R}_{x}\) amplitude exhibits periodic variations, with an average acoustic energy loss of 15.2 dB.

Figure 5h further demonstrates continuous monitoring and diagnosis of abnormal respiratory rates, such as tachypnea or bradypnea. The smart textile accurately responds to abdomen movements during breathing by capturing real-time variations in the \({R}_{x}\) signal amplitude. The periodicity of the \({R}_{x}\) signal amplitude curve directly reflects the observed respiratory rate (Fig. 5h). In a 40-second test, the subject maintained a normal respiratory rate of 18.5 breaths per minute (BPM) for the first 25 seconds, followed by accelerated breathing to simulate tachypnea at 46.5 BPM. This test showcases the SISO system's capability to effectively monitor respiratory rates in real time when integrated into a garment. In addition, we noted that during simulated tachypnea (Fig. 5h), the fluctuation range of the \({R}_{x}\) amplitude was reduced compared with the normal state. Specifically, the average fluctuation range of the \({R}_{x}\) amplitude was 30.0 mV under normal conditions, whereas it decreased to just 18.1 mV during tachypnea. Rapid breathing results in less pronounced abdominal movements, recorded as a lower amplitude. These more subtle fluctuations could offer a valuable additional diagnostic tool for identifying respiratory abnormalities.

We reported an acoustic-based smart textile platform for human–machine interactions and physiological monitoring. Our smart textile incorporates acoustic waveguides in microfibres with transmitting and receiving PZTs. The acoustic energy loss during acoustic wave propagation is sensitive to external stimuli, allowing the textile to function as a sensing platform. The acoustic sensing fibres can be incorporated with various textile substrates using different weaving conditions and shows consistent sensory performance and sensitivity (Supplementary Figs. 12, 14 and 15). Using the frequency selectivity of acoustic wave propagation, we incorporated FDMA to achieve distributed sensing systems. This simplifies the system architecture by reducing the number of sensors, electrical connections and wiring, and thus improves scalability. Furthermore, the use of FFT-based signal processing in the frequency domain enhances computational efficiency. Our smart textiles are also stable and durable when subjected to repeated stimuli and physical activities (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Videos 5 and 6).

The acoustic smart textile technology platform is based on commercially available glass microfibres. The integration of multiple glass fibres into the textile substrate also does not affect the breathability, stability and flexibility of the textile substrate (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). The core components, including the PZTs and microfibres, help to enhance the overall affordability of the system, keeping the production cost within hundreds of dollars.

Future research is needed to overcome existing packaging limitations by integrating wearable power supplies, embedded data acquisition systems and wireless data transmission capabilities. The incorporation of sustainable, biodegradable materials could improve the environmental impact of the system. Haptic feedback could also be incorporated into the platform. Exploring diverse coupling methods between the glass microfibres and PZTs could optimize sensitivity and increase functionality and effectiveness. Future improvements could be achieved by tailoring the sensing properties of the fibres. By adjusting factors such as fibre length, diameter and material composition, we can control the mechanical response of the fibres and thus can tailor the system for specific applications with distinct working frequencies, thereby enhancing both the functionality and sensitivity of our sensing systems.

Our smart acoustic textile technology could be of use in a variety of fields. In physical therapy, smart gloves could be used to monitor finger movements and provide feedback to ensure that exercises are performed correctly. The smart gloves could also be used in stroke rehabilitation by tracking the recovery progress of patients through monitoring fine motor skills and hand movements. In addition, such gloves could potentially monitor disease progression of arthritis and aid in designing personalized exercise. In human–computer interactions, the gloves could be used in the gesture-based control of computers, smart devices and other electronic systems, providing an intuitive and hands-free method of interaction. In virtual and augmented reality environments, the gloves could enhance user experiences by offering precise hand and finger tracking, enabling more natural interactions. They could also be of use in gaming, robotics and teleoperation.

Distributed tactile sensing garments could be used by athletes to receive real-time feedback on their biomechanics during training or competitions. This data could then be used to optimize performance, prevent injuries and tailor training regimens to individual needs. Smart garments could also be used in assistive technology, providing alternative input methods for computers and other devices. The textiles could, in addition, provide tactile information to guide individuals with visual impairments, or to help to monitor and adjust posture for those with mobility issues. Future developments in artificial intelligence, 5G networks and the Internet of Things could expand the capabilities of our smart textiles, leading to opportunities in advanced computing, intelligent decision making and robust data connectivity46,47,48,49.

Acoustic energy loss, that is, the total energy loss during the propagation due to natural attenuation and external stimuli, is of key importance in the characterization of the smart acoustic textiles. For consistency, the acoustic energy loss, denoted by EL, is expressed in the following equation:

where AT and AR are the peak-to-peak amplitudes of the \({T}_{x}\) transmitted and \({R}_{x}\) received acoustic waves, respectively. The acoustic energy losses described in this article are all calculated using EL, with the unit being decibels (dB).

Commercially available PZTs made of piezoceramics are used in our experiments for the electroacoustic and acoustoelectric conversion. In the characterization of the SISO system and fibre-array tactile sensing experiments, we used the piezoelectric disc transducer (7BB-27-4L0, Murata Electronics) with a diameter of 27 mm and thickness of 0.5 mm for both the \({T}_{x}\) and \({R}_{x}\). In experiments with smart gloves and physiological monitoring applications, we selected the piezoelectric disc transducer (SMD10T2R111WL, STEMINC), which measured 10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness.

The acoustic textiles operate at frequencies from 100 to 200 kHz, with PZTs achieving nanometre-scale oscillation. The vibration amplitude of transmitting PZTs depends primarily on the input voltage and piezoelectric coefficient, as described by the following equation50,51:

where \({d}_{33}\) is the piezoelectric coefficient (which is approximately 600 × 10−12 m V−1 for PZT-5H) and \(V\) is the applied voltage. The excitation voltages applied to the PZTs induce oscillations with nanometre-scale amplitudes. This high-frequency operation is both inaudible and imperceptible to the user, which minimizes the potential for discomfort33. In addition, based on our tests, these two types of PZT transducers do not exhibit significant heat generation under normal operating conditions, which makes them well suited for wearable applications (Supplementary Fig. 18).

Commercially available glass fibres (FiberOptic P. & P. AG) made of silica (SiO2) with a diameter of 130 μm were used in our experiments, acting as the acoustic waveguide between the \({T}_{x}\) and \({R}_{x}\) PZTs. Glass fibre has a high Young's modulus (72 GPa)52, which leads to high propagation speeds and low attenuation of acoustic waves in the waveguides53. In addition, glass fibre not only has good flexibility, but also exhibits excellent stability in high-temperature and corrosive environments, which makes it quite suitable for wearable devices.

Our fabric that we employed in this study was composed of a two-thirds cotton and one-third polyester blend (used for results shown in Figs. 2 and 3). The design criteria emphasized breathability, ensuring both comfort and functionality. Experimental validation confirmed that the acoustic textiles exhibit robustness and adaptability, demonstrating compatibility with a wide range of textile substrates varying in material composition and thickness (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). Furthermore, the sensitivity and the effective propagation distance (that is, the wave travel distance along the fibre) are related to factors such as the textile substrate and weaving conditions (Supplementary Notes 3 and 5 and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 16).

The connection between glass fibres and PZTs serves as a critical interface for the propagation of acoustic waves between the microfibres and the PZTs. We employed copper foil tape (3M) to bond the PZTs to the glass microfibres. This method enables reusing the microfibres and PZTs during our research. However, a key challenge remains in achieving consistent and stable bonding strength, so further research is needed to achieve better bonding.

The glass fibres of the acoustic textiles are incorporated into the textile substrate through conventional weaving. We adopted the traditional manual weaving method in this work, using a hollow needle to sew the glass fibre into the textile. Although a digital sewing machine suitable for glass fibres can definitely provide more convenient and accurate weaving effects, we believe that manual weaving is sufficient for completing basic explorations of the smart textiles.

Electronic function generators (AFG 1062, Tektronix) were employed to generate the predesigned waveforms which were finally connected to the \({T}_{x}\) PZTs. The observation and recording of the \({R}_{x}\) received signals were performed by a digital oscilloscope (TBS 2000, Tektronix), which could display the signal waveform and FFT results in real time and store the waveform with 8-bit amplitude resolution on a USB device. In the evaluations of the SISO acoustic textile (Fig. 2), a high-frequency signal amplifier (High Wave 3.2, Digitum-Elektronik) was connected between the function generator and the \({T}_{x}\) PZT to amplify the signal amplitude. This amplifier could provide an amplification gain of 15 times in the bridge mode. We note that the proposed acoustic textiles did not require this separate amplifier in the presented application scenarios, as the 20-VPP output from the function generator was sufficient. In future work, we aim to integrate signal generation, analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue conversion, signal acquisition and other functionalities into compact wearable embedded systems.

The data processing of the \({R}_{x}\) received signal, including FFT-obtained single-sided amplitude spectra and time–frequency spectrograms, was primarily performed through postprocessing using computer software (MATLAB 2024a, Mathworks). Completing the digital signal processing tasks within wearable embedded systems is a key focus for future work.

Metrics details

Slope streaks are dark albedo features on martian slopes that form spontaneously and fade over years to decades. Along with seasonally recurring slope lineae, streak formation has been attributed to aqueous processes, implying the presence of transient yet substantial amounts of liquid water or brines on Mars' surface, with important implications for present-day Mars' habitability. Here, we use a deep learning-enabled approach to create the first consistent, global catalog of half a million individual slope streaks. We show that slope streaks modify less than 0.1% of the martian surface, but transport several global storm equivalents of dust per Mars year, potentially playing a major role in the martian dust cycle. Our global geostatistical analysis challenges wet streak formation models and instead supports dry streak formation, driven by seasonal dust delivery and energetic triggers like wind and meteoritic impacts. We further identify a qualitative, spatiotemporal relation between recurring slope lineae formation, seasonal dust deposition, and dust devil activity. Our findings suggest that modern Mars' slopes do not commonly experience transient flows of water or brines, implying that streak bearing terrain can be explored without raising planetary protection concerns.

First observed in Viking images in 19771,2, slope streak occurrence and formation have been subject to a continuous debate ever since. Dark slope streaks form sporadically and fade over years and decades (~3 to ~20 Mars years, MY)3,4, occasionally turning brighter than the surrounding regolith3,5. Slope streak populations have been observed to occur in dusty, low thermal inertia equatorial regions6,7. In stark contrast, recurring slope lineae (RSL), first discovered in 2011, are predominantly located in rocky, southern, high thermal inertia highlands8,9. The formation of streaks and RSL has been explained by dry and wet mechanisms, such as airfall- or thermal cycling-induced dust avalanching and impact-, quake-, dust devil-, or rockfall-induced mass/dust movements (dry)10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, as well as groundwater spring-, frost-, and brine-induced flows (wet)7,9,19,20,21,22,23. Recently4, and24 identified an enhanced streak formation rate in northern autumn and winter (Ls ~140°–270°). Similarly, RSL have been observed to predominantly form in southern summer (Ls ~270° 8). To date, it remains unclear whether slope streaks and RSL are different expressions of the same process, or fundamentally different features (e.g. refs. 5,25). If confirmed, a wet formation mechanism for streaks or RSL would indicate that present-day Mars' hydrological cycle is substantially more pronounced than previously anticipated, with substantial implications on our understanding of martian weather, climate, surface evolution, and habitability. In addition, liquid water or brines on Mars' surface would evoke serious concerns about planetary protection. Here, we fuse several decades' worth of orbital data and use a global-scale deep learning- and data-driven approach to create the first global catalog of slope streaks, shedding new light on a fundamental, decades-old debate.

We identify a total of 13,026 bright and 484,019 dark slope streaks with a wide range of morphologies in the pre-v01 version of the global MRO CTX (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Imager) mosaic26,27 (‘detected population', \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{D}}}}}\)), including previously unknown slope streak-bearing regions (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. S1, S2). There is no clear, universally applicable, quantitative way to separate ‘dark' from ‘bright' streaks, especially in CTX data, as the transition between dark and bright is continuous. Here, ‘dark' streaks include recently-formed streaks that appear dark in CTX images, and ‘bright' streaks refer to old, partially-faded streaks that appear bright in CTX images (Fig. 1A, B). The deep learning-driven detector is able to identify about 20% and 55% of all bright and dark streaks in a given CTX image, on average; at the same time, we estimate that about 6 % of all detections are duplicates caused by the spatial overlap of some of the CTX images that make up the mosaic (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that the actual number of bright and dark streaks observable on the surface of Mars are ~60,000 and ~830,000 (at the CTX-scale, ~6 m, ‘statistically-corrected population', \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}\)). We note that the deep learning-predicted detections contain an average of 2.33 individual streaks per detection box due to streak co-location and overlap (see Fig. 1A, B, Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating there might be up to ~140,000 and ~1,900,000 individual, CTX-scale bright and dark slope streaks on Mars, which is several factors more than was previously estimated (~800,000 dark streaks28). Applying the power law relation between the number of resolved streaks and image resolution as established by Bergonio et al.29, we estimate there might be ~14 times more streaks resolvable at the HiRISE-scale (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, ~0.3 m30), i.e., ~2,000,000 bright and ~28,000,000 dark streaks.

D) through F): Maps of slope streak (bright, white; dark, black) and RSL (red) distribution (e.g. refs. 8,51) as well as bright-to-dark slope streak ratio per 10° by 10° quadrangle, overlain on a Viking merged color mosaic and MOLA topography81. Percentages of total population per streak hotspot indicated on the map. Our results agree well with earlier maps of streak-bearing regions3,5, while identifying a series of previously unknown streak hotspots, e.g. in Xanthe Terra and Lunae Planum (Supplementary Fig. S2).

We identify streaks between ~40°N and ~20°S, with a mean latitude of 12.7°N and 16.7°N for bright and dark streaks, respectively, indicating that dark streaks are systematically shifted northwards relative to bright streaks. Notably, ~89% and ~90% of all bright and dark streaks are located north of the equator, and there are a factor ~37 more dark than bright slope streaks. Bright streak hotspots (>100 features per 5° x 5° quadrangle) are located in Arabia Terra - Terra Sabaea, E Kasei Valles, Ius Chasma, and Noctis Labyrinthus, where the Arabia Terra – Terra Sabaea hotspot is the most pronounced. Dark streak hotspots (>5000 features per 5° × 5° quadrangle) are located in Olympus Rupes - Lycus Sulci, Ceraunius Fossae, Arabia Terra – Terra Sabaea, Tartarus Montes, and NW Medusae Fossae – Marte Vallis, where the Olympus Rupes – Lycus Sulci hotspot is the most pronounced (holding ~68% of the global dark streak population). Only 15% of all 10 × 10° quadrangles across the surface host more bright than dark streaks (Fig. 1). Those regions might have experienced reduced streak formation rates in recent years; we note a particularly substantial percentage of bright streaks in Kasei Valles and Nili Fossae. The vast majority (~85%) of all bright streaks are located on Noachian terranes, only ~4% are located on Amazonian terranes. In turn, about ~50% of all dark streaks are located on Amazonian terranes, and only 31% on Noachian terranes (Fig. 2A).

Note the blue line at TES albedo 0.26, as spatially visualized in Fig. 3. Average values indicated. Note that the relatively low spatial resolution of most of the global thermophysical datasets might blur certain relations, most prominently for the MOLA slope angle dataset, which largely underestimates the actual slope angle at the streak-scale. C AFDs of estimated feature area; \(\surd 2\) binning is used, power law fits indicated by lines, power law exponents indicated by numbers. Note that the lack of small slope streaks is caused by the spatial resolution of the used CTX images (6 m); RSL are only resolvable at the HiRISE scale (0.3 m).

Generally, bright and dark streaks are located at a) below-average topographic elevations, with average values of −126 m (bright) and −1126 m (dark); b) above-average slope angles with average values of 7° (bright) and 8.6° (dark); c) in above-average TES (Thermal Emission Spectrometer31) albedo terrain with average values of 0.27 (bright) and 0.28 (dark); and d) in above-average OMEGA (Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activité32) nanophase ferric oxide terrain with average values of 1.02 (bright and dark) (Figs. 2B, 3A). Globally, we observe a weak power law relation between the density of slope streaks and the mean slope angle (Supplementary Fig. S4). Dark slope streaks do not appear to feature a preferred slope orientation, but equator-facing slopes host slightly more dark streaks (global difference to pole-facing slopes is 4.1%, i.e., ~20,000 streaks, Fig. 2B); bright streaks feature a distinct west-facing orientation. We do not observe any substantial differences when considering northern and southern hemisphere populations separately.

This implies that streaks can only form in the highest albedo (smallest particle size) terrains. Viking merged color mosaic in the background. B Joyplots (showing kernel density estimates) of slope streak (bright, tan; dark, solid black), RSL (red), and background (black line) MCD daily mean dust deposition rate on a horizontal surface for Ls 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° (left34) and sensible surface heat flux for Ls 90° (northern summer) at 12, 3, 6, and 9 AM (right34). Average values indicated.

Bright and dark streaks feature a strong correlation between estimated size, MOLA elevation (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter33), MCD diurnal surface temperature amplitude (Mars Climate Database34), albedo, and nanophase ferric iron: larger streaks appear to feature lower MOLA elevation and higher diurnal temperature amplitude, albedo, and nanophase ferric iron values (Supplementary Fig. S5). On average, bright streaks are larger than dark streaks, with an average estimated size of ~775 vs ~609 meters. We do not observe any general, longitudinal or latitudinal variations in streak size. Streak length and width are weakly linearly related; assuming a rectangular streak shape, we estimate a mean surface area for bright and dark streaks of ~0.047 and 0.034 km2, respectively. The area-frequency-distribution (AFD) of estimated streak area follows a power law with a negative slope of 3.9 and 3.8, respectively. Interestingly, an AFD derived for RSL presents a negative exponent of 1.1 (Fig. 2B). There is no correlation between streak size and the age of the host terrane (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Using the mean number of streaks per detection (2.33), we estimate that one bright or dark slope streak detection modifies a surface area of ~0.1 km2, on average. This indicates that the detected slope streaks modify an area of 49,705–103,500 km2 globally, i.e., 0.03–0.07% of the martian surface (for \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{D}}}}}\) and \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}\), respectively). Considering a streak survival time of 3–20 MY (where streaks are observable3,4), the global surface modification rate would be 15,568 to 2485 km2/MY and 34,500 to 5175 km2/MY, i.e., 0.01–0.002% and 0.02–0.004% of the surface per MY (for \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{D}}}}}\) and \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}\), respectively). Considering a streak thickness of ~1 m (i.e., the maximum value derived by14,15, an average streak detection would modify a volume of ~100,000 m3 or ~0.0001 km3, which would result in a total modified volume of ~50 to ~100 km3 (for \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{D}}}}}\) and \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}\), respectively). Considering a dust bulk density of ~2500 kg/m3 or ~2.5 × 109 t/km335, the total modified mass would account for ~1.3 × 1011 to ~2.5 × 1011 t, i.e., ~4.2 × 1010 to ~6.3 × 109 t/MY and ~8.3 × 1010 to ~1.3 × 1010 t/MY (for \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{D}}}}}\) and \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}\), respectively). References 36,37 report that around 4.0 × 108 to 2.9 × 109 t/MY of dust is exchanged between the martian surface and atmosphere, i.e., between ~1 to ~46% and ~0.5 to ~22% of the dust mass modified by streaks (for \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{D}}}}}\) and \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}\), respectively). Reference 38 reports a total dust mass of ~4.3 × 108 t lifted during a global dust storm observed in 1977, which is ~1 to ~7% and ~0.5 to ~3% of the estimated mass modified by slope streaks per year (for \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{D}}}}}\) and \({{{{\rm{p}}}}}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}\), respectively). These estimates indicate that slope streaks move several dust-equivalents of a global dust storm every MY. The injection of dust into the atmosphere by slope streaks has not been observed yet, but would make slope streaks an important contributor to the martian dust cycle and climate, potentially accounting for a substantial fraction of the surface-atmosphere dust exchange budget.

We observe that dark streaks and date-constrained impact events39 are partially co-located in dusty regions (Fig. 4A). To suppress the observational bias related to the detection of new impacts in dusty regions (e.g. refs. 39,40) we perform a statistical analysis of streak and new impact locations in the dust-rich Arabia Terra, Elysium Planitia, and Tharsis regions, which host both streaks and new impacts. We find that dark streaks tend to be located slightly closer to real impact sites than to randomly placed (synthetic) impact sites in Arabia Terra (statistically significant, P = 0.038) and Elysium Planitia (not significant, P = 0.231), on average, but not in Tharsis. In Arabia and Elysium, in circles with radii of 0.5, 2, and 5°, there are a factor ~1.5, ~1.3, ~1.1, as well as ~1.9, ~1.6, and ~1.3 more streaks around new impacts vs synthetic impacts, on average (Fig. 4B, see Supplementary Table S1), decreasing with increasing distance from a given impact. Beyond Arabia Terra and Elysium, we do not see a global relation between the spatial density of streaks and new impacts (Supplementary Fig. S7).

B Joyplots (showing kernel density estimates) of minimum distance between streaks (bright, tan; dark, solid black) and real/synthetic impact/seismic events for Arabia Terra, Elysium Planitia, and Tharsis; differences between distance dark streaks – real impacts and dark streaks – synthetic points are statistically significant for Arabia Terra, but not for Elysium and Tharsis. Note that there are no InSight-recorded marsquakes located in Arabia Terra and only one in Tharsis (per41). We note that we do not consider the relation in Tharsis representative due to the availability of just one single data point (InSight event S0183a). Average values indicated. C Pie charts visualize the ratio between the number of streaks (b = bright, d = dark) within a 0.5°, 2°, or 5° area around real (tan/black) vs synthetic (brown) impact events/epicenters. RSL statistics not shown as they are not deemed statistically sound (see Supplementary Table S1).

Some of the global streak hotspots are spatially co-located with InSight-recorded, tecto-genetic broadband (BB) and low-frequency (LF) events with back azimuth (BAZ)41,42,43,44, but a) not all streak hotspots feature a co-located epicenter and b) not each epicenter features a streak hotspot (Fig. 4A). We perform a statistical analysis of the two global streak hotspots with associated seismic BB or LF event(s) (Elysium Planitia and Tharsis). Dark streaks do not tend to be located closer to real quake epicenters than to randomly placed (synthetic) epicenters (no statistically significant difference, P = 0.167). In Elysium, in circles with radii of 0.5, 2, and 5°, there are a factor ~1.4, ~1,4, and ~1.0 less streaks around real epicenters vs synthetic epicenters, on average (Fig. 4B, see Supplementary Table S1). We note that a substantial fraction of the CTX images used by the global mosaic were acquired prior to the InSight mission, rendering our analysis not ultimately conclusive. We do not observe a general, global relation between the distribution of streaks and the geomorphic expressions of past tectonic activity, such as graben and fossae, despite those features' steep slopes, but identify noteworthy exceptions such as Ceraunius, Tractus, Noctis, Ulysses, Elysium, and Labeatis Fossae (Fig. 4A). Similarly, we do not observe a general, global relation between rockfall locations45 and slope streak distribution other than a small number of co-located features in the Cerberus Fossae and Ius Chasma areas (Fig. 5).

Slope streaks tend to be located in regions with above-average MCD wind speed, particularly in the morning (9 AM, statistically significant, P < 2.2 × 10−233, Fig. 6). We observe that slope streaks and active dust devils46 are strongly inversely correlated, i.e., regions with dust devil activity are nearly entirely devoid of slope streaks. Notably, regions of active dust devil occurrence appear to coincide with several of the globally distinct boundaries of slope streak distribution, such as located in NW Lycus Sulci, Syria Planum, N Phlegra Dorsa, E Terra Sabaea, and S Arabia Terra (Fig. 6A). Slope streaks are strongly associated with above-average MCD diurnal temperature amplitude regions, particularly pronounced in northern spring, summer, and autumn (Fig. 7). Slope streaks tend to be located in regions with above-average MCD atmosphere-to-surface heat flux during the night (12 and 3 AM), where the correlation disappears in the morning (6 AM) (Fig. 3B).

Differences between dark streaks and background are statistically significant for all Ls and LST. Average values indicated.

The temperature range between 273 and 283 K that (theoretically) provides conditions for liquid water on the surface of Mars (in some regions) is indicated in blue. Average values indicated.

We observe that slope streaks appear to be located in regions with slightly above-average WEH (water equivalent hydrogen, statistically significant, P = ~0), H2O, and H, particularly bright slope streaks. Notably, not all high-H2O/H/WEH regions feature slope streaks and many streak hotspots are located in low H2O/H/WEH regions (Fig. 8; e.g., in Elysium, 10°N 170°E, and E Tharsis, 20°N 110°W). Slope streak locations feature slightly enhanced water vapor column values in northern summer and autumn (Fig. 8B). The vast majority/parts of the slope streak population pass through the ~273 to ~283 K temperature band that theoretically allows for transient liquid surface water, in northern summer and southern summer, respectively (northern summer is particularly pronounced, Fig. 7B). Streak locations do not show any substantial overlap with the valley networks mapped by Hynek et al.47, expect for a few locations in Naktong, Deva, Minio, Padus, and Sabis Vallis (Fig. 5A). We note that dark streaks are located in regions that see above-average dust deposition rates in southern summer (statistically significant, P = ~0), but below-average rates for the rest of the year (Fig. 3B).

Average values indicated. Note that the locations of bright and dark streaks tend to feature slightly higher FREND WEH values than GRS H values; note that GRS H and H2O are nearly (but not entirely) identical.

Our observations discard three previously proposed dry streak formation mechanisms: dust devils (e.g. refs. 11,48), rockfalls (e.g. ref. 15), and thermal cycling (e.g. ref. 25) do not appear to play a globally important role in triggering slope streaks (Figs. 5–7). Dust devil, rockfall, and slope streak occurrence are predominantly inversely correlated, and slope streak populations experience higher-than-average diurnal temperature amplitudes around the year, not just during streak peak formation season in southern summer (Ls ~270°); in fact, the southern summer peak formation season experiences the least pronounced temperature amplitude difference (Fig. 7B).

Our observations question many of the hypothesized wet formation mechanisms: streak populations a) do not express any preferred slope orientation (Fig. 2B), challenging a potential CO2 frost related trigger21; b) only experience conditions suitable for liquid water in northern summer (Ls ~90°) – despite being located in regions that experience above-average diurnal thermal amplitudes and heat flux –, which conflicts with observations of peak streak formation occurring in northern autumn and winter (Ls ~140–270° 4,24); in fact, streak populations experience unfavorable conditions at Ls ~ 270° (statistically significant, P = 5.8 × 10−158) (Figs. 3B and 7B); and c) streak populations experience peak water vapor column values in northern summer and autumn (Ls ~90–180°), which also conflicts with observations of enhanced streak formation in northern autumn and winter (Ls ~140–270° 4,24) (Fig. 8B). We observe that streak populations feature slightly enhanced WEH, H2O, and H values at the global-scale (Fig. 8B), but note that recent, local-scale investigations using CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) have not found any signs of hydration at slope streak locations49.

We identify three global-scale, statistically significant relations that support dry formation hypotheses for slope streaks: streak populations a) tend to be slightly closer located to new impacts than to the same number of randomly placed locations in some regions (Fig. 4B); b) consistently experience above-average (near-surface) wind velocities (Fig. 6B); and c) experience above-average dust deposition rates in northern winter (Ls ~270°) (Fig. 3B), coinciding with the seasonal formation peak4,24). Notably, we identify a distinct cascade of slope streaks on two specific slopes in the direct vicinity of a 140-m diameter crater that formed on September 18th 2022 (Ls 305°, during peak dust deposition, Supplementary Fig. S8, refs. 90,91) as well as new slope streaks close to other new impact events (ref. 92, Supplementary Figs. S9–S12), but also find slopes that do not host new streaks following close-by impact events (Supplementary Figs. S12–S14), which illustrates how impacts can trigger streaks, but only in sloped, dust-bearing terrain. We do not observe any relation between streak occurrence and tectonic marsquakes, noting that this particular comparison suffers from a substantial observational (spatiotemporal) bias due to the limited seismic data available (~2 MY). However, we identify a number of Fossae with an increased number of slope streaks (Fig. 4A), which might point to recent tectonic activity in those regions12. The lack of streaks in the majority of Fossae might also be rooted in a general lack of (fine) dust in those regions.

In contrast, RSL populations are preferably located on equator-facing slopes (Fig. 2B8,50) and experience conditions suitable for liquid water in southern summer (Ls ~270°), i.e., during their peak occurrence (Fig. 7B); however, RSL populations simultaneously feature below-average diurnal thermal amplitude, heat flux, and WEH, H2O, and H values, as well as average water vapor column values, rendering a wet formation mechanism less likely (Figs. 3B, 7B and 8B). We note that RSL locations experience peak dust deposition rates in northern autumn (Ls ~180°), i.e., at the onset of RSL peak formation, and dust storms have been shown to substantially enhance RSL formation rates51. We do not observe any global-scale relation between RSL locations, new impacts, and wind velocity (Figs. 4 and 6B), but identify an indistinct, spatial relation with dust devil occurrence, and – potentially – rockfall occurrence (Figs. 5 and 6A), as previously locally observed by, e.g. refs. 51,52. Here, dust devils and rockfalls might (jointly) trigger the displacement of material through turbulence and the transfer of kinetic energy (e.g. refs. 11,53). Recently, seasonal peak dust devil activity (number and size) has been observed in the southern highlands in southern summer (Fig. 6A46), coinciding with peak RSL formation. We note that one of the main limitations of this study is the lack of information on the timing of global-scale streak and RSL formation. Globally-distributed information about slope streak and RSL formation would allow for a more robust statistical comparison of streak and RSL occurrence and potential drivers.

Overall, our observations suggest that slope streak and RSL formation may be predominantly controlled by two independent, dry drivers, 1) the seasonal delivery of dust onto topographic inclines, and 2) the spontaneous activation of accumulated dust by energetic triggers – wind and impacts for slope streaks, as well as dust devils and rockfalls for RSL. These observations showcase how the seasonal dust delivery and the seasonal formation of streaks and RSL are inherently linked, while alleviating the likelihood of wet formation as proposed by preceding studies (e.g. refs. 16,17,50,51,52). The important role of fine dust in streak formation is further highlighted by the abundance of streaks in the highest-TES albedo terrain (Fig. 3A), the positive correlation between slope streak size and dust abundance (Figs. 2B, 3, Supplementary Fig. S5), and the lack of a relation between streak size and host terrane geologic age (Supplementary Fig. S6). Notably, ref. 54 report how variations in the particle size could explain albedo differences between high-albedo (e.g., Arabia) and intermediate-albedo terrain (e.g., Utopia). Per55, the dust in high-albedo terrain features a particle size less than 40 µm; recent work by Valantinas et al.56 suggest even smaller particle sizes, i.e., as small as 1 µm, which agrees with earlier observations of atmospheric dust57. Such small-sized particles could facilitate the formation of some of the observed complex, flow-like features of slope streaks, such as fingering and anastomosis (e.g. refs. 25,58,59,60). In addition, slope streak formation may be influenced by slow moving dense granular flows that are supported by dispersive pressure60, potentially explaining why slope streaks do not produce observable dust clouds during their formation. It remains unclear what amount of the dust displaced by slope streaks ultimately ends up being injected into the atmosphere.

Our results underline the fundamental differences between slope streaks and RSL, despite their visual resemblance. Streak and RSL populations occur on opposite hemispheres (north vs south), at different topographic elevations (mostly lowlands vs mostly highlands), in opposite thermal inertia terrain (low vs high), in different wind speed regimes (above-average vs below-average), in dissimilar diurnal thermal amplitude and heat flux terrain (above-average vs average), in different WEH, H2O, H, and water vapor column terrain (average vs below-average), and in terrain that provides suitable (theoretical) conditions for liquid water at different seasons (Ls ~90° vs Ls ~ 270°) (Figs. 1–8). Importantly, the exponents of the AFDs (streaks: ~3.8; RSL: ~1.1) bracket the exponents commonly experienced for landslides on Earth (~1.5 to ~361,62,63); we note that AFD exponents cannot be directly used to infer triggers or causes of mass wasting events, but the substantially different exponents add further weight to the conclusion that streaks and RSL are fundamentally different features and might point to different material properties (e.g., dusty, cohesion- vs sandy, friction-controlled material, e.g. refs. 18,63 (Fig. 2B).

Our findings suggest that martian slopes currently do not experience seasonal, transient flows of liquid water or brines, underscoring the dry, desert-like nature of Mars. This implies that slope streak and RSL locations are not likely to be habitable, alleviating strict planetary protection measures for future landed missions to those regions.

We select 40 globally-distributed MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) CTX (Context Imager) images with a pixel scale of ~6 m64 and crop them into ~1000 × 1000 pixel patches. With those patches we create a training dataset by labeling a total of 1007 and 147 dark and bright slope streaks, following previously established workflows65,66,67,68. Here, a label represents a rectangular box drawn by a human expert around a slope streak. We label an additional 35 dark and 6 bright slope streaks for model testing and verification (~4% of the training set size; remains unseen during training). During labeling, we carefully separate bright and dark slope streaks following the definition provided in the main text and showcased in Fig. 1. We purposely minimize the size of the testing dataset, to maximize the data available for model training. Here, the usage of the term ‘few-shot learning' accounts for the fact that the number of slope streak labels available for training and testing is lower than in traditional deep learning which commonly uses tens of thousands of labels. Importantly, past studies have demonstrated that a few-shot learning approach can successfully map geomorphic and atmospheric features across various planetary bodies and datasets45,46,69,70,71,72,73. A list of all used CTX images in shown in Supplementary Table S2 and their illumination and imaging geometries are listed in Supplementary Table S3.

We use the training dataset to fine-tune a COCO-pretrained (‘Common Objects in COntext'), off-the-shelf PyTorch 1.7 implementation of the YOLOv5x convolutional neural network (CNN) provided by ultralytics via GitHub (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). YOLOv5 is a well-established, verified, cutting-edge object detection framework that has been utilized for a wide range of scientific applications, such as food science, robotics, medical image processing, and planetary science (e.g. refs. 71,73,74,75,76). YOLOv5 represents the best compromise between state-of-the-art performance and reliability, and has been shown to substantially outperform (performance and speed) earlier machine learning algorithms such as based on AdaBoost, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, and Region-based CNNs (e.g. refs. 77,78,79) as were used by earlier studies that reported on the automated detection of slope streaks80.

We apply substantial label augmentation during training to prevent model overfitting and minimize any negative impact of the relatively small number of labels, as is common practice in computer vision and few shot learning, utilizing label rotation, up-down flipping, shearing, up- and down-scaling, and brightness and contrast modifications. We do not apply left-right flipping to preserve a proper representation of the illumination conditions governed by MRO's sun-synchronous orbit in the training data. The training of the CNN required ~15 min on one single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU (Graphical Processing Unit).

We evaluate the performance of the trained detector using the testing dataset and the three most common metrics used for object detector evaluation: recall (i.e., the number of detected streaks, e.g. 8/10), precision (i.e., the number of correctly detected streaks, e.g. 9/10), and average precision (AP, relation of recall and precision over a wide range of model confidence scores, i.e., the area under the precision-recall curve, which summarizes the performance of a detector in one single number, Fig. 9C). The CNN assigns a confidence score to each detection (0, low to 1, high), representing its confidence in the assigned detection and classification; higher confidence score populations usually feature lower recall but higher precision. At confidence 0.8, the trained slope streak detector achieves full precision (100%), a recall of 20 % and 55 %, as well as 0.98 and 0.50 AP (0.74 mAP, mean average precision for all classes) for bright and dark streaks in the testset, respectively (Fig. 9C). This indicates that the detector can be expected to make none to very few mistakes, while being able to (consistently) identify about 20 and 55% of all bright and dark slope streaks observed by CTX, at a confidence score of 0.8 and higher.

A MRO CTX images are cropped into small patches and fed into the CNN, which (B) outputs predictions of slope streak location, size, and confidence score (true positives, TP, white boxes). The detector can miss slope streaks (false negatives, FN, yellow) or can make incorrect predictions (false positives, FP, red); note how larger streaks feature larger bounding boxes. C Testset performance of the detector is visualized on the left, indicating recall, precision, and AP, as well as the score cut-off of 0.8 used for this study. Image ID B22_018396_1890_XI_09N320W. Raw image credits to NASA/MSSS/ASU.

At a score of 0.6 our detector outperforms (for dark streaks only, recall ~85%) the performance as reported by earlier studies that used a combination of feature selection and machine learning (binary) classification techniques and HiRISE images (ref. 80, recall ~79%), at a continuously high level of precision (~94%). However, given the substantial number of expected slope streak candidates we deliberately choose a confidence score of 0.8 for this study, to maximize the precision of the detector and minimize the amount of time required for the subsequent review efforts, as described below.

We deploy the trained detector in a customized image download and processing pipeline originally established by Bickel et al.69 and further refined by Bickel et al.70,72, and Conway et al.46. The pipeline successively downloads all of the 86,546 CTX images contained in the post-beta27, pre-v01 version of the global CTX mosaic (pers. comm. J. Dickson), which was later officially published in ref. 26, at https://image.mars.asu.edu/stream/, and tiles them into 1000 × 1000 pixel patches (Fig. 9A). At the time of data processing, the final version of the26 mosaic was not yet available, which required us to process the individual CTX images that made up the pre-v01 version of the mosaic instead. All patches are scanned by the streak detector, the geographic location of all detections are reconstructed using the image's metadata, and all detections as well as their associated metadata are stored (including a size estimate, i.e., the diameter of the bounding box), including so-called ‘thumbnails', i.e., crop-outs of all CNN-predicted bounding boxes that are used for the subsequent expert review (see Fig. 9B, Supplementary Fig. S1). We use YOLOv5's default Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS) algorithm to remove duplicate predictions in each patch, following computer vision best practice. Overall, the processing of the entire dataset requires ~2 months of processing time using one single NVIDIA RTX 3090 located in a regular desktop computer.

Due to the potential for geo-location and co-registration inaccuracies as well as partial overlap of the CTX images that make up the pre-v01 version of the global CTX mosaic (pers. comm. J. Dickson) there is a small chance that slope streaks located along the seams of individual images are detected multiple times (‘duplicates'). However, a case study in the Tharsis region suggests that the number of potential duplicate detections in the overall dataset is expected to be small, around 6 % of the total streak count (Supplementary Fig. S3). The slight location inaccuracies paired with the large number of slope streak detections impedes an automated and manual detection and removal of duplicates, which is why they are not specifically identified and removed. We note that duplicate detections are evenly distributed across the mosaic and globe and, thus, do not systematically affect the geostatistical science analysis.

After processing, the detector identified 661,144 slope streak candidates (40,855 bright, 620,289 dark) at a confidence score of 0.8 and higher. At confidence 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5 the detector identified 1,494,416, 2,015,709, and 2,463,542 slope streak candidates, respectively.

We note a number of false detections among the bright and dark slope streak detection candidates, which closely resemble the visual appearance of streaks, such as wind streaks, linear shadowed topography, dunes, and mountain ridges (Supplementary Fig. S15). Past experience with object detectors being applied to very large and heterogeneous orbital image datasets has shown that the testset performance is not always fully representative of the ‘real world' performance of the detector in the full dataset, due to the inherently limited representability of the strictly size-constrained training and testing datasets as well as unknown/unexpected anomalies such as related to imaging artefacts, weather-related phenomena (clouds, etc.), and a-priori unknown look-alikes (see, e.g. refs. 45,70,71,72). The increased number of false detections as achieved by the bright streak detector (Fig. 9C) can likely be attributed to a) the smaller training dataset, which in turn is caused by the relative scarcity of bright streaks (as noted by other authors, such as, e.g. refs. 3,5), and b) the more subtle radiometric contrast between bright streaks and the surrounding slope (compared to dark streaks). The presence of false positives in the output of both detectors underlines the importance of the manual review of all candidates and the removal of all false positives.

In order to remove all obvious false detections and ensure the integrity of the scientific analysis, we manually review all CNN-identified candidates. The review consists of a human expert looking at every single slope streak candidate thumbnail, one-by-one. Due to the overwhelming amount of candidates at lower scores (e.g., >1 million candidates are score 0.7) we decide to only review all candidates with score 0.8 or higher, i.e., all very high confidence detections (n = 661,144). Overall, the manual review of all candidates required ~two weeks, achieving a reviewing rate of ~183 detections/minute or ~3 detections/second, assuming an 8-hour workday and 5 workdays per week. We identify a total of 13,026 bright and 484,019 dark slope streaks, indicating a detector precision of ~32% (bright) and ~78% (dark) (Fig. 9C). The testset precision at score 0.8 is 100% for both types, indicating there is a drop of performance by 68% for bright and by 22 % for dark streaks, as was expected based on previous experience. After expert review, we conclude the validation of the dataset by examining all remaining slope streak detections as plotted on the26,27 global CTX mosaic, considering all detections in their geomorphic context and removing any remaining outliers. All analyses and results (as well as the associated dataset) utilize the fully reviewed streak catalog.

The quality and reliability of the produced global slope streak dataset rely on the a) combined quality of the used CTX images, b) performance of the slope streak detector, and c) quality of the manual expert review. We do not find any direct or indirect evidence for any negative effect of the scanned CTX images on the mapping outputs, such as potentially caused by cloud cover, shadowing, haze, and data artifacts. We point out that26,27 carefully selected the images that make up the global mosaic to minimize any such negative impacts. The detector was carefully trained and its performance thoroughly tested and assessed using state-of-the-art approaches and heterogeneous, geographically-distributed training data. We do not expect any observational bias for the dark slope streak class; the very wide range of slope streak morphologies identified by the detector (Supplementary Fig. S1) provides evidence for a robust and capable detector.

Notably, the preferably more equatorward distribution and W-facing orientation of bright slope streaks is likely to be attributed to a bright slope streak detector that is more successful in retrieving bright streaks on well-illuminated, Sun-facing slopes, given the very faint appearance of bright slope streaks (Fig. 1A, C) and MRO's sun-synchronous orbit (imaging takes place in the early local afternoon). Potentially, the higher mean length as reported for bright streaks could be attributed to the lower performance of the bright streak detector (compared to the performance of the dark streak detector) resulting in systematically less precisely placed bounding boxes, leading to larger size estimates. We point out that the evenly-distributed orientation of dark streaks (Fig. 2B) implies that there is no general, CTX imaging-related bias regarding slope shadowing, as further verified by qualitative testing – and as expected based on the careful selection of mosaic images performed by Dickson et al.26,27.

We expect the manual review to capture and remove the overwhelming majority of all false detections contained in the original candidate dataset. In confirmation of that expectation, our derived streak distribution maps agree exceedingly well with previously published maps of slope-bearing terrain (e.g., refs. 3,5, Supplementary Fig. S2), which further increases our confidence in the derived maps and relations. Notably, we identify a number of previously unknown streak hotspots, such as located in Xanthe Terra, Lunae Planum, E Kasei Valles, and Syrtis Major (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S2). We note that our mapping approach is relying on a stitched mosaic consisting of CTX images taken several years apart (2006–202026,27), and at different times/seasons; as a result, our slope streak catalog does not represent one snapshot in time, but a wide time-range. Much of the remaining ambiguity could be addressed with globally-distributed information about slope streak and RSL formation times.

The CNN reports a size estimate for every slope streak detection, representing the diameter of the CNN-predicted bounding box, which closely encompasses the streaks, i.e., represents a proxy for streak length (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Using the spatial resolution of the associated CTX image, we convert the diameter from pixel to meter. Following a previously established methodology65,66 and in order to improve the accuracy of the relation between bounding box diameter and actual streak length, we manually measure the actual length of a randomly drawn subsample of 1000 slope streaks and relate it to the respective bounding box diameter (linear relation), deriving the following relation:

We use this relation and correct all ~500,000 streak length estimates; all scientific analyses use the corrected length estimate. As the size of each bounding box is dominated by the largest contained streak, this relation might not be entirely representative for bounding boxes that include multiple streaks with distinct streak length differences. We further establish a linear relation between the length of streaks and their width, measured at their morphological center, using the same randomly drawn subsample of 1000 slope streaks:

In addition, we use the subsample to quantify the average number of individual slope streaks contained in one single detection (see Supplementary Fig. S1), calculating an average of 2.33 streaks/detection. Multiple, spatially co-located slope streaks are not always easily discernible, such as visualized by Fig. 1A, B, Supplementary Fig. S8. We note that the absolute counts of individual slope streaks as derived in this work might under- or over-estimate the actual number of slope streaks in a given region.

We use the corrected streak length and the relation between length and width to produce estimates of streak area for the entire dataset, assuming a simplified rectangular streak shape:

For RSL, we manually measure a subsample of 100 semi-randomly selected, geographically-distributed features (taken from, e.g. refs. 8,51) and estimate their surface area using Eq. (3).

We compare our slope streak catalog to a large number of auxiliary spatial raster and vector datasets using Quantum GIS (QGIS). Specifically, we use TES surface albedo31, MOLA topography81, RSL locations mapped in MRO HiRISE (such as by McEwen et al.8,51), modeled environmental outputs produced by the Mars Climate Database (MCD34, assuming a climatology average solar scenario), date-constrained (new) impacts39, InSight tecto-genetic broadband (BB) and low-frequency (LF) events with back azimuth (BAZ41,42), the most recent version of the martian geologic map82, river valleys47, rockfall locations45, OMEGA nanophase ferric iron83, TGO FREND water-equivalent-hydrogen (WEH84), GRS H2O and H85, and dust devil locations (ref. 46, covering MY28 to MY36). We use the MOLA topography data to create two derived topography products, slope angle and slope aspect, using built-in QGIS algorithms. We quantitatively define the significance of differences between different populations and datasets using a two-sample T-test with a default P-criterion of 0.05.

Importantly, many of the used global auxiliary datasets feature spatial resolutions several factors below the size of CTX-detected slope streaks and/or depend on various assumptions and models, such as the MCD-derived outputs. For example, the global, km-scale, MCD-derived wind speed maps do not fully capture the complex influence of small-scale topography on wind speed and direction. We underline the importance of local, site-specific studies to verify the global-scale observations and interpretations made by this work.

Using a methodology developed by Bickel et al.70,86, we quantify the statistical relation between streak and date-constrained impact/marsquake epicenter locations (Fig. 10). First (‘Criterion 1'), we calculate the shortest distance between all streaks and a) all real impacts/quakes and b) the same number of randomly placed (synthetic) points (in the same area). Second (‘Criterion 2'), we count the number of streaks in 0.5, 2, and 5° radii around a) all real impacts/quakes and b) the same number of randomly placed (synthetic) points (in the same area). If there was a physical relation between impacts/quakes and streak occurrence, the average distance to streak locations should be smaller, and the number of streak should increase in the proximity of real impacts/quakes (Fig. 10).

A Schematic map of streaks (black dots, n = 22), impacts (blue, n = 4), and synthetic impacts (orange, n = 4); B Assessment of minimum distance between streaks and (real/synthetic) events; C Assessment of number of streaks in n° bins around (real/synthetic) events. A relation between an impact/seismic event and streaks would result in smaller minimum distances and increased numbers of streaks closer to the events. D Real example from Arabia Terra, including bright (white dots) and dark streak detections (black dots); diameter of circles does not properly reflect the 0.5, 2, and 5° radii used throughout this study. Note how the individual streak detections cluster along topographic inclines, mostly along crater walls. Viking merged color mosaic in the background.

We note that this method is strongly affected by the quality and spatiotemporal availability of the impact and marsquake data; ref. 39 acknowledge that their impact catalog is likely incomplete, particularly in the southern highlands; in addition, a CTX image used in the mosaic might have been taken prior to an impact even at the same location. However, there is a substantial number of date constrained impacts available for a statistical analysis (n = 1203) which have been mapped over the same time period as the images for the global CTX mosaic have been acquired, indicating there is a robust statistical foundation for our analyses.

In turn, a substantial fraction of the CTX images in the global mosaic were acquired prior to the InSight mission (late 2018 to late 2022), making a meaningful comparison with the seismic data challenging. Tecto-genetic quakes are likely to periodically re-occur in the same regions, but their periods are unknown and might exceed the survival time of slope streaks. In addition, InSight's records are occasionally noisy, i.e., might not include all tectonic events in the monitoring period, do not cover all of Mars' surface (core shadow), and suffer from substantial localization uncertainties (e.g. ref. 87). Overall, the geostatistical comparison of streak and marsquake locations is not expected to be entirely conclusive. In order to compensate the data limitations, we also compare streak locations with the distribution of permanent geomorphic expressions of geologically recent tectonic activity, such as graben and fossae.

Metrics details

The apicomplexan mitochondrial electron transport chain is essential for parasite survival and displays a divergent subunit composition. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of an apicomplexan III2–IV supercomplex and of the drug target complex III2. The supercomplex structure reveals how clade-specific subunits form an apicomplexan-conserved III2–IV interface with a unique, kinked architecture, suggesting that supercomplexes evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages. A knockout resulting in supercomplex disassembly challenges the proposed role of III2–IV in electron transfer efficiency as suggested for mammals. Nevertheless, knockout analysis indicates that III2–IV is critical for parasite fitness. The complexes from the model parasite Toxoplasma gondii were inhibited with the antimalarial atovaquone, revealing interactions underpinning species specificity. They were also inhibited with endochin-like quinolone (ELQ)-300, an inhibitor in late-stage preclinical development. Notably, in the apicomplexan binding site, ELQ-300 is flipped compared with related compounds in the mammalian enzyme. On the basis of the binding modes and parasite-specific interactions discovered, we designed more potent ELQs with subnanomolar activity against T. gondii. Our findings reveal critical evolutionary differences in the role of supercomplexes in mitochondrial biology and provide insight into cytochrome b inhibition, informing future drug discovery.

The mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) is essential for nearly all organisms from the divergent domain of eukaryotes, yet our knowledge of how it works is primarily informed by studies in yeast and mammals. The occurrence of respiratory supercomplexes has been known for decades1 and recently, insight from structural studies exposed the interactions that mediate their formation. However, whether supercomplex formation is functionally relevant for electron transfer or whether this reoccurring arrangement confers a different advantage, such as increased complex stability, is still a subject of ongoing investigations2,3,4,5,6. This study provides an evolutionary perspective on the currently proposed supercomplex functions through the structural and functional characterization of a protozoan parasite supercomplex. Apicomplexans are parasites that belong to the myzozoan clade of eukaryotes. These parasites were recently shown to have expanded mETC complexes with numerous clade-specific subunits7,8; however, their role remains unknown. Likewise, in the apicomplexan mETC, complex III2 (CIII) is the primary target for antiparasitic drugs. However, the molecular basis for this sensitivity is not fully understood owing to the lack of a parasite CIII structure. We address both of these questions through structural analyses and genetic studies.

The Toxoplasma gondii respiratory supercomplex was purified from the rapidly proliferating tachyzoite stage. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined the structure of the III2–IV supercomplex in the presence of atovaquone and endochin-like quinolone (ELQ)-300 (10 µM each) at 2.8 Å resolution, allowing atomic model construction (Fig. 1a,b, Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). The 960 kDa supercomplex consists of 37 subunits and contains the conserved reaction centers and cofactors (Supplementary Table 1). In total, 13 subunits are apicomplexan conserved, of which 2 are found in CIII (TgQCR12 and 13). Unlike previously predicted8,9, the complex contains a newly assigned homolog of QCR10, which could only be identified via structural similarity. Complex IV (CIV) is greatly augmented, containing 11 apicomplexan-conserved subunits and substantial clade-specific subunit extensions (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1), giving it a molecular mass of 405 kDa, much larger than the 207 kDa mammalian homolog10. For the 11 apicomplexan-conserved subunits of T. gondii CIV (ApiCox7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24 and 30), we extend an existing nomenclature indicating the approximate molecular weight11 (Methods and Supplementary Table 1). The increased molecular masses of CIII and CIV are in line with the larger complex II and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase assemblies found in Apicomplexa12,13. These findings confirm that the apicomplexan oxidative phosphorylation complexes display augmented subunit compositions, raising questions about the role of new subunits and extensions, as well as their evolution. An overall reduced protein hydrophobicity resulting from a splitting of structural elements into several subunits may enable mitochondrial protein targeting following gene transfer from the mitochondrial genome to the nuclear genome13,14. In our structure, T. gondii Cox2 is split into three proteins, each providing canonical helices but displaying reduced overall hydrophobicity compared with canonical Cox2 (Extended Data Fig. 2), providing support that this mechanism enabled the marked mitochondrial genome reduction in apicomplexans to just three protein-coding genes.

Supernumerary subunits may also mediate higher-order oxidative phosphorylation assemblies that suit clade-specific mitochondrial functions and contribute to membrane curvature induction. Our T. gondii III2–IV structure reveals an unusual supercomplex architecture, in which the transmembrane region of CIV is tilted against the membrane plane of CIII by ~20° (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 3). This finding is further supported by the positions of lipid-binding sites within the curved membrane region (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). By contrast, the transmembrane region of the mammalian and yeast supercomplex homologs are flat (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The kink is probably induced by the presence of clade-specific subunits TgQCR12 in CIII and ApiCox7 in CIV, which act as spacers in the transmembrane and matrix regions and would clash in a flat architecture, as present in the mammalian supercomplex (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Recently, kinked interfaces have been observed between complexes I and III2 in ciliate and plant supercomplexes15,16 and the ciliate I–II–III2–IV2 structure was shown to contribute to membrane curvature induction. In T. gondii, pentagonal pyramid arrays of ATP synthase generate a distinct bulbous cristae morphology that is characteristic for mitochondria of apicomplexan parasites13. Using electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging, we identified the III2–IV supercomplex in situ and revealed its localization in the curved, lateral regions of the cristae membranes (Fig. 2a–c). Therefore, the newly observed kinked III2–IV architecture, mediated by clade-specific subunits, probably reflects the curvature of the lateral cristae regions. This architecture differs markedly from the lamellar cristae found in mammals, where respiratory supercomplexes reside in the flat membrane regions17 (Fig. 2d,e).

a, A slice of an electron cryo-tomogram of mitochondrial membranes from T. gondii. ATP synthase (yellow) and supercomplexes (red) are indicated. b, The subtomogram average map (gray) is consistent with a III2–IV1 arrangement. The individually fitted CIII dimer (blue) and CIV monomer structures (yellow) are from S. cerevisiae (PDB 6T15). c, A three-dimensional close-up of a showing apical ATP synthase and lateral supercomplex. The apices of the mitochondrial membranes (blue) are occupied by ATP synthase pyramids (yellow, described in ref. 13), with supercomplexes (red) in the flatter lateral regions. Both structures were obtained by subtomogram averaging. d, The arrangement of ATP synthase and supercomplexes in cristae of mammals and T. gondii. The rim of flat cristae in mammals are in line with ATP synthase rows (PDB 7ajb), whereas the apices of bulbous T. gondii cristae are shaped by ATP synthase pyramids (PDB 6TML). Mammalian supercomplexes (PDB 7o37) are found in the lateral, flat membrane regions, whereas the kinked III2–IV T. gondii supercomplex (this study) is accommodated by the curved, lateral regions. The matrix is shown in yellow. The cristae lumen and intermembrane space are shown in blue. e, A schematic highlighting the resulting cristae morphologies, adapted from ref. 43. f, Overlay of supercomplex structures aligned on CIV highlights different architectures, as revealed by differing positions of CIII from mammals (Mus musculus, PDB 7o37 mature supercomplex), yeast (S. cerevisiae, PDB 6giq) and plant (Vigna radiata, PDB 7jrp). The mammalian and T. gondii CIII homologs bind to opposite sides of CIV. g, Comparison of the T. gondii (this study) and M. musculus III2–IV (PDB 7o37) showing the rotation of CIV relative to CIII, thereby placing different CIV subunits (COX6B and COX7c) at the interface with QCR6, or at the distal end of the supercomplex. h, Open-book view of the III2–IV interface with lumenal contacts with respective subunits highlighted by spheres. i, Top view of the III2–IV interface.

The T. gondii CIV is unusual in its augmented subunit composition and orientation within the supercomplex. The largest clade-specific subunit, ApiCox13, contains a CDGSH-type iron–zinc finger domain on the matrix side, with some residues contributing to cardiolipin binding (Extended Data Fig. 4). As this protein fold is known to have evolved varying metal binding capacities (Zn2+ or Fe2S2)18, we performed sequence alignments and structure prediction of ApiCox13 homologs. This analysis indicated that Fe2S2 sites are well conserved in Apicomplexa, while homologs from marine species in related phyla instead contain tetrahedrally coordinated zinc (Extended Data Fig. 4). These findings are in line with the observed essentiality of Fe2S2 binding capability for CIV integrity and parasite survival in T. gondii19.

The architecture of the T. gondii supercomplex is unique among all previously described respiratory supercomplexes and this is mediated by a series of clade-specific subunits and extensions. When compared with the mature mammalian supercomplex III2–IV, the T. gondii CIV is found in a similar position relative to CIII, but rotated by ~180° (Extended Data Fig. 5a), therefore interacting with a different set of subunits. This leads to a unique relative positioning of T. gondii complexes III and IV, compared with mammalian, yeast and plant supercomplexes20,21,22 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5a), indicating that non-opisthokont lineages may represent most of respiratory supercomplex diversity. Whereas the mammalian assembly factor SCAF1 ties CIV to CIII in proximity to QCR6, TgQCR6 is facing toward NDUFA4 and the clade-conserved subunits, ApiCox10 and 15, located on the opposite side of CIV, thus generating a unique interface and III2–IV supercomplex architecture (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Furthermore, owing to the kinked architecture of the T. gondii supercomplex, CIV is associated to CIII only via the conserved TgQCR6, forming lumenal interactions with the four CIV subunits COX6B, ApiCox10, NDUFA4 and ApiCox15 (spheres in Fig. 2h). The interaction with ApiCox10 is mediated via an apicomplexan-conserved N-terminal extension (residues 2–23) of TgQCR6, which forms hydrophobic interactions with a helix hairpin (H3–H4) of ApiCox10 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). ApiCox15 contains a single TM-helix and a 38-residue lumenal region that contacts the TgQCR6 helix hairpin. Finally, unlike its mammalian homolog, the apicomplexan NDUFA4 C-terminus contains a structured horizontal helix that interacts with the TgQCR6 hairpin (Fig. 2g,h,i) on the lumenal side. The clade-specific interacting subunits and phylum-specific protein extensions are conserved in the malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e) and other apicomplexans, indicating that the newly described III2–IV interface and unusual supercomplex architecture are probably conserved in apicomplexan parasites.

Given the observed interactions of the clade-specific ApiCox10 and ApiCox15 with TgQCR6 at the supercomplex interface, we hypothesized that deletion of either of those proteins would result in supercomplex disassembly, allowing us to address the role of supercomplex formation. We attempted to generate ApiCox10 and ApiCox15 individual knockouts (KOs) using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–Cas9 system. Five independent transfections and a screen of 50 clones failed to isolate an ApiCox15-KO mutant suggesting that this gene is refractory for full deletion. On the other hand, we were able to generate an ApiCox10-KO in two separate background lines, one where the CIV subunit Cox2a is endogenously tagged with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag, and another where the CIII subunit QCR2 is endogenously HA tagged8. Additionally, we generated a complemented line where a Ty-tagged ApiCox10 is reintroduced (Extended Data Fig. 6a–g). Native gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated the loss of III2–IV supercomplexes in both ApiCox10-KO lines (Fig. 3a–c), and this was further confirmed via proteomics analysis of Cox2a-HA immunoprecipitation (Extended Data Fig. 6h and Supplementary Data 1). Importantly, the individual CIV and CIII2 remain intact (Fig. 3d–f) and the Ty-tagged ApiCox10 complementation restored the supercomplex (Extended Data Fig. 6i), confirming the unique interface architecture of the apicomplexan III2–IV supercomplex and its dependence on a clade-specific subunit for its assembly.

Source data.

The supercomplex structure raises the question of whether the observed kinked architecture contributes to the induction of membrane curvature or whether it has evolved to allow accommodation in the unique bulbous mitochondrial cristae found in apicomplexans. Analysis of mitochondria in electron microscopy thin sections of the ApiCox10-KO line pointed to unchanged cristae morphology and density, in support of the latter scenario (Extended Data Fig. 6j–l). Likewise, ApiCox10-KO had no impact on the mitochondrial redox state (Extended Data Fig. 6m). Furthermore, examination of the mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in extracellular ApiCox10-KO, as proxy measurements for respiratory activity in tachyzoites, revealed no alteration compared to the parental line (Fig. 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 7). This finding is in stark contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where supercomplex disruption impairs electron transfer efficiency in a cytochrome c level-dependent manner4. Interestingly, analysis of the surface charges on the T. gondii supercomplex shows a continuous negatively charged patch on the lumen region (Extended Data Fig. 6n), which is conserved in the yeast supercomplex, where it has been suggested to facilitate intracomplex cytochrome c transfer by two-dimensional (2D) diffusion23. Together, our findings suggest that cytochrome c diffusion does not limit respiration in T. gondii tachyzoites.

Finally, we tested whether the inability to form respiratory supercomplexes inflicts a fitness cost on the parasite. Analysis of parasite replication revealed a potential delay in reaching eight parasites per vacuole (Extended Data Fig. 6o). We thus created an ApiCox10-KO in a fluorescent background line and performed a growth competition assay. ApiCox10-KO parasites grown in the same culture as wild-type parasites were consistently outcompeted, indicating decreased fitness (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Figs. 6p and 7). Overall, parasites that are unable to form supercomplexes have no observable defects in respiratory activity, but display a fitness penalty, indicating that supercomplexes play an important fitness-conferring role in mitochondrial function that is not directly related to primary catalytic function. The finding that clade-specific subunits, which mediate supercomplex formation are important for competitive fitness may indicate that they convey increased stability or aid localization of the kinked supercomplexes to the uniquely shaped cristae (as opposed to the inner boundary membrane) to enable efficient formation of a membrane potential. The fitness defects associated with loss of supercomplexes in a tachyzoite competition assay suggest that supercomplex functions may become more relevant and observable in vivo or in different stages of the T. gondii life cycle.

CIII (cytochrome bc1 complex) plays a crucial role in electron transfer and proton pumping. The pumping of protons into the cristae lumen occurs via the Q-cycle, which involves sequential ubiquinol oxidation and ubiquinone reduction. Both reactions occur in specific quinone binding sites within the cytochrome b (Cyt-b) subunit, called Qo (oxidation) and Qi (reduction), which are essential for catalytic activity. Atovaquone is a Food and Drug Administration-approved antimalarial drug that competitively inhibits the Cyt-b Qo site and is also effective against toxoplasmosis24 (EC50 of 138 nM (ref. 25)). However, resistance to atovaquone has led to the development of novel inhibitors, such as ELQs, which target the Qi site25. The basis of selectivity of inhibition at either site is not fully understood.

The current understanding of species-specific Qo site inhibition by atovaquone is deduced from homology models of CIII structures of other species26, but experimental structures from apicomplexans have not been determined. Moreover, ELQ-300 is a Qi site inhibitor undergoing late-stage preclinical testing as a new antimalarial drug in the Medicines for Malaria portfolio, which is effective against blood, liver and mosquito-stage malaria, and also displays efficacy against T. gondii and other apicomplexan pathogens27,28. When used in combination therapy with atovaquone, ELQ-300 is highly synergistic in a murine malaria model29. However, the atovaquone/ELQ-300-bound structure of CIII has not been reported, and the structural basis for parasite-specific Cyt-b inhibition is not known.

We determined the structure of the T. gondii III2–IV supercomplex in the presence of atovaquone and ELQ-300 (10 µM each) at 2.8 Å resolution. The cryo-EM map shows both ELQ-300 (Qi) and atovaquone (Qo) bound, allowing insight into the binding mode of the two inhibitors (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 8). As our mitochondria preparations of the obligate intracellular parasite T. gondii also contained substantial amounts of mitochondria from the host cells (‘Vero' cells from the African green monkey, Cholorocebus sabaeus), the final cryo-EM sample contained a mixture of mitochondrial complexes from both species, which we classified computationally (Extended Data Fig. 1). From the same cryo-EM dataset, we thus also determined the structure of CIII within the co-purified Cholorocebus sabaeus I–III2–IV respirasome at 2.8 Å resolution (with atovaquone bound in Qi and Qo sites, see below), allowing direct comparison of architecture and inhibitor binding between parasite and host (Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). In our structure, TgCyt-b displays the conserved fold including eight transmembrane helices (A–H) and conserved redox centers (Extended Data Fig. 8). Notably, helices F, G and H are substantially remodeled. In opisthokonts (which includes yeast and mammals), helix F is curved and contains a 310 helix that introduces a bend in the transmembrane segment and is followed by a conserved proline residue (P305 in humans and C. sabaeus) that acts as a helix breaker. This conserved proline residue is missing in apicomplexan Cyt-b homologs, resulting in a straight α-helical helix F. Likewise, the T. gondii FG-loop (N306–W324, human 309–315) is remodeled, followed by a shortened hairpin of helices G and H. These features affect the positioning of residues that interact with the chlorophenyl moiety of atovaquone.

Residues responsible for apicomplexan-specific atovaquone sensitivity are shown in red. b, A ligand diagram of atovaquone interactions in the T. gondii Qo site. c, View of the Qo site of C. sabaeus occupied with atovaquone. d, A schematic of atovaquone interactions in the C. sabaeus Qo site.

The binding pocket for the hydroxynaphthoquinone group of the inhibitor is conserved between C. sabaeus and T. gondii, with our structure revealing interactions with residues F128, Y131, P265, M138 and I263 (Fig. 4), of which the latter two were previously found mutated in atovaquone-resistant T. gondii lines30. The difference in Qo site affinity arises from a group of parasite-specific residues (I124, Y272 and F289) that interact with the chlorophenyl moiety of atovaquone. Among these, Y272 (T. gondii numbering) on the EF-helix is occupied by an alanine in higher primates (A277 in humans and C. sabaeus). In the inhibited Cyt-b structure from S. cerevisiae, the chlorophenyl and cyclohexane rings of atovaquone are modeled in a near parallel configuration26. Our structure reveals that in T. gondii, the two moieties are instead oriented orthogonally, leading to a pi-stacking interaction of the chlorophenyl group with Y272 (Fig. 4). The aromatic character of this residue is also conserved in Plasmodium species causing malaria in humans (F267). Indeed, the single mutations F267V and F267I convey atovaquone resistance in P. falciparum and P. yoelii, respectively31,32, indicating that aromatic interactions, rather than unspecific hydrophobic contacts, are required for atovaquone binding. Our structure reveals that Y272 acts to position the chlorophenyl group of atovaquone to convey parasite-specific ligand interactions.

The remodeled TgCyt-b structure affects the binding of atovaquone in the Qo site. Owing to the curved helix F structure, in the S. cerevisiae Cyt-b, the I299 sidechain is partially inserted between the respective aromatic residue (F278) and the chlorophenyl group, preventing a stacking interaction as observed in our T. gondii structure (Extended Data Fig. 8e). This may explain the potential difference in sensitivity between yeast26,33 and P. falciparum27,34.

Notably, the binding of atovaquone to the Qo site generates an induced fit. Comparison to our T. gondii structure with unoccupied Qo site (see below), revealed that the EF loop and cd1 helix undergo movements to widen the pocket. In this process, I263 on the EF loop, which would result in a clash with atovaquone in the unoccupied state, moves by 2 Å to accommodate the ligand (Supplementary Movie 1).

While the atovaquone EC50 value is in the low nanomolar range for both P. falciparum and T. gondii cytochrome bc135,36, the EC50 for the mammalian homolog is more than 100 times higher27 (EC50 T. gondii of 138 nM, 38 µM human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF)25). Remarkably, we also found atovaquone bound not only in the Qo site, but also the Qi site of the C. sabaeus Cyt-b, which is part of the I–III2–IV supercomplex. Our structure indicates that in the dual-site inhibited mammalian Cyt-b, the atovaquone molecules of the Qi and Qo sites probably adopt two different tautomers to enable the formation of hydrogen bond networks in the two quinone binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Discussion). This observed dual atovaquone inhibition of the mammalian complex (Qi + Qo) indicates that ELQ-300 binds the mammalian Qi site very weakly or not at all. Thus, by co-determining the structures of both the mammalian and T. gondii CIII in the presence of equimolar atovaquone/ELQ-300 concentrations (10 µM) from the same heterogeneous sample and revealing their different drug binding, we provide structural evidence for the high parasite selectivity of ELQ-300 as a Qi-site inhibitor27.

To reveal its binding mechanism at high resolution, we affinity-purified the T. gondii CIII embedded in amphipols via the 3xFLAG-tagged Rieske subunit (Extended Data Fig. 9a–e), inhibited by ELQ-300 only, and determined its cryo-EM structure to 1.8 Å resolution (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). Surprisingly, the C2-symmetric CIII structure contains two bound ELQ-300 molecules per Cyt-b monomer, one at the Qi site and, unexpectedly, another in the central cavity of the Qo channel (Fig. 5a–d). In the Qi pocket, ELQ-300 displays an unexpected binding mode, which is well supported by our cryo-EM density (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9f–h). The 4-(1H)-quinolone group is pinned by hydrogen bonds with H197 and D223, interacting with ketone and amino groups of the ligand at N–O distances of 3.0 Å, respectively (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9f–g). The ketone group of ELQ-300 also interacts with the heme bH propionate group via an ordered water (Fig. 5a,e). This binding mode differs markedly from the orientation of other 3-diaryl 4-(1H)-quinolones in the Qi site of the bovine enzyme, which was found to be rotated 180° (ref. 37) (Extended Data Fig. 9l–m). Owing to the fixed orientation of the quinolone group in our T. gondii structure, the diarylether group in position-2 extends toward helix D (on the matrix side), which is markedly different from the binding pose observed in the bovine homolog, in which quinolones with both 2- or 3-diaryl-groups extend in the opposite direction, toward helix A (in the lumen side; Fig. 5c,e and Extended Data Fig. 9k–p). This finding is similar to the binding mode of atovaquone in the Qi site observed in our C. sabaeus structure, in which the chlorophenyl-cyclohexyl group also points toward helix A, indicating a similar binding mode to that seen for other inhibitors of the mammalian Qi site26,29,30. In our T. gondii structure, the orientation of the first aryl group is determined by the adjacent I193 on helix D, leading to a 63° angle between the aryl and quinolone planes. The peripheral trifluoro-methoxy-phenoxy group displays flexibility and adopts two distinct conformations (Fig. 5a). Conformer A makes contacts along helix D with I189, V190 and I193, whereas through a rotation around the ether bond, conformer B extends toward helix a to interact with a set of hydrophobic residues (Extended Data Fig. 9i). The hydrophobic character of the Qi site entrance is probably enhanced by the specific recruitment of an adjacent cardiolipin molecule (Extended Data Fig. 9j).

One conspicuous residue that may contribute to determining the binding mode of ELQ-300 is F34 from helix A, which interacts with the methyl group in the 2-position (Fig. 5a,e). This residue is conserved in P. falciparum, but not in human (S35) and it is thus possible that its bulky character contributes to dictating the orientation of the 3-aryl quinolones in apicomplexan parasites by restricting the entrance of the Qi site. Thus, our structure reveals an unexpected binding mode of the ELQ-300 in the apicomplexan Qi site, which differs markedly from previously determined structures of the inhibited mammalian CIII and provides an accurate molecular model for developing antimalarial inhibitors.

Our data also reveal the structural basis for the observed parasite selectivity of ELQ-300 for the Qi site35,38,39. In the deepest part of the T. gondii Qi pocket, L26 interacts with the chloro and methoxy groups of the quinolone (Extended Data Fig. 9q). This finding corroborates the observation that an I22L mutation of the respective residue in P. falciparum (clone D1) causes a 24-fold reduction in sensitivity to ELQ-300 (ref. 40). L26 further contacts the chlorine substituent at the van der Waals distance (Extended Data Fig. 9r), suggesting it is important for ligand positioning within the Qi site. This finding agrees with previous evidence showing that the size of the atomic radius of the 6-position substituent, fluorine (ELQ-316) or hydrogen (ELQ-298), is inversely correlated to potency against T. gondii25,28. Furthermore, our structure indicates that species-specific affinity may not be solely owing to steric hindrance introduced by L26, but due to additional contacts of the 3′-methyl group of the P. falciparum I22 sidechain with the 7-methoxy group of ELQ-300 (Extended Data Fig. 9q). The methoxy-substituent at the 7-position is known to limit Qi site affinity in the mammalian host25,41.

On the basis of the above observation, the EC50 of various ELQs decreases together with the atomic radius in position 6 (Br > Cl > F > H). We concluded that this may be owing to a deeper penetration of the inhibitor into the Qi site, allowing a stronger interaction with the substituent at the position 7 (Extended Data Fig. 9r). The EC50 of ELQ-340, ELQ-300, ELQ-316 and ELQ-298 were 238 nM (95% confidence interval (CI) 215, 261), 63.9 nM (95% CI 53–74.9), 3.2 nM (95% CI 2.7–3.6) and 1.1 nM (95% CI 0.5–1.7), respectively (Extended Data Table 1). Indeed, an analysis of the apicomplexan Qi site revealed that a parasite-specific aqueous pocket around the 7-methoxy-substituent is generated by replacement of mammalian residues Y224 and K227 with M219 and T222 in T. gondii, respectively. Moreover, a T222P substitution resulted in resistance to 7-methoxy ELQs36. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized and tested ELQs with a longer 7-ethoxy substituent in combination with chlorine (ELQ-804), fluorine (ELQ-807) and hydrogen (ELQ-627) at position 6 (Fig. 5d,f and Extended Data Table 1). As predicted, the extended 7-ethoxy substituent increased potency compared with the analogous 7-methoxy-substituent. ELQ-804, ELQ-807 and ELQ-627 were fourfold, threefold and tenfold more potent than their respective 7-methoxy analogs. We propose that the most potent compound, ELQ-627, possesses the greatest potential for extending into the pocket owing to the smallest 6-position substituent, hydrogen, paired with the 7-position ethoxy group. The EC50 values of each 7-methoxy compound compared with its 7-ethoxy analog was statistically different (P < 0.0001). The EC50 of ELQ-627 was 0.12 nM, which was 27-fold more potent than ELQ-316, a lead preclinical candidate for toxoplasmosis that is highly effective and well-tolerated in mouse models of acute and latent toxoplasmosis compared with clinically used drugs and advanced preclinical compounds42. The discovery and validation of a unique binding pocket in the T. gondii Cyt-b Qi site provides a readily exploitable feature of the apicomplexan target for structure-guided drug design. The cryo-EM structure of the apicomplexan CIII will advance the development of pathogen-specific, highly potent Cyt-b inhibitors to treat devastating apicomplexan diseases.

T. gondii tachyzoites were cultured in HFF, sourced from American Type Culture Collection (SCRC-1041). HFFs and parasites were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, containing 4.5 g l−1 glucose, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mM L-glutamine and penicillin or streptomycin antibiotics and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

To generate the Rieske-3xFLAG line (C-terminal triple FLAG epitope tagging), a gRNA targeting the stop codon of TGGT1_320220 was identified using ChopChop44 and cloned into a U6 promoter and Cas9–green fluorescent protein expressing vector (Tub-Cas9YFP-pU6-ccdB-tracrRNA)45 using the BsaI restriction site. The CAT selection cassette and triple FLAG epitope were amplified by PCR from a pLIC.TEV.3xFLAG.CATΔpacI plasmid46. The gRNA–CAS9 vector–PCR product mixture was transfected into the TATi∆ku80 (ref. 47) line by electroporation and cassette integration was selected with chloramphenicol. Positive clones were isolated by serial dilution and confirmed by PCR analysis.

For the ApiCox knockout line, a gRNA targeting the stop codon of TGGT1_316255 was identified via ChopChop44 and cloned as above into Tub-Cas9YFP-pU6-ccdB-tracrRNA. A dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) resistance cassette was amplified using the pDT7S4 plasmid as template47 and using primers containing 50 bp of sequence homology to regions upstream and downstream of the TGGT1_316255 open reading frame. The gRNA–Cas9 vector–PCR product mixture was transfected into the either a Cox2a-HA, QCR2-HA8 or mNEON::Δku80 (ref. 48) parental line by electroporation and cassette integration was selected with pyrimethamine. Positive clones were isolated by serial dilution and confirmed by PCR analysis. For the complementation of the knockout cell line, cDNA was cloned into a pTUB8mycGFPMyoATy expression vector via EcoRI and NsiI restriction sites49, plasmid electroporated and selected with mycophenolic acid (25 mg ml−1) and xanthine (50 mg ml−1).

Replication assay: parental or ApiCox10-KO parasites were inoculated into HFF cells grown on a glass coverslip and left to invade and replicate for 24 h. Parasites were detected via immunofluorescence using the GAP45 antibody [1:1,000]50. The number of vacuoles containing 1, 2, 4 or 8+ parasites were counted for more than 250 vacuoles per replicate. Four independent experiments were performed.

Competition assay: parental or ApiCox10-KO parasites in the mNEON::Δku80 background48 were counted, resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (25 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA and 1% w/v FBS) and mixed in a ≈1:1 ratio with wild-type tdTomato::Δku80 parasites and the mixed population inoculated in cell culture. These mixed populations were passaged six times. At each passage a portion of the population was analyzed using BD FACS Celesta (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using the FlowJo v10.8.1 software (BD biosciences).

Growth inhibition for ELQ EC50: T. gondii proliferation inhibition with ELQs was measured in a 96-well assay using an RH T. gondii strain expressing beta-galactosidase cultured in HFF. Compounds dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were diluted serially across the plate in four replicate rows by fourfold dilutions with a control column receiving no compounds. Then, 4,000 T. gondii tachyzoites were added to each well. After 3 days of incubation (37 °C, 5% CO2), the media were replaced with a solution of chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside and NP-40. The absorbance of each well was measured at 575 nm in a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 190 plate reader. Each compound was tested in at least three independent experiments. Absorbance was plotted against the base-10log of compound concentration and fitted to a four-parameter model of the Hill equation to estimate the EC50 for each compound. The 95% CIs of the mean, two-tailed unpaired t-tests and EC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism v8.4.3 software.

For native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis, parasites were filtered through a 3.0-µm polycarbonate filter, washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in native PAGE sample buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 1% n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (β-DDM) or 1% digitonin. After 30 min incubation at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 18,000g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant mixed with Coomassie G250 to a final concentration of 0.25% w/v. Samples were separated on a native PAGE 4–16% (for monomer detection) or a 3–12% (for supercomplex detection) Bis-Tris gel. NativeMark and a bovine mitochondrial membrane preparation was used as a molecular weight marker. SDS–PAGE, immunoblot analysis and DAB staining were performed as described previously8,46. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-HA (Roche, clone 3F10) (1:500), anti-TOM40 (1:2,000)51, anti-MYS (1:2,000)52, anti-Ty53 (1:800), anti-CDPK1 (1:10,000)54 and anti-FLAG (Thermo Fisher, clone FG4R) (1:2,000). SDS–PAGE immunoblots were then labeled with secondary fluorescent antibodies (LI-COR: anti-mouse IRDye 800CW, anti-rabbit IRDye 680RD and anti-rat IRDye 800CW, all 1:10,000) and imaged with an Odyssey CLx. Native PAGE immunoblots were labeled with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (anti-rat, immunoglobulin G H&L horseradish peroxidase, abcam, 1:5,000; anti-rabbit, immunoglobulin G H&L horseradish peroxidase conjugate, Promega, 1:10,000) and chemiluminescence detection using Pierce ECL western blotting substrate and either an X-ray film or an iBright FL1000 imager (Invitrogen).

OCR and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured using a Seahorse XF HS Mini Analyzer v3.0.0.41 (Agilent Technologies) as described previously55. Each of the six independent experiments was performed with parental and ApiCox10-KO parasites with two technical replicates.

Parasites were filtered through a 3.0 µm polycarbonate filter and incubated with 1.5 µM JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine iodide, Thermo Fisher Scientific, stock 1.5 mM in DMSO) for 15 min at 37 °C. Treatment with 10 μM valinomycin was used as a depolarizing control. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1–2 ml FACS buffer (25 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA and 1% w/v FBS) before analysis using a BD FACS Celesta analyzer and data acquisition using FACSDiva software v9 (BD Biosciences). Unstained controls were used to define gates for analysis. In total, 50,000 events per treatment were collected, and data were analyzed using FlowJo v10.8.1 software (BD Biosciences).

Parasites were inoculated on fresh HFFs on glass coverslips. After 1 day, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized and blocked with a solution of 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% triton X-100 in PBS before incubation with primary antibodies (anti-Ty53, anti-MYS52 and anti-TOM40 (ref. 51)), 1:1,000, followed by secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor Goat anti-Mouse 488 Invitrogen A-11001, 1:1,000 and Alexa Fluor Goat anti-Rabbit 594 Invitrogen A-11012, 1:1,000). Coverslips were mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Southern Biotech, 0100–20). Slides were visualized on a DeltaVision Core microscope (Applied Precision) using the 100× objective and z-stacking. Images were deconvolved using SoftWoRx v5.5 software and processed using FIJI software v1.5.2 (ref. 56).

Parental and ApiCox10-KO parasites were allowed to invade HFF and form vacuoles. Cells were then fixed with fixation buffer (2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2), washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2 and post-fixed in 1% (w/v) OsO4, 1.25% (w/v) K4[Fe(CN)6] for 1 h on ice. After several washes in the same buffer, the samples were en bloc stained with 0.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate in water for 30 min. Thereafter, samples were washed with water, dehydrated in ascending acetone series and resin embedded. Ultrathin sections (~50 nm thick) were collected and imaged on a JEOL 1200 Transmission electron microscope (JEOL) operated at 80 kV. Images were analyzed in FIJI software and the number of cristae per unit mitochondrial area was calculated. Cristae density: parental: 62.57 ± 19.19 cristae µm−2, mean, s.d., n = 100. ApiCox10-KO: 58.55 ± 17.97 cristae µm−2; mean, s.d., n = 100. Mitochondrial area: parental: 0.09739 ± 0.09649 µm2, mean, s.d. n = 100. ApiCox10-KO: 0.09441 ± 0.06876 µm2, mean, s.d., n = 100.

MitoSOX staining to assess oxidative stress in the mitochondria was performed as described previously48 with minor modifications. Briefly, parasites were grown in the presence or absence of 2 mM ferric ammonium chloride, shown to increase mitochondrial oxidative stress, for 6 h, before parasites were filtered through a 3.0 µm polycarbonate filter and incubated with 1 µM MitoSOX (Thermo Fisher, M36008) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2 ml FACS buffer (25 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA and 1% w/v FBS) before analysis using BD FACS Celesta analyzer and data acquisition using FACSDiva software v9 (BD Biosciences). Parasites were gated on forward and side scatter and on green fluorescence before the red fluorescent signal was analyzed. In total, 100,000 events per treatment were collected and data were analyzed using the FlowJo v10.8.1 software (BD biosciences).

Immunoprecipitations for identification by mass spectrometry were performed as described previously55 with minor modifications. Cox2a-HA and ApiCox10-KO/Cox2a-HA parasites were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% digitonin. Elutions containing equal amount of protein were sent for mass spectrometry analysis. Four independent experiments were performed. Proteins detected in at least three out of the four experiments are displayed in a volcano plot. Data analysis to generate a volcano plot was performed using Perseus v1.6.12.0; samples were compared using a two-sided t-test, the false discovery rate was set to 0.01 and the significance threshold was set to 2.

Immunoprecipitation of Rieske-TEV-3xFLAG parasites was performed using anti-FLAG M2 affinity agarose gel (Merck). Parasites (≈1 × 1010) were incubated in 4 ml buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4) containing 2% β-DDM for 2 h at 4 °C before centrifugation at 18,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with FLAG affinity gel overnight at 4 °C. Then the affinity gel was washed three times with buffer containing 0.05% β-DDM before elution with a FLAG peptide solution (150 µg ml−1) for 1 h at 4 °C. The eluate was concentrated to ≈50 µl in a vivaspin 500 filter (100 kDa molecular weight cutoff) and subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 6 Increase 3.2/300 column (GE Healthcare) in 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4 and 0.05% β-DDM to separate it from aggregates and FLAG peptide. CIII-containing fractions were pooled and incubated with amphipol A8-35 (Anatrace) in a molar ratio of 1:5 for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of Bio-Beads SM-2 Resin (Bio-Rad) in a molar ratio of 1:20 for 16 h at 4 °C to remove detergent. The sample was concentrated and gel filtrated as before, followed by a final spin-column concentration to 0.94 mg ml−1. ELQ-300 (in DMSO) was added to a final concentration of 10 µM before sample vitrification.

Parasite culturing and mitochondria purification was performed as previously described13. Briefly, T. gondii RH tachyzoites were grown in Vero cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 4 mM of l-glutamine and penicillin or streptomycin antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2. For each mitochondrial preparation ≈100 T150 flasks were collected at >80% host-cell lysis and passed through 23G needles to fully lyse any remaining host cells. Parasites were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed in PBS and then resuspended in buffer containing 210 mM of mannitol, 70 mM of sucrose, 50 mM of HEPES–KOH pH 7.4, 1 mM of EGTA, 5 mM of EDTA, 10 mM of KCl and 1 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT) to 5 × 108 cells ml−1. Parasites were lysed by successive rounds of nitrogen cavitation (2,500 PSI, 15 min incubation on ice) until >95% lysis (confirmed by light microscopy). After each round, the lysate was centrifuged at 1,500g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and the pellet resuspended in the same volume for further lysis. The final combined lysate was centrifuged as before to remove unbroken cells and the supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting crude mitochondrial pellet was further purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient in 20 mM of HEPES–KOH pH 7.4, 2 mM of EDTA, 15%/23%/32%/60% (w/v) sucrose by centrifugation (103,745g, 1 h, 4 °C) in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter) and enriched mitochondria were collected from the 32–60% (w/v) interface.

Enriched mitochondria were lysed in a total volume of 34 ml buffer containing 25 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 15 mM MgOAc2, 2% (w/v) digitonin, 2 mM DTT and one tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail for 2 h at 4 °C and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was layered on a sucrose cushion in buffer of 1 M sucrose, 25 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 15 mM MgOAc2, 2% digitonin and 2 mM DTT, and centrifuged at 230,759g for 4 h at 4 °C in a Ti70 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 µl 25 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 15 mM MgOAc2, 2 mM DTT and 0.1% digitonin, and gel filtrated over a Superose 6 Increase 3.2/300 column (GE Healthcare). Fractions corresponding to the respiratory chain supercomplex were pooled and concentrated to 25 µl in a vivaspin 500 filter (100 kDa molecular weight cutoff). Atovaquone and ELQ-300 (in DMSO) were added in a 100-fold dilution to a final concentration of 10 µM before sample vitrification.

Next, 3 µl of sample (~0.2–0.5 mg ml−1) were applied to glow-discharged Quantifoil R2/2 Cu grids with a 2-nm-thin carbon support layer and vitrified by plunge-freezing into liquid ethane after blotting for 3 s. Cryo-EM was performed on a Titan Krios operated at 300 kV at a magnification of 165 kx (0.83 Å per pixel) with a K3 quantum camera (slit width 20 eV) at an exposure rate of 17 electrons pixel−1 s−1 with a 1.75 s exposure fractionated into 40 frames using EPU 1.12 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Initial rounds of 2D classification were performed to generate classes for reference-based particle picking, which was performed in RELION4, resulting in 2,658,324 picked particles. To address sample heterogeneity, the resulting classes of a subsequent 2D classification (cryoSPARC4.6) were manually grouped and subjected to ab initio model generation (cryoSPARC), which resulted in six different 3D references, corresponding to the T. gondii ATP synthase dimer and supercomplex, the C. sabaeus ATP synthase and I–III2–IV supercomplex, and mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, as well as an unidentified C7-symmetric complex (Supplementary Fig. 1d). These six maps were used as input to heterogeneous refinements, resulting in the particle distribution shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, with 432 k and 637 k particles for T. gondii and C. sabaeus, respectively. Subsequent masked refinements of the T. gondii supercomplex yielded maps of the CIII and CIV subcomplexes at 2.79 and 3.16 Å, respectively.

Data collection of the ELQ-300-inhibited T. gondii complex-III dataset was performed on a Titan Krios, as described above, resulting in 46,370 movies. Image processing was performed in cryoSPARC. Templates for particle picking were generated by initial rounds of 2D classification. 12,822,652 particles were picked and cleaned by 2D classification resulting in 4,451,128 particles. To reduce map anisotropy and increase interpretability, the number of top views was reduced, resulting in a final number of 2,056,878 particles. Non-uniform refinement resulted in a 1.9 Å structure which was improved to 1.83 Å by cryo-EM density modification in PHENIX 1.21 (ref. 57).

All final maps were generated from contrast transfer function (CTF)-refined particles. All resolution estimates are according to Fourier shell correlations (FSC) that were calculated from independently refined half-maps using the 0.143 criterion with correction for the effect of the applied masks (Extended Data Fig. 1).

An initial atomic model of the T. gondii III2–IV supercomplex was assembled by fitting the known conserved subunits, as predicted by AlphaFold2 (ref. 58) into the cryo-EM maps. Newly identified subunits were built de novo and identified by BLAST searches following manual modeling in Coot 0.96 (ref. 59). At the modeled N-terminus of the T. gondii Cyt-b, we identified cryo-EM density preceding residue Met10, which is consistent with a Phe9. While this observation is not explained by the mRNA sequence, it is consistent with the high-resolution cryo-EM map.

For atomic model building of the C. sabaeus CIII, a homology model of the murine CIII (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 7o37) was generated using the SWISS-MODEL webserver, followed by rebuilding and inhibitor fitting in Coot and structure refinement in PHENIX 1.19. Homology modeling of the P. falciparum QCR6 homolog was performed in SWISS-MODEL. For the mapping of Cyt-c binding sites, PDB 3CX5 (ref. 60) and 5IY5 (ref. 61) were fitted to the T. gondii complexes III2 and IV, respectively, to reveal cytochrome binding sites.

Prediction of membrane positions was performed using the OREMPRO webserver62. Structure-based multiple sequence alignment of QCR6 was performed in Chimera-1.14 (ref. 63). Images of the structures were generated with ChimeraX 1.6.1 (ref. 64).

For CIII subunits, TGGT1_214250, previously named apicomplexan-specific QCR11 (ref. 8), was reassigned as a homolog of conserved subunit QCR10 and thus renamed TgQCR10. The newly identified TGGT1_312940 was named TgQCR13 to avoid changing the already named TgQCR12. For CIV subunits, we followed a previously established ‘ApiCox' nomenclature11. However, structural similarity showed that previously named ApicCox23, 25, 35 and 14 correspond to conserved subunits Cox4, 6A, 6C and 7a, respectively. We also reassigned TGGT1_306670 as NDUFA4. Furthermore, we newly identified the conserved subunit Cox2c and Cox7c directly from the cryo-EM density. We also reassigned the previously detected subunit TGGT1_257160 as conserved Cox8a and, following the established nomenclature, novel clade-conserved subunits ApiCox22, 20, 5, 10 and 7.

Metrics details

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) phenomenon plays a vital role in multiple cell biology processes, providing a mechanism to concentrate biomolecules and promote cellular reactions locally. Despite its significance in biology, there is a lack of conventional techniques suitable for studying biphasic samples in their biologically relevant form. Here, we present a label-free and non-invasive approach to characterize biomolecular condensates termed LLPS REstricted DIFusion of INvisible speciEs (REDIFINE). Relying on diffusion NMR measurements, REDIFINE exploits the exchange dynamics between molecules in the condensed and dispersed phases to determine not only diffusion constants and the fractions in both phases but also the average radius of the condensed droplets and the exchange rate between the phases. Observing proteins, RNAs, water, as well as small molecules, and even assessing the concentrations of biomolecules in both phases, REDIFINE analysis allows a rapid biophysical characterization of multicomponent condensates which is important to understand their functional roles. In comparing multiple systems, REDIFINE reveals that folded RNA-binding proteins form smaller and more dynamic droplets compared to the disordered ones.

Cells organize complex biochemical reactions in space and time by forming compartments1,2,3. Besides the organelles enclosed by membranes, proteins and nucleic acids can phase separate into membraneless liquid-like compartments such as the prominent nucleolus, nuclear speckles, processing bodies, or stress granules4,5,6. These cellular structures, formed through the process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), have been described as coacervates7,8 and are optically resolvable as micron-sized structures. Given their involvement in RNA metabolism, many of these biomolecular condensates are enriched in proteins that contain RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and LLPS-prone intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)9,10,11.

Numerous RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) undergo LLPS under physiological conditions, either in the presence or absence of RNA. One of the examples of RBPs that recently attracted a lot of attention in the scientific community during the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (Nu), binds the RNA and engages in multivalent homo- and heterotypic interactions leading to LLPS12,13. It is hypothesized that its phase separation with RNA is essential for genome RNA packaging and the formation of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP)14,15. Another RBP protein, Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), can form condensates with RNA, driving the production of the compartments in the nucleus to promote gene silencing16,17. Moreover, LLPS is associated with several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, where stress may induce yet another RNA-binding protein FUS (FUsed in Sarcoma)18,19 to form granules that mature into solid aggregates. Disease-associated mutations accelerate this liquid-to-solid transition20. Besides FUS, a mammalian DEAD-box helicase (DDX4) can also undergo LLPS by itself (by self-association of the disordered N terminus)21, forming condensed droplets that can act as a molecular filter concentrating single-stranded DNA but excluding double-stranded DNA22. The domain schemes of these proteins are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Despite the evidence of the functional importance of phase-separation for these proteins, a wide spectrum of questions about the biophysical properties of these biomolecular condensates and their relation to (patho)physiology in biological systems remain unanswered23,24, due to a lack of suitable experimental procedures that are not invasive and that can probe the biomolecules in their relevant form25,26,27. Although multicolor labeling can provide a plethora of information about the condensates, the fluorescent tags often affect protein conformation and dynamics, which can influence their phase separation, introducing potential bias in the conclusions28,29,30,31,32,33,34.

In this work, we examined several biomolecular condensates (protein and protein-RNA complexes) using LLPS REDIFINE, an approach that utilizes the restricted diffusion of biomolecules inside the droplets and chemical exchange as an NMR lens to probe the physical properties of the condensates. Without the need for specific labels, we could comprehensively characterize the biomolecular condensates formed by wild-type FUS, DDX4, Nu, and PTBP1 proteins and correlate the extracted information to their biophysical characteristics.

For our first application of LLPS REDIFINE, we examined the biphasic sample of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the human FUS protein, which we studied earlier19. It comprises the low complexity QGSY-rich segment and the first arginine-glycine repeat (RGG1)19. FUS NTD domain is completely unstructured (Supplementary Fig. 1) and is considered to be essential for the phase separation of FUS protein35. FUS NTD droplets were stabilized in vitro using an agarose hydrogel, which allows prolonged spectroscopical analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2)19. Previously, we have shown that the large diffusion difference between FUS NTD in dilute and condensed phases can be used to quantify their respective populations19. However, the choice of longer diffusion times, Δ, could impair this quantification due to the presence of protein exchange between the two phases. With this in mind, we performed multiple diffusion measurements on FUS NTD biphasic sample stabilized in agarose, where we varied the gradient strength as well as the diffusion time Δ (Fig. 1a). As expected, the decay of protein signal is more pronounced at the longer diffusion times. Figure 1b illustrates that indeed, the population of the condensed phase that would be extrapolated from the plateau19 becomes lower with increasing Δ. Furthermore, when the signal decays are plotted as the logarithmic value of normalized signal with respect to the global diffusion parameter q2 as defined in the theoretical section of the Methods, the diffusion constants can be calculated directly from the slope of the resulting lines (Supplementary Note 1). We observed that the apparent diffusion constants of both the slow- and fast-diffusing proteins are also strongly influenced by the diffusion time Δ (Fig. 1b). This implies that these experimental decay curves cannot be simply explained by two independent protein populations and that only by taking into account exchange between the populations one could interpret these curves.

Following parameters are determined: Ddil = 8.0 ± 0.2 × 10−11 and Dcond = 8.9 ± 0.7 × 10−13 m2/s, νcond = 0.753 ± 0.002, Rdrop = 1.21 ± 0.03 μm, p = 0.405 ± 0.007 μm/s and kcd = 1.00 ± 0.03 s−1 is derived from Rdrop and p. d Spider chart summarizes the properties of FUS NTD condensate and represents its REDIFINE fingerprint. 10 ms gradient length was used in (a, b). The final value for minimization function \(\chi\) indicating the goodness of the fit is shown in (c). The uncertainties for each parameter are calculated using covariance matrix and report on the ambiguity of determined values. e FRAP experiment performed on FUS NTD spiked with 1% Atto488-labeled FUS NTD in 0.5% agarose. Scale bar is 5 μm. Data are presented as mean values +/− the standard deviation from the measurements on 4 different droplets. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We therefore introduced the model outlined in the theoretical section of the Methods and in Notes 2 and 3 of Supplementary Information to interpret these decay curves. Our model considers a population of protein \({\nu }_{{cond}}\) inside the condensed droplets and \({\nu }_{{dil}}\) in the dilute phase in equilibrium that can exchange between each other, given by \({\nu }_{{cond}}{k}_{{cd}}={\nu }_{{dil}}{k}_{{dc}}\) where \({k}_{{cd}}\) and \({k}_{{dc}}\) are the forward and reverse exchange rates, respectively. The average size of the droplets is described by the radius \({R}_{{drop}}\) and the protein inside experiences a restricted diffusion with the apparent diffusion constant \({D}_{{cond}}^{{app}}\) that is dependent on the droplet size, the gradient strength g, and diffusion time Δ (compared to the isotropic \({D}_{{dil}}\) in the pure dilute phase)36,37. The droplet-bulk interface is characterized by a permeability for a molecule to move between the phases, and it is defined as the permeability factor p. The exchange rate from condensed to dilute phase \({{{\rm{k}}}}_{{{\rm{cd}}}}\) is expressed as \({k}_{{cd}}=\frac{3p}{{R}_{{drop}}}\) where \(\frac{3}{{R}_{{drop}}}\) the surface-to-volume ratio of a sphere38. As the \({D}_{{cond}}^{{app}}\) is too slow to be measured by conventional NMR probes due to technical limitations, our method exploits the chemical exchange between the two phases to relay the information about slow restricted diffusion onto more easily observable NMR signals of the dilute phase. Hence the name LLPS REstricted DIFusion of INvisible speciEs (REDIFINE).

The framework of REDIFINE model is illustrated in Supplementary Note 2. We ran extensive simulations to show how various parameters including \({R}_{{drop}}\), permeability and \({\nu }_{{cond}}\) affect diffusion curves. Not surprisingly, the choice of diffusion time Δ influences the extent of the modulation in diffusion curves caused by different condensate parameters (Supplementary Note 2). Using REDIFINE simulation, we could fully reproduce the acquired data for FUS NTD. As the chemical exchange is not a priori known, our simulations also revealed that in order to unambiguously determine condensate parameters by REDIFINE, multiple experiments with several diffusion times Δ, are required (Supplementary Note 2). To test this, we subjected FUS NTD sample prepared in agarose to LLPS REDIFINE, integrating signals stemming from the aromatic protons of tyrosines (Fig. 1a), which were assigned based on their characteristic chemical shift. REDIFINE provided excellent global fitting to the curves (Fig. 1c). In just 2 h of experimental recording followed by REDIFINE fitting, key FUS LLPS properties could be determined including FUS diffusion constants in both phases (8.0 × 10−11 and 8.9 × 10−13 m2/s for the dilute and the condensed phases, respectively), the fraction of the protein in the droplets (νcond of 0.75 at 600 μM FUS NTD) and the droplets average radius (1.2 μm) as well as their permeability (0.4 μm/s) from which we can derive the exchange rate from condensed to dilute phase (kcd = 1 s−1). These parameters of the biphasic sample obtained with REDIFINE can be illustrated by the spider chart shown in Fig. 1d, which represents a fingerprint for FUS NTD LLPS. We can also define a global exchange rate that accounts for the partitioning between phases \({k}_{{ex}}={\nu }_{{cond}}{k}_{{cd}}={\nu }_{{dil}}{k}_{{dc}}\), which can be somewhat comparable to the rates obtained in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)39,40 experiments. This results in a \({k}_{{ex}}\) rate of 0.75 s−1, corresponding to a half-life time (\({t}_{1/2}\)) of 0.9 s according to the equation \({t}_{1/2}=\frac{{\mathrm{ln}}2}{{k}_{{ex}}}\). This result is very consistent with the FRAP data acquired on the FUS QGSY-rich region41 (recovery \({t}_{1/2} \sim 1{{\rm{s}}}\)) and yet with another unstructured protein, α-Synuclein42 (recovery \({t}_{1/2} \sim 3{{\rm{s}}}\)). LLPS REDIFINE droplet size is also in very good agreement with the values determined by a thorough analysis of fluorescent images taken for FUS NTD in agarose19, which further indicated that FUS NTD droplet size does not depend on initial protein concentration. We prepared two additional FUS NTD samples at a concentration of 200 μM and measured REDIFINE three times for each sample. Supplementary Note 4 summarizes these measurements and confirms very consistent fitting parameters throughout the technical and biological replicates.

As an independent control, we prepared a fresh sample of FUS NTD in 0.5% agarose and visualized it under the microscope (Supplementary Fig. 2a). FUS NTD droplets stabilized in agarose indeed have a very uniform size of circa 1 μm in radius, validating the REDIFINE methodology. To test droplet dynamics, we performed FRAP experiments by adding 1% FUS NTD which was labeled with Atto488 dye (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We chose the small dye Atto488 over a fusion protein to minimize the effect of the labeling on the phase separation of FUS NTD. Figure 1e shows the fluorescence recovery upon bleaching of the FUS NTD droplet, indicating liquid-like condensate properties. Due to the low bleaching efficiency of Atto488 dye, the full laser power was required to reach a significant reduction in fluorescence. The FRAP recovery that we obtained (9 ± 4 s−1) was slower than the REDIFINE exchange rate and the literature values. We attribute this discrepancy to the local heating effects caused by the high-power irradiation, as the bleached droplet slightly changed shape over time (Fig. 1e). This could also be a reason for the lower recovery levels that we achieved, as high irradiation power can cause degradation and/or enhanced oligomerization of FUS NTD.

Next, we extended REDIFINE to the full-length FUS, which, despite the presence of two folded RNA binding domains, is still mostly unstructured (with only 8.9 % of the sequence adopting a stable structure). Akin to FUS NTD, full-length FUS spontaneously forms droplets by itself. At a concentration of 200 μM, the large majority of full-length FUS is found inside the condensed phase based on an almost non-decaying signal in NMR diffusion experiment19 (Fig. 2a). Supplementary Fig. 3a shows the LLPS REDIFINE fitting for this FUS biphasic sample. From REDIFINE, we indeed found that 90% of the protein is inside the droplets (νcond = 0.9, translating to 1.6 mg of protein) and consequently very low population of FUS outside which is primarily why the diffusion constant of the protein in the dilute phase could not be accurately determined. Furthermore, in this biphasic condensate of FUS full-length, we could quite surprisingly spectroscopically observe a small population of slowly diffusing water with a shifted frequency implying different interactions in the condensed phase. This population corresponds to structured water43,44,45 found in the droplets, and as the water decay curve showed a complex biexponential shape (Fig. 2b), we could apply LLPS REDIFINE to the water signal as well. Supplementary Fig. 3b presents an excellent fit of the water LLPS REDIFINE data, confirming a droplet radius of around 1 μm consistent with the radius obtained independently using the FUS FL signal decay. REDIFINE revealed also that there is around 3% of water trapped in the droplets (accounting for a volume of 4 μl of water). Similar results are detected for FUS NTD, though with slightly lower water content in the droplets (Supplementary Note 5). Due to such a small population of water in the droplets, the uncertainty for the diffusion coefficient in the condensed phase is large, but still revealed that water is diffusing two to three orders of magnitude slower than in the dispersed phase and within the same range as the FUS protein. FUS condensate parameters of the protein and the water are summarized in Fig. 2c, d. As expected, they both report the same size, however the interface permeability for water is 3-fold larger than for the protein. Knowing the initial amounts of protein and water, and accounting for protein and water fractions in the condensed phase result in a FUS concentration of 6.8 mM in the droplets and correspondingly 20 μM in the dilute phase (340−fold less) as illustrated in Fig. 2d. Although these correspond to the concentrations of a macromolecule in a biphasic LLPS sample in equilibrium, our result is in agreement with previously reported concentrations for the FUS protein in a single condensed phase after physical separation of the two phases41.

Non-decaying signal implies a very high population of slow-diffusing FUS in the droplet. b Similarly, a series of 1D proton spectra showing the water signal from the same FUS sample. Note that based on different chemical shifts, there is a distinct population of bound water in the droplets. Water diffusion also exhibits biexponential behavior. c Summary of LLPS REDIFINE data set acquired on both protein and water signal, providing multicomponent characterization of FUS FL condensate. d LLPS REDIFINE allows us to “visualize” the FUS FL condensates, providing average droplet size, interface permeabilities, and concentrations in corresponding phases. Scale bar is 10 μm. e Fluorescent images acquired on FUS FL sample using different fluorescent tags. Analysis of droplet sizes could be performed in the case of GFP and mCherry tags, while the addition of 1% of Atto488-labeled protein causes aggregation. Scale bar is 5 μm. f FRAP recovery time course for GFP and mCherry tags. Data are presented as mean values +/− the standard deviation from the measurements on 4 different droplets. Experiments in (a) are acquired using 75 ms diffusion encoding time and 10 ms gradient length while in (b) for water 70 ms and 2 ms respectively. The uncertainties for each parameter in (c) are calculated using a covariance matrix and report on the ambiguity of determined values. The representative images are from three independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Again, to independently compare our measurements with other methods, we added 1% of Atto488 labeled protein to visualize condensates by fluorescent microscopy. This labeling unfortunately caused the whole sample of FUS FL protein to aggregate (Fig. 2e) possibly due to the presence of 15 lysine residues in FL protein where the dye can be potentially bound affecting the net charge and leading to cumulative effects of increased hydrophobic interactions. On the contrary, by spiking FUS FL with 1% GFP- and mCherry-tagged fusion protein, we could observe liquid-like FUS FL droplets. The size distribution analysis of the fluorescent images showed that the droplet radius average was very slightly below 1 μm with the mCherry droplets being smaller than the GFP-tagged ones. FRAP experiment showed similar recovery for both GFP- and mCherry-tagged protein (Fig. 2f) while the aggregated sample with Atto488 label never recovered. Akin to the FUS NTD, the FRAP recovery rates are by the same amount slower compared to REDIFINE chemical exchange. Impaired bleaching recovery correlated with an observation that FRAP rates closely depend on the size of the droplet that was bleached (Supplementary Fig. 4a) might be explained by the disproportionate partitioning of the tagged protein between the phases46. Faster FRAP recovery detected after partial bleaching of larger droplets compared to the small ones can be rationalized by the steep reduction in exchange efficiency when the fraction of protein in the dilute phase is below 10% (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). As the exchange process between phases depends on droplet size and populations in each phase, REDIFINE provides much more comprehensive analysis of the condensates than FRAP. In addition, the example of FUS FL further shows evidence that even a small amount of fluorescent tag can affect phase separation and even introduce bias in the fluorescent measurement raising the demand for the development of label-free methodologies.

Still puzzled by the difference between REDIFINE and FRAP, we analyzed another intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain from DDX4 protein (SSP = 0.052, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 5a). Diffusion constant in the condensed phase of around 7 × 10−13 m2/s that we determined with REDIFINE perfectly matched with the value obtained on a monophasic dense phase of DDX4 using very elegant NMR experiments that exploit methyl triple-quantum states for diffusion encoding47. Besides the protein-specific diffusion and population parameters, we could observe that the average droplet size (Rdrop = 1.05 μm) and global chemical exchange rate (kex = 0.61 s−1) of DDX4 condensates is very similar to FUS indicating a potentially common mechanism of condensate formation for unstructured proteins. On this sample, we also measured an independent NMR experiment that could be adapted to LLPS systems to measure directly the rate of chemical exchange between phases. Filter-Exchange NMR Spectroscopy (FEXSY)48,49,50 can filter out the signal stemming from the dilute phase and consequently measure the rate of signal recovery as a result of chemical exchange from the condensed phase. The fitting of FEXSY datasets confirmed the same exchange rate and protein fraction in the condensed phase as determined by LLPS REDIFINE (Supplementary Fig. 5b). To further test this, we compared REDIFINE and FEXSY on another biphasic sample of FUS FL incubated for two months at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). Again, the chemical exchange determined by REDIFINE and FEXSY closely matched. Note that due to its lower sensitivity, FEXSY experiments took 5-fold longer to acquire compared to LLPS REDIFINE but could not report on interface permeabilities, droplet size, and reliably on diffusion coefficients.

Besides previously discussed systems, many proteins can undergo LLPS only in the presence of binding molecules, forming bi- or multimolecular condensates3. A well-known example is the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein that binds negatively charged RNA, which in turn induces condensate formation. Nu readily phase-separates with substoichiometric quantities of structured viral RNA fragments such as the stem-loop-2 s2m RNA (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b)51. DOSY decay curves acquired on free Nu can be easily fitted to a single exponential decay indicative of a single dispersed phase (Supplementary Fig. 7a). With RNA present, phase separation occurs, and decay curves experience a steep decrease of the signal with no significant plateau compared to FUS samples. The data could not anymore be quantitatively explained by a single exponential function, however fitting with LLPS REDIFINE (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c), allowed delineating the exchange-averaged diffusion information about the Nu condensates. \({D}_{{cond}}\) is circa two orders of magnitude slower than \({D}_{{dil}}\), and around 27% of the protein resides in the droplets. The average exchange rate is determined to be 4.8 s−1 which is faster than for fully unstructured proteins, explaining the steeper diffusion decay at higher gradient strengths. The size of the droplets determined by REDIFINE is around 0.8 μm, which is confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Yet, using this complex, we could not detect the RNA and therefore could not probe the exchange and the diffusion of the RNA in the condensed phase.

As Nucleocapsid protein can promiscuously interact and form droplets even with short single-stranded RNAs, we then examined a Nu condensate bound to the 6-mer poly-A RNA (A6). Maximum turbidity is reached at 6 equivalents of this single-stranded RNA (Supplementary Figs. 6a, b and 8a). Unlike s2m, the NMR RNA signals are now detectable allowing us to apply LLPS REDIFINE to both the protein and RNA signals (Fig. 3a). This is equivalent to multicolor fluorescent labeling, however without any specific dye as every type of polymer possesses a distinct the NMR signature. Figure 3a illustrates the aliphatic peaks of the protein and aromatic resonances of the A6 RNA that we used for observing the decay and fitting with REDIFINE. Reassuringly, both protein and RNA (Supplementary Fig. 8b and Fig. 3b) data sets independently report the same average droplet size but more surprisingly we obtained a significantly different permeability for the interphase exchange. We could see that A6 RNA exchanges almost eight-fold faster than the Nucleocapsid protein, probably due to being smaller and in large excess. Although having a better fit (χ = 0.23 vs 0.70), the uncertainty of the RNA's \({D}_{{cond}}\) is large (Supplementary Fig. 8b) due to fast chemical exchange averaging. From the equal fractions of protein and RNA in the droplet (~0.3), it can be implied that the condensate contains 6 equivalents of A6 for one Nu protein in both phases, which is the ratio needed to reach maximum turbidity (Supplementary Fig. 6b).

a Nucleocapsid:A6 condensates prepared at 1:6 protein:RNA ratio. Both protein and RNA peaks are visible in NMR spectrum and are analyzed separately by LLPS REDIFINE. Spectra are acquired using 75 ms diffusion time and a gradient length of 10 ms for protein and 3.5 ms for RNA. b LLPS REDIFINE results obtained from both Nucleocapsid and RNA side. c Overlay of condensate properties obtained on condensates formed by Nucleocapsid protein and structured s2m RNA and by another structured protein, PTBP1 in the presence of 3 × UCUCU RNA. The uncertainties for each parameter are calculated using covariance matrix and report on the ambiguity of determined values. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In contrast to the Nucleocapsid that promiscuously binds the RNA, we also investigated the multidomain PTBP1 protein that forms a specific complex of high affinity with an RNA containing several UCUCU motifs. With 0.1 equivalent of 3 × UCUCU RNA (Supplementary Figs. 6a, b, and 8c), PTBP1 readily phase separates, and at room temperature, around 50% of PTBP1 is found in droplets (consistent with independent spectrophotometric measurements). Surprisingly, we found that PTBP1 is exchanging very quickly between the condensed and dilute phases (90 s−1, see Supplementary Fig. 8d). These rates are very high on the diffusion time-scale (tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and REDIFINE could not determine unambiguously the diffusion coefficients and the droplet size. However, at 278 K the droplets are still present in the sample and the \({k}_{{cd}}\) rate is significantly reduced (around three-fold) allowing REDIFINE to provide information about the droplet size and permeability as well as the diffusion of PTBP1 in the condensed phase (Supplementary Fig. 8e, and Fig. 3c). The observed reduction in the exchange is consistent with the Arrhenius temperature dependence of kinetic rates. For comparison, Nu:s2m results from Supplementary Fig. 7 are also presented in Fig. 3c, showing a very similar REDIFINE fingerprint to Nu:A6 condensate and even to PTBP1:3 × UCUCU in terms of diffusion constant, size, and fraction of proteins, despite being different in terms of droplet permeability and exchange. This suggests that RNA-induced condensates have similar droplet properties. Altogether, we showed here that LLPS REDIFINE allows the biophysical characterization of multicomponent biological condensates such as protein-RNA condensates (Supplementary Table 1), and the method could be easily extended to multiprotein or drug-protein condensates.

After examining more than 15 different condensate samples involving several different proteins and RNAs (Supplementary Table 1), we indeed observed an intriguing trend in the droplet properties among different systems. The condensates of unstructured proteins generally tend to form larger droplets and experience slower interphase exchange (i.e., FUS, DDX4). Proteins with structured domains that require the addition of RNA to phase separate exchange faster and usually form smaller droplets (i.e., Nu, PTBP1). This is illustrated in Fig. 4a by a 2D plot showing an inverse correlation between the condensed-to-dilute exchange rate and the droplet size. Interestingly, the FUS biphasic sample in the presence of RNA (green dot) contains droplets that are more dynamic and closer to the region defined by structured protein condensates which phase separated in the presence of RNA (Supplementary Fig. 9). The effect of protein structural properties on droplet dynamics may find its origin by the positive correlation between the global chemical exchange rate and the ratio between the protein secondary structure prediction factor (SSP) and the protein net charge Z (Fig. 4b). The fastest exchange is observed for PTBP1 that has the largest SSP/Z ratio while the fully unstructured FUS NTD and DDX4 LCD domains have the slowest rate and smallest SSP/Z ratio (Fig. 4b). A possible explanation for this relationship is proposed in Fig. 4c that highlights the smaller potential for multivalent interactions in structured RBPs compared to fully unstructured proteins to form condensates.

a A correlation plot of chemical exchange vs. the average radius of the droplets showing that disordered proteins make larger droplets that exchange slower to the dilute phase compared to RNA-binding structured proteins. The latter cover much broader space with much more heterogeneous interphase chemical exchange. Addition of RNA to one of the FUS samples shifted the position in the plot closer to RBPs suggesting that the RNA makes droplets more dynamic (green dot). b A plot of average global exchange rate determined by LLPS REDIFINE with respect to the ratio between protein secondary structure prediction factor SSP and protein net charge Z. An obvious correlation could be deduced. Values presented for FUS NTD, FUS and Nu condensates are the averages with standard deviation of the results from multiple (n > 3) different samples containing these proteins while for DDX4 and PTBP1 are the fitting uncertainties. c A potential explanation for such behavior. RBDs are mostly folded proteins that protect their hydrophobic parts with their fold and can engage in far less polyvalent binding interactions compared to IDPs. Therefore, IDPs have larger affinity to be in the condensed, interaction-reach phase. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The concept of restricted diffusion in biomolecular condensates occurs as a result of the droplets' interfacial tension52. Polyvalent interactions in the condensed phase prevent molecules from diffusing to the dilute phase, manifesting as complex diffusion. Interestingly, even dispersed molecular complexes experience restricted diffusion. Being in dynamic equilibrium with the complex, constituent molecules move in solution as they are constantly being dragged by these intermolecular interactions, which makes their diffusion coefficient a function of interaction affinity and kinetics. Diffusion NMR experiments are sensitive to detect this apparent restricted diffusion only when diffusion coefficients of free molecules and complex are significantly different and in an intermediate exchange regime (10−1000 ms). Fortuitously, this is often the case with protein-RNA complexes prone to phase separation, resulting in complex, exchange-averaged diffusion detectable by the NMR experiment.

Considering this, we extended our model with a multi-pool exchanging system in a dilute phase. This is illustrated in Fig. 5a; if the diffusion coefficient of the complex is significantly different from that of the free species, then REDIFINE could, in principle, determine the binding kinetic parameters such as the off-rate \({k}_{{off}}\) and the population of the complex. This can be used to further calculate the dissociation constant \({K}_{d}\) and the on-rate \({k}_{{on}}\) (“Methods”). We applied the methodology to soluble PTBP1 complex with one equivalent of 3 x UCUCU RNA (Fig. 5b). Using this extended model, we obtained a population for the complex of 0.945 ± 0.006 and a \({k}_{{off}}\) of 1.41 ± 0.02 s−1. Based on the previous experience with this system, we presumed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry and could determine a \({K}_{d}\) of 500 ±100 nM. This value is in very good agreement with the independent electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) performed for the same complex with a measured \({K}_{d}\) of 490 ± 20 nM (Fig. 5c). The additional advantage of our methodology is that it involves a single protein–RNA sample for an acquisition/processing time of only 2 h and importantly does not require titration.

a REDIFINE with dispersed complexes. If biomolecules coexist in solution in multiple exchanging states with different diffusion coefficient (protein/RNA and a complex), then PGSTE curve contains exchange averaged information of all the states present in solution. If exchange happens to be in intermediate regime, REDIFINE approach can be used to calculate \({K}_{d}\) and \({k}_{{on}}\) rate based on fitted \({k}_{{off}}\) and the complex population parameters. b Fitting of REDIFINE data for PTBP1 : 3 × UCUCU. \({K}_{d}\) of 500 ± 100 nM is determined. Values of the parameters are the average values of two independent measurements and two independent processing (different integration regions) with the standard error. c Native gel showing the 3 × UCUCU RNA shift upon binding to PTBP1 protein and ensuing fitting of the protein-RNA complex band formation. \({K}_{d}\) of 490 ± 20 nM is determined which is in agreement with the REDIFINE. The \({K}_{d}\) value is the mean of three independent EMSA experiments with standard error. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Here we presented a methodology that can be used to study liquid–liquid phase separation and complex biophysical systems in general. REDIFINE approach allowed us to gain detailed insights into the physical properties of biphasic condensates by examining them in vitro in their biologically relevant form. By determining diffusion coefficients in dilute and condensed phases co-existing in equilibrium, partition coefficients, average droplet size, surface permeability, and chemical exchange, REDIFINE provides a fingerprint for biomolecular condensates, akin to fluorescent microscopy LLPS assays, FRAP, and microrheology combined25, though acquired in a single NMR experiment and without requiring any specific detection labels. As NMR spectroscopy provides distinct molecular fingerprints, LLPS REDIFINE can be applied to any species present in the condensates, given that they are observable by NMR, i.e., in multicomponent condensates. Although we primarily focused on monitoring proteins (FUS, DDX4, PTBP1, and SARS-CoV-2 Nu), we could also observe the properties of RNA and water within the condensates. This multicomponent characterization, often not accessible by other techniques, can be extended to ions such as phosphate, chloride, and sodium53 that often influence phase separation behavior, but also multiprotein and drug-protein condensates.

Applying LLPS REDIFINE on various protein condensates, we observed an unexpected trend in droplet properties. We could see an inverse correlation between the droplet size and the chemical exchange between the condensed and dilute phases for our samples. This might be explained by the fact that smaller droplets have a larger surface-to-volume ratio promoting more efficient exchange processes54. Moreover, RBPs containing structured domains tend to form smaller and more dynamic droplets compared to mostly unstructured proteins. We hypothesize that this is due to the much smaller valency of structured RBP homotypic interactions compared to IDPs. This is also why structured proteins need an anionic RNA to significantly increase the polyvalency of interactions in order to enable phase separation, while IDPs can engage in interactions with other protein molecules and phase-separate on their own. Once in the droplets without tertiary structure protecting their hydrophobic or other interaction-prone groups, IDPs have a higher affinity to remain in the high-valency droplet environment compared to the dilute phase. This would explain consistently slower exchange rates among IDPs.

LLPS REDIFINE requires for NMR analysis only one sample of unlabeled biomolecules stabilized in agarose hydrogel. We performed an extensive analysis to show that the loose mesh of 0.5% agarose does not affect the structure and behavior of the large biomolecules of interest (Supplementary Note 6). A minimum of 100-150 μM protein in 130 μl sample volume is needed for analysis, although even lower protein concentrations can be used since NMR experiments can be acquired with more extensive signal-averaging. As the spectral resolution is not essential, LLPS REDIFINE is in theory also applicable at low-field benchtop machines with gradient capabilities.

Currently, LLPS REDIFINE is based on a model that considers droplets of uniform size. Consequently, it provides information about the average droplet radius that best fits the experimental data. Although agarose-mimicking cytoskeleton prevents droplet fusion, in general, the droplets in the biphasic sample are somewhat heterogeneous in size. Although not encountered in this study, very heterogeneous size distributions can affect the fitting. Principally, if the distribution shape is assumed (normal or log-normal) LLPS REDIFINE could provide also a standard deviation of the distribution besides the average radius55,56,57,58 and this is currently being investigated. It should be mentioned that very fast exchange could also constrain the applicability of REDIFINE, which is, in principle, limited to the kinetic processes occurring on a millisecond to second time scale. Other limitations are discussed in the Supplementary Information. Furthermore, while the model currently accounts only for the surface-to-volume ratio of the droplets, it is also possible to include different liquid droplet shapes, other than spheres. This could be ellipsoids and cylinders for example38, which could be applicable in the case of aggregated condensates and also for in cell (bacterial and eukaryotic) studies, which are currently being explored.

Biphasic condensates exhibit complex diffusion behavior that manifests as a deviation from mono-exponential trend and resembles the so-called kurtosis effect59 utilized traditionally in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This kurtosis effect, defined with a parameter K, represents a deviation from gaussian diffusion (Supplementary Note 7) and implies a physically-restricted molecular motion36. Diffusion kurtosis imaging of water has proven to be very sensitive to the tissue type and is conventionally used to assess structural abnormalities in the brain associated with neuropathologies. It is illustrated in Supplementary Note 7 that molecular diffusion in all biomolecular condensates experiences a kurtosis effect to a different extent. Following this link, we anticipate that REDIFINE methodology can be eventually utilized for in cell NMR microimaging60 to spatially characterize various membraneless assemblies.

Additionally, this methodology exhibits a broad range of applications, such as for soluble biomolecular complexes, as it can provide thermodynamic and kinetic information of protein-RNA binding in the intermediate to fast exchange regime. As the diffusion coefficient of a small molecule becomes significantly slower upon binding to a large biomolecule, we anticipate that our approach can be exploited in drug screening campaigns as ligand-observed experiments.

Altogether, LLPS REDIFINE provides a label-free approach to study droplet properties in a biphasic environment for protein-only condensates but also for homogenous multicomponent condensates composed of protein and RNA. Application to multiprotein and protein-drugs condensates is underway. Considering the importance of the surface of biological condensates for droplet maturation and reaction kinetics61,62,63,64,65, the exchange parameters obtained by LLPS REDIFINE will be crucial to understand the role of condensates in biology and disease.

Since the early development of the pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) technique by Stejskal and Tanner in 196566, diffusion measurement experiments have been extensively used in the field of NMR and MRI67,68,69. In the conventional diffusion experiment, a normalized signal of a studied analyte is mapped as a function of the gradient amplitude applied in the experiment. The application of gradients can impart a specific phase to molecules depending on their position in the NMR tube, and their translational diffusion will lead to the mixing of different phases, ultimately resulting in decay of the signal. The attenuation of the observable normalized signal depends on the experimental parameters and diffusion rates (Supplementary Note 1) and follows a simple mono-exponential decay66 according to the formula

where parameter \(b={\gamma }^{2}{g}^{2}{\delta }^{2}\cdot \Delta\) \({{\rm{\gamma }}}\) is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio, \(g\) and \(\delta\) the strength and duration of the gradient coming from the NMR probe, \(\Delta\) diffusion time, and finally \(D\) a diffusion coefficient. It is often sensible to write this equation as

where \(q=\gamma g\delta\) it excludes diffusion time and depends only on the pulse gradient parameters. The decay of the signal with respect to \(\Delta\) or \(\delta\) provides a quantitative measure of the displacements, and therefore, the diffusion rates of the nuclear spins along the applied gradient field can be calculated (Supplementary Note 1). Usually, \(\delta\) it is kept constant, but should be adjusted according to the molecular weight of the analyte. When this dependence is visualized on a semi-logarithmic plot as

Then, a slope of the line simply represents the diffusion coefficient (Supplementary Note 1).

Laying the foundations of LLPS REDIFINE (REstricted DIFusion of INvisible speciEs) methodology, the model considers a biphasic sample containing a relative population of protein νcond in condensed and νdil in dilute phase. For simplicity, we considered a mono-component condensate formed solely by one type of biomolecule (i.e., FUS condensates). Since the chance for hindered diffusion outside the droplets is very low due to the relative volumes of condensed and dilute phase, we consider free diffusion of biomolecules in the dilute phase described with the diffusion coefficient \({{{\rm{D}}}}_{{{\rm{dil}}}}\). Diffusion of molecules inside the condensed droplets is restricted by the interfacial tension caused by the very different interaction affinity within the two phases. Related NMR diffusion measurements were first applied in the 2000s to characterize emulsion systems based on restricted diffusion55,56,57,58. In biomolecular condensates, the polyvalent interactions inside the condensed phase prevent the molecules from diffusing freely to the dilute phase. This defines certain permeability38,70 of droplet interface described with permeability factor \({{\rm{p}}}\). Restricted diffusion will depend on the size of the droplets, and we assume perfect spherical geometry for the condensed droplets defined by the average radius \({{{\rm{R}}}}_{{{\rm{drop}}}}\). For the sake of simplicity, if we use \({{\rm{q}}}={{\rm{\gamma }}}{{\rm{g}}}{{\rm{\delta }}}\), the restricted diffusion36,37,38,70,71,72,73 can be expressed as:

For the fitting purposes, we propagated the summation up to the first 2000 terms.

To describe the chemical exchange between the condensed and dilute phase, we used the exchange rate \({{{\rm{k}}}}_{{{\rm{cd}}}}\) that is dependent on the droplet surface-to-volume ratio and interface permeability. As the surface-to-volume ratio for the spheres is equal \(\frac{3}{{R}_{{drop}}}\), then the chemical exchange rate38 is given by:

We can use the McConnell differential equations to describe the chemical exchange between the two phases. If the decay of magnetization \({{\rm{M}}}\) due to the gradients of PGSE experiment can be expressed in the differential form as:

Then the evolution of the biphasic system in exchange can be shown as:

where \({k}_{{dc}}=\frac{{\nu }_{{cond}}{k}_{{cd}}}{{\nu }_{{dil}}}\) and \({\nu }_{{cond}}+{\nu }_{{dil}}=1\) as the system is at equilibrium during rather short measurement time. We can also define a global chemical exchange as a rate more comparable with the rates obtainable by FRAP experiments.

The system of differential equations in Eq. (7). can be solved analytically, and the total magnetization at given time \({{t}}=\Delta\), and gradient strength and length \({{\rm{g}}}\) and \({{\rm{\delta }}}\), respectively, is given by:

Solution for \(S\left({q}^{2},\varDelta \right)\) has been used to fit the experimental data. There are 5 independent physical parameters that describe the model system: \({D}_{{dil}}\), \({D}_{{cond}}\), \({\nu }_{{cond}}\), \({R}_{{drop}}\), and average permeability \(p\). The diffusion decay curves for various \(\Delta\) have been fit globally at the same time. Fitting was performed using fminsearch, a nonlinear programming solver in MATLAB, that finds the minimum of multivariable function. The function to be minimized was defined according to the least squares regression as the Euclidian norm of the difference between the experimental data points and model predictions.

The uncertainties of fitted values were calculated using the covariance matrix of parameters. Covariance matrix reports on the correlations between all the parameters and therefore reflects on the ambiguities about their fitted values. In other words, large uncertainty reports that the parameter is not well correlated with the other parameters and therefore cannot be determined with certainty by the multiparametric fitting procedure. For example, this is the case with diffusion coefficient \({D}_{{cond}}\) in case of low population of the condensed phase (<0.2) or fast chemical exchange (>30 s−1).

The model to calculate binding affinity in soluble complexes considers a two-pool system with different isotropic diffusion coefficients (as in a dispersed sample) that can exchange with each other. There are 4 independent parameters that describe the model system: \({D}_{{dil\_free}}\), \({D}_{{dil\_complex}}\), \({\nu }_{{complex}}\), and \({k}_{{off}}\). Based on known initial concentrations of the reactants, the population in the bound state (\({\nu }_{{complex}}\)), and a priori determined binding stoichiometry, one can calculate the equilibrium concentrations of the species in a free state. Having all the equilibrium concentrations, a dissociation constant can be determined as

Based on the \({k}_{{off}}\) and \({K}_{d}\), one can also calculate the \({k}_{{on}}\) rate of complex association:

Full-length Nucleocapsid construct was cloned into a pESPRIT vector between the AatII and NotI cleavage sites with His6-tag and TEV protease cleavage sites at the N terminus (GenScript Biotech, The Netherlands). All Nucleocapsid protein constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) overnight at 18 °C after induction at an optical density of 0.6 with 0.6 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifuging at 3,750 x g and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1 M NaCl. The cells were lysed by cell cracking and the lysate centrifuged again at 17,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to standard Ni-NTA purification. Proteins were eluted with 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, and 300 mM imidazole. Samples were then dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C overnight. Following TEV cleavage and removal of the excess N-terminal tag and TEV by Ni-NTA affinity, samples were concentrated and exchanged to 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl (NMR buffer). For certain protein preparations, when purity was not satisfactory, it was additionally subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC; Superdex 75/200) into the NMR buffer.

The coding sequence of PTBP1 was cloned in pET28a (Novagen). All plasmids were sequenced and transformed into BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL cells (Agilent Technologies) for protein expression. Protein purification of PTBP1 was performed as described previously74. The NMR samples of PTBP1 were prepared in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 20 mM NaCl at pH 6.5.

Full-length FUS sequence was cloned into a pET24b vector by XhoI and BamHI restriction digestion and ligation that enables the translation of a TEV-cleavable GB1-His6-tagged protein. RNA-binding mutants were generated by classical site-directed mutagenesis. FUS protein constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) overnight at 20 °C after induction at an optical density of 0.6 with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g and were directly resuspended in Suspension Buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, protease inhibitors). Two times 12 min sonication on ice for 7 cycles with pulse-pause intervals at power level 70% was used to lyse the cells. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and the resulting cell pellet was homogenized on ice (15 mL, Dounce Homogenizer) in Buffer A (8 M urea, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl). The homogenized protein solution was centrifuged again at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to Ni-NTA purification. The Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column was equilibrated with Buffer A. After loading the filtered protein solution onto the column, the column was washed with 2 column volumes of Buffer A and 4 column volumes of Buffer A1 (1 M urea, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). Protein was eluted by Elution Buffer (1 M urea, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole). TEV protease and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol were added into the eluted protein solution followed by a dialysis in Buffer B (1 M urea, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 5 mM ME) overnight, prior to a second dialysis in Buffer C (6 M urea, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). A second Ni-NTA purification was performed by applying the protein solution on a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in Buffer C. Six column volumes of Buffer C were used for washing. The flow-through of protein solution and washes were collected together and concentrated via centrifugation using 15 mL Amicon UltraCentrifugal Filter Units (Millipore) with a molecular weight cut-off of 30 kDa. After dilution of high-concentration urea to form the droplet sample, the final buffer contained 5 mM phosphate and 5 mM HEPES at pH 7, 1 mM TCEP, 600 mM urea, and 15 mM NaCl.

N-terminus disordered domain of DDX4, DDX4(1−233), and FUS NTD low-complexity domains were expressed and purified as previously described19. The final buffer used in LLPS REDIFINE was 30 mM HEPES with 200 mM KCl at pH 7.5 with a residual urea concentration of 0.6 M. For reasons unrelated to the present study FUS NTD (600 μM sample in Fig. 1) was 15N/13C labeled.

S2m (5′-GGUUCACCGAGGCCACGCGGAGUACGAUCGAGUGUACAGUGAACC-3′), 3 × UCUCU (5′-GGGAGAUCUCUAAAAAUCUCUAAAAAUCUCUAAAAA-3′), and SL34 (5′-GGGAUCCGAUUUCCCCAAAUGUGGGAAACUCGACUGCAUAAUUUGUGGUAGUGGGGGACUGCGUUCGCGCUUUCCCCUG-3′) RNAs were produced by in vitro run-off transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (purified in-house) from two complementary DNA primers containing a T7 promoter or in the case of SL34 based on previously reported plasmids75. Magnesium concentration was optimized for in vitro transcription reactions with both commercially available unlabeled NTPs (Applichem). The RNAs were purified by anion exchange chromatography in denaturing conditions. The purified RNA was precipitated by butanol extraction to eliminate urea and salts. Lyophilized RNA was re-suspended in water or respective buffers. A6 RNA oligo was purchased from Dharmacon.

The turbidity (light scattering at 600 nm) of the samples was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, NanoDrop). For Nu, a defined volume of protein and RNA stock solutions was diluted in Nucleocapsid NMR buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl) to yield a 60 µM of protein and varying RNA concentrations in a total reaction volume of 20 µL. The RNA is added in the last step to initiate the phase separation, and the measurements are performed after 1 min of incubation in two technical replicates. In total, three biological replicates were acquired using the same procedure for Nu:s2m and two biological replicates (each with 2 technical replicates) for Nu:A6. A similar procedure was used for PTBP1 and SL34 (3 biological replicates) prepared at 100 µM protein concentration in PTBP1 buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 20 mM NaCl) in a total reaction volume of 10 µL. For measurements of FUS, 20 µM protein samples were prepared in FUS Turbidity Buffer (5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 100 mM KCl, 2 µM ZnCl2, 1 mM TCEP) and measured in three replicates with varying concentrations of RNA.

All biphasic samples examined in this study with LLPS REDIFINE method were prepared in 0.5% final mass concentration of agarose in order to stabilize liquid droplets as previously described19. For structured protein, low-melting agarose is used while for unstructured proteins we used a regular agarose. Corresponding protein buffers were first boiled with agarose powder to solubilize it, and then kept warm to remain liquid. Agarose buffers used to prepare FUS and DDX4 samples were still liquid at 55 °C, while the low-melting agarose buffer is in liquid state even at 36 °C. It is crucial to use low-melting agarose with folded proteins in order not to denature them by the addition of very hot agarose stock buffer. To form a biphasic sample stabilized by agarose hydrogel, protein (and RNA) stocks were mixed with respective warm agarose buffer in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf and quickly transferred to the NMR tube. Agarose gelation occurs shortly after transferring to the NMR tube, and the sample is ready for analysis. Note that the final samples of FUS and DDX4 also contain residual urea19.

FUS NTD (100 μΜ), full-length FUS (150 μΜ), Nucleocapsid:A6 (110:660 μΜ), and PTBP1:3 × UCUCU (150:15 μΜ) samples were prepared in 0.5% agarose hydrogel to ensure the same conditions as in REDIFINE experiments and imaged using bright-field microscopy. FUS NTD, FL FUS and Nucleocapsid protein were labeled post-translationally with Atto488 dye (Jena Bioscience) on primary amino groups as per the manufacturer's protocol. Unbound dye was removed from the labeled protein by overnight dialysis against fresh protein buffer. GFP- and mCherry-labeled FL FUS were expressed as fusion proteins and expressed as described above for FUS FL. S2m RNA was 3'end labeled with pCp-Cy5 (Jena Bioscience) using T4 RNA ligase (NEB). Enzymes and unbound dye were removed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Unlabeled FUS NTD and FUS FL were spiked 100:1 with Atto488 and GFP/mCherry-labeled protein. Unlabeled Nucleocapsid and s2m RNA were spiked 20:1 with Atto488 Nucleocapsid or Cy5-s2m, respectively. All samples except for Nucleocapsid:s2m were prepared in corresponding buffers containing 0.5% agarose. FUS NTD, FUS FL, Nucleocapsid:s2m and PTBP1:3xUCUCU samples were imaged on a Nikon Spinning Disk SoRa microscope using a 100 × 1.45 CFI Plan Apo Oil objective, while Nucleocapsid:A6 image was acquired using a Sony α6400 APS-C DSLM camera body mounted to an Olympus CKX41 inverted microscope with a 40× objective. FRAP experiments were performed using a standard procedure76. Ensuing recovery rates are reported as a multiple droplets average (>4) with standard deviation.

Purified RNA 3 × UCUCU (10 pmol) was first 5'-end dephosphorylated by 5 units of Antarctic phosphatase (NEB, 5 U/µL) in Antarctic phosphatase buffer (NEB, 50 mM Bis-Tris-Propane-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2) in a total reaction volume of 10 µL. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the enzyme was heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 2 min Dephosphorylated RNA (1.8 pmol) was then 5′-end labeled with 2 pmol of ATP [γ32P] (10 uCi/uL, 5000 Ci/mmol, Hartmann Analytic GmbH) using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, 10 U/µL) in T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (NEB, 70 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT) in a total reaction volume of 10 µL. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then the enzyme was heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. The labeled RNA was purified using an Illustra MicroSpin G-25 column (GE Healthcare) and diluted to 7.2 fmol/µL. Different protein-RNA samples containing 7.2 fmol 3 × UCUCU and an increasing amount of PTBP1 full-length (final concentration from 0 to 1.5 µM) were prepared in D buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT). The RNA-protein complexes were run on a native 10% TBE gel in TBE running buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) at 100 V for 1 h. The gel was soaked in fixing solution 1 (10% acetic acid, 20% methanol, 5% glycerol) for 15 min and in fixing solution 2 (20% methanol, 5% glycerol) for another 15 min. The gel was subsequently dried using a drying device (Hoefer Slab Gel Dryer GD2000) at 80 °C under vacuum for 1 h. The gel was screened overnight in a phosphor cassette and imaged using Typhoon FLA 9000 (GE Healthcare).

All NMR experiments were recorded with a 3-mm NMR sample tube at 298 K (unless otherwise specified) on 600 MHz and 700 MHz Avance NEO spectrometers equipped with TCI cryo-probes and on a 500 MHz Avance NEO with QCI cryo-probe. In total 700 MHz cryoprobe was equipped with xyz-gradient system, while the 500 and 600 MHz probes had only z-axis gradients. All experiments were run and processed using TopSpin 4 software (Bruker).

LLPS REDIFINE data sets were measured using a conventional 2D Stimulated-Echo experiment using bipolar gradients (stebpgp1s19) to which a pseudo 3rd dimension was added to vary the diffusion encoding time (Supplementary Note 3). Watergate3919 was used as a preferred water suppression scheme. Alternatively, we also tested the LED experiment using bipolar gradients (ledbpgppr2s) and water suppression using presaturation, and, besides lower signal-to-noise (SNR), the same LLPS REDIFINE results were obtained. LLPS REDIFINE of the water molecule in the FUS condensate (Fig. 2) was acquired without water presaturation using ledbpgp2s pulse sequence.

All diffusion experiments were run in 16 increments of gradient strength (g), ranging from 2 to 95%. On Bruker spectrometers, this is defined in percentage of the maximum gradient amplitude of the system, and it is specific for each NMR probe. Typically, most probes can deliver a maximum output of around 53.5 G/cm at 100% gradient amplitude. LLPS REDIFINE needs to contain at least 16 gradient amplitude points defining the diffusion decay for a good fitting. 16−32 scans of signal averaging to acquire sufficient SNR per every gradient strength were required on our NMR systems, and condensate samples were prepared at 100−150 µM protein concentration (except FUS NTD at 600 µM). Depending on the protein/RNA size, diffusion gradient length (δ) can range from 2 to 10 ms. In this study, we used δ of 9 or 10 ms for the protein detection, 3.5 ms for the A6 RNA, and 2 ms for water, and always smoothed rectangular-shaped gradients SMSQ10.100. All experiments were run using an AU program “dosy” available in the TopSpin that also calculates the gradient ramp and feeds it to the spectrometer.

It is described that the LLPS REDIFINE data set contains multiple diffusion curves acquired for different diffusion encoding times. To provide the most accurate multiparametric fitting, a minimum of six diffusion curves have to be acquired spanning as wide as possible diffusion encoding time. The maximum diffusion time that can be applied is constrained by the longitudinal T1 relaxation of the target molecule, leading to the signal decay, and for RBDs it is around 700 ms, while for unstructured proteins it can be up to 1000 ms. In case of slow chemical exchange, long diffusion times are absolutely crucial to resolve the fitting parameters. As chemical exchange is not a priori known, acquisition of sufficient diffusion curves spanning the region between the short and the maximum diffusion time is acquired for precise parameter determination by LLPS REDIFINE. In this work, we acquired from 6 to 11 curves in total that were used for fitting. The reason for acquiring fewer diffusion decay curves can be the need to acquire the data faster due to the instability of the sample and/or limited experimental time. Also, samples containing similar fractions of protein in the condensed phase and dilute phase can be characterized well with only 6 curves, while more curves are required otherwise. Further aspects of the REDIFINE methodology, including prospects and limitations, are discussed in Note 8 of the Supplementary Information.

Another parameter worth mentioning is the d1 recovery delay that we used between 1.5 and 5 s. To acquire the full LLPS REDIFINE data set, the course depends on all aforementioned parameters, but in this study, it usually took 1−2 h.

The presented differential equations defining the model behind LLPS REDIFINE are incorporated within a home-written MATLAB code. Differential equations are first solved and their analytical solution is used for all the simulations (Supplementary Note 2) and all the fitting. The experimental data were first processed in TopSpin (Fourier transformation, apodization, baseline correction) and then fed to the MATLAB code, which used the least squares regression to minimize the difference between the experimental data and the analytical model function. Five independent parameters were fit: Ddil, Dcond, νcond, average Rdrop, and p, while kcd is derived as explained in Eq. (5). Because of using analytical solutions for the differential equations presented in Eq. (7), the multiparametric fitting procedure was very fast and lasted only a couple of seconds on a regular laptop. The uncertainties of fitted values were calculated using the covariance matrix of parameters. The code containing the model functions and fitting procedures is provided as Source data.

as i waited to meet with Jay Graber, the CEO of Bluesky, on the 25th floor of an office building in downtown Seattle, I stared out at the city's waterfront and thought: God fucking damn it. Stretching in every direction was a wall of dense, gray, tragically boring fog. And here I was about to interview the head of a social platform named after good weather. On camera, no less.

Then something miraculous happened. Moments before Graber showed up, the haze lifted. Elliott Bay glittered in the sun. I could see past Bainbridge Island's rolling hills all the way to a snow-capped peak, and the skies were, yup, completely and totally blue.

Graber's tenure at Bluesky has had this felicitous quality, starting with her given name, Lantian, which—in a triumph for the nominative determinism crowd—means “blue sky” in Mandarin. (That the name she's gone by for years, Jay, can also mean a winged creature that takes to the skies adds to the serendipity.) When Graber joined Bluesky in 2019, it was an experiment within Twitter. The idea was to spin off a social platform that would give users more control. That happened when Bluesky launched as an invite-only service in 2023, and by the time it opened up to the general public a year later, Twitter had become the right-wing echo chamber known as X. Bluesky swiftly became a refuge for a coalition of leftists, liberals, and never-Trumpers.

The 34-year-old chief executive cuts a different figure than most social media bosses. Earlier this year, after Mark Zuckerberg wore a shirt winking at his king-like status at Meta, Graber donned a near-identical top that instead called for a world without kings. The sartorial rebuttal was good press (and Bluesky ended up making major dough selling the shirt), but it also reflects her idea that this project ultimately cannot be controlled by a single leader.

Indeed, Graber, a former software engineer, seems most energized when she's talking about the unique infrastructure for her kingless world. Undergirding Bluesky as well as several smaller apps is the Atmosphere, or AT Protocol, which is a rule book that servers use to communicate. The open source protocol allows sovereign digital spaces to integrate with one another as needed. Two apps with complementary ideas about moderation or ads can work in tandem—or not. It's up to them.

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

Graber sees Atmosphere as nothing less than the democratized future of the social internet, and she emphasizes to me that developers are actively building new projects with it. In her dreams, these projects are as big, if not bigger, than Bluesky. Her ambitions might not be kingly, in other words, but they are lofty. For now, call Graber an insurgent go-getter—on whom the sun still shines.

When we talked a few months ago, Bluesky had surpassed 25 million users. Where are you today?

34.6 million users.

What's your day-to-day like right now?

A lot of hiring. We're getting ready to make this a larger social experience for more people, both within the Bluesky app and outside it.

How many people have you hired?

In November, during our growth spurt, we were around 20. Now we're at 25, and we'll probably pass 30 soon. We're growing at a pace that's sustainable to us.

What milestones are you hoping to hit by the end of 2025?

Some of the features we've been talking about for a long time, like communities and verification, we're really excited about. Verification is the most fleshed-out. We're doing it in stages. [Days after we spoke, Bluesky rolled out tools to help users authenticate their identity and discourage impersonators.]

Tell me about the communities feature.

A lot of people don't realize that Bluesky is a bit like Reddit and Twitter at the same time, because you can build feeds that are essentially communities—the science feed is run by scientists, is moderated by scientists, and has its own rules. But right now you have to go outside the app to do it. Third-party services, like SkyFeed or Graze, let you create feeds.

So you can create and monitor many feeds in one interface, but it's a separate app. Are you building this capability into Bluesky itself?

We've talked to people who are running these feeds, and they would like better tooling for making these into communities within the Bluesky app. So that's the big idea: making it easier to create and run a custom feed.

Any timeline for when that's coming?

The end of the year.

Let's back up. How did you end up starting a decentralized social platform?

In college, I had this major—science, technology, and society—that was very interdisciplinary. I studied virtual currencies and thought that they were going to be disruptive, so I was interested in getting involved in that. I worked on Zcash, a cryptocurrency that combined decentralized technology with privacy technology. I like seeing a new technology emerging, and asking, What can you do with this? After a few years, I realized you could build better social networks that weren't on a blockchain but use some of those components. I started researching and building decentralized social stuff. Then, when Jack Dorsey announced in 2019 that Twitter was working on a decentralized protocol, I was already considered an expert in the space.

I always thought Bluesky started as a skunkworks within Twitter.

It was a skunkworks but with outside contributors. I was a contractor. I wanted independence, because old Twitter moved slowly. Jack Dorsey was our biggest champion, but then Elon Musk said that he was going to buy Twitter, and that threw off everything—no new projects were going to get shipped, especially not something as ambitious as Bluesky. That's when we started thinking that we should experiment with building our own app.

You mentioned your crypto background. Bluesky's largest investor is a venture capital firm that specializes in crypto. Does Bluesky have more in common with a crypto startup than one might think?

Well, the term Web3 got very associated with cryptocurrency, so it's not a good word to use for what we're doing. But if you think about Web3 as evolving the social Web 2.0, that kind of is what we're doing. We're evolving social media that was based in centralized companies into something that is open and distributed. That was a goal underlying the Web3 movement—we just didn't build on that technical foundation of a blockchain. You can achieve a lot of the same things using open web principles and more Web 1.0 kinds of technology. Our identity system lets you use a domain name as your username, so you can have wired.com in your username. That's just a web 1.0 technology brought into the social media sphere. I think our investors saw that vision, and they're excited about building out the broader developer ecosystem. We want investors who care about seeing this entire world of social media come to life, not just Bluesky.

Bluesky users can now post videos. A lot of people already consider Bluesky an X competitor. Are you gunning for TikTok too?

We're built on an open protocol, and other apps are starting to fill in these open spaces. An app called Skylight is more of a straight TikTok alternative. It lets you post short-form videos, and you can edit them in the app. Bluesky has videos, but it's more secondary. The great thing about an open protocol is that you can move from Bluesky over to Skylight and keep your followers. So they go with you across applications.

How does that work?

Say you download Skylight from the app store—you can log in with your Bluesky username, if you want. Then you have the same followers, and the photos or videos that you post to Skylight can also show up in Bluesky and vice versa.

Did the Bluesky team have anything to do with the development of Skylight, or is it totally separate?

Totally separate.

What are your relationships like with the people developing other apps on the protocol?

There was recently the Atmosphere Conference, and we met a lot of folks there building apps we didn't know about. There are private messengers, new moderation tools. The benefit to developers of an open ecosystem is that you don't have to start from zero each time. You have 34.6 million users to tap into.

When you're talking about this new ecosystem of applications, is the idea that you're the CEO of all of this, or just Bluesky?

I am just the CEO of Bluesky Social. We have built out the protocol, and we maintain the Bluesky app, but the protocol is going to take on a life of its own. Pieces of it are going to be standardized, pieces of it are going to be stewarded by the community, and it's going to evolve in different directions as new people shape it.

“Nobody is fully grasping that this is potentially the last social identity you have to create.”

If one of these apps were to blow up and surpass Bluesky, would it help or hurt your business?

It would help us—because these are shared backends, if you recall.

Let's say that the video app, Skylight, goes megaviral. How does that shared backend become relevant?

That means you can view all those videos on Bluesky too. It'd probably change the way that people interact on Bluesky, because all this content would be coming in from another application. Also, one of the pathways to monetization we've mentioned is developer services.

How do you plan to make money?

Subscriptions are coming soon. The next steps are to look into what market­places can span these different applications. Other apps in the ecosystem are experimenting with sponsored posts and things like that. I think ads eventually, in some form, work their way in, but we're not going to do ads the way traditional social apps did. We'll let people experiment and see what comes out of it.

There's been an influx of big creators onto Bluesky, but there's no direct way for them to monetize their work yet. Are you going to change that?

We're giving them great traffic—and that can convert to money. One big thing is we don't downrank links, so if you are a YouTube creator or you have a Patreon and you post those links on Bluesky, you're getting higher link traffic, even with a smaller follower count. This is true of small creators and even news organizations. We've heard from large news organizations that Bluesky has better click-throughs and better subscription rates. [WIRED can vouch for this: The platform has become a top traffic driver and source of new subscribers.]

Democratic Party stars like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have also joined Bluesky. Are you doing anything to court celebrities and influencers?

We're doing some community outreach. We're seeing a lot of growth in sectors with maybe not as big celebrities but a lot of traction, like sports media. The sports reporter Mina Kimes came on and created a starter pack, which got a lot of followers very quickly. We have game devs, we have sports, we have science.

Would you welcome President Trump?

Yeah—Bluesky's for everyone, and we think that over time, the broader public conversation needs to be on an open protocol. That lets people choose their own moderation preferences. We think that it's flexible enough to serve every use case and everyone.

We're in this moment when free speech is under threat. How do you think about that?

I think building on an open protocol is the most enduring foundation for speech. We're creating a digital commons of user data where you get to control your identity and your data. We're building infrastructure that I hope stays around for a long time. Bluesky, the app, is just one site where speech can happen.

This is like the web itself. Early on, we had AOL, and accessing the internet happened through AOL. If the AOL web portal wasn't showing you something, it would be a lot harder to find. Then more browsers came along, and these linked you out to the broader internet. Now anyone can put up a blog and host their own views online. There's larger websites if you want, Substack or Medium, but you can also self-host. This is the kind of ecosystem we're building, where anyone can self-host. And then the question of “freedom of speech, not reach” is made very tangible. The Mediums of the world get to choose their moderation rules, but if individuals are unhappy with that, they can start a new site or host their own blog.

What does “freedom of speech, not freedom of reach” mean to you?

Early on, we basically embedded freedom of speech into the protocol. Anyone can do the equivalent of standing up a new blog. Then sites like Bluesky get to decide how to prioritize reach.

And “reach” here means how Bluesky spreads—or doesn't spread—your posts. So people can say what they want, but they have to live with how Bluesky moderates their words?

If you want to change the rules, you can build your own thing or find another space that serves you. Within the parameters of Bluesky, we're setting the rules.

With your interest in decentralized spaces, I'm curious what you think about decentralized or “network” states, which are, in theory, startup countries—a bunch of like-minded people who met online and bought up land together, for example. Are you following the network state movement?

We'll have a lot of trial and error to develop good governance in the digital sphere, so maybe much farther down the road that might translate into the real world. In part I see what we're doing as building civic infrastructure in digital form. Social media is how we get our news, it's how we get informed, and if you can make control of that democratic, pluralistic, and open, I think that will translate down the road to more democratic social structures.

How do you balance wanting to provide civic infrastructure with being the CEO of a for-profit company?

We're running a lot of infrastructure that serves other apps in the network, and I think that is very financially valuable long-term. Early in the history of the web, you had these internet protocols that didn't have monetization baked in, but it meant anyone could spin up a website. Then the people who built the search engines and browsers to access the new web were ultimately very big companies.

Are you still working toward any ambitions from when you started in 2019—or are there any that now seem impossible?

Yes. Right now, Bluesky feels like Twitter, Flashes like Instagram, Skylight like TikTok. But you can build or combine things in totally new ways, or build social experiences that aren't necessarily large mainstream social apps. Those kinds of experiences are what I'm excited to see unleashed. The long-term vision is not just for a new form of social apps but a new layer for the web—what Web3 aspired to be, without the blockchain.

I'm having a flashback to a conversation I had a decade ago. The Internet Archive's founder, Brewster Kahle, talked about reinventing the web in a similar way.

I got my first open-source crypto job, at Zcash, through the Internet Archive's Decentralized Web summit. That was one of the places where I got my first insight into all the folks building things in the decentralized web space.

I wrote about the Internet Archive's legal struggles last year. Some groups in the book world fiercely support its digital lending; others fiercely oppose it. I see a similar tension brewing among Bluesky power users. Some people want the app to be more active in content moderation, but that seems to clash with the principles of decentralization, where ideally no one body can ban or block people. Do you see this as a problem for Bluesky?

There are always going to be conflicts when one person's idea of a good time online conflicts with somebody else's. People have different ideas about safety. Every space needs some moderation. The goal of building an open ecosystem is to support the coexistence of people with different points of view. They don't all have to be in the same room, abiding by the same rules. Maybe they can be in adjacent rooms, or maybe it's like two hotel buildings that are linked.

At the end of the day, we set some parameters of what we think acceptable behavior is on Bluesky, and if you disagree with those you can branch off and build another application adjacent to it.

What is your relationship with Jack Dorsey like now?

Jack isn't involved anymore. He had a portfolio approach to decentralized technologies, and early on he helped several projects get off the ground. He funded another distributed protocol that I think today he probably prefers, Nostr, which shares many architectural similarities to Bluesky, but it works more like a cryptocurrency wallet. You need keys. You have to be a bit more sophisticated as a user.

What's your pitch for why people should join Bluesky?

It's a great time to shape the culture and the future of Bluesky. The people who have created starter packs, created feeds, and gotten involved in the community have seen a lot of growth—even if they previously weren't big posters elsewhere. For creators, nobody is fully grasping that this is potentially the last social identity you have to create. Signing up now isn't just committing to yet another micro-blogging app, it's committing to a new era of social, to having a sort of digital passport that moves with you.

Is there anything else you want people to know about Bluesky?

This is a choose-your-own-adventure game. You can get in there and customize the experience as much as you want. If you're not finding what you want within the Bluesky app, there might be another app within the protocol ecosystem that will give you what you want. If you can't find it, you can build it. You don't get this level of control anywhere else.

For the last hour, in a backroom of a gun range in Arabi, Louisiana, I've been building Luigi Mangione's gun. Well, not his, in the literal sense. The not-quite-finished firearm in my hands is very much mine: I was the one who pushed “print” on a 3D printer the prior evening and then, this morning, pulled the gun's finished frame out of that mini-fridge-sized appliance. And I'm the one now struggling with the trickier task of attaching to that precisely contoured chunk of matte-black plastic all the metal and polymer components that will make it a fully functioning, semi-automatic pistol.

This weapon I'm constructing is, however, intended to be an exact clone of the partially 3D-printed gun that Mangione allegedly used to kill UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City in December, down to the stippling on the weapon's plastic grip. I've come to this makeshift workshop on the outskirts of New Orleans with the goal of printing, assembling, and test-firing that very same model of handgun, complete with the 3D-printed silencer Mangione allegedly screwed to its muzzle.

The intention of this experiment is to see for myself just how far 3D-printed guns have come. I want to know if it's true that the apparent murder weapon in the most high-profile assassination in recent memory can, in 2025, be made in the privacy of a garage by essentially anyone, without facing any gun control whatsoever or even breaking any laws.

The 3D printing, it turns out, was the easy part. Now I'm in the midst of the finicky process—something like assembling a very small piece of Ikea furniture—of building onto my homemade handgun frame the rest of a gun's components, all ordered off the internet. This includes everything from the trigger assembly to the slide and barrel that ride on top of the Glock-style pistol's plastic-printed body.

My guide on this journey, given that I have very little idea what I'm doing, is a 3D-printed-gun aficionado and YouTuber who calls himself Print Shoot Repeat, or PSR. He's sitting to my right—dressed in a black hoodie along with the trademark black mask and mirror goggles that he wears to protect his identity—patiently offering instructions as I fumble with small parts.

As I approach the final step in the gun's assembly, he shows me how to pull its trigger so that the slide can fit onto metal rails I've slotted into my printed frame. Then PSR watches as I struggle to pull that top half of the firearm into position. Suddenly, the slide seems to stop resisting and slips into place.

“Yep, now pull it back as hard as you can,” PSR tells me through his mask. I yank back on the chunk of metal, exposing the empty chamber that will soon be filled by a 9-millimeter round. “Now let it go.”

The spring-loaded slide snaps forward with a loud click. Only then do I notice that all the people in the room—the video crew filming all of this and the gun range employees who have become curious about our experiment—are standing up to watch the somewhat unnerving moment when a new DIY firearm comes into being.

“Alright. Now we've got a gun,” PSR says. “Just make sure you don't point it at anyone.”

As strange as this experience may have been, it felt familiar. That's because, 10 years ago, I had done it all before.

In 2015, in a quiet backroom of WIRED's San Francisco office, I made an AR-15 “ghost gun”—a fully functioning semi-automatic rifle. Just like the Glock-style handgun I would construct in Louisiana a decade later, that rifle was a “ghost gun” in the sense that it had no serial number and was built entirely in private, without any background check, without showing anyone ID, and without making any government agency aware of its existence.

Ghost guns take advantage of a kind of loophole in US federal gun control laws: Only the central component of a firearm onto which all its other components are attached—known as the lower receiver for an AR-15 or the frame for a Glock-style handgun—is regulated as the gun. Make that one piece yourself at home, and you can buy the rest online in a few clicks, putting weapon components like barrels, slides, and triggers into your shopping cart without facing the slightest regulatory speed bump.

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

To test just how easy it was to build a ghost gun back in 2015, I made the lower receiver of an AR-15 three different ways: I 3D-printed it out of plastic; used a computer-controlled milling machine to carve one out of aluminum (or more accurately, to finish carving it, since I started with an 80 percent finished lower receiver, or “80 percent lower,” designed to almost—but not quite—meet the legal definition of that part); and even tried the more old-school technique of drilling out the same aluminum 80 percent lower with a manual drill press.

I was somewhat surprised at the time when a gunsmith I showed all three parts to warned me that my 3D-printed lower receiver wouldn't be safe to build a rifle out of. He told me to instead stick with the milled aluminum one—which worked perfectly.

Flash forward to last December, however, and now it seemed a homemade plastic frame had been used in a carefully premeditated murder. When police arrested then 26-year-old Luigi Mangione in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald's five days after he allegedly gunned down Brian Thompson, evidence photos of the gun found in his backpack showed a partially 3D-printed handgun with a printed silencer wrapped in hockey tape. I spoke to digital gunsmiths in the days after that revelation, and they identified the alleged murder weapon specifically as a variation on a printable, Glock-style frame known as the FMDA 19.2—an acronym for the libertarian slogan “Free men don't ask”—released online by a gun-printing group called the Gatalog.

I hadn't covered 3D-printed guns for years. But now that one had allegedly been used in Brian Thompson's killing, I wanted to know: How far had the technology come over the past decade? And after 10 years of controversy surrounding these anarchic, lethal weapons, had American gun laws finally caught up with ghost guns?

I decided to find out by making a ghost gun of my own—again. And as soon as I began this quest, it became immediately apparent that the answer to the second of those questions was a resounding no. Creating a ghost gun with a 3D printer in America today is not only easier and more practical than ever—in most of the US, it also remains entirely legal.

In the decade since I built my first ghost gun, several states have passed laws that would now make that experiment a felony. In New York, it's now illegal to make a gun without a serial number. In New Jersey, even sharing printable gun files is forbidden. In California, where I made my AR-15, it's now against the law to so much as sell a 3D printer ""used solely or primarily for manufacturing firearms.”

Yet at the federal level, the legal regime around ghost guns remains far patchier. In 2022, the Biden-era Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) did ban “kits” designed to let anyone quickly make a ghost gun from the kind of 80 percent completed part I used in 2015. Gun advocates fought back, but the case was finally settled in March with a United States Supreme Court decision upholding the ban.

Despite that years-long legal battle, the ATF's ban always applied only to components “readily convertible” into a gun. It says nothing about 3D-printed ghost gun frames fabricated out of thin air and spools of plastic filament.

All of that meant that the only real legal hurdle to my experiment in 3D printing a Glock-style ghost gun was a flight from New York to New Orleans, where a gun range on the east edge of the city had agreed to host me and my WIRED video colleagues as we built and test-fired the weapon. James Reeves, the owner of that range as well as a lawyer and gun-focused YouTuber, assured me that it would all be fully above board, so long as I was only making my ghost gun for my own use and not selling it or transferring it to anyone else. “It's a free country down here in the great state of Louisiana,” Reeves said.

In fact, by removing an even easier way to circumvent gun control laws, the Supreme Court ruling on ghost gun kits may have only made 3D-printed guns more appealing, says Nick Suplina, a former prosecutor who now works as a gun control advocate at the nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety. Between 2016 and 2022, 70,000 ghost guns were found at crime scenes, according to the ATF, many of them likely made from kits. Now that the kits have been banned, Suplina says, 3D printing may be the next best thing for those seeking to build a firearm without encountering any gun control laws.

“You now have this huge marketplace of people who really want untraceable, unserialized firearms with no questions asked,” Suplina says. “They're going to turn to 3D-printed guns and those that can supply them. 3D-printed guns are about to have their moment.”

By the time I got to Reeves' gun range in Arabi, almost every component of my ghost gun was already there, thanks to the magic of ecommerce. The cost of the entire shopping spree totaled just $1,144.67 plus shipping—$200 for the slide, $35 for the barrel, $21 for the components of the trigger mechanism, and just $650 for a printer. For comparison, the 3D printer I'd used in 2015 had alone cost $2,900, or more than $3,900 in today's dollars.

Every item on my list had been recommended by PSR, who had agreed to come to Arabi to walk me through the gun-printing process and had closely studied evidence photos of the gun allegedly found on Mangione to identify its components. The first evening in the workshop, after unboxing and setting up the printer, PSR showed me how to orient two digital FMDA 19.2 frames—downloaded in an instant from one of several online repositories of open-source gun models—in a desktop CAD application. The printer was fast enough that we would be able to print two frames in a single night, just in case I managed to screw up one during assembly.

CAD models of the FTN silencer and two Glock-style frames, ready to be 3D-printed.

I transferred the microSD card with the project file from my MacBook to the 3D printer, then hit the print button. The next morning, 13 and a half hours later, I walked into the garage to see that two eerily perfect black gun frames had materialized inside the machine's glass front panel.

Now it was time to print the silencer. Legally speaking, this component of Mangione's ghost gun was not like the others. Silencers, also known as suppressors, are illegal to make under the National Firearms Act of 1934 without a very particular gun-making license. For Mangione—and for me—printing a suppressor alone would have constituted a felony.

Conveniently, though, our host James Reeves did have exactly the sort of Federal Firearms License necessary to manufacture that precisely shaped tube. So we were careful to make sure that Reeves was the one who pushed print and pulled the black cylinder out of the printer three and a half hours later.

In the meantime, PSR sat with me as I built the rest of the gun. In contrast to the black mask and goggles that gave him the menacing look of a comic book villain, PSR was remarkably polite and forgiving as I clumsily attempted to follow his instructions. In total, a process that takes an experienced gunmaker around 20 minutes took me over an hour as I drilled out bits of stray plastic, hammered metal pins into the holes left behind, and fiddled with tiny interlocking metal and polymer pieces.

As a firearm took shape in front of us, I commented to PSR how strange it was that it's only the frame of a Glock-style gun that's regulated under American gun control laws and not the slide and the barrel sitting on the table in front of us—the very gun-like components that actually hold the round and contain the explosive forces that propel a bullet.

“That's per the ATF,” PSR answered. “So, thanks, ATF.”

I asked PSR what appealed to him about 3D-printing guns. He started off with the hobbyist's answer: That it lets him make “intricate, neat” gun designs that aren't commercially available. (On his YouTube channel, for instance, he's tested everything from the Orca—an AR-15 with as many printed components as technically possible, including its lower receiver, stock, grip, and even parts of its upper receiver—to a printable combined Glock-style gun and bong known as the “Glong.”) Even better, he argued, is that he can make these ever-evolving ghost guns with total anonymity and privacy.

But don't 3D-printed ghost guns offer that same anonymity and privacy to actual dangerous people who might otherwise not be allowed to obtain a deadly weapon, even in America? “I don't love that people commit crimes and kill each other with guns. But we live in a country that's relatively free,” PSR responded. “Freedom is, ultimately, dangerous.”

Two handgun frames, fresh from a Bambu 3D printer. The rectangular material beneath each frame is a support structure created by the printer that's designed to be stripped away after printing finishes.

By the next day, the silencer was done. After it finished printing, the plastic FTN suppressor—the acronym stands for “Fuck That Noise” or “Fuck the NFA,” in a reference to the National Firearms Act—still needed to be epoxied into a carbon-fiber tube for additional reinforcement. To comply with the NFA, Reeves' team at the gun range had also registered it on a government website, added a serial number engraved on a washer at one end, and wrapped it in black hockey tape to match the one prosecutors say was found in Mangione's backpack.

With that process complete, I threaded this doppelgänger silencer onto the muzzle of the pistol—a final step that suddenly made the gun look approximately twice as much like an actual DIY murder weapon—and took it into Reeves' firing range for testing.

After a dozen years covering 3D-printed guns, I was about to test-fire a partially plastic firearm myself for the very first time. I'd watched enough videos of 3D-printed gun fails—barrels exploding, frames cracking—for this to actually make me sweat a little.

PSR had told me that any dangerous failure was unlikely, but that the most plausible risk to someone firing this kind of 3D-printed glock-style pistol would be that, if the frame failed, the gun's recoil might send the slide flying off backwards into their face. So for the first shot, I decided to hold the gun out to the side and fire it from the hip.

I gripped the ghost gun, pointed it vaguely at the human-shaped paper target downrange, and squeezed the trigger. Bang. The sudden sound of the explosion filled the range, even with the suppressor on. I was surprised to see a hole in the target's torso, not far from its dead center.

For that first tentative test shot, we had loaded only one round into the magazine. Now I added a few more, brought the gun up to eye level—briefly wondering, as I did, whether I was about to get a chunk of steel to the face—and fired again.

Test-firing the gun.

The next shot put a hole even closer to the center of the target, now that I was actually sighting it. But I could immediately see that, exactly as in the closed-circuit footage of Brian Thompson's killing, the gun hadn't fully “cycled”: Instead of the slide loading a new round into the chamber and then returning to its original position, as it should in a semi-automatic weapon, I had to “rack” the gun—pulling back the slide manually—to eject the round's casing and then give it a bump with my fist to push it back into place for the next shot.

I squeezed the trigger again. Click. It had misfired. I racked the gun again, gave it another punch in the back of the slide with my left hand, fired again, and heard the click of another misfire.

PSR took the gun, tried a few shots himself and got a similar mix of bangs and clicks as the gun misfired repeatedly. For the next half hour or so, he troubleshooted it, apologizing as if he felt personally responsible for the ghost gun's shortcomings. He removed the suppressor, lubricated the slide, swapped in different ammunition, and even briefly changed the barrel for a higher quality one.

Ultimately PSR came to the conclusion that the problem was the relatively cheap slide he'd recommended based on trying to match the one in prosecutors' evidence photos. None of these issues, in other words, had anything to do with the 3D-printed frame.

PSR spent a few minutes smoothing down an internal surface of the slide with a file, reassembled the gun, and we took turns firing it again, now with the suppressor off to isolate the issue. After a few more shots, PSR was barely nudging the slide to get it back into place—then, as it wore in, not touching it at all between pulls of the trigger. Finally, he unloaded an entire magazine into the target in just a few seconds. “There it is!” he yelled between shots. “There we go!”

When the gun was empty, he turned to me with a thumbs-up. “We have a functioning, 3D-printed semi-automatic Glock-style pistol here.”

I screwed the silencer back into place and fired it again. Now the gun acted precisely like the one from the CCTV video of Thompson's murder: It still didn't quite cycle, and I had to rack it and tap the back of the slide with every shot. That was likely because, just as with the gun allegedly found on Mangione, the silencer was still preventing the slide from achieving its full range of motion. In fact, watching the surveillance video again, I could now see that there was no hesitation in the shooter's racking and tapping of the gun—that he was fully prepared to manually cycle it, just as I was doing. I now understood that he had likely practiced at a range just as we were doing and perhaps had even troubleshooted his weapon in exactly the same way we had.

The gun required some troubleshooting and ultimately our test ended when a round got lodged in the barrel. But by then, we had fired it well over 50 times.

I fired the gun six more times before it misfired again. On that final, seventh shot, it failed in a new way: A live round actually appeared to have lodged itself into the barrel. It would take some precise surgery to get it out safely. Testing was over.

Despite the gun's eventual failure, our experiment in building an uncontrollable, lethal weapon had been a success—it had fired more than 50 times in total.

Over the previous half-dozen shots, meanwhile, as the ghost gun replicated precisely the performance of the one in the surveillance video, I had come to a disturbing realization: that I was now experiencing exactly the sensations—the same exact repetitive squeeze of the trigger, recoil, racking and tapping of the slide—that a murderer had felt as he gunned a man down on a Manhattan sidewalk.

Late that night, I turned in my two ghost gun frames to a police station in New Orleans' French Quarter. After all, they were mine, and I couldn't legally transfer them to anyone else or fly with them back to New York, where they're illegal.

When I'd similarly turned over my AR-15 ghost gun lower receivers in 2015, the cops had wordlessly accepted the components without making eye contact, as if I were an insane person. This time, when I explained to the police why I was handing over plastic gun parts, they looked them over curiously and asked me a few questions—but already knew exactly what a ghost gun was.

I wondered what their reaction would be in another 10 years. By then, perhaps, partially and even fully 3D-printed ghost guns will be commonplace. America's gun control system, after all, has shown no sign of keeping up with the pace of DIY firearm technology. Unless that changes, it's safe to expect a future with more ghost guns than ever, and more people—like a certain alleged CEO killer—ready to use them.

Amber Scorah knows only too well that powerful stories can change society—and that powerful organizations will try to undermine those who tell them. In 2015, her 3-month-old son Karl died on his first day of day care. Heartbroken and furious that she hadn't been with him, Scorah wrote an op-ed about the poor provision for parental leave in the US; her story helped New York City employees win their fight for improved family leave. In 2019 she wrote a memoir about leaving her tight-knit religion, the Jehovah's Witnesses, that exposed issues within the secretive organization. The book cost her friends and family members, but she heard from many people who had also been questioning some of the religion's controversial practices.

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

Then, while working at a media outlet that connects whistleblowers with journalists, she noticed parallels in the coercive tactics used by groups trying to suppress information. “There is a sort of playbook that powerful entities seem to use over and over again,” she says. “You expose something about the powerful, they try to discredit you, people in your community may ostracize you.”

In September 2024, Scorah cofounded Psst, a nonprofit that helps people in the tech industry or the government share information of public interest with extra protections—with lots of options for specifying how the information gets used and how anonymous a person stays.

Psst's main offering is a “digital safe”—which users access through an anonymous end-to-end encrypted text box hosted on Psst.org, where they can enter a description of their concerns. (It accepts text entries only and not document uploads, to make it harder for organizations to find the source of leaks.)

To safely share secrets, tech whistleblowers can go to psst.org and enter details in an encrypted text-box.

What makes Psst unique is something it calls its “information escrow” system—users have the option to keep their submission private until someone else shares similar concerns about the same company or organization.

As the organization was preparing to launch, members of Psst's team helped a group of Microsoft employees who were unhappy with how the company was marketing its AI products to fossil-fuel companies. Only one employee was willing to speak publicly, but others provided supporting documents anonymously. With help from Psst's team of lawyers, the workers filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission against the company and aired their concerns in a story published by The Atlantic.

Combining reports from multiple sources defends against some of the isolating effects of whistleblowing and makes it harder for companies to write off a story as the grievance of a disgruntled employee, says Psst cofounder Jennifer Gibson. It also helps protect the identity of anonymous whistleblowers by making it harder to pinpoint the source of a leak. And it may allow more information to reach daylight, as it encourages people to share what they know even if they don't have the full story.

Only members of Psst's in-house legal team can access information in the safe. In countries including the US and UK, communications between lawyers and their clients usually benefit from legal privilege, meaning the information is kept confidential.

This is one reason tech companies have such large legal departments, says Gibson, who leads Psst's in-house legal team: “They're designed to put lawyers in the room so the information isn't disclosable. To some extent, we're using their playbook.”

Amber Scorah with Psst co-founders Jennifer Gibson and Rebecca Petras.

At the moment, Psst lawyers first manually review the entries in the safe without reading the contents. Users can tag their entries with the company name and the category of their concern—“trust and safety” or “fraud,” for instance. If the lawyers find matches, and the contributor consents, the lawyers decrypt and read the entries to see if they may form part of the same story, while keeping the different contributors' identities protected from one another.

Psst plans to automate some of this process—in the future an algorithm running in a secure enclave built into the hardware of a computer will decrypt and compare information looking for potential matches while keeping it shielded from human eyes.

What happens next depends on various factors, but often Psst will involve an independent investigative journalist or publish accounts on its own website. Sometimes, whistleblowers might want to alert regulators without going public.

One challenge, Gibson says, is that regulation often lags behind technological advances, as with AI safety. “You're then in this no-man's-land,” she says—even if something's not illegal, reporting it may be in the public interest.

Scorah hopes Psst's impact on the tech world will be similar to what she experienced when telling her own stories, by using insiders' accounts to shed light on broader industry issues. “Whether it's a religion operating off the radar with policies that cause harm or an AI company whose product or policies are causing harm, I have seen the same thing,” she says. “Sunlight has a sanitizing effect.”

As soon as Format Boy answers the phone, I recognize his booming voice. I've spent weeks immersed in the influencer's back catalog of videos and voice notes. Format Boy isn't like other influencers: He doesn't show his face, and he won't tell me his real name. He isn't posting motivational content or seeking lucrative brand deals. Instead, he's teaching his audience how to orchestrate high-paying online scams.

Format Boy—as he styles himself on YouTube, Telegram, Instagram, and X, where he has amassed thousands of followers and racked up hundreds of thousands of views—acts as an unofficial adviser to a collective of menacing West African fraudsters known as the Yahoo Boys.

Typically these cybercriminals, mostly young men, work from their phones or laptops to con wealthy foreigners—often Americans—out of their life savings. Some have started using face-swapping and deepfakes to enhance their grifts. In one recent development, Yahoo Boys posted fake CNN broadcasts with AI-generated newscasters designed to trick people they're blackmailing into thinking they've been outed on the news.

Often based in Nigeria, Yahoo Boys build elaborate relationships with their victims over weeks or months before they extract whatever cash they can. They're not the most technically sophisticated scammers, but they're agile and skillful social engineers. Victims in the US, UK, and elsewhere have lost millions to Yahoo Boys in recent years, and multiple teenage boys have reportedly taken their own lives after being blackmailed and sextorted by them.

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

Yahoo Boys have their own terminology—a code of sorts—that helps them run scams (and potentially avoid social media moderation teams). Victims are called “clients.” “Bombing” involves messaging hundreds of online accounts to see if someone responds. Scams are known as “formats” (hence the name Format Boy). And there are formats for all occasions. Romance and dating formats try to get people to fall in love; cops and FBI officials are mimicked in impersonation scams; Elon Musk formats pretend to be the centibillionaire. There are investment scams, gift card scams, the list goes on. Hundreds of scripts, which can be copied and pasted directly to a victim, float around the internet. One is called “50 Questions to Ask Your Client as a Yahoo Boy.”

There's a whole hustle culture surrounding the Yahoo Boys. They pose with luxury cars and wear elaborate jewelry. On social media, hundreds of pages and groups, often explicitly using “Yahoo” in their names, claim to mentor newcomers, teach them the skills they need to con people, and provide them with the tools to do so.

Format Boy is one of the more prominent, or at least obvious, of these “scamfluencers”—his posts are often flagged by cybersecurity researchers who track the Yahoo Boys.

“I'm going to be teaching you guys exactly how to make a fake video call in this video,” Format Boy says at the start of his most popular YouTube video. Dramatic music blares as a deepfake video call is made onscreen. A brief text banner says it's for educational purposes only. Six of Format Boy's most popular videos, in fact, are all about creating deepfakes, with others detailing how Yahoo Boy scams work. “Fake video calls are very important,” he says in a voice note on Telegram. “Sometimes your clients cannot release some information to you without seeing you physically, without seeing you on camera.”

Format Boy started working around 2019, using a cheap phone to spam potential victims on dating sites. From there he got into the business of teaching people his methods and selling them software, guides, and tools. But on the phone with me, Format Boy is quick to distance himself from scamming. “It's not something I really do personally,” he says, a claim he repeats multiple times, although he concedes he has at least some hands-on experience. “At some point I was doing it, but I eventually stopped, and I started doing … I went into video editing and AI research,” he says.

He complains that over the past three years YouTube has removed his channels multiple times, resetting his follower count on each occasion. When pushed, he admits that what he posts online could help people to break the law. “I won't lie to you. That's the truth; it's encouraging them,” he says. He's most active on his Telegram channel where he regularly sends messages and rambling voice notes—some up to nine minutes long—to his 15,000 subscribers. His posts give advice on things like how to build up trust with a “client” to gain access to their bank accounts, and recommendations and offers for AI software that Yahoo Boys can use to change their appearance on video calls with potential victims. In one post, he touts a Valentine's Day promotional offer on this deepfake software—reduced from 60,000 Nigerian Naira (about $38) to 15,000 ($9.50).

I ask Format Boy how he feels about the impact Yahoo Boys have on their victims. He emphasizes his professional restraint. “I don't teach them everything—even if they pay for it—because I feel like this is not the right thing to do normally,” he says. Many people in Nigeria feel that they have little help from the government, he adds. “This is why I teach, just so that they can know that even if they're in the worst place in life, they can try something different for a while.”

In many of his voice notes on Telegram, Format Boy strikes an optimistic tone. Time is short, he says. Scammers need “determination” to succeed. “If you don't plan well, you will fail well. If you plan well, you will succeed well,” he says in one voice note. “When I am giving you guys assignments,” he says in another, “I am not trying to play teacher. I'm trying to push you to your next level.”

Format Boy, like any influencer, is subject to the vicissitudes of the algorithm. Over the years he has begged for more engagement on his YouTube videos. In voice notes from December 2023, he said someone was pretending to be Format Boy online and had created false accounts. In another from early 2024, he said: “I feel like the stress on YouTube, all these platforms, is too much. I'm resigning.” Three days after quitting, he was back posting. But recently, he's been planning his new hustle. His latest move, he tells me, is trading memecoins.

At WIRED, we've had a long-running obsession with rogues. This is, after all, a publication that was founded in the early '90s, born of a desire to champion the subversive, disruptive advent of the internet—and the hackers, hustlers, and blue-sky lunatics consumed by the possibilities of a digitized and interconnected planet.

Of course, WIRED had no idea, then, just what those rogues would ultimately unleash: a proliferation of bad actors wreaking havoc across the web; a booming industry of online conspiracy theorists whose dangerous convictions threaten everything from the health of our children to the strength of our democracies; and a coterie of tech billionaires with checkbooks and megaphones that reach from Silicon Valley all the way to the White House. Yes, rogues built the internet and inspired a technological revolution. Now, a mutated and much more powerful version of that same lawless spirit threatens to undo much of the incredible progress that technology and scientific inquiry have unlocked. DOGE Boys: I'm looking at you.

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

In this edition of WIRED, we're finding plenty of ways to show you just how roguish, how crooked, and how precarious our world has become. Matt Burgess brings you the inside story of Nigeria's Yahoo Boys and the “scam influencer” teaching them how to pull sophisticated digital cons on American victims. From Andy Greenberg, a timeline of ghost guns culminating in the one that Luigi Mangione allegedly used to murder a health care CEO in broad daylight—an act that's turned Mangione into the internet's most beloved rogue in recent memory. (Scroll down to watch what happened when Andy tried to re-create that weapon himself.) And from Evan Ratliff, the sweeping, bone-chilling saga of the Zizians, a group of gifted young technologists who became the world's first AI-inflected death cult and allegedly killed six people over several violent, chaotic years.

Scam influencers? DIY guns? AI death cults? Yes, things are rough out there. But we wouldn't be WIRED without finding—and even creating—a little bit of roguish fun amid the gloom. Elsewhere in this issue, we'll introduce you to a new and inspiring era of anti-establishment rebellion that's taking root: Amber Scorah, the cofounder of a nonprofit that helps whistleblowers safely share information with the masses, is one such example. Another is Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, who sat down with Kate Knibbs to elaborate on her vision for a democratized social internet. Plus, our Gear experts will show you the slickest, most villainous products to outfit your supervillain lair.

If you take one thing from our Rogues Issue, I hope it's this: “Rogue” is by no means a pejorative—even if it feels like more nasty bad actors than ever, perched in the highest seats of power, are running roughshod over pretty much everything. In fact, I'd argue that this moment calls for more rogues rather than fewer. The idealistic rogues. The indefatigable rogues. The new iteration of blue-sky lunatics who can imagine what a better world should look like—and are willing to fight the status quo to get us there. So be the rogue you want to see in the world, and know that WIRED, with every ounce of rebel spirit in our DNA, will be right there with you.

Can AI speed up aspects of the scientific process? Microsoft appears to think so.

At the company's Build 2025 conference on Monday, Microsoft announced Microsoft Discovery, a platform that taps agentic AI to “transform the [scientific] discovery process,” according to a press release provided to TechCrunch. Microsoft Discovery is “extensible,” Microsoft says, and can handle certain science-related workloads “end-to-end.” 

“Microsoft Discovery is an enterprise agentic platform that helps accelerate research and discovery by transforming the entire discovery process with agentic AI — from scientific knowledge reasoning to hypothesis formulation, candidate generation, and simulation and analysis,” explains Microsoft in its release. “The platform enables scientists and researchers to collaborate with a team of specialized AI agents to help drive scientific outcomes with speed, scale, and accuracy using the latest innovations in AI and supercomputing.”

Microsoft is one among many AI labs bullish on AI for science. Earlier this year, Google unveiled an “AI co-scientist,” which the tech giant said could help scientists with creating hypotheses and research plans. Anthropic and its chief rival, OpenAI, along with outfits like FutureHouse and Lila Sciences, have asserted that AI tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in medicine. 

But many researchers don't consider AI today to be especially useful in guiding the scientific process, largely due to its unreliability.

Part of the challenge in developing an “AI scientist” is anticipating an untold number of confounding factors. AI might come in handy in areas where broad exploration is needed, like narrowing down a vast list of possibilities, but it's less clear whether it can do the kind of out-of-the-box problem-solving that leads to bona fide breakthroughs.Results from AI systems designed for science have so far been mostly underwhelming. 

In 2023, Google said around 40 new materials had been synthesized with the help of one of its AIs, called GNoME. But an outside analysis found not even one of those materials was, in fact, new. Meanwhile, several firms employing AI for drug discovery, including Exscientia and BenevolentAI, have suffered high-profile clinical trial failures.

Microsoft no doubt hopes that its effort will fare better than those that've come before it.

Nikola's hydrogen trucks are officially up for auction, one of the company's last big steps in unloading all of its assets after filing for bankruptcy in February.

Auction house Gordon Brothers reached an agreement with Nikola in Delaware bankruptcy court to purchase the hydrogen trucking assets late last week. Over the weekend, Gordon Brothers published the listing and a brochure detailing everything for sale. 

The auction house says it has around $114 million worth of hydrogen trucks, raw material, and sub-assemblies. That includes 103 finished hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks, along with spare batteries, tires, and other components. Gordon Brothers is also auctioning off Nikola's hydrogen storage, refueling, and testing equipment, some of which is still brand new.

The hydrogen assets are hitting the market a little more than a month after EV startup Lucid Motors emerged as the surprise buyer of Nikola's Arizona manufacturing facility and headquarters. Lucid also agreed to bring around 300 Nikola employees on board as part of that transaction, in exchange for roughly $30 million in cash and non-cash considerations.

Gordon Brothers will now look to auction these assets at a time when hydrogen as a fuel source has struggled to become a viable option. The technology also faces fresh headwinds. House Republicans are working to roll back financial support for hydrogen power signed into law by former President Biden as part of a larger attempt to dismantle his entire climate agenda.

Pharmaceutical maker Regeneron announced Monday it will buy genetic testing company 23andMe for $256 million following a bankruptcy auction. 

Regeneron said it will acquire 23andMe's genomics service and its bank of 15 million customers' personal and genetic data as part of the deal. The pharma giant said it plans to use the 23andMe customer data to help drug discovery, and that it will “prioritize the privacy, security, and ethical use of 23andMe's customer data.”

23andMe filed for bankruptcy protection in March after a data breach exposed the private and genetic data of 7 million customers throughout 2023. The company's stock price also plummeted to near-zero amid waning consumer interest in the company's DNA testing kits. 23andMe's founder and chief executive Anne Wojcicki resigned following the company's collapse.

After its filing, a federal bankruptcy court was appointed to oversee the sale of 23andMe's assets, sparking concerns that the stores of customer data could be sold to adversarial nations or unethical buyers.

Regeneron said in its statement that as the named buyer in the bankruptcy auction, it “intends to ensure compliance” with 23andMe's privacy policies and laws regarding customer data. 

The bankruptcy court is set to consider Regeneron's acquisition on June 17. Regeneron said it will not acquire 23andMe's Lemonaid Health business.

Microsoft on Monday became one of the first hyperscalers to provide managed access to Grok, the AI model developed by billionaire Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI. 

Available through Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry platform, Grok — specifically Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini — will “have all the service-level agreements Azure customers expect from any Microsoft product,” says Microsoft. They'll also be billed directly by Microsoft, as is the case with the other models hosted in Azure AI Foundry.

When Musk announced Grok several years ago, he pitched the AI model as edgy, unfiltered, and anti-“woke” — in general, willing to answer controversial questions other AI systems simply won't. He delivered on some of that promise. Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing colorful language you likely wouldn't hear from ChatGPT.

According to SpeechMach, a benchmark comparing how different models treat sensitive subjects, Grok 3 is among the more permissive models. 

Grok, which powers a number of features on X, Musk's social network, has been the subject of much controversy lately. A recent report found that Grok would undress photos of women when asked. In February, Grok briefly censored unflattering mentions of Donald Trump and Musk. And just last week, an “unauthorized modification” caused Grok to repeatedly refer to white genocide in South Africa when invoked in certain contexts. 

The Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini models in Azure AI Foundry are decidedly more locked down than the Grok models on X. They also come with additional data integration, customization, and governance capabilities not necessarily offered by xAI through its API.

Microsoft is launching new APIs for Edge, its web browser, to let developers incorporate AI functionality into web apps using models built into Edge.

Unveiled at Build 2025, the AI APIs mirror some of the functionality in Google Chrome, which also offers “built-in AI” that developers can tap to power their web applications. Microsoft's move suggests that it's keen to offer a competitor — one that might sway devs to its side.

Edge's new APIs give websites and Edge browser extensions access to Phi 4 mini, an AI model that Microsoft released in late February. Around 3.8 billion parameters in size, Phi 4 mini excels at math problems, Microsoft says, thanks to a training data set that includes a mix of human-crafted and synthetic data (i.e. data generated by AI models). 

Parameters roughly correspond to a model's problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters. Small models have the advantage of being more efficient, however, particularly on less powerful hardware like that found in laptops and mobile devices.

Edge is also gaining other AI APIs, including a set of writing assistance APIs for generating, summarizing, and editing text. In a few months, Microsoft plans to release a translator API to serve AI-powered language translations via Edge, the company says. 

“These experimental APIs are intended as potential web standards and will work across platforms, browsers, and with other AI models,” writes Microsoft in a press release provided to TechCrunch. “For developers dealing with sensitive data or working in regulated industries, these APIs offer the privacy and security of on-device processing, eliminating the need to send data to external cloud services.”

All of the new AI APIs are available in the Edge Canary and Dev channels.

In related news, Microsoft is bringing a translation tool for PDFs to Edge. With support for over 70 languages, the tool lets users open a PDF in Edge, click the “Translate” icon in the Edge address bar, and create a new doc translated into the language of their choice. 

PDF translation will be generally available next month, and Canary users can try it starting today.

I honestly think Microsoft could win back some mind share from Apple if they:* Put out a version of windows without all the crap. Call it Dev edition or something and turn off or down the telemetry, preinstalled stuff, ads, and Copilot.
* Put some effort into silicon to get us hardware with no compromises like the MacbooksI'm on Mac now, and I jump back and forth between Mac laptop and a Linux desktop. I actually prefer Windows + WSL, but ideologically I can't use it. It has potential - PowerToys is fantastic, WSL is great, I actually like PowerShell as a scripting language and the entire new PC set up can now be done with PowerShell + Winget DSC. But, I just can't tolerate the user hostile behavior from Microsoft, nor the stop the world updates that take entirely too long. They should probably do what macOS and Silverblue, etc. do and move to an immutable/read-only base and deploy image based updates instead of whatever janky patching they do now.Plus, I can't get a laptop that's on par with my M4 Pro. The Surface Laptop 7 (the arm one) comes close, but still not good enough.

The big drawback to WSL to me is the slow filesystem access because NTFS sucks. And having to deal with Windows in the first place.Ps I wouldn't worry about your karma. It's just a number :P

The problem is Windows IO filters and whatnot, Microsoft Defender trying to lazily intercept every file operation, and if you're crossing between windows and Linux land, possibly 9pfs network shares.WSL2's own disk is just a VM image and fairly fast - you're just accessing a single file with some special optimizations. Usually far, far more responsive than anything done by windows itself. Don't do your work in your network-shared windows home folder.

It's fine for running small models but when you get to large training sets that don't fit in RAM it becomes miserable.There is a line where the convenience of training or developing locally gives way to a larger on demand cloud VM, but on WSL the line is much closer.

You know what's even more convenient than a VM? Not needing a VM and still having the exact same functionality. And you don't need a bunch of janky wrapper scripts, there's more than one tool that gives you essentially the same thing; I have used both Distrobox and toolbx to quickly drop into a Ubuntu or Fedora shell. It's pretty handy on NixOS if I want to test building some software in a more typical Linux environment. As a bonus, you get working hardware acceleration, graphical applications work out of the box, there is no I/O tax for going over a 9p bridge because there is no 9p bridge, and there is no weird memory balloon issues to deal with because there is no VM and there is no guest kernel.I get that WSL is revolutionary for Windows users, but I'm sorry, the reason why there's no WSL is because on Linux we don't need to use VMs to use Linux. It's that simple...

I don't have a need to run multiple OSes though. All of my tools are Linux based, and in companies that don't let people run Linux, the actual tools of the trade are almost all in a Linux VM because it's the only reasonable way to use them, and everything else is cross-platform. The outer OS just creates needless issues so that you now need to be a power user with two operating systems and their weird interactions.

XAMPP did not work out of the box with me on Windows (skill issue on my part, I know), so my preferred setup was to run a Ubuntu Server VM (LAMP stack) and then develop whatever I had on a Windows IDE.I could have done that under full Linux, I just did not want that. Then Vagrant came into existence, which I'd say was for my use case (but never came around to adopt it).I'm really happy with my WSL2 setup. I stopped using VMware Workstation when WSL2 broke it, but WSL2 is exactly what I needed to match my use case.

Hence, is it better to run Linux in Windows now? Genuinely asking.

Sorry but not sorry, it's not easier to run than on linux. It requires the Windows store to work, and to use Hyper-V (which breaks VMware workstation, among other things).It's in a better package, to be sure, but it's not ""easier to run multiple OS on the same computer"". It's easier to use multiple OSes (no SSH, GUI forwarding, etc), as long as all those OSes are Linux flavors supported by WSL.Want FreeBSD or Windows? Nope!

That said, the kernel they distribute is open source and you're not limited to just the distros they're working with directly. There are a number of third party (e.g. there's no Arch from Arch or Microsoft, but there's a completely compatible third party package that gives you Arch in WSL2)

This is a great way of saying it and expresses the uneasy feeling windows has given me recently. I use Linux machines but I have 1 windows machine in my home as a media PC; and for the last several years windows has made me feel like I don't own that computer but I'm just lucky to be along for the ride. Ramming ads on the task bar and start menu, forcing updates on me, forcing me to make a Microsoft account before I can login (or just having a dark UI pattern so I can't figure out how to avoid it, for the pedantic).With Linux I feel like the machine is a turing complete wonderbox of assistance and possibility, with windows it feels like Microsoft have forced their way into my home and are obnoxiously telling me they know best, while condescendingly telling me I'm lucky to be here at all. It's a very different feeling.

Of course, if you want the native integration WSL offers, you'll need to upgrade the Linux driver/daemon side to support whatever kernel you prefer to run if it's not supported already. Microsoft only supports a few specific kernels, but the code is out there for the Linux side so you can port the code to any OS, really.With some work, this could even open up possibilities like running *BSD as a WSL backend.

I've seen a number of theories online that boil down to young tech enthusiasts in the 2000's/early-2010's getting hands-on experience with open source projects and ecosystems since they're more accessible than enterprise tech that's typically gated behind paywalls, then translating into what they use when they enter the working world (where some naturally end up at M$).This somewhat seems to track, as longtime M$ employees from the Ballmer-era still often hold stigmas against open source projects (Dave's garage, and similar), but it seems the current iteration of employees hold much more favorable views.But who knows, perhaps it's all one long-winded goal from M$ of embracing, extending, and ultimately extinguishing.

From our experience with customers, Fabric feels like a rebrand of existing Azure services, plus a few new beta services that Microsoft is aggressively selling to their customers as fully baked. I've heard two customer stories this year where they migrated ETL to Fabric and then had to scramble to migrate again because of latency or reliability issues.I suspect Fabric will be pretty dang good a few years from now, and that it's probably a great option today for users who accurately understand its strengths and weaknesses, but I think the way some MS sales teams are selling the platform to customers right now is dishonest and harmful.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched me on writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. It was her biggest assignment to date. Hao's feat of reporting took a series of twists and turns over the coming months, eventually revealing how OpenAI's ambition had taken it far afield from its original mission. The finished story was a prescient look at a company at a tipping point—or already past it. And OpenAI was not happy with the result. Hao's new book, Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman's OpenAI, is an in-depth exploration of the company that kick-started the AI arms race, and what that race means for all of us. This excerpt is the origin story of that reporting. — Niall Firth, executive editor, MIT Technology Review

I arrived at OpenAI's offices on August 7, 2019. Greg Brockman, then thirty‑one, OpenAI's chief technology officer and soon‑to‑be company president, came down the staircase to greet me. He shook my hand with a tentative smile. “We've never given someone so much access before,” he said.

At the time, few people beyond the insular world of AI research knew about OpenAI. But as a reporter at MIT Technology Review covering the ever‑expanding boundaries of artificial intelligence, I had been following its movements closely.

Until that year, OpenAI had been something of a stepchild in AI research. It had an outlandish premise that AGI could be attained within a decade, when most non‑OpenAI experts doubted it could be attained at all. To much of the field, it had an obscene amount of funding despite little direction and spent too much of the money on marketing what other researchers frequently snubbed as unoriginal research. It was, for some, also an object of envy. As a nonprofit, it had said that it had no intention to chase commercialization. It was a rare intellectual playground without strings attached, a haven for fringe ideas.

But in the six months leading up to my visit, the rapid slew of changes at OpenAI signaled a major shift in its trajectory. First was its confusing decision to withhold GPT‑2 and brag about it. Then its announcement that Sam Altman, who had mysteriously departed his influential perch at YC, would step in as OpenAI's CEO with the creation of its new “capped‑profit” structure. I had already made my arrangements to visit the office when it subsequently revealed its deal with Microsoft, which gave the tech giant priority for commercializing OpenAI's technologies and locked it into exclusively using Azure, Microsoft's cloud‑computing platform.

Each new announcement garnered fresh controversy, intense speculation, and growing attention, beginning to reach beyond the confines of the tech industry. As my colleagues and I covered the company's progression, it was hard to grasp the full weight of what was happening. What was clear was that OpenAI was beginning to exert meaningful sway over AI research and the way policymakers were learning to understand the technology. The lab's decision to revamp itself into a partially for‑profit business would have ripple effects across its spheres of influence in industry and government. 

So late one night, with the urging of my editor, I dashed off an email to Jack Clark, OpenAI's policy director, whom I had spoken with before: I would be in town for two weeks, and it felt like the right moment in OpenAI's history. Could I interest them in a profile? Clark passed me on to the communications head, who came back with an answer. OpenAI was indeed ready to reintroduce itself to the public. I would have three days to interview leadership and embed inside the company.

Brockman and I settled into a glass meeting room with the company's chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. Sitting side by side at a long conference table, they each played their part. Brockman, the coder and doer, leaned forward, a little on edge, ready to make a good impression; Sutskever, the researcher and philosopher, settled back into his chair, relaxed and aloof.

I opened my laptop and scrolled through my questions. OpenAI's mission is to ensure beneficial AGI, I began. Why spend billions of dollars on this problem and not something else?

Brockman nodded vigorously. He was used to defending OpenAI's position. “The reason that we care so much about AGI and that we think it's important to build is because we think it can help solve complex problems that are just out of reach of humans,” he said.

The company really wants you to know that it's trying to make its models safer.

He offered two examples that had become dogma among AGI believers. Climate change. “It's a super‑complex problem. How are you even supposed to solve it?” And medicine. “Look at how important health care is in the US as a political issue these days. How do we actually get better treatment for people at lower cost?”

On the latter, he began to recount the story of a friend who had a rare disorder and had recently gone through the exhausting rigmarole of bouncing between different specialists to figure out his problem. AGI would bring together all of these specialties. People like his friend would no longer spend so much energy and frustration on getting an answer.

Why did we need AGI to do that instead of AI? I asked.

This was an important distinction. The term AGI, once relegated to an unpopular section of the technology dictionary, had only recently begun to gain more mainstream usage—in large part because of OpenAI.

And as OpenAI defined it, AGI referred to a theoretical pinnacle of AI research: a piece of software that had just as much sophistication, agility, and creativity as the human mind to match or exceed its performance on most (economically valuable) tasks. The operative word was theoretical. Since the beginning of earnest research into AI several decades earlier, debates had raged about whether silicon chips encoding everything in their binary ones and zeros could ever simulate brains and the other biological processes that give rise to what we consider intelligence. There had yet to be definitive evidence that this was possible, which didn't even touch on the normative discussion of whether people should develop it.

AI, on the other hand, was the term du jour for both the version of the technology currently available and the version that researchers could reasonably attain in the near future through refining existing capabilities. Those capabilities—rooted in powerful pattern matching known as machine learning—had already demonstrated exciting applications in climate change mitigation and health care.

Sutskever chimed in. When it comes to solving complex global challenges, “fundamentally the bottleneck is that you have a large number of humans and they don't communicate as fast, they don't work as fast, they have a lot of incentive problems.” AGI would be different, he said. “Imagine it's a large computer network of intelligent computers—they're all doing their medical diagnostics; they all communicate results between them extremely fast.”

This seemed to me like another way of saying that the goal of AGI was to replace humans. Is that what Sutskever meant? I asked Brockman a few hours later, once it was just the two of us.

“No,” Brockman replied quickly. “This is one thing that's really important. What is the purpose of technology? Why is it here? Why do we build it? We've been building technologies for thousands of years now, right? We do it because they serve people. AGI is not going to be different—not the way that we envision it, not the way we want to build it, not the way we think it should play out.”

That said, he acknowledged a few minutes later, technology had always destroyed some jobs and created others. OpenAI's challenge would be to build AGI that gave everyone “economic freedom” while allowing them to continue to “live meaningful lives” in that new reality. If it succeeded, it would decouple the need to work from survival.

“I actually think that's a very beautiful thing,” he said.

In our meeting with Sutskever, Brockman reminded me of the bigger picture. “What we view our role as is not actually being a determiner of whether AGI gets built,” he said. This was a favorite argument in Silicon Valley—the inevitability card. If we don't do it, somebody else will. “The trajectory is already there,” he emphasized, “but the thing we can influence is the initial conditions under which it's born.

“What is OpenAI?” he continued. “What is our purpose? What are we really trying to do? Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. And the way we want to do that is: Build AGI and distribute its economic benefits.”

His tone was matter‑of‑fact and final, as if he'd put my questions to rest. And yet we had somehow just arrived back to exactly where we'd started.

Our conversation continued on in circles until we ran out the clock after forty‑five minutes. I tried with little success to get more concrete details on what exactly they were trying to build—which by nature, they explained, they couldn't know—and why, then, if they couldn't know, they were so confident it would be beneficial. At one point, I tried a different approach, asking them instead to give examples of the downsides of the technology. This was a pillar of OpenAI's founding mythology: The lab had to build good AGI before someone else built a bad one.

Brockman attempted an answer: deepfakes. “It's not clear the world is better through its applications,” he said.

I offered my own example: Speaking of climate change, what about the environmental impact of AI itself? A recent study from the University of Massachusetts Amherst had placed alarming numbers on the huge and growing carbon emissions of training larger and larger AI models.

That was “undeniable,” Sutskever said, but the payoff was worth it because AGI would, “among other things, counteract the environmental cost specifically.” He stopped short of offering examples.

“It is unquestioningly very highly desirable that data centers be as green as possible,” he added.

“No question,” Brockman quipped.

“Data centers are the biggest consumer of energy, of electricity,” Sutskever continued, seeming intent now on proving that he was aware of and cared about this issue.

“It's 2 percent globally,” I offered.

“Isn't Bitcoin like 1 percent?” Brockman said.

“Wow!” Sutskever said, in a sudden burst of emotion that felt, at this point, forty minutes into the conversation, somewhat performative.

Sutskever would later sit down with New York Times reporter Cade Metz for his book Genius Makers, which recounts a narrative history of AI development, and say without a hint of satire, “I think that it's fairly likely that it will not take too long of a time for the entire surface of the Earth to become covered with data centers and power stations.” There would be “a tsunami of computing . . . almost like a natural phenomenon.” AGI—and thus the data centers needed to support them—would be “too useful to not exist.”

The firm's spending makes clear how much it wants to shape the new rules around government AI policy.

I tried again to press for more details. “What you're saying is OpenAI is making a huge gamble that you will successfully reach beneficial AGI to counteract global warming before the act of doing so might exacerbate it.”

“I wouldn't go too far down that rabbit hole,” Brockman hastily cut in. “The way we think about it is the following: We're on a ramp of AI progress. This is bigger than OpenAI, right? It's the field. And I think society is actually getting benefit from it.”

“The day we announced the deal,” he said, referring to Microsoft's new $1 billion investment, “Microsoft's market cap went up by $10 billion. People believe there is a positive ROI even just on short‑term technology.”

OpenAI's strategy was thus quite simple, he explained: to keep up with that progress. “That's the standard we should really hold ourselves to. We should continue to make that progress. That's how we know we're on track.”

Later that day, Brockman reiterated that the central challenge of working at OpenAI was that no one really knew what AGI would look like. But as researchers and engineers, their task was to keep pushing forward, to unearth the shape of the technology step by step.

He spoke like Michelangelo, as though AGI already existed within the marble he was carving. All he had to do was chip away until it revealed itself.

There had been a change of plans. I had been scheduled to eat lunch with employees in the cafeteria, but something now required me to be outside the office. Brockman would be my chaperone. We headed two dozen steps across the street to an open‑air café that had become a favorite haunt for employees.

This would become a recurring theme throughout my visit: floors I couldn't see, meetings I couldn't attend, researchers stealing furtive glances at the communications head every few sentences to check that they hadn't violated some disclosure policy. I would later learn that after my visit, Jack Clark would issue an unusually stern warning to employees on Slack not to speak with me beyond sanctioned conversations. The security guard would receive a photo of me with instructions to be on the lookout if I appeared unapproved on the premises. It was odd behavior in general, made odder by OpenAI's commitment to transparency. What, I began to wonder, were they hiding, if everything was supposed to be beneficial research eventually made available to the public?

At lunch and through the following days, I probed deeper into why Brockman had cofounded OpenAI. He was a teen when he first grew obsessed with the idea that it could be possible to re‑create human intelligence. It was a famous paper from British mathematician Alan Turing that sparked his fascination. The name of its first section, “The Imitation Game,” which inspired the title of the 2014 Hollywood dramatization of Turing's life, begins with the opening provocation, “Can machines think?” The paper goes on to define what would become known as the Turing test: a measure of the progression of machine intelligence based on whether a machine can talk to a human without giving away that it is a machine. It was a classic origin story among people working in AI. Enchanted, Brockman coded up a Turing test game and put it online, garnering some 1,500 hits. It made him feel amazing. “I just realized that was the kind of thing I wanted to pursue,” he said.

In 2015, as AI saw great leaps of advancement, Brockman says that he realized it was time to return to his original ambition and joined OpenAI as a cofounder. He wrote down in his notes that he would do anything to bring AGI to fruition, even if it meant being a janitor. When he got married four years later, he held a civil ceremony at OpenAI's office in front of a custom flower wall emblazoned with the shape of the lab's hexagonal logo. Sutskever officiated. The robotic hand they used for research stood in the aisle bearing the rings, like a sentinel from a post-apocalyptic future.

“Fundamentally, I want to work on AGI for the rest of my life,” Brockman told me.

What motivated him? I asked Brockman.

What are the chances that a transformative technology could arrive in your lifetime? he countered.

He was confident that he—and the team he assembled—was uniquely positioned to usher in that transformation. “What I'm really drawn to are problems that will not play out in the same way if I don't participate,” he said.

Brockman did not in fact just want to be a janitor. He wanted to lead AGI. And he bristled with the anxious energy of someone who wanted history‑defining recognition. He wanted people to one day tell his story with the same mixture of awe and admiration that he used to recount the ones of the great innovators who came before him.

A year before we spoke, he had told a group of young tech entrepreneurs at an exclusive retreat in Lake Tahoe with a twinge of self‑pity that chief technology officers were never known. Name a famous CTO, he challenged the crowd. They struggled to do so. He had proved his point.

In 2022, he became OpenAI's president.

During our conversations, Brockman insisted to me that none of OpenAI's structural changes signaled a shift in its core mission. In fact, the capped profit and the new crop of funders enhanced it. “We managed to get these mission‑aligned investors who are willing to prioritize mission over returns. That's a crazy thing,” he said.

OpenAI now had the long‑term resources it needed to scale its models and stay ahead of the competition. This was imperative, Brockman stressed. Failing to do so was the real threat that could undermine OpenAI's mission. If the lab fell behind, it had no hope of bending the arc of history toward its vision of beneficial AGI. Only later would I realize the full implications of this assertion. It was this fundamental assumption—the need to be first or perish—that set in motion all of OpenAI's actions and their far‑reaching consequences. It put a ticking clock on each of OpenAI's research advancements, based not on the timescale of careful deliberation but on the relentless pace required to cross the finish line before anyone else. It justified OpenAI's consumption of an unfathomable amount of resources: both compute, regardless of its impact on the environment; and data, the amassing of which couldn't be slowed by getting consent or abiding by regulations.

Brockman pointed once again to the $10 billion jump in Microsoft's market cap. “What that really reflects is AI is delivering real value to the real world today,” he said. That value was currently being concentrated in an already wealthy corporation, he acknowledged, which was why OpenAI had the second part of its mission: to redistribute the benefits of AGI to everyone.

An exclusive conversation with Ilya Sutskever on his fears for the future of AI and why they've made him change the focus of his life's work.

Was there a historical example of a technology's benefits that had been successfully distributed? I asked.

“Well, I actually think that—it's actually interesting to look even at the internet as an example,” he said, fumbling a bit before settling on his answer. “There's problems, too, right?” he said as a caveat. “Anytime you have something super transformative, it's not going to be easy to figure out how to maximize positive, minimize negative.

“Fire is another example,” he added. “It's also got some real drawbacks to it. So we have to figure out how to keep it under control and have shared standards.

“Cars are a good example,” he followed. “Lots of people have cars, benefit a lot of people. They have some drawbacks to them as well. They have some externalities that are not necessarily good for the world,” he finished hesitantly.

“I guess I just view—the thing we want for AGI is not that different from the positive sides of the internet, positive sides of cars, positive sides of fire. The implementation is very different, though, because it's a very different type of technology.”

His eyes lit up with a new idea. “Just look at utilities. Power companies, electric companies are very centralized entities that provide low‑cost, high‑quality things that meaningfully improve people's lives.”

It was a nice analogy. But Brockman seemed once again unclear about how OpenAI would turn itself into a utility. Perhaps through distributing universal basic income, he wondered aloud, perhaps through something else.

He returned to the one thing he knew for certain. OpenAI was committed to redistributing AGI's benefits and giving everyone economic freedom. “We actually really mean that,” he said.

“The way that we think about it is: Technology so far has been something that does rise all the boats, but it has this real concentrating effect,” he said. “AGI could be more extreme. What if all value gets locked up in one place? That is the trajectory we're on as a society. And we've never seen that extreme of it. I don't think that's a good world. That's not a world that I want to sign up for. That's not a world that I want to help build.”

In February 2020, I published my profile for MIT Technology Review, drawing on my observations from my time in the office, nearly three dozen interviews, and a handful of internal documents. “There is a misalignment between what the company publicly espouses and how it operates behind closed doors,” I wrote. “Over time, it has allowed a fierce competitiveness and mounting pressure for ever more funding to erode its founding ideals of transparency, openness, and collaboration.”

Hours later, Elon Musk replied to the story with three tweets in rapid succession:

“OpenAI should be more open imo”

“I have no control & only very limited insight into OpenAI. Confidence in Dario for safety is not high,” he said, referring to Dario Amodei, the director of research.

“All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla”

Afterward, Altman sent OpenAI employees an email.

“I wanted to share some thoughts about the Tech Review article,” he wrote. “While definitely not catastrophic, it was clearly bad.”

It was “a fair criticism,” he said that the piece had identified a disconnect between the perception of OpenAI and its reality. This could be smoothed over not with changes to its internal practices but some tuning of OpenAI's public messaging. “It's good, not bad, that we have figured out how to be flexible and adapt,” he said, including restructuring the organization and heightening confidentiality, “in order to achieve our mission as we learn more.” OpenAI should ignore my article for now and, in a few weeks' time, start underscoring its continued commitment to its original principles under the new transformation. “This may also be a good opportunity to talk about the API as a strategy for openness and benefit sharing,” he added, referring to an application programming interface for delivering OpenAI's models.

“The most serious issue of all, to me,” he continued, “is that someone leaked our internal documents.” They had already opened an investigation and would keep the company updated. He would also suggest that Amodei and Musk meet to work out Musk's criticism, which was “mild relative to other things he's said” but still “a bad thing to do.” For the avoidance of any doubt, Amodei's work and AI safety were critical to the mission, he wrote. “I think we should at some point in the future find a way to publicly defend our team (but not give the press the public fight they'd love right now).”

OpenAI wouldn't speak to me again for three years.

OpenAI's GPT-4 is much better at getting people to accept its point of view during an argument than humans are—but there's a catch.

Millions of people argue with each other online every day, but remarkably few of them change someone's mind. New research suggests that large language models (LLMs) might do a better job. The finding suggests that AI could become a powerful tool for persuading people, for better or worse.  

A multi-university team of researchers found that OpenAI's GPT-4 was significantly more persuasive than humans when it was given the ability to adapt its arguments using personal information about whoever it was debating.

Their findings are the latest in a growing body of research demonstrating LLMs' powers of persuasion. The authors warn they show how AI tools can craft sophisticated, persuasive arguments if they have even minimal information about the humans they're interacting with. The research has been published in the journal Nature Human Behavior.

“Policymakers and online platforms should seriously consider the threat of coordinated AI-based disinformation campaigns, as we have clearly reached the technological level where it is possible to create a network of LLM-based automated accounts able to strategically nudge public opinion in one direction,” says Riccardo Gallotti, an interdisciplinary physicist at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Italy, who worked on the project.

“These bots could be used to disseminate disinformation, and this kind of diffused influence would be very hard to debunk in real time,” he says.

The researchers recruited 900 people based in the US and got them to provide personal information like their gender, age, ethnicity, education level, employment status, and political affiliation. 

Participants were then matched with either another human opponent or GPT-4 and instructed to debate one of 30 randomly assigned topics—such as whether the US should ban fossil fuels, or whether students should have to wear school uniforms—for 10 minutes. Each participant was told to argue either in favor of or against the topic, and in some cases they were provided with personal information about their opponent, so they could better tailor their argument. At the end, participants said how much they agreed with the proposition and whether they thought they were arguing with a human or an AI.

AI is skilled at tapping into vast realms of data and tailoring it to a specific purpose—making it a highly customizable tool for combating misinformation.

Overall, the researchers found that GPT-4 either equaled or exceeded humans' persuasive abilities on every topic. When it had information about its opponents, the AI was deemed to be 64% more persuasive than humans without access to the personalized data—meaning that GPT-4 was able to leverage the personal data about its opponent much more effectively than its human counterparts. When humans had access to the personal information, they were found to be slightly less persuasive than humans without the same access.

The authors noticed that when participants thought they were debating against AI, they were more likely to agree with it. The reasons behind this aren't clear, the researchers say, highlighting the need for further research into how humans react to AI.

“We are not yet in a position to determine whether the observed change in agreement is driven by participants' beliefs about their opponent being a bot (since I believe it is a bot, I am not losing to anyone if I change ideas here), or whether those beliefs are themselves a consequence of the opinion change (since I lost, it should be against a bot),” says Gallotti. “This causal direction is an interesting open question to explore.”

Although the experiment doesn't reflect how humans debate online, the research suggests that LLMs could also prove an effective way to not only disseminate but also counter mass disinformation campaigns, Gallotti says. For example, they could generate personalized counter-narratives to educate people who may be vulnerable to deception in online conversations. “However, more research is urgently needed to explore effective strategies for mitigating these threats,” he says.

While we know a lot about how humans react to each other, we know very little about the psychology behind how people interact with AI models, says Alexis Palmer, a fellow at Dartmouth College who has studied how LLMs can argue about politics but did not work on the research. 

“In the context of having a conversation with someone about something you disagree on, is there something innately human that matters to that interaction? Or is it that if an AI can perfectly mimic that speech, you'll get the exact same outcome?” she says. “I think that is the overall big question of AI.”

When you're done crying your eyes out, we thought it might be a good time to talk about the latest episode of The Last of Us. The penultimate sixth episode was just released on HBO, and it was incredible. We'll have our full, traditional recap on Monday, but we had to give everyone a place to commiserate and discuss it before that, with full spoilers unleashed.



In this week's episode, called “The Price,” we finally got to see Ellie's birthday gift, the unforgettable flashback scene from The Last of Us Part II. And, from the watchful eye of franchise creator and episode director Neil Druckmann, it lived up to its predecessor. But building off that, the episode took things many steps further, creating scenes specifically made for the show, such as Ellie's birthdays before and after the one at the museum.

Then, eventually, things caught up to the timeline of the show, catching up with the first episode of season two and revealing that before Joel died, Ellie found out. She finally found out that Joel killed everyone at the Salt Lake City hospital in a selfish act to save her life, sacrificing the lives of, well, the world. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey absolutely murdered the scene—no pun intended—as after years of tension, Joel and Ellie finally come clean and agree to forgive.

Which, of course, we now know from the show, is basically the last time they ever spoke. It's a heavy, heavy episode and that's before you talk about the whole storyline involving Eugene, played by Joe Pantoliano, as well as that first flashback of young Joel and Tommy with their father, played by Hawkeye star Tony Dalton.

So, below, feel free to discuss the episode however you see fit. Did it live up to your expectations if you played the game? If you haven't, what did you think? Again, we'll have a full, detailed recap and reaction Monday morning—but, for now, discuss “The Price” below.

As much as Nintendo's games try to emphasize the “fun” first, the company's consoles themselves similarly want to spark joy in odd, though surprisingly endearing, ways. Even before the Switch 2's launch, Nintendo shared a few odd and cutesy features beyond the headlining mouse controls and GameChat that are meant to remind you you're not just plugging in any bog-standard gaming machine, especially not when you can play a song with your Joy-Cons on the connection screen.

The Switch 2, swathed in its new black finish, may look a little too dark and drab compared to classic, colorful Nintendo, but the amusements are more than skin-deep. The more technologically minded Nintendo fans have poured over recently leaked Switch 2 specs. The console will indeed be many times more powerful than the original Switch. The specs also revealed the console will support VRR—or variable refresh rate—on handheld mode up to 120Hz but not on TV when docked.

Variable refresh rate is a way for displays to change the rate a screen refreshes to match a game's frames per second (fps). Nintendo confirmed with Nintendo Life that it posted “incorrect information” to its website suggesting VRR is supported on TVs. That language has been changed, but the hubbub surrounding this talk of VRR or other spec details largely misses the point. Games are already confirmed to run at a max 60 fps at 4K. Other resolutions will carry their own standard frames per second. The PlayStation 5 didn't get VRR support until two years after its 2020 release. In the same way, Nintendo could update this at a later time.

So unless lack of VRR leads to screen tearing issues, Nintendo would rather focus on the oddly endearing functions of its new handheld. Much like the original Switch, there are a few hidden features that Nintendo has in store when the Switch 2 launches June 5. We'll be sure to add more once we finally have the console in hand.

You will be able to customize the Joy-con 2 side panes like the PS5 faceplates.

Some new panels have already started popping up. pic.twitter.com/0Fv9YRbCa5

— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) May 5, 2025



Those blue and red accents on the Switch 2 Joy-Cons 2 aren't going to be your only option. The controllers currently only come in black, but users can remove the small side panels in a similar fashion to how you can swap out the fins on the PlayStation 5. Some shops are already selling replacement panels and removal tools. We expect Nintendo will try to sell a bounty of different color options in the future. If the Japanese console maker plans to sell different-colored controllers, we could be in store for some interesting color combinations.

The original Switch included a hidden feature on the lock screen, where pressing different buttons activated different sounds. Few Switch owners knew about it, but you—dear reader—will be some of the few to know controllers can make music in the system's “Change Grip/Order” section of the main menu. Nintendo said you can play different sounds with your connected controller by pressing the L/R, ZL/ZR, and SL/SR buttons. Nintendo said you can “even create a musical scale” with these sounds, but enterprising musicians will certainly be able to carry a tune. This works with all first-party controllers, including Switch 2 Pro controllers and even the original Switch's Joy-Cons.

Speaking of sound, Nintendo also shared more of the main menu chirps and bleeps. Now if only Nintendo could make something as endearing as the Wii Shop theme.

Nintendo Today showed off some of the system sounds of the Switch 2!⁰- There are different sounds for pressing the C Button and for selecting each icon on the HOME Menu.– A sound also plays when you wake up the docked system from sleep mode. pic.twitter.com/pqnYqER5W7

— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) May 18, 2025



Console gamers will get a small taste of the PC lifestyle with the ability to navigate the Switch 2 main menu with the Joy-Cons 2 mouse controls. This may make navigating the newly redesigned eShop much easier. Mouse controls are supposed to be one of the major defining features of the handheld console, and you'll find it in a surprising number of games. Super Mario Party Jamboree will include mouse-specific minigames, and the upcoming Drag x Drive will use it for pushing around a wheelchair for basketball-based antics. Those titles that aren't using first-person mouse controls—such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond—or in real-time strategy games like Civilization VII, will likely be using it to navigate menus.

The original Switch included a Find Controllers feature that made a missing Joy-Con chime and vibrate in case you're having a hard time finding it. Nintendo updated this feature for the Switch 2, but it should work the same as before. You'll find this capability under the controllers section of the main menu. The Joy-Con needs to be paired with the console and still have enough battery to receive the signal.

Switch 2 owners can enable a “Stop Charging Around 90%” setting that should help save your battery long term. It's a common feature on other devices like smartphones, and it should help keep your battery capacity stable over a longer period of time. It will reduce your undocked playtime, though it's a good idea to use it if you plan on taking the handheld out and about. If it sounds obvious, then know the Steam Deck only added a battery maximum charge limit setting this month through its latest beta.

While Nintendo intends its GameShare feature to be the main way you'll interact with friends and share moments, users should be able to send their friends in-game screenshots with a new Switch app. This will make it far easier to share your favorite moments without needing to go through the original Switch's tedious process of scanning a QR code to bring them up in a browser. You'll also use the app to access friends lists and use it for voice chat online. You need a Switch Online membership to access these features.

If you've been thinking about dipping your toes into the smart home world, one good place to start is with an Amazon Echo device. It's easy to use, and you can put it just about anywhere in your house. It's a solid speaker and a smart home hub, and it's pretty unobtrusive, too. And if you want to go ahead and lock one in for yourself, Amazon is selling one at a great price right now. You won't want to miss out on this one, especially since it's available for only $25.

In fact, you can get the newest version of the Echo Pop for just $25, down from its usual price of $40. That's $15 off and a discount of 38%.

The 4th Gen Echo is a smaller, sphere-shaped device that you can put just about anywhere and it won't look or feel too out of place. It's an effective speaker with a 3-inch woofer and dual front-firing tweeters, which means it actually offers sound that can fill a room if you want that type of music. And it can push out clear, crisp voice calls if you use it to communicate.

But it's much more than that. In fact, you can use it to set up and keep track of all your smart home devices. That includes cameras, bridges, and more. You can use the Echo to bring them all together in a central location, which should make it a lot easier to set routines, get updates, control lights, and more.

Alexa can help with a lot of that too, like weather updates, voice-controlled routines, news briefings, shopping lists, alarms, and more. There's even a built-in temperature sensor and motion detection, which you can use to trigger automations based on whether someone's in the room. And if you're worried about privacy, there's a physical button that cuts power to the microphones. You're in control of when it's listening.

For just $25, this is a device that punches above its weight class in a big way. You'd probably find yourself spending a lot more on similarly functioning tech elsewhere, but Echo speakers are cheaper for a reason. And this one is affordable in a way right now that means you can get a couple and place them around your house, or give them as gifts. Whatever the case may be, don't miss out on this deal and head to Amazon to scoop one up.

A group of participants from several U.S. agencies took part in a first-of-its-kind exercise that tested their preparedness for a severe solar storm, revealing major cracks in scientists' ability to forecast space weather—which could put crucial systems at risk.

The Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation (SWORM) task force, an inter-agency group that includes the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), organized a space weather exercise aimed at better understanding the U.S. government's preparedness for an impending solar storm. The results were recently published in a report, which highlighted significant limitations in space weather forecasting.

The exercise was held from May 8 to 9, 2024, at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, and at a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) site in Denver, Colorado. The space weather scenario was organized into four modules involving a series of solar events that resulted in adverse effects on our systems on Earth and in space. The effects included radio communication blackout, loss of GPS functionality, power outages, intense radiation exposure for astronauts and satellites, and an inability to track and communicate with orbiting satellites.

One of the modules took place in the future, asking participants to imagine a hypothetical scenario taking place over eight days in January and February 2028. In the scenario, NOAA tracks an active region on the solar surface that rotates to a position where it is pointed toward Earth. To make matters more complicated, a crew of two astronauts is en route to the Moon aboard the Orion spacecraft while another two-person crew is already on the lunar surface as part of the Artemis missions. The exercise asked participants to consider whether their agency or organization has policies or protocols in place in case of a major space weather event.

Coincidentally, the largest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years took place around the same time as the exercise. On May 10, 2024, a G5, or extreme, geomagnetic storm, hit Earth as a result of large expulsions of plasma from the Sun's corona (also known as coronal mass ejections). The G5 storm caused some deleterious effects on Earth's power grid and some spectacular auroras seen across much of the globe. The storm also increased atmospheric density in low Earth orbit by up to an order of magnitude, which in turn caused atmospheric drag that affected satellites.

Space weather forecasters monitor the Sun's activity and incoming coronal mass ejections, but these storms are hard to predict. “We never know what's actually going to be, what the CME is composed of, and what to make of it until it gets just 1 million miles from Earth, where it's only 15 to 45 minutes away,” Shawn Dahl, service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center, told Gizmodo in an earlier interview. “That's when we can see what the CME is composed of. How strong is it magnetically? What's the speed of its movement? Is it going to connect with Earth?”

Participants found that the most challenging aspect to space weather forecasting is the inability to predict how the coronal mass ejection will affect Earth. Scientists are able to know the true impact of a coronal mass ejection about 30 minutes before it hits—that's when the magnetic field orientation of the cloud of particles becomes apparent.

The report suggests investing in next-generation space weather satellites and developing and deploying more sensors to monitor space weather drivers. It also recommends that U.S. agencies collaborate with international partners and the private sector.

“Ongoing preparedness efforts for a space weather event are crucial because an extreme event has the potential to severely impact our nation's critical infrastructure and threaten our national security,” the report read. “Just as we prepare for earthquakes, hurricanes and cyberattacks, our nation must take action before a major space weather event occurs.”

Arc Pro arrives for inference workstations. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel has announced its Arc Pro B-series of graphics cards at Computex 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan, with a heavy focus on AI workstation inference performance boosted by segment-leading amounts of VRAM. The Intel Arc Pro B50, a compact card that's designed for graphics workstations, has 16GB of VRAM and will retail for $299, while the larger Intel Arc Pro B60 for AI inference workstations slots in with a copious 24GB of VRAM. While the B60 is designed for powerful 'Project Battlematrix' AI workstations sold as full systems ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, it will carry a roughly $500 per-unit price tag. 

Intel has focused on leveraging the third-party GPU ecosystem to develop its Arc Pro cards, in contrast to its competitors, who tend to release their own-branded cards for the professional segment. That includes partners like Maxsun, which has developed a dual-GPU card based on the B60 GPU. Other partners include ASRock, Sparkle, GUNNR, Senao, Lanner, and Onix. 

Both the B50 and B60 GPUs are now being sampled to Intel partners, as evidenced by a robust display of partner cards and full systems on display, and will arrive on the market in the third quarter of 2025. Intel will initially launch the cards with a reduced software featureset, but will add support for features like SRIOV, VDI, and manageability software in the fourth quarter of the year. 



The Intel Arc Pro B50 has a compact dual-slot design for slim and small-form-factor graphics workstations. It has a 70W total board power (TBP) rating and does not have external power connectors. The GPU wields 16 Xe cores and 128 XMX engines that deliver up to 170 peak TOPS, all fed by 16GB of VRAM that delivers 224 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The card also sports a PCIe 5.0 x8 interface, which Intel credits with speeding transfers from system memory, ultimately delivering 10 to 20% more performance in some scenarios. 

The B50's 16GB of memory outweighs its primary competitors in this segment, which typically come armed with 6 or 8GB of memory. The card also has certified drivers that Intel claims deliver up to 2.6X more performance than the baseline gaming drivers. 

Intel shared a slew of benchmarks against the competing Nvidia RTX A1000 8GB and the previous-gen A50 6GB, but as with all vendor-provided benchmarks, take them with a grain of salt (we included the test notes at the end of the article). In graphics workloads, Intel claims up to a 3.4X advantage over its previous-gen A50, and solid gains across the board against the RTX A1000. It sports similar advantages in a spate of AI inference benchmarks. 

The Intel Arc Pro B60 has 20 Xe cores and 160 XMX engines fed by 24GB of memory that delivers 456 GB/s of bandwidth. The card delivers 197 peak TOPS and fits into a 120 to 200W TBP envelope. This card also comes with a PCIe 5.0 x8 interface.

Intel supports multiple B60 GPUs on a single board, as evidenced by Maxsun's GPU,  with software support in Linux for splitting workloads across both GPUs (each GPU interfaces with the host on its own bifurcated PCIe 5.0 x8 connection). 

Intel's benchmarks again highlighted the advantages of the B60's 24GB of memory vs the competing RTX 200 Ada 16GB and RTX 5060Ti 16GB GPUs, claiming this can impart gains of up to 2.7X over the competition in various AI models. Intel also highlighted the advantages of higher memory capacity in model size, context, and concurrency scaling.

The Intel Arc Pro B60 will primarily come in pre-built inference workstations ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, dubbed Project Battlematrix. The goal is to combine hardware and software to create one cohesive workstation solution. However, the per-unit cost will be in the range of $500 per GPU, depending on the specific model.

Project Battlematrix workstations, powered by Xeon processors, will come with up to eight GPUs, 192GB of total VRAM, and support up to 70B+ parameter models. 

Intel is working to deliver a validated full-stack containerized Linux solution that includes everything needed to deploy a system, including drivers, libraries, tools, and frameworks, that's all performance optimized, allowing customers to hit the ground running with a simple install process. Intel will roll out the new containers in phases as its initiative matures. 

Intel also shared a roadmap of the coming major milestones. The company is currently in the enablement phase, with ISV certification and the first container deployments coming in Q3, eventually progressing to SRIOV, VDI, and manageability software deployment in Q4. 

Intel's partners had multiple Project Battlematrix systems up and running live workloads in the showroom, highlighting that development is already well underway. 

One demo included a system running the full 675B parameter Deepseek model entirely on a single eight-GPU system, with 256 experts running on the CPU and the most frequently used experts running on the GPU. 

Other demos included running and finding bugs in code, an open enterprise platform for building RAGs quickly, and a RAG orchestration demo, among others. 

As noted above, the Intel Arc Pro B50 and Intel Arc Pro B60 will arrive on the market in the third quarter of 2025.

Nvidia opens up NVLink to external chipmakers. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia made a slew of announcements at Computex 2025 here in Taipei, Taiwan, focused on its data center and enterprise AI initiatives, including its new NVLink Fusion program that allows customers and partners to use the company's key NVLink technology for their own custom rack-scale designs. The program enables system architects to leverage non-Nvidia CPUs or accelerators in tandem with Nvidia's products in its rack-scale architectures, thus opening up new possibilities.

Nvidia has amassed a number of partners for the initiative, including Qualcomm and Fujitsu, who will integrate the technology into their CPUs. NVLink Fusion will also extend to custom AI accelerators, so Nvidia has roped in several silicon partners into the NVLink Fusion ecosystem, including Marvell and Mediatek, along with chip software design companies Synopsys and Cadence.

NVLink has served as one of the key technologies that assured Nvidia's dominance in AI workloads, as communication speeds between GPUs and CPUs in an AI server are one of the largest barriers to scalability, and thus peak performance and power efficiency.

Nvidia's NVLink is a proprietary interconnect for direct GPU-to-GPU and CPU-to-GPU communication that delivers far more bandwidth and superior latency than the standard PCIe interface, up to a 14X bandwidth advantage, even though it leverages the tried-and-true PCIe electrical interface.



Nvidia has increased NVLink's performance over the course of several product generations, but the addition of custom NVLink Switch silicon allowed the company to extend NVLink from within a single server node to rack-scale architectures that enable massive clusters of GPUs to chew through AI workloads in tandem. Nvidia's NVLink advantage has thus served as a core advantage that its competitors, such as AMD and Broadcom, have failed to match.

However, NVLink is a proprietary interface, and aside from the company's early work with IBM, Nvidia has largely kept this technology captive to products utilizing its own silicon. In 2022, Nvidia made its C2C (Chip-to-Chip) technology, an inter-die/inter-chip interconnect, available for other companies to use in their own silicon to facilitate communication with Nvidia GPUs by leveraging industry-standard Arm AMBA CHI and CXL protocols. However, the broader NVLink Fusion program is much broader, addressing larger scale-out and scale-up applications in rack-scale architectures using NVLink connections.

NVLink Fusion changes that paradigm, allowing Fujitsu and Qualcomm to utilize the interface with their own CPUs, thus unlocking new options. The NVLink functionality is integrated into a chiplet located next to the compute package. Nvidia has also roped in custom silicon accelerators, like ASICs, from designers MediaTek, Marvell, and Alchip, enabling support for other types of custom AI accelerators to work in tandem with Nvidia's Grace CPUs. Astera Labs has also joined the ecosystem, presumably to provide specialized NVLink Fusion interconnectivity silicon. Chipmaking software providers Cadence and Synopsys have also joined the initiative to provide a robust set of design tools and IP.

Qualcomm recently confirmed that it is bringing its own custom server CPU to market, and while details remain vague, the company's partnership with the NVLink ecosystem will allow its new CPUs to ride the wave of Nvidia's rapidly expanding AI ecosystem. 

Fujitsu has also been working on bringing its mammoth 144-core Monaka CPUs, which feature 3D-stacked CPU cores over memory, to market. “Fujitsu's next-generation processor, FUJITSU-MONAKA, is a 2-nanometer, Arm-based CPU aiming to achieve extreme power efficiency. Directly connecting our technologies to NVIDIA's architecture marks a monumental step forward in our vision to drive the evolution of AI through world-leading computing technology — paving the way for a new class of scalable, sovereign and sustainable AI systems,” said Vivek Mahajan, CTO at Fujitsu.

Nvidia is also releasing new Nvidia Mission Control software to unify operations and orchestration, optimizing system-level validation and workload management, a key capability that speeds time to market. 

Nvidia rivals Broadcom, AMD, and Intel are notably absent from the NVLink Fusion ecosystem. These companies, and many more, are members of the Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) consortium, which aims to provide an open industry-standard interconnect to rival NVLink, thus democratizing rack-scale interconnect technologies.  

Meanwhile, Nvidia's partners are forging ahead with chip design services and products the company says are available now.

Panther Lake comes screaming to market in early 2026. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel demoed working Panther Lake Core Ultra 300 silicon for laptops, its first chips based on its crucial 18A process node, here at Computex 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan. Unlike the first public demoes at CES 2025 that merely showed the chips powered on, Intel put Panther Lake its paces in real-time rendering and AI applications, showing that the silicon is healthy and on-track for retail availability in early 2026. Intel also shared more information about its performance and power consumtpion expectations for the new chips. 

As you can see in the image above, Intel also had a Panther Lake chip on display, enabling us to see how the CPU, GPU, I/O tile, and SoC tile are arranged on the package. These chips are thought to come with Cougar Cove P-cores and Darkmont E-cores (you can see the unconfirmed leaked specifications of some of the chip models here). 



Intel says the Panther Lake chips blend the power efficiency of Lunar Lake with the performance of Arrow Lake-H, noting that while the chips will be in production in the second half of 2025, presumably launched at CES, full retail availability will not come until early 2026. Intel did tease that the chips will come with the next-gen integrated graphics with XMX graphics, but aside from saying the iGPU performance will be closer to Lunar Lake than Arrow Lake, the company didn't elaborate. These iGPUs are thought to be based on the Xe3 architecture.

Intel ran its Panther Lake benchmarks on two Reference Validation Platforms (RVP) that you can see in the above album. These platforms are used to validate the design and emulate real-world conditions. Both RVPs were equipped with a heatsink and fan, so they were presumably operating without thermal constraints. 

Intel demoed one system running the newly-resurrected Clippy as a large language model to demonstrate that the chips are running AI workloads. The presenter used the system to write game code in Python code. Intel didn't share performance metrics from the benchmark. 

Intel also demoed a system running Da Vinci to edit and manipulate video using local AI processing to process the video, enabling fast manipulation of the video clip, such as changing backgrounds, clothing colors, and adding flying text to the clip. 

Intel also displayed a running developer kit that 300+ developers with ISVs are using to enable software support for the coming chips. Intel demoed the system being used for image editing with auto-coloring and upscaling features, powered, of course, by AI. As you can see in the album, the developer system is quite compact. Intel also had a host of laptops on display from its OEM partners.

All four SKUs feature USB Type-C connectivity, too.

Asus has brought the joy of wood grain to its graphics card lineup. The PC and components giant has just taken the wraps off its first RTX 50 graphics cards to swell the ranks of the ProArt family, and they all feature “a classy brown wood grain design.” Moreover, this first quartet of RTX 50 ProArt cards is the firm's “first to offer USB Type-C support for enhanced versatility for creative workflows.” Two of the models also sport an M.2 slot, which will please some users, as long as Asus's price premium isn't too ambitious.



The most desirable model among the new Asus ProArt GeForce RTX 5080 models is the OC Edition with M.2 SSD slot. We'd probably rank the non-overclocked M.2 slot packing card next, followed by the ProArt GeForce RTX 5080 OC, and then the ‘vanilla' but still wood effect finished and USB Type-C port packing model.

Regular readers will be well aware of the key attractions of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, and if not, please check out our extensive review and consider its place among the best graphics cards on the market in mid-2025. Asus has two new ProArt cards, which will offer ‘reference' specs, and two with an overclock applied to the GPU. We can't drill down on those figures, though, as Asus hasn't added the specs to the product pages at the time of writing.

Probably the more important differentiation here is with the cooler, M.2 slot, and USB Type-C connectivity, though. The Asus ProArt design looks a lot like a reskinned Prime card, but here it has ProArt motifs and the headlining wood grain effect along the top. Like you've installed a log in your GPU slot.

Asus's cooling system is listed as “2.5 slot small form factor size,” but it isn't low-profile or similar. The triple spinner design is taller than the PCI bracket and probably approaches 300mm in length. Asus says the cooler features a MaxContact design with vapor chamber, and there's a phase-change GPU pad between the cooler and the GPU to help keep this card cool, calm, and collected.



Moving along to the other special features here, all four new ProArt RTX 5080 models also feature USB Type-C support, which is great for a growing number of monitors and devices.

If you choose one of the models with an M.2 slot, you can benefit from up to PCIe Gen5 speeds. Moreover, the ample cooling of the graphics card should also cover the needs of any toasty SSD you might equip.

Some retro tech enthusiasts may be quite pleased to see the return of wood-effect finishes to tech. Whether it comes in the form of actual wood construction or parts, wood veneers, or even just wood-effect plastics – the look and feel can bring back fond memories of old tech and gadgetry like TV, Hi-Fi, and even games console systems.

With Asus introducing these ProArt designs, and knowing there are already numerous wood-finish cases around, the dreams of an all-wood finished PC are getting nearer. Wood finish keyboards and mice have been a thing for quite some time, and we also know there are wood finish CPU air coolers from DeepCool at Computex. A wood completist might still long for wood-finish motherboards, RAM, and storage. Finally, a wood-bezel monitor shouldn't be a big challenge to DIY-frame, if no firm steps forward with some lignin-lover options.

Forget about CES! The most important tech show of the year -- particularly if you care about PCs and PC hardware -- is Computex Taipei.

As always, we're on the ground in Taipei, attending the press conferences, meeting with companies and combing the show floor for interesting finds. After a turbulent first few months of 2025, the industry is out in force, ready to wow us with new products and features.

While we'll be posting lots of articles, we'll also be blogging the experience here, highlighting the coolest and weirdest stuff that's going on. We'll even be commenting on what it's like to visit Taipei, the tech capital of the world.

The RTX 5060 (and the long-awaited RTX 5060 driver) are now here, as is Asus' new RTX 5060 laptop lineup.



Computex 2025 isn't all motherboards and silicon; here are some snaps of the locale here in Taipei.



Check out ASUS' new Noctua triple-fan RTX 5080, as well as it's new external GPU dock, which we've been having a look at over on the floor.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says there is no evidence of AI chip diversion to blacklisted nations, in response to questions at Computex. Huang said countries and companies understand the rules and want to continue doing business with Nvidia.



As promised, MSI has unveiled its new EdgeXpert MS-C931 supercomputer, powered by Nvidia DGX Spark and capable of 1,000 TOPS FP4 performance.

Nvidia announced at Computex that it would be working with Foxconn to build an AI supercomputer in Taiwan featuring 10,000 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.

Alongside the aforementioned new Intel Arc Pro offerings, there's a brand new partner card from Maxsun that jams two Arc Pro B60 chips onto a single graphics card, replete with 48GB of total VRAM, or 96GB in a two-card configuration.





MSI's new X50 is a QD-OLED monitor and a 500 Hz refresh rate, but the headline is actually its new AI Care Sensor, which can detect when you're not looking at the monitor, powering down accordingly to reduce burn-in.

Intel has just unveiled its brand new Arc Pro B50, a compact graphics card for workstations with 16GB of VRAM and a starting price of $299. There's also a new Pro B60 with a hefty 24GB with a price tag of roughly $500 per unit.





We've all seen broken McDonald's order consoles running Windows 98 or some other such monstrosity, but how about this Computex display board that appears to have malfunctioned, revealing Windows 7 underneath.



Samsung has announced that it is finally adding support for Nvidia G-Sync in its 2025 OLED TV lineup, starting with the S95F.

Acer has unveiled the new Nitro PG271K monitor, featuring 4K at 72Hz, with DFR for 1080p at 144Hz, 0.5ms response time (GTG), USB-C, and HDMI ports.

There's also a new 32-inch ProCreator and a new portable PD163QT. Gamers will love the new Nitro GA341CUR W0, a 34-inch UWQHD display with a 240Hz refresh rate.

Morning folks, Stephen here picking up the live blog until 1pm ET - we're all over the Computex trade floor bringing you the latest insights and news, so stay tuned!



One of Nvidia's biggest announcements at Computex 2025 is a new NVLink Fusion program which allows customers and partners to use NVLink in their own custom rack-scale design. Here are all the details...



Day 1 of Computex 2025 is in full swing, and Intel is demoing working Panther Lake Core Ultra 300 silicon for its laptops, the first to use its 18A process node. We've been shown real-time rendering and AI applications ahead of its early 2026 launch.



The Nvidia keynote is underway and most of what CEO Jensen Huang is talking about has to do with AI development, not desktop computing. However, he just showed off the new RTX 5060 on stage, flashing an Asus-branded RTX 5060 GPU and an MSI laptop with RTX 5060 inside.

Huang didn't share any details about the cards, but lots of information has already come out. For example, we reported yesterday that the RTX 5060 is 25% faster than the 4060 with frame generation enabled.

While he spoke, Huang stood in front of a digital scene of a pond in a European city (it looked like Italy). He said that an RTX card (perhaps the 5060) was rendering only 1 out of every 10 frames in the scene, which showed candles floating over water. Instead, he said DLSS was generating 9 out of every 10 frames.



This is probably all we'll hear about PC gaming during this keynote.

""You know, when you're CEO, you have many children, and GeForce is here, and now all of our keynotes are 90% not GeForce,"" Huang said. ""But it's not because we don't love GeForce. GeForce RTX 50 series just had its most successful launch ever, the fastest launch in our history. And PC gaming is now 30 years old. So that tells you something about how incredible GeForce is.""



I've been on the ground (and sweating) in Taipei for a few days now, and one of the first things that always strikes me here is the plethora of billboards and signs for various laptops and PC components.



Sure, a lot of this gets ramped up ahead of Computex, and many are in and around the Guang Hua Digital Plaza area, where there are dozens (perhaps hundreds) of shops and storefronts that sell pretty much everything PC related, from high-end gaming laptops to obscure PC cases, and entire stores dedicated to MSI, Asus, Aorus – there's even a store that pretty much only sells Transcend storage devices and media.

But the ads exist away from the main tech district as well. Today I was walking to a record shop in an arts district, looked up and saw, of all things, a slim vertical billboard for power supply maker, Seasonic.



And later, as I was headed into an MRT (subway) station, making my way back to my hotel, there was a big banner for AMD's Ryzen 9000 CPUs above the train platform.



The only other place I've seen ads like this for PC components and the latest laptops is in Tokyo's famous Akihabara neighborhood during a visit in 2015 – where I bought a random wafer of chips at the back junk tech store that, sadly, was far too fragile to survive the trip home.



On the one hand, it's cool to see the PC hardware we obsess over getting the kind of treatment and attention that is more typically afforded to the latest attempt at a blockbuster movie or a tech startup flush with cash and looking to build brand recognition. And I certainly find ads for components more interesting and less annoying than most ads I see walking around our office neighborhood in Midtown Manhattan.But considering how much I already spend on PC hardware and related tech, I am not sure I'd want to be regularly be surrounded by ads reminding me that the Ryzen 9 9950X3D exists, making my perfectly capable 7950X feel outdated and inadequate, or that my RAM or storage isn't as fast as it could be.

Sure, signs and billboards that are more targeted to my PC interests are cool to see here in Taipei, but I really don't need any more “help” deciding when it's time to upgrade. After all, if I spend all my money on new tech, I won't have any left over to buy old records.

There are plenty of tasty and interesting snacks to be had at Taipei's night markets or the many (many) convenience stores. But I could help but pick up a couple of bags of spicy Guai Guai when I saw them today.For those not in the know, this brand of Cheetos-like (but usually sweet) snack is part of a tradition or superstition (take your pick) where engineers and tech workers place the snacks in and around important machines to help assure they function without problems. The phenomenon is so widespread that we've seen both TSMC- and AMD / Lisa Su-branded versions of the snacks debut (and reportedly quickly get bought up) in the last couple of years. And of course, both companies have seen new levels of success in the past several years. Maybe someone should tell Intel's new CEO to invest in some blue Guai Guai.Unsurprisingly, I couldn't find any of the TSMC or Ryzen varieties of the snacks, so these spicy ones will have to do. I'm going to leave them sitting on my laptop overnight, because it has a bad habit of blue-screening every week or so. Maybe the snacks will keep that from happening until I get home (or at least until I'm done reporting from Computex). If it doesn't work, I may have to ask AI for some help with my crash dumps.

-Matt Safford



Taipei is great for a lot of reasons. But as a bit of a coffee addict and snob, I really appreciate the abundance of coffee shops and roasters here. And the coffee (like most food here) is pleasantly affordable.

This iced Americano (unfortunately, the cold brew was sold out) from one of my favorite spots, Coffee Moon, was the equivalent of about $3. And that's on the expensive end. Major chains, like Louisa Coffee (I recommend the egg and peanut butter breakfast sandwich), tend to be cheaper. There are a lot of Starbucks here as well, but I'm not a fan – especially when there are so many other options.



I picked up some fresh-ground coffee for my travel-friendly Aeropress at Ikari Coffee (I like to think this chain is the Ikari Warriors retirement plan) for about $6 – enough for a week's worth of early mornings and late nights, and then some. It's going to be hard to go back to the $5 Dunkin' cold brew when I get back home, even if the sizes are much bigger.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says that there is no evidence of AI chip diversion to countries where the sale of said chips is prohibited, in response to questions at Computex 2025. Huang told Bloomberg that there is no evidence of diversions when it comes to its Grace Blackwell chips. Furthermore, he added that Nvidia's customers are well aware of the restrictions and that they are careful about it when selling to third parties.

“Governments understand that diversion is not allowed, and there's no evidence of any AI chip diversion — recognize our data center GPUs are massive; these are massive systems,” Huang said during the surprise questioning. “The Grace Blackwell system is nearly two tons, and so you're not going to be shipping — you're not going to be putting that in your pocket or your backpack anytime soon. And so, these systems are fairly easy to keep track of... but the important thing is that the countries and the companies that we sell to recognize that diversion is not allowed, and everybody would like to continue to buy Nvidia technology, and so they very well monitor themselves very carefully and they're quite careful about that.”

However, this doesn't seem to be the reality. After all, we've already heard of several instances of Nvidia AI GPUs getting past Washington's sanctions and getting into the hands of Chinese businesses. We've even seen one businessman showing off his smuggled H200 GPUs on X. Even as late as March 2025, there have been reports of Chinese entities using corporations registered in neighboring countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan to order these advanced chips and then reroute them to China.

Singapore has already started cracking down on this practice, and the U.S. has also asked Malaysian authorities to keep an eye on this black market and shut it down. However, Malaysian imports of advanced GPUs still surged by over 3,400% in early this year, raising alarm bells.

Huang also said that these servers are massive, weighing several tons, so tracking them shouldn't be difficult. But the company has also said that these AI chips are impossible to find after they're sold. That's why the U.S. Congress is considering legislation that would require companies to enable geo-tracking on high-end gaming and AI GPUs. Furthermore, weight and size are no issues when it comes to smuggling. After all, if stolen cars and SUVs can be smuggled across borders, then GPU servers are fair game as well, especially with the amount of money involved.

COMMENTARY

 DISCLOSURES Authors and DisclosuresAuthors

Interviewee: Axelle Hoge, PhD
Associate professor and public health researcher at the University of Liège, Liège, Belgium
Disclosure: Axelle Hoge, PhD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

Disclosure: Axelle Hoge, PhD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

The 9th edition of the “Nourrir Liège” festival was held in mid-April, with this year's theme centred on the concept of One Health — the interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health. Among the many conferences, one session focused on the hidden costs of food, offering a platform for Axelle Hoge, PhD, associate professor and public health researcher at the University of Liège, Belgium, to examine why many Belgians struggle with poor dietary habits and to propose actionable solutions.

The following interview was conducted by MediQuality, a Medscape Network platform, after her presentation at the event.

In your view, why is it now more difficult to clearly link nutrition and health? 

Today, it has become increasingly difficult for the general public, health professionals, and researchers to draw a direct connection between diet and health. This is largely due to the complexity of so-called societal diseases, which are typically multifactorial in nature. While diet clearly plays a recognized role in the development of conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and osteoporosis, it is only one of many contributing factors. Genetic predisposition, physical activity, exposure to environmental pollutants, and stress also influence the onset of these diseases. This interplay of multiple causes makes the relationship between diet and health more difficult to understand and quantify — even though we know that nutrition remains a major tool for disease prevention.

Was the association between diet and health more obvious in the past?

Yes, the connection used to be more apparent. In cases of nutritional deficiency, specific clinical symptoms would develop that directly pointed to the problem. I'm thinking, for example, of kwashiorkor or scurvy. It was immediately clear that the diet was lacking in either quantity or quality. Today, the situation is much more complex.

Do you think Belgian consumers are poorly informed about nutrition?

I believe they are generally aware of the main dietary recommendations. However, putting them into practice is another matter. For instance, does the average person really know what concrete steps to take to reduce their intake of unhealthy fats? I'm not so sure.

We need to move away from the idea that everything depends on information alone. For a long time, public health campaigns operated on the assumption that people simply didn't know what was good or bad for their health. That perspective is outdated. Knowledge alone is not enough to change behaviour.

Conditions like obesity and other diet-related diseases cannot be fully explained by individual choices. Our eating habits are heavily influenced by the environment in which we live. On one hand, there's the social environment — family, friends, and coworkers influence our eating behaviour through imitation and social norms. On the other hand, the physical environment — supermarkets, restaurants, schools, and workplaces — determines what foods are available, in what quantities, and at what prices. Finally, the macro-environment plays a role: food production, processing, and distribution systems, agricultural policies, and marketing all shape our dietary choices.

Have these three influencing factors — the social, physical, and macro-level environments — evolved in recent years?

Yes, all three have changed significantly over the past few decades, and these changes clearly contribute to the current rise in multifactorial diseases. Foods high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and salt have become much more widespread. Portion sizes have increased, and ready-made meals are more accessible than ever. At the same time, we now spend less time on meals, and the availability of fast food and the intensity of food marketing have exploded. Altogether, these shifts have altered our eating habits — often not for the better.

What do we know about the measurable links between diet and mortality?

One of the most comprehensive sources is the 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study, which evaluated the health effects of diet in 195 countries. The study found that approximately one in five deaths worldwide is attributable to dietary risks. In terms of morbidity, it estimated that around 255 million years of healthy life are lost annually due to chronic diseases worsened by poor diets.

Three specific dietary factors were identified as particularly harmful: excessive salt intake, low consumption of whole grains (such as wholemeal bread and brown rice), and insufficient fruit consumption. However, it's worth noting that the study focused solely on nutritional quality — factors like chemical contamination and the level of food processing were not included, even though they clearly play a role in health outcomes.

We often hear that ultra-processed products are harmful. Why is that?

In Belgium, about 35% of the adult population's daily caloric intake comes from ultra-processed foods, according to the NOVA classification. These are foods that have undergone extensive industrial processing, including chemical, biological, or physical transformations. Such processes alter the food matrix, which is the structural and functional architecture of a food item.

Two foods may have the same nutritional composition on paper but differ in matrix, leading to different effects on health. For example, in dairy products, changes to the matrix caused by processing can affect satiety and nutrient absorption. Additionally, ultra-processed foods often contain ingredients not typically found in traditional cooking, such as additives, colourings, artificial flavours, emulsifiers, hydrogenated oils, and modified proteins. A growing body of research links these ingredients to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic health conditions.

Could including the NOVA score on product labels positively influence consumer purchasing behaviour?

While information alone doesn't solve everything, it would likely raise public awareness about the degree of food processing and its impact on health. Currently, I believe most people are poorly informed on this issue — especially since the level of processing is not among the five core public dietary recommendations.

If both the NOVA score and the Nutri-Score were made mandatory on food labels, products receiving unfavourable ratings from both systems could face reputational and commercial consequences. That level of transparency could also motivate manufacturers to reformulate their products to improve health profiles.

There is scientific literature exploring how the two labelling systems could be combined. Unfortunately, given the European Commission's decision not to mandate the Nutri-Score, we do not appear to be heading in the right direction.

What solutions do you see for helping consumers make better dietary choices?

We need to implement changes at multiple levels of the food environment. A number of evidence-based interventions are already recognized by local, national, and international authorities. These include restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, tightening regulation of additives, taxing sugar-sweetened beverages, implementing policies that make fresh, minimally processed foods more accessible.

Equally important is providing comprehensive nutritional education from an early age. While these interventions can directly influence eating behaviours, they are not sufficient on their own.

On a broader scale, we need to rethink how food is produced, processed, and distributed. This calls for systemic change and agricultural policies that prioritize quality over quantity.

What role can health professionals play in encouraging this change?

A strong alliance between researchers, health professionals, activists, citizens, and environmental groups can form a meaningful counterbalance to dominant forces in the food system. This coalition has the potential to produce and share independent knowledge, mobilize public opinion, and influence policy change.

However, for such a movement to be truly impactful, it must be supported by a systemic understanding of food issues. That means institutional backing, sustained public funding, and a political will that prioritizes public health and the common good. Sadly, when we look at current debates — such as those around university funding — the direction does not appear promising.

Do you think health professionals' voices carry more weight with public authorities than others?

Yes, I believe health professionals can play a more central role. Their voices carry a high degree of public trust and credibility, which can shape public debate and influence decision-making.

That said, to make a lasting impact, health professionals need to be well-informed about the broader dimensions of food systems, including not only nutrition and patient care but also social, economic, and environmental factors.

Creating the conditions and support systems that enable their active participation in public discourse and advocacy is also crucial. There is still significant progress to be made in this area.

Despite the challenges, are you optimistic about the future of our diets?

I try to remain optimistic — especially as someone at the beginning of my career. Through my research, I'm increasingly aiming to contribute to policy discussions and engage with communities on the ground.

There are promising local initiatives, particularly in Liège, that show how things can move forward. While these efforts currently tend to reach more affluent populations, we're starting to see some projects extend to disadvantaged groups as well. That's an encouraging sign, especially since much remains to be done to reduce social inequalities in nutrition and health.

 May 19, 2025  

SAN DIEGO — A real-time, blood-sensing capsule (PillSense) is a safe and effective diagnostic tool for patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding that can aid patient triage, reduce unnecessary procedures, and optimize resource use, a study found.

Notably, patients with negative capsule results had shorter hospital stays and lower acuity markers, and in more than one third of cases, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was avoided altogether without any observed adverse events or readmissions, the study team found.

“Our study shows that this novel capsule that detects blood in the upper GI tract (PillSense) was highly sensitive and specific (> 90%) for detecting recent or active upper GI blood, influenced clinical management in 80% of cases and allowed about one third of patients to be safely discharged from the emergency department, with close outpatient follow-up,” Linda Lee, MD, medical director of endoscopy, Brigham and Women's Hospital and associate professor of medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was presented at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

EGD is the gold standard for diagnosing suspected upper GI bleeding, but limited access to timely EGD complicates diagnosis and resource allocation.

Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, PillSense (EnteraSense) is an ingestible capsule with a reusable receiver that provides a rapid, noninvasive method for detecting upper GI bleeding. The capsule analyzes light absorption to identify blood and transmits the result within 10 minutes.

Lee and colleagues evaluated the real-world impact of this point-of-care device on clinical triage and resource allocation, while assessing its safety profile.

They analyzed data on 43 patients (mean age 60 years; 72% men) with clinical suspicion of upper GI bleeding in whom the device was used. The most common symptoms were symptomatic anemia (70%), melena (67%), and hematemesis (33%).

Sixteen PillSense studies (37%) were positive for blood detection, and 27 (63%) were negative.

Compared to patients with a positive capsule results, those without blood detected by the capsule had shorter hospital stays (mean, 3.8 vs 13.4 days, P = .02), lower GBS scores (mean, 7.93 vs 12.81; P = .005), and fewer units of blood transfused (mean, 1.19 vs 10.94; P = .01) and were less apt to be hemodynamically unstable (5 vs 8 patients; P = .03).

Capsule results influenced clinical management in 80% of cases, leading to avoidance of EGD in 37% and prioritization of urgent EGD in 18% (all had active bleeding on EGD).

Capsule use improved resource allocation in 51% of cases. This included 12 patients who were discharged from the ED, six who were assigned an inpatient bed early, and four who underwent expedited colonoscopy as upper GI bleeding was ruled out, they noted.

Among the eight patients who did not undergo EGD, there were no readmissions within 30 days and no adverse events. There were no capsule-related adverse events.

“Clinicians should consider using this novel capsule PillSense as another data point in the management of suspected upper GI bleed,” Lee told Medscape Medical News.

“This could include in helping to triage patients for safe discharge from the ED or to more urgent endoscopy, to differentiate between upper vs lower GI bleed and to manage ICU patients with possible rebleeding,” Lee said.

Reached for comment, Shahin Ayazi, MD, esophageal surgeon, Director, Allegheny Health Network Chevalier Jackson Esophageal Research Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said this study is important for several reasons.

“Prior investigations have established that PillSense possesses a high negative predictive value for detecting upper GI bleeding and have speculated on its utility in triage, decision-making, and potentially avoiding unnecessary endoscopy. This study is important because it substantiates that speculation with clinical data,” Ayazi, who wasn't involved in the study, told Medscape Medical News.

“These findings support the capsule's practical application in patient stratification and clinical workflow, particularly when diagnostic uncertainty is high and endoscopic resources are limited,” Ayazi noted.

In his experience, PillSense is “highly useful as a triage adjunct in the evaluation of suspected upper GI bleeding. It provides direct and objective evidence as to whether blood is currently present in the stomach,” he said.

“In patients whose presentation is ambiguous or whose clinical scores fall into an intermediate risk zone, this binary result can provide clarity that subjective assessment alone may not achieve. This is particularly relevant in settings where the goal is to perform endoscopy within 24 hours, but the volume of consults exceeds procedural capacity,” Ayazi explained.

“In such scenarios, PillSense enables physicians to stratify patients based on objective evidence of active bleeding, helping to prioritize those who require urgent endoscopy and defer or even avoid endoscopic evaluation in those who do not. The result is a more efficient allocation of endoscopic resources without compromising patient safety,” he added.

Ayazi cautioned that the PillSense capsule should not be used as a replacement for clinical evaluation or established risk stratification protocols.

“It is intended for hemodynamically stable patients and has not been validated in cases of active or massive bleeding. Its diagnostic yield depends on the presence of blood in the stomach at the time of capsule transit; intermittent or proximal bleeding that has ceased may not be detected, introducing the potential for false-negative results,” Ayazi told Medscape Medical News.

“However, in prior studies, the negative predictive value was high, and in the present study, no adverse outcomes were observed in patients who did not undergo endoscopy following a negative PillSense result,” Ayazi noted.

“It must also be understood that PillSense does not localize the source of bleeding or replace endoscopy in patients with a high likelihood of active hemorrhage. It is not designed to detect bleeding from the lower GI tract or distal small bowel. Rather, it serves as an adjunct that can provide immediate clarity when the need for endoscopy is uncertain, and should be interpreted within the broader context of clinical findings, laboratory data, and established risk stratification tools,” he added.

The study had no specific funding. Lee and Ayazi had no relevant disclosures.

Oropouche virus (OROV) cases surged significantly in 2024 and early 2025, with almost 20,000 confirmed infections reported across Latin America and the Caribbean, including four deaths. The highest burden was observed in Brazil, followed by Peru and Cuba. This sudden spike has captured the attention of public health officials. What set the stage for its resurgence and rapid geographic spread?

Having followed arboviral outbreaks closely over the past few years, this sudden rise is concerning, not just for its scale but for its silence. Like dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, OROV is transmitted through the bite of infected arthropods, navigating a complex web of vectors, vertebrate hosts, and increasingly permissive environments. What makes OROV especially insidious is its dual-cycle transmission: an urban cycle dominated by Culicoides paraensis midges and a sylvatic cycle involving mosquitoes like Aedes serratus and Culex quinquefasciatus. First identified in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1950s and isolated in Brazil in 1960, OROV has since spread across the Amazon and other parts of Central and South America, with outbreaks driven by environmental changes, deforestation, urbanization, and human mobility. 

From a clinical standpoint, OROV presents much like dengue or chikungunya: fever, headache, muscle pain, and rash. But around 40% of those infected show no symptoms at all, which further complicates surveillance. And while most symptomatic cases resolve within 2 weeks, severe neurological complications, such as meningitis and encephalitis, are rare but possible. That alone should keep public health officials alert.

In February 2024, Rio de Janeiro confirmed its first case of Oropouche fever in a man who had returned from the Brazilian state of Amazonas, signaling the virus's expansion beyond its traditional hotspots in Amazonas, Acre, and Rondônia. Simultaneously, Brazil faced a severe dengue epidemic, surpassing one million cases in the first 2 months of 2024. The overlapping symptoms between Oropouche fever and other arboviruses suggest a significant underdiagnosis of Oropouche cases, creating a major challenge for the health system. 

In July 2024, Brazil reported the world's first deaths from OROV, involving two previously healthy women from the state of Bahia, highlighting the severity of the disease and the urgent need for enhanced surveillance and public health responses. 

In 2024, the highest burden of OROV infections was observed in Brazil (13,785 cases and all four deaths), Peru (1263), and Cuba (626). In early 2025 (epidemiological weeks 1-4), an additional 3765 confirmed cases were reported, predominantly in Brazil (3678), with smaller numbers in Panama (79), Cuba (4), Peru (2), and isolated imported cases in Canada, the United States, and Guyana. Since the last update in December 2024, 6990 new cases have been registered. Notably, Brazil also reported cases of possible vertical transmission in 2024, with five confirmed outcomes (four fetal deaths and one congenital anomaly), and several other fetal and neonatal outcomes remain under investigation.

In the United States, OROV cases surged in 2024, with 108 imported cases, predominantly in Florida. However, as of early 2025, only 14 additional cases were reported, reflecting either a decline in travel-related exposure or potential underdiagnosis. Imported cases were also detected in Canada (2 cases) and several European countries (30 cases), all linked to travel from endemic regions. 

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cases in the country have followed a travel-related pattern. While the absence of local transmission is reassuring, the presence of competent vectors such as C paraensis in several southern US states raises concerns about the potential for future outbreaks. The CDC emphasizes the importance of early detection, clinical awareness, and vector surveillance to prevent local establishment of the virus.

The rapid expansion of OROV is attributed to multiple interconnected factors. Climate change has played a significant role, as rising global temperatures, increased rainfall, and shifting humidity levels have created optimal breeding conditions for midges and mosquitoes, the primary vectors of the virus. Warmer climates accelerate the lifecycle of these arthropods, prolonging their activity and expanding their geographical range, which has contributed to the virus's emergence in non-endemic regions such as the Caribbean and southern United States. 

Deforestation and urbanization have further intensified the spread of OROV. The destruction of tropical forests in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru has brought human populations into closer contact with sylvatic virus reservoirs, including non-human primates and sloths, which serve as intermediate hosts. Simultaneously, unplanned urban expansion in Latin America has led to an increase in artificial water reservoirs, providing ideal breeding grounds for disease-carrying vectors. As rural populations migrate to urban centers, the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission in densely populated areas continues to rise. 

Another key factor is the increase in human mobility and globalization, which has significantly facilitated the spread of OROV beyond its historically endemic areas. Imported cases in the United States, Canada, and Europe demonstrate how infected travelers inadvertently carry the virus to non-endemic regions, increasing the likelihood of localized outbreaks. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that OROV RNA can persist in semen for up to 58 days, raising concerns over potential sexual transmission. While no confirmed cases of sexually transmitted OROV have been documented, the persistence of viral RNA in bodily fluids mirrors patterns seen in other arboviruses, such as Zika. This suggests that sexual transmission could play a role in maintaining OROV circulation outside vector-driven outbreaks, particularly in urban settings where direct human-to-human transmission may become a contributing factor. 

As OROV continues its rapid spread, the likelihood of its establishment in new regions, sustained transmission, and potential adaptation to different vectors poses an increasing concern. The overlapping impact of climate change, deforestation, urbanization, and human migration has accelerated the virus's expansion at an unprecedented rate. With the first confirmed deaths reported in 2024 and the continued increase in cases in 2025, urgent global interventions are required, including enhanced vector control strategies, improved diagnostic capabilities, and further research into sexual transmission and vaccine development. 

Researchers are employing advanced techniques to identify viral components that can stimulate the immune system, paving the way for potential vaccines. Several approaches are under investigation, including live attenuated vaccines, chemically inactivated vaccines, DNA-based vaccines, and protein-subunit vaccines. 

A promising candidate is a live attenuated vaccine derived from the weakened OROV strain, BeAn19991, which has shown positive results in animal studies and demonstrated safety and efficacy in a phase I trial with healthy volunteers, eliciting a strong immune response without serious side effects. Another innovative approach involves a vaccine utilizing a modified vesicular stomatitis virus to deliver OROV proteins. This vaccine has protected mice from the virus, indicating potential for human application. Advancements in reverse genetics are also anticipated to significantly aid vaccine development by enabling scientists to modify the virus's genetic material to create vaccines that elicit robust and targeted immune responses. Researchers are experimenting with various genetic modifications to attenuate the virus while maintaining its effectiveness as a vaccine. 

Insights from vaccine development for related viruses, such as Schmallenberg virus (SBV), Aino virus, and Akabane virus, are informing OROV vaccine research. These veterinary vaccines have successfully reduced or prevented infections in animals. For instance, a bivalent vaccine combining proteins from both SBV and Akabane virus has conferred protection in cattle. Additionally, DNA-based vaccines for these viruses have safeguarded mice by preventing weight loss and reducing viral levels in the blood. These cross-species insights offer hope — but human application is still a work in progress.

Developing a vaccine for OROV presents challenges due to the virus's genetic diversity and the necessity for broad protection against multiple strains. Although no licensed vaccines for OROV currently exist, ongoing research and clinical trials provide a promising foundation for the future prevention of Oropouche fever.

With no licensed vaccine available yet, we're left with traditional control measures: vector surveillance, environmental interventions, and public awareness. Governments must invest not just in emergency response, but in research, innovation, and early detection systems. Community education and personal protection — window screens, repellents, long sleeves — remain frontline defenses, especially for those living in or traveling to high-risk areas.

In response to the escalating threat of arboviral diseases, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Arbovirus Initiative on March 31, 2022. This initiative aims to monitor and control diseases caused by arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and yellow fever, by implementing an integrated approach across various sectors and disciplines. The initiative focuses on six key pillars: monitoring risk and anticipating epidemics, reducing local epidemic risks, strengthening vector control, preparing for pandemics, enhancing innovation in diagnostics and treatments, and building a coalition of partners.

Building upon this foundation, the WHO introduced the Global Strategic Preparedness, Readiness, and Response Plan in October 2024 to specifically target dengue and other Aedes-borne arboviruses. This plan outlines priority actions for countries to control transmission, emphasizing areas such as disease surveillance, laboratory activities, vector control, community engagement, clinical management, and research and development. The plan is designed to be implemented over 1 year, concluding in September 2025, and requires an estimated US $55 million to support health preparedness and response efforts. 

This plan aligns with existing strategies, including the Global Vector Control Response 2017-2030 and the Global Arbovirus Initiative. Factors such as unplanned urbanization, climate change, and increased international travel have contributed to the rapid geographical spread of these diseases, making a unified and comprehensive approach essential. 

Through these concerted efforts, the WHO aims to reduce the burden of arboviral diseases worldwide by enhancing surveillance, improving vector control, promoting research and innovation, and strengthening partnerships across sectors and regions. ""The next pandemic could very likely be due to a new arbovirus, and we already have some signals that the risk is increasing,"" said Sylvie Briand, WHO director of pandemic and epidemic diseases. ""Since 2016, more than 89 countries have faced epidemics due to the Zika virus. Given human mobility and urbanization, the risk of amplifying localized arbovirus outbreaks is real.""

TORONTO — Older patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) are known to have a higher overall risk for cancer than the general population, but new evidence from a large population-based study indicated that when these patients have concurrent breast, lung, prostate, or colorectal cancer — the four most common cancer types — their rates of overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) are similar to or better than those of patients with cancer alone.

Results from this new analysis of data from Medicare claims linked to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database also showed that the rates of OS and CSS were significantly higher for patients with axSpA and concomitant colorectal cancer than for patients with colorectal cancer but not axSpA, even though past evidence suggested that for older patients with some other rheumatic diseases, there are worse cancer survival outcomes — for instance, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and concomitant breast or prostate cancer and those with systemic lupus erythematosus and breast cancer.

“We're not entirely sure why survival rates were higher in colorectal cancer patients with axSpA, but it's likely the use of [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] NSAIDs in the treatment of axSpA played a role,” study presenter Savannah M. Bowman, MD, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston told Medscape Medical News at the Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The hazard ratio (HR) for 5-year OS from colorectal cancer in patients with axSpA was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.62-0.83; P < .0001), and the HR for 5-year CSS was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.55-0.97; P = .03).

There were also no significant differences in OS and CSS in patients with axSpA and concomitant breast, prostate, or lung cancer compared with patients with cancer alone, with HRs of 0.87, 0.97, and 0.94, respectively.

When asked to comment on the study findings, John D. Reveille, MD, professor of rheumatology at the University of Texas McGovern Medical School, Houston, said that the better survival rates seen in patients with axSpA may result from the close monitoring they receive because of their increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease.

“It's likely these patients had colonoscopy [or other colorectal cancer screenings], and that this detected cancer earlier [than in patients without axSpA]. This would have resulted in better survival,” said Reveille, who was not involved in the study.

For the analysis, Bowman and study co-authors examined data from 6103 patients, with and without axSpA, and a primary diagnosis of breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2006 and 2019. Of these patients, 2061 had breast cancer, 1988 had prostate cancer, 1234 had lung cancer, and 820 had colorectal cancer. The mean age ranged from 74 to 77 years.

Patients in the axSpA cohorts were required to have two or more claims with a diagnosis of axSpA either 12 months before or after cancer diagnosis. They were matched to controls by gender, cancer type and stage, age at cancer diagnosis, and year of cancer diagnosis.

Patients with diagnostic claims for connective tissue diseases were excluded from the control cohorts.

Survival time was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazard regression models were performed for each type of cancer and adjusted for competing risks for CSS.

“Further research is needed to explore the potential reasons for longer survival in elderly patients with colorectal cancer and axSpA compared to those without axSpA,” the investigators concluded.

Reveille agreed. “The lack of previous research on colorectal cancer in axSpA patients suggests a need for further studies,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Bowman said she plans to use the IQVIA claims database to conduct the same analysis in younger patients. She would also like to analyze the impact of treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin 17 inhibitors, and Janus kinase inhibitors on cancer outcomes in patients with axSpA.

Reveille reported having a relationship with Surf Therapeutics. Bowman reported having no potential conflicts of interest. Two study co-authors reported having numerous financial relationships with industry.

Dermatology residency programs saw modest gains in racial and ethnic diversity from 2020 to 2024, but underrepresented groups remain disproportionately low compared with their share of the US population.

“Despite incremental improvements in diversity, sustained mentorship, pipeline development, and outreach efforts remain the key drivers of these gains,” the study authors wrote. “To ensure long-term progress, residency programs should track diversity metrics to better align recruitment with the demographics of their local communities,” they added.

The study was led by Devin Barzallo, BA, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland. It was published online on May 14 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and moderate to severe depressive symptoms were less likely to achieve low disease activity (LDA) and inactive disease following the initiation of systemic therapy than those with axSpA but with mild or no depressive symptoms, according to an analysis of data from the register.

""[The study finding] highlights the need to integrate more objective measures of disease activity in axSpA and carefully consider the role of comorbidities like depression in interpreting PROs [patient-reported outcomes] and guiding clinical decisions,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Andreas Reich, German Rheumatology Research Center (DRFZ Berlin), Berlin, Germany. It was published online on May 08, 2025, in RMD Open.

This study lacked a formal diagnosis of depression and robust objective parameters for evaluating disease activity in axSpA; the heavy reliance on patient-reported outcomes was also an important limitation.

RABBIT-SpA was supported by a joint, unconditional grant from AbbVie, Amgen, Biocon, Biogen, Celltrion, Hexal, Janssen-Cilag, Lilly, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, and UCB.

Michael A. Bernstein, MD, can't contain his curiosity when he hears the common claim: This is the worst allergy season ever. “I feel like the current season is always said to be ‘the worst' for allergies, but it's difficult to know how bad any season is until it's actually over,” said Bernstein, a pulmonologist at Stamford Health, Stamford, Connecticut. What's easier to acknowledge, however, is the number of patients requiring treatment for seasonal allergies, including those with chronic lung disease, continues to escalate.

As more patients experience greater allergy symptom severity with each calendar year, Bernstein and other physicians are often establishing appropriate care planning for patients in real time. While there's a certain level of unpredictability to accept with allergies, there's also evidence that defines effective strategies based on each patient's symptom portfolio, age, chronic lung conditions, and the time of year. Many of the protocols used by today's specialists are born out of a better understanding of why seasonal allergies are on the rise and how environmental clues can assist patients.

Numerous factors are increasing the rate of allergy diagnoses. Among them is a heightened awareness about outdoor and indoor aeroallergens — airborne substances such as pollen from grass, weeds, trees, and plants; fungi and mold spores; dust mites; animal dander; and insect debris that can trigger a cascade of hay fever–related symptoms. But the lead cause of more allergies today is primarily the effect of global climate change, most notably changes in seasonal variation and increased production of pollen. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the earth's average surface temperature has become consistently warmer since the late 19th century, with 2023 ranking as the warmest year (by a wide margin) since global temperature records began in 1850. The 10 individual warmest years have all occurred since 2014, per the NOAA.

“Because of climate change, the winter season is now shorter,” explained Bernstein. “When you're robbing days from winter, you're adding days to spring. Whereas allergy season previously started toward the end of April or the beginning of May, we're now seeing it begin early in April or even March. The season now starts further back.”

It is estimated that the typical allergy season is 13 days longer than it once was, said Purvi S. Parikh, MD, an allergist at New York University Langone Health, New York City. “We have fewer ‘frost-free' days today as well, and these are the types of days when pollen can form.”

Compounding the issue is an increase in carbon dioxide levels, which allows for more efficient photosynthesis, leading to more pollen.

“The pollen itself is becoming more allergenic, meaning its structure is evolving to be more likely to cause allergies,” said Parikh, who also pointed to basic human genetics and other circumstances as associated allergy culprits.

“You only need one parent with allergies to increase your risk [of eventually developing allergies], along with lack of exposure to good bacteria and microorganisms that protect us from being allergic,” she said. “An increase in urban living away from farmland has also done a disservice to our immune systems because urbanization exposes us more to carbon emissions and ozone that worsen with climate change. And the foods that we eat with pesticides or that are processed can also disrupt our internal microbiome and immune systems.”

Despite the potential for allergy symptoms to mimic various chronic lung conditions, allergy symptoms can likely be identified temporally.

“Ultimately, it's that their clinical symptoms worsen episodically during times when you know the pollen count is high,” said David Beuther, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at National Jewish Health, Denver. “In addition to their chronic condition, we're also seeing rhinitis — it's itching, sneezing, watery eyes, nasal drainage, congestion — and sometimes, this puts them at risk for worsening lung problems or sinus infections. There's that clinical timing of symptoms that are big clues.”

Beuther estimates that asthma is most likely to occur in conjunction with allergies, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), “because asthma is typically more chronic year-round,” said Beuther. “For a subset of patients, allergens in the environment are a trigger for their asthma to worsen. But independent of that, patients who have sinus issues caused by allergies can actually lead to their asthma becoming uncontrolled, or not well controlled, when those conditions are most active.”

Inflammation within the nasal passages caused by allergies can lead to enhanced inflammation of the airways and worsen asthma. Additionally, persistent coughing can cause an irritation of the airway, and nerves that become irritated can cause bronchial spasms when they're triggered. “But there are also asthma patients who say they have no response to allergens,” Beuther said. “So there's variability. Inflammation caused by seasonal allergies can also disrupt the normal mucosal barrier that serves as the immune system's ‘first line of defense,' leaving patients at increased risk of developing upper respiratory tract infections, which are a major driver of asthma and COPD exacerbations.”

As a heterogeneous disease, COPD can mimic allergy symptoms or be exacerbated during allergy season, making it difficult to decipher the cause of symptoms. “I see many COPD patients who experience worse symptoms when their nasal passages are congested, or they're sneezing or coughing,” said Beuther. “You may see some patients who say their COPD is worse seasonally, similar to those with asthma. That's important to know.”

Patients with cystic fibrosis, however, are less likely to experience seasonal allergy aggravation of the condition. “I don't know that we spend a lot of time worrying about allergies with these patients,” said Beuther. “But what we more often see is that cystic fibrosis affects the nasal passages and the sinuses so much from the disease alone that the allergy issue is not felt to be that much more.”

According to Sobia Farooq, MD, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, mild to moderate warning signs of an allergy exacerbating a chronic lung condition include increased coughing, especially at night or early morning; chest tightness or discomfort; increased nasal congestion; sneezing; postnasal drip that triggers wheezing; noticeable drop in peak flow readings; and more frequent use of a rescue inhaler.

Warning signs requiring immediate care include shortness of breath during minimal exertion or while at rest, wheezing that doesn't improve with standard medication, lack of relief when using a rescue inhaler, a persistent drop in peak flow below 50% of personal best, difficulty speaking in full sentences, blue lips or fingernails, and showing signs of fatigue or confusion. “When seasonal allergies start to worsen chronic respiratory symptoms, early recognition is critical,” said Farooq. There are also patients who are diagnosed with perennial rhinitis defined by yearlong nasal congestion and drainage, which can be linked to external triggers or be experienced unrelated to environmental allergens.

“It depends on the patient,” said Bernstein. “We know that some patients' chronic lung disease is made worse by allergy triggers. But for some, as their lung disease gets worse than it was earlier in their life, they're going to have more impact by the allergens in the air. We don't see as many people ‘growing out' of their allergies anymore — which I'm not really sure if that was ever true.”

Multiple options are available for treating seasonal allergies, as well as routes of administration that offer certain tradeoffs, including intranasal medications, pills or liquids, eye drops, and injections.

“I often recommend 24-hour, non-drowsy antihistamines — particularly those that don't cross the blood-brain barrier, so there's no drowsiness or ‘brain fog,'” said Parikh. “Also, steroid nasal sprays, antihistamine nasal sprays, and eye drops. Start your patients on their controller medications for allergies and asthma as early in the year as possible, as it's easier to target allergies proactively rather than retroactively. If they suffer every year, consider immunotherapy or allergy shots, which actually decrease allergies over time and are the closest thing to a ‘cure.'”

Farooq also suggests the use of sublingual tablets to help with potentially reducing long-term sensitivity.

Physicians suggest allergy season is not the time to tinker with medications prescribed for chronic lung disease regardless of allergy severity. Instead, take stock of those with confirmed allergies and plan patient referrals to an allergist if they're not already seeing a specialist.

“The first question for patients who have chronic lung disease is to determine if they have seasonal allergies,” said Bernstein. “Ask if they've previously had symptoms and, if so, what time of year do they happen and what triggers their allergies. If they have seasonal allergies and their breathing is worse during seasonal allergy times, that's not a great time to make major moves with their medications. For most of my patients with chronic lung conditions, April, May, and June tend to be the months when I won't take them off medications. Even if they're doing well, I'll suggest that we get to the end of June and then see how they do when stopping their medication. Because if we stop in the middle of allergy season and they get worse — you won't know if it's the allergy season or if they needed the medication.”

Bernstein also suggests timing routine and follow-up appointments for patients with allergies. “The worst thing that you can do is try to play catch-up during allergy season,” he said. “But if you get patients started before the spring, you'll have time to help them prevent the symptoms that they have at their worst time of the year.” Mainstay treatments for Bernstein include corticosteroid nasal sprays. “Oral antihistamines will also certainly help, but they have side effects such as drowsiness and dry mouth that can become issues for patients. And antihistamines, particularly in older patients who are on other medications, get more complicated to use. If you can avoid that it will help.”

Beyond medications, avoiding exposure to allergens can also reduce symptom severity. “Allergens tend to be the worst at dawn and dusk,” said Bernstein. “On the highest allergy days, being inside air-conditioned environments is suggested. Don't have patients taking walks during early evenings unless they're walking inside.” These measures can potentially complicate typical self-care among chronic lung patients, however.

“For many of these patients, the best advice you give them is to exercise, so it's a problem when pollen is thick in the air during the spring or when there's wildfires during the summer because taking a walk outside is not going to be the most beneficial recommendation for their health,” said Bernstein. “Some patients benefit from walking outside with a mask.”

Parikh also advises that patients change their clothes when at home during high-pollen days and showering to wash off any pollen to decrease exposure. “Keep windows closed early in the morning for the same reason,” she said.

If such precautions aren't taken, allergy severity can peak. “Two of the issues for patients with chronic lung disease is they'll get bronchial constriction or tightening or narrowing of the airways in their lungs,” said Bernstein. “This can manifest in wheezing, and that's directly triggered by the allergens in the air. The other is increased mucus production, where mucus builds up in their airways, and they have to cough it up and clear it out. These are constant struggles for some of these patients, and if they have severe allergies, you're taking what's their normal baseline and making it worse.”

Bernstein also warned that some prescribed medications, such as beta-blockers metoprolol and carvedilol, have been known to worsen allergy symptoms. Conversely, drugs prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory conditions can actually help with allergies. “Some patients will experience lessened allergy symptoms when they're started on anti-inflammatory medications just as an added bonus to being treated for those conditions,” Bernstein said. “With COPD, we are increasingly using the medication Dupixent. This can help with allergies regardless of how it treats COPD.” During allergy seasons, physicians can also add bronchodilators or leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast, suggests Farooq.

Poorly controlled allergies can also lead to another general health malady that has a tendency to be overlooked, said Beuther — poor sleep quality due to overnight coughing and congestion. “It's very clear from the care of our patients that the impact on sleep and quality of life from allergies can make the experience of a chronic lung disease worse,” he said. “Imagine that you're someone with any chronic lung disease. You're struggling to breathe, you're having cough and mucus from your lungs, you might be on oxygen. And now we're adding a nose that's plugged up and you're not sleeping.”

Allergy symptoms during evening hours can be reduced with steam humidifiers, the use of high-efficiency particulate air filters, and peak flow monitoring with a digital app. Other digital tools or telehealth can also support patients in logging symptom cadence.

Updating action plans with clear steps for managing worsening symptoms will also reduce potential for emergency department visits, said Farooq. “This type of care coordination between pulmonologists, allergists, and primary care physicians, as well as patient education, all improve outcomes,” she said.

Farooq and Bernstein reported having no relevant financial relationships. Beuther reported being a paid consultant for AstraZeneca, and Parikh reported being a paid partner and healthcare practitioner spokesperson for Opella.

In the exam room, pediatricians witness a wide range of fears in children, from fear of getting a shot to social shyness to performance anxiety before a big game or college applications. Anxiety in youth is universal and developmentally normal, although it may signal a disorder when it is impairing function or clearly disproportionate to the stressor. 

It also always presents an opportunity: to nurture courage. Courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to act in spite of it. Courage is also an essential skill for mental health across the lifespan. Courage empowers a child to explore a new interest or face a bully, fuels a teenager to ask someone on a date or to accept treatment for their drug abuse, and equips an adult to leave a bad relationship or to run for office. Cultivating courage builds self-knowledge, resilience, autonomy, and emotional maturity. 

Pediatricians are uniquely positioned to counsel patients and their parents in practical strategies to foster courage across developmental stages. You can normalize discussions around anxiety, fear, and courage during well-child visits. Brief, open-ended questions — such as “What's something that felt a little scary for your child recently?” — can open the door to valuable conversations. Reassure parents that their support is critical, even though progress may feel slow. With your encouragement, parents can nurture courage in their children.

Strength is a good paradigm, because courage is a set of skills — cognitive, emotional, and behavioral — that we build by facing challenges. Courage is built upon the ability to bear the discomfort of uncertainty and anxiety, to consider different choices available in the face of a challenge, and to move from thinking to taking action. The anxiety of a personal failure prevents some children from even trying or having the grit to persevere while in the learning phase of any activity. Courage is partially built on self-esteem.

Different children have different temperaments and histories. They will experience anxiety in response to different challenges and in different ways. Parents are the experts on their children. They are uniquely equipped to stay connected to their child when they meet a moment of difficulty. With support, a child can face and manage that moment. That is courage. There will be discomfort, setbacks, and failures. But in trying, children are building the skills that are essential to their mental health. And they will be deepening their knowledge of themselves, their empathy, and their resilience in the process.

Naming emotions gives children the power to learn how to manage them. When they can say, “I feel nervous,” they can bear it a little longer and learn what they need to do to handle big feelings while taking action.

Avoidance reinforces anxiety. Instead, help parents find opportunities to guide their children through small steps toward managing and eventually mastering what they fear. Talk about what makes each step doable and whether it gets easier with practice.

Fear of failure is a major barrier to courage. Parents can remind children that mistakes are how we learn. There are no successes without many small failures first! 

Courage is contagious. Younger children emulate adult behavior and teenagers are watching what adults do more than listening to what they say. Parents model courage by trying new things, acknowledging when they're anxious, and demonstrating tenacity in the face of uncertainty or setbacks. They should talk about what helps them be courageous and that each of us learns our own strategies.

Infants and toddlers have everything to learn about the world, but their most important education is through moment-to-moment interactions with their attuned caregivers. This is how they develop a secure base from which to explore. This secure attachment is the cornerstone of self-esteem and creates the foundation of their future mental health.

Imagination flourishes — and so do fears. Monsters under the bed or fear of the dark are common during this phase of magical thinking.

Children have all the cognitive tools of adulthood but are still emotionally young. They have great capacity for empathy and prioritize fair play as they begin facing academic, social, and moral challenges. Peer comparisons and performance anxiety may rise.

Teens are establishing their identity, deeper relationships, independence, and impulse control. They are wired to tolerate higher levels of risk in the pursuit of novel experiences, especially in a social context. The need for courage in these years often arises when they face social stigma (facing a bully, resisting peer pressure, or managing embarrassment) or when they face letting go of something familiar to try something new.

Whether they have an anxious temperament, a history of trauma, or an underlying anxiety disorder, some children will struggle with anxiety. They will need specialized skill building and support to develop courage. Perform a Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) for a child if:

If the screen is positive, work with the parents to locate a psychiatrist or a therapist who has experience treating anxiety disorders in children.

Helping children become courageous doesn't require heroism — it requires small, consistent efforts by supportive adults. Pediatricians play an essential role by guiding parents to foster courage as an important developmental skill. When youth and their parents understand that courage is a critical part of a healthy and full life, a skill that is developed over time, they can face sources of anxiety not as things to be avoided but instead as precious opportunities to build courage. And those children will become adults who are equipped to meet life's challenges with courage.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Changing the prescribing protocol for low-dose aspirin (LDA) for preeclampsia prevention from risk-based to universal significantly increased aspirin use in pregnant patients, based on new data presented at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The use of LDA to reduce the risk for preeclampsia has been well established as an inexpensive and simple intervention, but it has remained underutilized nationwide, said lead author Meryl Y. Grimaldi, MD, of SBH Health System, New York City, in an interview.

“Many of the patients we care for at SBH Health are at high risk for preeclampsia, but we wanted to ensure that our eligible patients received the benefits of this intervention,” said Grimaldi, who presented the study at the meeting.

A low rate of LDA use, defined as 25%-50% of eligible patients, is considered a quality gap by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Grimaldi and colleagues noted in their abstract. The current ACOG criteria for use of LDA to prevent preeclampsia include not only high-risk patients but also women with more than one of the following moderate risk factors: First pregnancy, maternal age ≥ 35 years, body mass index > 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history.

“We hypothesized that the majority of our patients were eligible to receive low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia, but I was surprised that the rate was so high at more than 96%,” Grimaldi told Medscape Medical News. Moving from risk-based to universal recommendations increased the rates of prescribing LDA, she said.

In the study, Grimaldi and colleagues reviewed data from charts of 116 patients with a gestational age of 12-28 weeks between February 2024 and May 2024 at a single center. The researchers assessed the charts for preeclampsia risk factors, eligibility for aspirin based on ACOG guidelines, and whether aspirin was prescribed. A policy of universal prescribing of LDA for preeclampsia prevention began in 2023. 

Prior to this change, LDA prescriptions were risk-based and for approximately 30% of patients, then increased to 46% of patients shortly after the shift to universal prescribing. During the study period, use of LDA increased to 81% overall and 88% in patients with high-risk factors.

We assumed universal candidacy was an effective intervention, as indicated by the increased prescribing rates, Grimaldi told Medscape Medical News. Similarly, high-risk populations might benefit from this universal approach to other prenatal care practices, she added.

“This change in practice would not be applicable to a population at lower risk for preeclampsia,” Grimaldi told Medscape Medical News. “Other approaches, such as EMR [electronic medical record] practice advisories, patient and provider education, and patient questionnaires, can be utilized where universal implementation is inappropriate,” she said.

“Based on our population, we developed a quick screener that could detect most eligible patients with four demographic factors that are in the medical record; this would also be an option to explore,” Grimaldi noted.

Administration of LDA has been shown to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, especially preterm preeclampsia, and this risk continues to rise with the increased risk for hypertension, obesity, and diabetes in the pregnant population, said Aleksandr M. Fuks, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee, in an interview.

“Aspirin, being essentially the only medication available to reduce the risk of preeclampsia, represents a unique opportunity for healthcare professions to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancy,” he said.

The current study showed a significant increase in the use of LDA in the study population, and although the program's success was not unexpected, Fuks commended the study authors on their implementation of an important quality care initiative.

However, the barriers to increasing use of LDA as preeclampsia prevention include not only patient access to prenatal care and compliance with medication intake, but also late initiation of prenatal care, as administration of aspirin beyond the early weeks of the third trimester has not shown a significant effect on preeclampsia prevention, Fuks said.

“The possible solution includes patient education with respect to timely and early initiation of prenatal care, patient education regarding risks of preeclampsia and the role of aspirin in its prevention, outreach efforts to communities, and preconception counseling with emphasis on patients' comorbidities and associated disorders in pregnancy and their prevention,” Fuks added.

The main limitation of the study is its retrospective design, relatively small inclusion period, and the inability to address the secondary goal of reduction in the development of preeclampsia in the study population, Fuks told Medscape Medical News.

Future research should focus on the analysis of the rate of preeclampsia in the study population who initiated LDA and comparison to retrospective or concurrent cohorts of patients who had only baseline rates of LDA use, said Fuks. “A larger time interval and multicenter design may be helpful in validating the results of the study and to assess receptivity of different population groups to early initiation of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy,” he said.

The study received no outside funding. Grimaldi had no financial conflicts to disclose. Fuks had no financial conflicts to disclose.

This transcript has been edited for clarity.

Today we're going to discuss a new clinical practice guideline from the Alzheimer's Association on the evaluation and testing for Alzheimer's and related dementias. This is an important area for us in primary care because we are the first clinicians that most patients see when they are concerned they may be having memory problems or dementia symptoms. It's a challenging area and this document provides much-needed guidance.

The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling, and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD-ADRD) recommends a three-step approach to diagnosis. The first step is to assess whether there's a cognitive deficit. If there is a cognitive deficit, then assess whether that deficit fits mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or whether it fits mild, moderate, or severe dementia. Remember the main difference between MCI and dementia is that dementia, by definition, interferes with the capacity for independent everyday activities.

It's important to get a history from both the patient and a significant other, with attention to activities of daily living, time course of the cognitive decline, and any potential precipitating factors. Patients themselves may not always give the best personal history to provide a complete picture of what's going on, due to factors such as memory impairment, embarrassment, or a lack of self-awareness. In addition, the DETeCD-ADRD guideline recommends performing a mental status exam using a validated instrument like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment or the Mini Mental State Examination. If that evaluation shows that the patient is cognitively unimpaired, then no further evaluation is needed and we can educate the patient about brain healthy behaviors and, of course, plan for follow-up assessment. If the patient does show evidence of cognitive impairment, then it's important to define the effect of that impairment on the patient's function.

The second step in the evaluation is to characterize the clinical profile of a patient's cognitive-behavioral syndrome. What this means is that we want — to the degree that is reasonable — to delineate the domains of impairment, which might include memory, executive function, attention, language, and emotional and social functioning. Here's where neuropsychological testing can be helpful, if it's available. These first two steps allow us to develop a plan for personalized care and support.

The third step is testing to help figure out the cause of the patient's symptoms. It's important to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from Alzheimer's disease–related dementias (ADRD), such as frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, multi-infarct or vascular dementia, or mixed vascular and Alzheimer's dementia. It's also important to determine if the cognitive decline is caused by or being made worse by other diseases like depression, sleep apnea, and B12 deficiency or if other factors like the effect of medications (eg, anticholinergics and alcohol) are contributing to the cognitive or behavioral symptoms.

Step 3 of the evaluation includes ordering what the guidelines refer to as “tier 1 laboratory studies.” They are first tier because these are laboratory studies that are considered routine and should be ordered for all patients who have MCI or dementia. The recommended labs should include a complete blood cell count with differential, complete metabolic panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone, vitamin B12, homocysteine, and C-reactive protein levels. In addition, the DETeCD-ADRD guideline recommends that physicians order imaging, preferably a brain MRI without gadolinium or, if MRI is contraindicated, a noncontrast head CT. The MRI can rule out tumor, show multiple infarcts, or show regional atrophy patterns that may suggest specific neurodegenerative pathologic changes — but it's important to recognize that the MRI is not in any way diagnostic.

The guideline recommends against using the term “labs for reversible causes of dementia” because the labs only rarely uncover a cause for dementia that is reversible. The guideline authors cite a meta-analysis that showed less than 1% of dementia syndromes are reversible, but nearly 10% of people with dementia have a common comorbid condition that may be contributing to their decrement in cognitive function. This certainly fits my experience. The preferred term for tier 1 labs is a “cognitive lab panel.” Additional testing, termed tier 2 and 3 tests, are only recommended when necessary on an individual basis. These can include sleep studies and antinuclear antibody, folate, ammonia, lead, Lyme antibody, rapid plasma reagin, and HIV tests. Of course, there are plenty more tests that can be done in specific circumstances.

Now what's missing here? How about blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease? I recently reviewed the Alzheimer's Association workgroup recommendations on revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease. The key principle which that guideline lays out is that Alzheimer's disease is defined by its biology — neuropathologic changes in the brain, like deposition of amyloid and tau protein. We are now on the cusp of having blood-based biomarkers for amyloid beta and p-tau that will enable us to either rule in or rule out Alzheimer's disease with a high degree of accuracy. It's important to recognize that while the biomarkers are promising and will be incredibly useful, they still need to be further validated in large populations. And although the blood biomarkers can now be ordered through many lab tests, there is not yet a biomarker that is fully approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In my opinion, start to understand the place of blood biomarkers now, because once they are regulatory approved, they'll become a routine addition to the initial panel of laboratory tests that we typically order when evaluating patients for dementia.

Finally, I was thrilled to see that the guidelines specifically acknowledge that in the primary care setting, two or more problem-focused visits would usually be required to assess for dementia. I certainly find that to be the case. When there's uncertainty with regard to diagnosis, early age of onset, rapid progression, and/or consideration of biologic therapy, then referral to a dementia specialist makes sense.

This is an important update and it provides a clear, straightforward approach which allows us to evaluate patients for dementia with confidence. I'm interested in your thoughts, please leave them in the comments section below. For Medscape, I'm Dr Neil Skolnik.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

MINNEAPOLIS — Virtual reality (VR) was associated with significant reduction in pain and anxiety in Ob/Gyn settings, according to a systematic review presented at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 2025 Annual Meeting.

“Women's pain has historically been under-recognized and undertreated in clinical settings, including in obstetrics and gynecology,” said lead and presenting author Surina Khurana, a medical student at the University of California, Irvine, in an interview.

“With VR emerging as a promising tool for pain and anxiety management in other fields, we saw an important opportunity to explore its potential in Ob/Gyn care,” she said. “As VR technology becomes more accessible, understanding how it can be integrated into routine practice is critical,” Khurana added.

Khurana and colleagues identified 34 studies published between 2013 and 2024 on the use of VR to alleviate pain and anxiety in Ob/Gyn. Approximately one third (35%) of the studies involved the use of VR in labor; the second most common use was hysteroscopy (18%).

Overall, 78% of studies in which pain was an outcome measure showed significant reductions in pain among patients who experienced VR compared with control groups. Similarly, 71% of studies in which anxiety was an outcome measure showed significant reductions in anxiety with VR vs control groups.

“One of the striking findings was the rapid growth in research on this topic in recent years,” Khurana told Medscape Medical News. “Although our review covered studies published between 2013 and 2024, nearly all the studies were published in 2020 or later,” she said. The sharp uptick highlights the growing interest in using VR as a non-pharmacologic tool for pain and anxiety management, potentially spurred by early success in other specialties, as well as an increasing focus on patient experience, said Khurana. The increase also “reflects a momentum in the field that we hope continues,” she said.

Most of the VR experiences used in the studies were designed to calm and distract patients, such as immersive nature scenes or relaxing environments, and were delivered via headsets, said Khurana. “These tools aim to redirect attention away from the procedure and toward a more soothing sensory experience,” she said.

Barriers to widespread implementation of VR in Ob/Gyn include not only the upfront cost of the devices and the need for internet access to download or stream content but also the logistical challenges of incorporating VR into fast-paced clinical workflows, Khurana told Medscape Medical News. “Overcoming these hurdles will require institutional support, provider training, and clear protocols for integrating VR into patient care,” she said.

“As a systematic review, one of the primary limitations is the heterogeneity among included studies, which limited our ability to perform a meta-analysis,” said Khurana. However, the review offers valuable insight on the current landscape of VR in Ob/Gyn care, along with trends and research gaps, she said.

“Further research is needed to better assess the effectiveness of VR in the most common office-based procedural settings, such as intrauterine device (IUD) insertions or colposcopies,” said Khurana. “Additional studies focusing on the pediatric and adolescent gynecology population would also be beneficial, as this group may have unique needs and could particularly benefit from supportive pain management strategies,” she noted.

A greater understanding of complementary and alternative pain management options in Ob/Gyn settings remains a critical, unmet need, said Melissa S. Wong, MD, assistant professor in the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, in an interview.

“We are beginning to see a real call from patients for better pain management, and finding safe, effective options that can be administered in a clinic or inpatient setting will broaden the tools available to us as clinicians to improve our patients' experience,” said Wong, who was not involved in the study but has published research on the use of VR for women in labor as a pain reduction strategy.

“I was surprised that more studies had not been performed in this space, as virtual reality has been repeatedly demonstrated to be effective in reducing pain and anxiety in other procedural settings,” Wong told Medscape Medical News. Many Ob/Gyn procedures are relatively brief and would be conducive to a quick on-and-off type of intervention such as what is possible with VR, she added. The takeaway from the current study is recognition of multiple settings in which VR has effectively reduced pain or anxiety for patients, she said.

Looking ahead, more research is needed to determine which patients may have the greatest benefit from VR, which procedures are most conducive, and even which kinds of VR experiences are most suited to Ob/Gyn settings, Wong said.

The study received no outside funding. The researchers had no financial conflicts to disclose. Wong had no financial conflicts to disclose.

CHICAGO — Combining machine learning and patient-reported tools significantly improved early detection of dementia in primary care, according to new research presented at the annual meeting of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

Researchers from Indiana University Indianapolis found that using a machine learning algorithm and a patient-reported screening tool — together known as the Digital Detection of Dementia (D3) approach — led to a 44% higher likelihood of a clinician diagnosing a patient with dementia over a 1-year period compared with usual care.

The researchers tested the D3 model in a randomized trial across nine federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in Indianapolis.

Of the more than 5300 patients aged 65 years or older who enrolled, 62% were women, and more than half were Black or Hispanic.

The clinics were assigned to provide three types of care, the first being usual care.

Patients in the second group were evaluated for dementia using the passive digital marker, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that analyzed existing electronic health record data to flag potential cases.

Clinicians at the third clinic evaluated patients by analyzing results from the Quick Dementia Rating System, a 10-item questionnaire that takes patients 2-3 minutes to complete, and viewed flagged cases produced by the algorithm.

Providers at the third clinic diagnosed significantly more patients with dementia than those at clinics using usual care, even after accounting for age, sex, race, and ethnicity (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.75).

In contrast, clinics using only the AI tool showed no statistically significant increase in diagnoses. Researchers hypothesized that even partial use of the questionnaire — completed by just 21% of eligible patients — may have improved clinicians' trust in AI alerts, nudging them toward making a diagnosis.

“Providers…are very busy and are bombarded with computerized decision support,” said lead study researcher Malaz Boustani, MD, a geriatrician and professor of aging research at Indiana University. But “with the right messenger and time,” trust in digital tools can grow and lead to behavior change.

According to previous research, 62% of older adults seen in FQHCs have mild cognitive impairment, and 12% have dementia. Yet most go undiagnosed. Black patients were more than twice as likely as White patients to have unrecognized cognitive decline.

The tools were embedded directly into the clinics' electronic health record system, triggering alerts in the chart view. Patients were offered the questionnaire during electronic check-in. A clinical decision support system then guided clinicians with next steps.

“This hybrid model lets clinicians do the right thing without adding to their workload,” Boustani said.

The D3 model is now being evaluated for broader implementation, Boustani said. He and his colleagues are also exploring ways to increase patient completion of the questionnaire and refine clinician prompts.

“We're waiting on the result of an ongoing trial that is trying to replicate our study using interruptive alerts instead of non-interruptive alerts,” Boustani said. “If that trial shows similar or better results, we will work with existing consulting companies to distribute the digital tools across the country.”

Boustani serves as a chief scientific officer and co-founder of two private companies and has various financial relationships involving equity with other companies. He also serves on various advisory boards for pharmaceutical companies.

A novel genetic variant may be a driving force behind the development of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in some cases, according to researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

In an article published in Hepatology, Filippo Pinto e Vairo, MD, PhD, and colleagues described their discovery of a single inherited variant of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) gene in a familial case of MASLD involving a father and daughter with no apparent additional risk factors.

MASLD remains one of the world's most common diseases and will likely become the leading cause of liver cirrhosis worldwide, the researchers wrote. MASLD, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), likely stems from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, they said.

Their discovery of the gene variation prompted the researchers to investigate whether that variation and others on the MET gene were linked to steatotic liver disease.

They used Mayo Clinic's Tapestry study, a large-scale genetic sequencing project, to analyze the exome sequencing data of 3904 adults with MASLD to identify other cases and analyze them. About 1% (45 individuals) had rare variants of the MET gene potentially associated with MASLD, and 8 of the 45 (18%) had genetic variants in the same area as the index patient and her father.

Pinto e Vairo, medical director of the Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases in the Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine, explained the potential implications of the findings in a Q&A with Medscape Medical News.

What prompted you to conduct this research? How did you identify the original patient?

Pinto e Vairo: The original patient was identified through clinical care and underwent liver biopsy due to elevated liver enzymes. Her histology confirmed MASH [metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis], and subsequent exome sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous MET variant, inherited from her affected father, which led to a deeper investigation into the genetic basis of her condition.

Were you surprised by any of the findings? Why or why not?

Pinto e Vairo: The findings were surprising in several ways. First, variants in MET had not previously been implicated as a germline monogenic cause of MASLD or MASH in humans. Its known roles had largely been confined to cancer. Second, the discovery that rare, loss-of-function variants in the MET kinase domain could underlie liver steatosis and inflammation ran counter to the usual oncogenic MET variants, which are typically gain-of-function.

The confirmation that the MET variants impaired downstream signaling further reinforced a novel mechanism. The lack of high polygenic risk scores in patients with these MET variants also highlighted that monogenic drivers might be underrecognized contributors to MASLD/MASH.

Based on your research and other research, how might genetics play into MASLD?

Pinto e Vairo: Genetics play a significant role in MASLD by modulating both susceptibility and disease progression. While large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified common variants — such as those in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, GCKR, MBOAT7, and HSD17B13 — that confer risk or protection, this study adds evidence that rare monogenic variants can also independently drive the disease.

This suggests a genetic spectrum in MASLD, ranging from polygenic, environmentally modulated forms to monogenic cases with high penetrance. The interplay between these rare variants and broader metabolic context will be crucial to understand personalized risk.

Is there a practical application for this research now? What might the future clinical applications be?

Pinto e Vairo: The immediate practical application lies in the potential for early identification of individuals at high risk for MASLD/MASH through exome or genome sequencing, particularly in families with a strong history of liver disease. Clinically, this could justify enhanced surveillance or earlier lifestyle and therapeutic interventions in at-risk individuals.

In the future, this research may support the development of targeted therapies that can restore or bypass defective MET signaling. Moreover, it opens the door to personalized medicine strategies that consider a patient's unique genetic profile when choosing interventions or preventive strategies.

What are the next steps?

Pinto e Vairo: The next steps include functional validation of other rare MET variants to better understand their pathogenic potential and variability in phenotypic expression; longitudinal cohort studies to monitor disease progression in individuals with MET variants and to define genotype-phenotype correlations more precisely; and ultimately therapeutic exploration, including in vitro and in vivo modeling, to determine whether restoring MET signaling could reverse or mitigate disease.

The study received no outside funding. The researchers had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Asking teenage girls about their access to menstruation products can help pediatricians gain a better understanding of the resources their patients need, whether it be more education or pads and tampons, according to a new study published in Pediatrics.

An academic pediatric clinic in North Carolina implemented a three-question screener inquiring if teens had problems acquiring products to manage their periods, such as pads and tampons. Researchers found 1 in 10 of 73 girls had these issues.

Some girls reported they resorted to using toilet paper as menstrual pads or missed school because they were worried about bleeding through their clothing.

Clinicians who screened the teens reported that patient responses were sometimes surprising and opened dialogue for broader conversations about menstrual health.

“I was surprised: I feel like, 30%...of my teens have screened positive, and sometimes even just the period poverty screener itself makes me probe a little bit more on questions,” said one clinician involved in the study. “And even if they're not positive on the screener, sometimes they'll realize they really actually don't have the things that they need.”

The study took place in 2022 during well visits at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist's Downtown Health Plaza Pediatric Clinic in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with a patient population with mostly Medicaid coverage. Teens were also asked if they had ever missed school (7%) or experienced anxiety because of their period (10%).

Girls who answered yes to any of the questions received a bag of menstrual supplies and information about where to obtain additional free products. The clinic partnered with a local chapter of The Period Project, a nonprofit aimed at eliminating menstrual poverty.

The North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology in 2022 called for clinicians to ask their patients about access to menstrual products, educate them about menstruation, and speak openly with girls about their periods.

A recent study found that 1 in 3 girls who visited an emergency department in Washington, DC, said they were unable to afford supplies or had to use cloth, toilet paper, tissues, or rags as alternatives.

Girls who struggle to afford supplies may “resort to using products beyond their recommended use,” which increases their risk for toxic shock syndrome, said Tambu Kudze, MD, a pediatric and adolescent gynecologist at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, who was not associated with the study.

The use of items like cloth or toilet paper can also increase the risk for vulvar irritation, poor hygiene, and infection, Kudze said.

However, asking questions about access to menstrual products is not a widespread clinical practice, said Callie Brown, MD, an associate professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and senior author of the study.

“I would say honestly that some of these teens lack understanding for their menstrual cycles in general, and not understanding that it can be irregular, and how much they need to use pads and tampons,” said one clinician. “Sometimes, they're using them inappropriately, so the education part has been an issue for some kids.”

Kudze said that written questionnaires could easily be integrated into clinical practice and might help patients disclose their struggles.

“One of my biggest takeaways from the study is we can ask these questions, but it's important to then have the resources,” Kudze said. “You can't just say ‘I'm sorry that you don't have pads' and then leave it there.”

Kudze and Brown reported having no disclosures. The study was independently funded.

Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet — which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, nuts, and low-fat dairy — was associated with a 19% reduced risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), with stronger protective effects observed in men than in women.

“The DASH diet can be a valuable component of a personalized plan for many in high-risk groups, but it shouldn't be presented as a one-size-fits-all solution,” the authors wrote. “Registered dietitians and healthcare professionals play a crucial role in creating tailored dietary plans that are both effective and achievable for each individual,” they added.

Mohammad Mehdi Abbasi of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Paria Babaahmadi of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Shiraz, and Fateme Nozari of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, all in Iran, led the study. It was published online in BMC Gastroenterology.

Included studies used different methods to assess DASH adherence, and its application varied across cultures and populations. Differences in various cooking styles, such as grilling, which might induce carcinogenesis, were not addressed. Colon and rectal adenomas were not specifically addressed in the included studies.

This study received no financial support. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Waist-to-height ratio predicts heart failure incidence, according to research presented today at Heart Failure 2025, a scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). 

Obesity affects a substantial proportion of patients with heart failure (HF) and it has been reported that the risk of HF increases as body mass index (BMI) increases. Study presenter, Dr. Amra Jujic from Lund University, Malmö, Sweden, explained why the current analysis was carried out: ""BMI is the most common measure of obesity, but it is influenced by factors such as sex and ethnicity, and does not take into account the distribution of body fat. Waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) is considered a more robust measure of central adiposity, the harmful deposition of fat around visceral organs. In addition, whereas BMI is associated with paradoxically good HF outcomes with high BMI, this is not seen with WtHR. We conducted this analysis to investigate the relationship between WtHR and the development of HF."" 

The study population consisted of 1,792 participants from the Malmö Preventive Project. Participants were aged 45–73 years at baseline and were selected so that approximately one-third had normal blood glucose levels, one-third had impaired fasting glucose and one-third had diabetes. All participants were followed prospectively for incident HF. 

The study population had a mean age of 67 years and 29% were women. The median WtHR was 0.57 (interquartile range, 0.52–0.61). 

During the median follow-up of 12.6 years, 132 HF events occurred. Higher WtHR was associated with a significantly increased risk of incident HF (hazard ratio [HR] per one standard deviation increase 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.61; p=0.001), independent of confounders. When WtHR was categorised into quartiles, individuals with the highest values of WtHR (median of 0.65) had a significantly higher risk of HF compared with individuals in the other three quartiles (HR 2.71; 95% CI 1.64–4.48; p<0.001). 

The median WtHR in our analysis was considerably higher than 0.5, the cut-off for increased cardiometabolic risk. Having a waist measurement that is less than half your height is ideal.""

Dr. John Molvin, Study Co-Author, Lund University and Malmö University Hospital, Sweden

He concluded: ""We found that WtHR was a significant predictor of incident HF and our results suggest that WtHR may be a better metric than BMI to identify patients with HF who could benefit from therapies for obesity. Our next step is to investigate whether WtHR predicts incident HF and also other cardiometabolic disorders in a larger cohort.""

Surgeons from Keck Medicine of USC and UCLA Health have performed the world's first-in-human bladder transplant. The surgery was successfully completed at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on May 4, 2025, in a joint effort by Inderbir Gill, MD, founding executive director of USC Urology, and Nima Nassiri, MD, urologic transplant surgeon and director of the UCLA Vascularized Composite Bladder Allograft Transplant Program. 

This surgery is a historic moment in medicine and stands to impact how we manage carefully selected patients with highly symptomatic 'terminal' bladders that are no longer functioning. Transplantation is a lifesaving and life-enhancing treatment option for many conditions affecting major organs, and now the bladder can be added to the list."" 

Inderbir Gill, MD, Chair and Distinguished Professor of Urology and Shirley and Donald Skinner Chair in Urologic Cancer Surgery with the Keck School of Medicine of USC

""This first attempt at bladder transplantation has been over four years in the making,"" Nassiri said. ""For the appropriately selected patient, it is exciting to be able to offer a new potential option."" 

Nassiri, formerly a urology resident with the Keck School and now assistant professor of urology and kidney transplantation at UCLA, and Gill worked together for several years at the Keck School to develop the new surgical technique, design a clinical trial and secure the necessary regulatory approvals. 

Numerous pre-clinical procedures were performed both at Keck Medical Center of USC and OneLegacy, Southern California's organ procurement organization, to prepare for this first-in-human bladder transplant. 

The patient had been dialysis-dependent for seven years. He lost the majority of his bladder during surgery to resect cancer over five years ago, leaving the remainder of his bladder too small and compromised to function appropriately. Both of his kidneys were subsequently removed due to renal cancer. 

To address these deficits, Drs. Gill and Nassiri performed a combined kidney and bladder transplant, allowing the patient to immediately stop dialysis and produce urine for the first time in seven years. First the kidney, then the bladder, were transplanted. The new kidney was then connected to the new bladder. The entire procedure took approximately eight hours. 

""The kidney immediately made a large volume of urine, and the patient's kidney function improved immediately,"" Nassiri added. ""There was no need for any dialysis after surgery, and the urine drained properly into the new bladder."" 

""Despite the complexity of the case, everything went according to plan and the surgery was successful,"" said Gill. ""The patient is doing well, and we are satisfied with his clinical progress to date."" 

The recovery of the kidney and bladder from the donor was performed at OneLegacy's Transplant Recovery Center in Azusa, Calif. All parts of the procedure, including surgery and post-surgical monitoring during the transplantation, were aligned with the highest current clinical and research standards. 

Millions of people around the globe experience some degree of bladder disease and dysfunction. Some develop terminal bladders that are either non-functioning and/or cause constant pain, repeated infections and other complications. Current treatment for severe terminal cases of bladder dysfunction or a bladder that has been removed due to various conditions includes replacement or augmentation of the urinary reservoir. These surgeries use a portion of a patient's intestine to create a new bladder or a pathway for the urine to exit the body. 

""While these surgeries can be effective, they come with many short-and long-term risks that compromise a patient's health such as recurrent infections, compromised kidney function and digestive issues,"" said Gill. 

""A bladder transplant, on the other hand, delivers a more 'normal' urinary reservoir and may circumvent some of the challenges associated with using the intestine,"" said Nassiri. 

The biggest risks of organ transplant are the body's potential rejection of the organ and side-effects caused by the mandatory immunosuppressive drugs given to prevent organ rejection. 

""Because of the need for long-term immunosuppression, the best current candidates are those with a pre-existing organ transplant or those who need a combined kidney and bladder transplant,"" said Nassiri. 

As a first-in-human attempt, there are naturally many unknowns associated with the procedure, such as how well the transplanted bladder will function immediately and over time, and how much immunosuppression will ultimately be needed. 

""Despite the unknowns, our goal is to understand if bladder transplantation can help patients with severely compromised bladders lead healthier lives,"" said Gill. 

Bladder transplants have not been done previously, in part because of the complicated vascular structure of the pelvic area and the technical complexity of the procedure. As part of the research and development stage, Gill and Nassiri successfully completed numerous practice transplantation surgeries at Keck Medical Center of USC, including the first-ever robotic bladder retrievals and successful robotic transplantations in five recently deceased donors with cardiac function maintained on ventilator support. 

Several non-robotic trial runs of bladder recovery were performed at OneLegacy by Gill and Nassiri, allowing them to perfect the technique while working alongside multidisciplinary surgical teams. 

The bladder transplant was done as part of a UCLA clinical trial. Gill and Nassiri hope to perform more bladder transplants together in the near future. 

Under Gill's leadership, USC Urology has rapidly established itself as a pioneer and world leader in the most advanced robotic urologic oncologic surgeries for kidney, bladder, prostate, testicular and penile cancers, and has achieved important milestones leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize patient outcomes. 

UCLA Urology has long been at the frontier of urologic transplantation, with pioneering research in kidney transplantation and, now, bladder transplantation.

Growing emphasis on self-reliance and trade barriers could impair the ability of people to consume healthy and sustainable diets around the world. Research teams from the University of Göttingen and the University of Edinburgh investigated the extent to which 186 countries can feed their own populations solely through domestic production. The study was published in the journal Nature Food.

The researchers evaluated seven food groups that are part of the World Wildlife Fund's Livewell diet. Only one in seven countries achieve self-sufficiency in five or more essential food groups – most within Europe and South America. This lack of self-sufficiency was especially true in the Caribbean, West Africa, and the Gulf states. Six countries, primarily in the Middle East, do not produce enough of a single food group for their own needs.

Notably, only Guyana achieved complete self-sufficiency in all seven food groups, while China and Vietnam nearly reach this by achieving six. Significant discrepancies exist regarding self-sufficiency in meat and dairy products. For example, while several European countries produce far in excess of their needs, domestic production in African countries is very low. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, produces only about 15% of its requirements for meat. The analysis uncovers shortfalls in nutrient-dense plant protein worldwide: fewer than half of the countries achieve their domestic needs for legumes (for instance, beans and peas), or nuts and seeds, while only a quarter do so for vegetables.

The study additionally highlights that some countries have low production and simultaneously rely almost exclusively on a single trading partner for more than half of their imports, compounding their vulnerability. This pattern is especially pronounced in smaller countries, including island states. Similarly, many Central American and Caribbean countries depend on the United States for the bulk of their imports of starchy staples – for instance, wheat and maize – and several European and Central Asian countries rely on a single partner for legumes, nuts and seeds.

International food trade and cooperation is essential for healthy and sustainable diets. However, heavy reliance on imports from single countries can leave nations vulnerable. Building resilient food supply chains is imperative for ensuring public health.""

As the global population ages, the prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes is increasing, highlighting the importance of effective treatment options. Researchers at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, collaborating with Genizer, have explored advancements in managing this condition. To understand their findings, it is essential to grasp the basics of diabetes.

Carbohydrates are found in many foods, including breads. Image Credit: Genizer

Carbohydrates, found in foods like bread and fruits, are composed of sugars. The body metabolizes these carbohydrates into simple sugars, which insulin then converts into energy or stores. Individuals with diabetes face challenges related to insulin, necessitating assistance in regulating their blood sugar levels to avoid hyperglycemia, a condition that can lead to severe health issues, including death.



You may be familiar with insulin treatment for diabetes. Image Credit: Genizer

If you know someone with diabetes, you might be aware of insulin use for blood sugar management. However, other treatment options exist, such as acarbose. Acarbose works by inhibiting amylolytic enzymes, which convert starches into simpler sugars, effectively lowering blood sugar levels.

While insulin helps remove sugars from the bloodstream, acarbose prevents their formation. α-amylase initiates sugar digestion, and α-glucosidase further breaks down smaller sugars into glucose. Acarbose may offer a more straightforward and cost-effective treatment regimen compared to insulin. However, it can cause side effects due to the undigested starches in the digestive tract. This occurs because acarbose significantly inhibits α-amylase, leaving many starches unprocessed.

Researchers Kadima Samuel Tshiyoyo, Ali Rabbad, Abdullahi Ahmed Yusuf, and Samkelo Malgas investigated essential oils from citrus peels as potential inhibitors of amylolytic enzymes. They screened essential oils from tangerines and oranges for their pharmacokinetic properties, discovering that they exhibited greater bioavailability and intestinal absorption than acarbose. They tested commercially available components of these oils for their ability to inhibit amylolytic enzymes. While these components did not significantly inhibit α-amylase, some were effective against α-glucosidase.



The researchers used tangerine and orange peels to source the essential oils. Image Credit: Genizer

Combining acarbose with essential oil compounds like carveol or geraniol reduced α-amylase inhibition while increasing α-glucosidase inhibition. This suggests a potential for lowering starch levels without causing spikes in blood sugar. Notably, carveol combined with acarbose showed a lower percentage of undigested starch compared to geraniol, although carveol alone produced too many smaller sugar particles.



The researchers used Genizer's Particle Sizer to conduct their research. Image Credit: Genizer

Genizer's Dual Light Nanoparticle Sizer was employed to measure the size of starch particles, indicating enzymatic inhibition's effectiveness. Further research could be beneficial to determine if the combination of acarbose and carveol can minimize side effects and enhance treatment for Type 2 Diabetes.

Announcing a new article publication for Cardiovascular Innovations and Applications journal. Cardiac dysfunction is a prevalent and serious complication after cardiac arrest (CA), yet limited therapeutic interventions are available. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a critical mediator of innate immune responses, has recently been identified as a potential contributor to cardiac dysfunction. This study was aimed at investigating the role of cGAS in post-CA cardiac dysfunction.

In vivo, in rats with ventricular fibrillation (VF)-induced CA, a selective cGAS inhibitor (RU.521) was used to specifically inhibit cGAS activity, thereby blocking its downstream signaling pathway. In vitro, hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) were used to stimulate H9C2 cardiomyocytes, and a specific siRNA targeting cGAS was applied to knock down cGAS expression.

Analysis revealed significant upregulation of cGAS protein expression and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in both myocardial tissues of rats that achieved ROSC and H/R-stimulated H9C2 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of cGAS with RU.521 effectively ameliorated cardiac function and maintained hemodynamic stability in ROSC rats. Genetic knockdown of cGAS enhanced the resistance of H9C2 cells to H/R-induced cell injury. Mechanistically, cGAS inhibition effectively attenuated CA-induced mitochondrial injury while concurrently suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis.

These findings highlight a strong association between cGAS upregulation and cardiac dysfunction after CA. Targeting cGAS might provide a promising therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac function in patients with CA.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide, with rising incidence linked to dietary and lifestyle changes. Despite advances in surgery and chemotherapy, drug resistance and tumor recurrence pose marked challenges. The epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR/MAPK) signaling pathway, frequently hyperactivated in CRC, drives tumor growth, but its downstream effectors-particularly noncoding RNAs-are not fully understood.

A research team from Sun Yat-sen University Sixth Affiliated Hospital has made a groundbreaking discovery in colorectal cancer (CRC) research, identifying a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) named ESSENCE (EGF Signal Sensing CAD's Effect; ENST00000415336) as a critical regulator of tumor progression. The study reveals that ESSENCE stabilizes a key metabolic enzyme, CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase), to promote cancer growth and suppress ferroptosis. The findings also propose a novel combination therapy targeting ESSENCE-high tumors, offering new hope for precision treatment.

Led by Dr. Xiangqi Meng and Dr. Mong-Hong Lee, the team identified ESSENCE as a top lncRNA upregulated by EGFR/MAPK signaling. ESSENCE expression correlates with poor prognosis in CRC patients and is transcriptionally activated by the EGF-induced transcription factor EGR1. Mechanistically, ESSENCE binds to CAD, a multifunctional enzyme critical for pyrimidine synthesis, and blocks its degradation by the E3 ligase KEAP1. This stabilization fuels cancer cell proliferation and ferroptosis defense.

To explore the potential of targeting the ESSENCE–CAD–ferroptosis axis in restraining CRC development, the research team established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Combining the MEK inhibitor selumetinib and the ferroptosis inducer sulfasalazine synergistically suppressed tumor growth in ESSENCE-high PDX models, while ESSENCE-low tumors showed minimal response. These findings support the clinical potential of patient stratification based on ESSENCE expression levels to optimize combination therapy selection.

The study demonstrates that ESSENCE serves not only as a prognostic biomarker but also as a directly targetable molecular driver in colorectal cancer. However, whether ESSENCE plays a similar oncogenic role in other malignancies beyond colorectal cancer remains to be explored. Additionally, the proposed combination therapy requires further preclinical validation before clinical translation.

Future study will focus on developing targeted therapies against the newly identified ESSENCE-CAD signaling axis, which may expand treatment strategies for a broader range of cancers. This study highlights the growing importance of lncRNAs in precision oncology and underscores the need for innovative approaches to combat treatment resistance.

A wearable pulse oximeter and connected software platform show promise for monitoring obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep-related breathing diseases, according to research presented at the ATS 2025 International Conference.

The device (pulse oximeter), which is cleared for medical use, was designed for comfort and ease of use; a clinical trial found high rates of utilization by patients. It could be used to track patient response to OSA treatment over time.

Investigators in our clinical research trials report how useful longitudinal data are to observe night-to-night variability and the response to treatment of OSA. One sleep specialist even reported that it may be better to collect one or two channels of data over 25 nights than 25 channels over one night, which is considered the gold standard with in-lab polysomnography.""

Ketan Mehta, MS, head of product and engineering for Connected Wearables at Apnimed

Wearable sensors like the Oura ring and Apple Watch that measure biometrics during sleep are widely used by consumers, but are not cleared for medical use. At the same time, other medical devices used in sleep studies gather clinically relevant data, but are too cumbersome and costly to use for frequent monitoring. This tool could potentially expand patient access to care through pulmonologists to manage routine sleep apnea in their patients, instead of having to refer them out to a sleep specialist, he added. The device provides a bridge between these two extremes, he said.

Worn as a ring, the device offers several key differences from other consumer wearables. Notably, it uses transmittance-based photoplethysmography, which has been shown to be more suitable for the proximal phalanx region, provide better signal-to-noise ratio, and is more effective in low perfusion situations. It also engages in continuous data collection, rather than spot checks, he added.

The device connects to an app that users can access from their smartphone, giving patients access to a subset of the same data as their health care providers.

""These data empower both parties to be informed, and they're able to have more meaningful conversations. This offers the opportunity for shared decision making between patient and provider using digital medicine,"" Mr. Mehta said.

The device was used in several different clinical settings including to monitor patient response to a pharmacologic treatment program for OSA. During the monitoring study, patients were asked to wear the device for 9 nights over a 47-day period. However, many patients voluntarily wore their devices more often, with 85 percent of patients using beyond the recommended nights. One patient used the device almost nightly for 44 days, the researchers noted.

In addition to clinical use, the device and connected software could be applied to research in conditions like COPD, ILD, and other conditions that involve sleep-related breathing diseases and require monitoring of oxygenation, noted Mr. Mehta. The device is FDA cleared for medical use; the connected software requires similar clearance before it can be deployed outside of clinical trial settings

Researchers hope to continue gathering data to further validate use of the device and connected software and better understand the patient and clinician experiences, the team said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Rising temperatures drive global surge in obstructive sleep apnea severity","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250518/Rising-temperatures-drive-global-surge-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-severity.aspx","Mon, 19 May 2025 02:31:00 GMT","

Rising temperatures increase the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), according to a large new study published at the ATS 2025 International Conference. The study also found that, under the most likely climate change scenarios, the societal burden of OSA is expected to double in most countries over the next 75 years.

In addition to highlighting the critical importance of limiting global warming, the findings also emphasize the immediate need for strategies to alleviate the health and economic impacts of OSA as it becomes more common and severe, researchers said.

This study really highlights the societal burden associated with the increase in OSA prevalence due to rising temperatures.""

Bastien Lechat, PhD, senior research fellow at FHMRI: Sleep Health at Flinders University

Previous cross-sectional studies identified a link between ambient temperature and OSA severity. However, this is the first to explain and describe that connection in detail.

For the study, researchers analyzed a consumer database of more than 116,000 worldwide users of an under-mattress sensor validated to estimate OSA severity. The dataset included around 500 repeat measurements per user. Researchers then analyzed this data against 24-hour ambient temperatures extracted from climate models.

Overall, higher temperatures were associated with a 45 percent increased likelihood of a sleeper experiencing OSA on a given night. However, these findings varied by region, with people in European countries seeing higher rates of OSA when temperatures rise than those in Australia and the United States.

""We were surprised by the magnitude of the association between ambient temperature and OSA severity,"" Dr. Lechat said.

Researchers then sought to estimate how burdensome the increase in OSA prevalence due to rising temperature is to society in terms of wellbeing and economic loss. They conducted modeling including disability-adjusted-life-years, productivity losses, and health economics to estimate the OSA burden under several climate scenarios.

They found that any scenario that involved temperatures rising 2 degrees Celsius or higher would result in a 1.5-fold to 3-fold increase to the OSA burden by the year 2100. They estimated that climate change has already increased the OSA burden by 50 percent to 100 percent since the year 2000.

In addition to providing further evidence of the major threat of climate change to human health and wellbeing, Dr. Lechat said the study highlighted the importance of developing effective interventions to diagnose and manage OSA.

""The high prevalence undiagnosed and untreated OSA amplifies the effect of global warming on the societal burden associated with OSA,"" he said. ""Higher rates of diagnosis and treatment is likely to reduce the health and productivity burden due to rising temperature and increased OSA prevalence.""

Next, the team plans to develop intervention studies looking at strategies to mitigate the effects of temperature on OSA. They also hope to study the physiological mechanisms linking OSA severity to temperature.

Both liposomes and micelles are effective carriers for hydrophobic molecules within hydrophilic environments, but they have distinct differences.

Both structures comprise amphiphilic molecules with hydrophilic (water-attracting) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) components. This dual nature allows them to interact with water and lipids.

When amphiphilic molecules are present in sufficient quantities in a solution, their hydrophobic parts cluster together, forming a spherical structure. The key distinction lies in their architecture: micelles consist of a single-layer sphere, while liposomes have a bilayer structure. This bilayer configuration is similar to the lipid bilayer that forms the cell membranes of human cells.

The type of amphiphilic molecules involved influences the formation of monolayers versus bilayers. Typically, single-chain amphiphiles form monolayers, whereas double-chain amphiphiles lead to bilayers.

Both micelles and liposomes are valuable for creating emulsions or suspending insoluble molecules in solutions. In these structures, the hydrophobic molecules can be encapsulated within the micelle, liposome, or even within the center of the liposomal bilayer.

Liposomes are particularly beneficial in pharmaceutical applications due to their resemblance to cell membranes, which enhances their biocompatibility. This liposomal encapsulation can help minimize side effects and prolong the circulation time of therapeutic agents.

Despite national guidelines, most American teen girls chase weight loss, often at the expense of healthier habits. New research shows that intent to slim down doesn't always align with health, underscoring the urgent need for supportive interventions.

Study: Lifestyle Behaviors Associated with Weight Loss Intent in Adolescent Girls: Findings from the US 2021 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Image Credit: Antonio Guillem / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers at Worcester State University, USA, investigated the lifestyle behaviors associated with weight loss intent in adolescent girls using nationally representative data.

Obesity affects over 22% of adolescents aged 12 to 19 in the United States (US), with long-term risks such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Girls, more than boys, often experience body dissatisfaction, which can drive weight loss attempts. Social media, peer pressure, and family environments significantly influence young girls' perceptions of ideal body weight. Despite existing physical activity and dietary guidelines, adherence remains low among adolescents, especially girls. Simultaneously, behaviors like skipping breakfast, insufficient sleep, vaping, and alcohol use are rising. A better understanding of these lifestyle patterns is critical. Further research is needed to clarify causal relationships.

The present study used data from the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, a cross-sectional survey administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess health behaviors in US high school students. Researchers extracted data from 4,362 female students in grades 9 through 12 who responded to the question about weight loss intent. Participants were classified into two groups: those trying to lose weight and those not trying.

Variables included dietary habits (e.g., breakfast, fruit, and vegetable intake), physical activity (e.g., strength training, aerobic activity), screen time, sleep duration, alcohol use, and vaping. The Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile was calculated using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts based on self-reported weight and height. Based on the discrepancy between actual BMI and self-view, weight perception was categorized as accurate, underestimated, or overestimated.

Logistic regression analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 29, adjusting for grade level, race/ethnicity, BMI percentile, and other covariates. Models were stratified by body image perception to examine subgroup differences. The model demonstrated good discrimination between groups, with an area under the curve value of 0.78.

Among the adolescent girls surveyed, the weighted estimate was 55.5% reported trying to lose weight. Girls who intended to lose weight had a higher average BMI percentile (75.4) compared to those not trying to lose weight (50.1). However, 43.4% of girls in the normal weight category also reported a desire to lose weight, indicating widespread body image dissatisfaction. Additionally, among girls with a normal BMI, 16% were trying to gain weight, reflecting further complexity in body image concerns. Notably, the highest overall intent to lose weight was observed among Hispanic girls (66.3%) and multiple Hispanic descent (59.9%). Among normal-weight girls, weight loss intent was particularly prevalent among white (47.5%) and Asian (45.7%) girls.

Proportion of adolescent girls reporting weight loss intent by BMI percentile categories (Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese) in the 2021 YRBS Survey: BMI, Body Mass Index. Normal weight BMI% < 85, overweight BMI% 85–<95, obese BMI% ≥ 95.

Lifestyle behaviors varied significantly between groups. Girls trying to lose weight were more likely to engage in muscle-strengthening activities (odds ratio [OR] 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.57) and report more than three hours of daily screen time (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58). They were also more likely to have consumed alcohol (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.32-1.98) and used electronic vapor products (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47) in the previous month.

Conversely, healthier habits were less common in this group. They were significantly less likely to eat breakfast daily (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.40-0.69), get at least 8 hours of sleep per night (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.89), or consume ‘other vegetables' (excluding salads, carrots, and potatoes) (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67-0.90). There was no significant difference in the frequency of consuming fruits, milk, or soda.

While muscle-strengthening exercises were more common among girls intending to lose weight (but not overall aerobic or total physical activity), there was no difference in meeting the national recommendation for 60 minutes of physical activity daily. The link between weight loss intent and muscle-building activity may reflect an attempt to lose weight rather than focusing on overall health.

Importantly, the study discusses the possibility of a bidirectional relationship between screen time and weight loss intent. Girls trying to lose weight slept less and used screens more, both of which can contribute to weight gain and mental health challenges. Extended screen time is known to influence self-esteem and body dissatisfaction, especially among adolescent girls, reinforcing a cycle of negative self-image and unhealthy behaviors.

The desire to lose weight was most common among obese girls (87.8%), but was notably high among girls in the normal weight range as well. These findings suggest that weight loss intent is not always aligned with actual weight status and may reflect unrealistic body standards.

To summarize, this study shows that adolescent girls trying to lose weight often engage in unhealthy behaviors such as skipping breakfast, inadequate sleep, excessive screen time, alcohol use, and vaping. These habits may not support long-term weight management or overall well-being. Moreover, a significant portion of girls with a normal BMI still express weight loss intent, highlighting concerns about distorted body image. Notably, the cross-sectional design means causality cannot be determined, but the associations suggest important targets for intervention. Interventions should focus on promoting healthy behaviors over weight fixation, integrating strategies like sleep hygiene, reducing screen exposure, addressing unrealistic body standards, and improving body image perceptions. Tailored, school-based programs and parental guidance can play key roles in supporting adolescent girls' health goals.

Using the gene scissors CRISPR and stem cells, researchers at Stockholm University and the UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI) at King's College London have managed to identify a common denominator for different gene mutations that all cause the neurological disease ALS. The research shows that ALS-linked dysfunction occurs in the energy factories of nerve cells, the mitochondria, before the cells show other signs of disease, which was not previously known. The study was recently published in the scientific journal Nature Communications.

""We show that the nerve cells, termed motor neurons, that will eventually die in ALS have problems soon after they are formed. We saw the earliest sign of problems in the cell's energy factories, the mitochondria, and also in how they are transported out into the nerve cells' long processes where there is a great need for them and the energy they produce,"" says Dr. Eva Hedlund at Stockholm University, head of the study together with Dr Marc-David Ruepp at the UK Dementia Research Institute at King's College London.

The research team was able to establish that these problems were common to all ALS-caused mutations, which will be important for future treatments of the disease.

This means that there are common factors that could be targeted with drugs, regardless of the cause of the disease.""

Dr. Eva Hedlund at Stockholm University

The researchers used the gene scissors CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce various ALS-causing mutations into human stem cells, called iPS cells. From these, motor neurons, the nerve cells that are lost in in ALS, and interneurons, nerve cells that are relatively resistant to the disease, were produced. These were then analyzed with single-cell RNA sequencing, a method that enables identification of all messenger molecules (mRNA) in each individual cell and with that understand how a particular cell works, how it talks to its neighbors and if it starts to have problems.

""In the data we obtained, we identified a common disease signature across all ALS-causing mutations, which was unique to motor neurons and thus did not arise in resistant neurons,"" says Dr Christoph Schweingruber, first author of the study.

This happened very early and was completely independent of whether the disease-causing mutated proteins (FUS, or TDP-43) were in the wrong place in the cell or not.

""Until now, it has been believed that it is the change where the proteins are within the cells, called mislocalization, that occurs first,"" says Dr Marc-David Ruepp.

In ALS, it is often said that some problems are caused by a loss of function in a protein that is mutated, while other problems arise due to the opposite, namely the emergence of a new toxic function that has been obtained through the mutation, called ""gain-of-function"", but according to Eva Hedlund, it has not always been easy to clarify how it really works and much is still unknown.

""By making various CRISPR mutations in the ALS-causing FUS-gene, we have now been able to show for the first time that most errors arising are caused by a new toxic property of the protein, not by a loss of function,"" says Dr Christoph Schweingruber.

A third discovery was that the transport of mitochondria out into the axons, the extensions of the nerve cells where most mitochondria in nerve cells are needed, was radically affected in the ALS lines. This happened independently of whether the disease-causing proteins were in the wrong place in the cell or not.

""A fact that poses a problem because there is a great need for these energy factories in the extensions of the nerve cells. Without them the nerve cells do not have enough energy to communicate properly with other cells,"" says Dr Eva Hedlund.

The new discoveries open up for early treatment methods, something that for the research team is a continuous work in progress.

""We are trying to understand how these early errors occur in the sensitive motor neurons in ALS, and how it affects energy levels in the cells and their communication and necessary contacts with muscle fibers. We believe that these are important keys to the understanding of why the synapses between motor neurons and muscles is broken in ALS and also to identify new targets for therapies,"" says Dr. Eva Hedlund.

During his first administration, President Donald Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.

Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.

Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.

Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans — a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.

In Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.

""This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,"" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.

""This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,"" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.

Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture — on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.

The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause — or worsen — physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.

Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.

""It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,"" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.

The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.

Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.

Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services — a liberal philosophy — will be considered on a ""case-by-case basis,"" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.

""What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,"" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. ""They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.""

Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.

Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.

California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.

Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.

""When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,"" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. ""My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.""

California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.

""We are fully committed,"" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. ""We have invested so much.""

Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. ""If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results — people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,"" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.

Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.

""We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,"" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.

Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.

""Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,"" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. ""We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.""

But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.

""We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture,"" said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. ""We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health.""

Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.

While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment — operating in mostly rural counties — by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.

State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.

""I welcome the challenge of demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs. It's making for healthier people and healthier budgets,"" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina's Medicaid program. ""Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Sedentary behavior increases risk of death or cardiac events post-heart attack","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250519/Sedentary-behavior-increases-risk-of-death-or-cardiac-events-post-heart-attack.aspx","Mon, 19 May 2025 11:11:00 GMT","

People who sit or remain sedentary for more than 14 hours a day, on average, may have a higher risk of a cardiovascular event or death in the year after treatment at a hospital for symptoms of a heart attack such as chest pain, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's peer-reviewed scientific journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.

Previous research from the study authors found that people who had experienced a heart attack were spending up to 12 to 13 hours each day being sedentary, defined as any awake activity that involved little-to-no physical movement. In this study, the researchers used a wrist accelerometer to track the amount of time each participant spent moving or being sedentary for a median of 30 days after discharge from a hospital's emergency department. 

Wrist accelerometers measure the acceleration of motion in three directions - forwards and backwards, side-to-side, and up and down. These measurements allowed the researchers to infer the intensity of a participant's physical activity, and they provide more accurate measurements of the participants' time spent moving, rather than asking participants to remember. Some examples of moderate intensity physical activities are brisk walking, water aerobics, dancing, playing doubles tennis or gardening, and examples of vigorous-intensity activities are running, lap swimming, heavy yardwork such as continuous digging or hoeing, playing singles tennis or jumping rope.

""Current treatment guidelines after a cardiac event focus mainly on encouraging patients to exercise regularly,"" said study lead author Keith Diaz, Ph.D., the Florence Irving Associate Professor of Behavioral Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, a certified exercise physiologist and a volunteer member of the American Heart Association's Physical Activity Science Committee. ""In our study, we explored whether sedentary time itself may contribute to cardiovascular risk.""

Researchers followed more than 600 adults, ages 21 to 96, treated for a heart attack or chest pain in the emergency department at a single hospital system in New York City. Participants wore a wrist accelerometer for a median of 30 consecutive days after hospital discharge to measure the amount of time they spent sitting or being inactive each day. Additional cardiac events and deaths were evaluated one year after hospital discharge via phone surveys with patients, electronic health records and the Social Security Death Index. The study was focused on understanding the risk of sedentary behavior and identifying modifiable risk factors that may improve long-term outcomes in this high-risk group.

The analysis found:

We were surprised that replacing sedentary time with sleep also lowered risk. Sleep is a restorative behavior that helps the body and mind recover, which is especially important after a serious health event like a heart attack. Our study indicates that one doesn't have to start running marathons after a cardiovascular event to see benefits. Sitting less and moving or sleeping a little more can make a real difference. More physical activity and more sleep are healthier than sitting, so we hope these findings support health professionals to move toward a more holistic, flexible and individualized approach for physical activity in patients after a heart attack or chest pain.""

Keith Diaz, Ph.D., the Florence Irving Associate Professor of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center

Physical activity and sleep are both key components of the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8, a list of health behaviors and factors that support optimal cardiovascular health. Poor sleep is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which claims more lives each year in the U.S. than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined, according to the American Heart Association's 2025 Statistical Update. In addition to sleep duration, a recent scientific statement from the Association highlighted the importance of sleep continuity, sleep timing, sleep satisfaction, sleep regularity, sleep-related daytime functioning and sleep architecture in cardiometabolic health.

The study had several limitations, including that the definition of sedentary behavior was based only on the intensity level of physical movement, meaning that the study may have overestimated the time participants spent in sedentary behavior. Additionally, there was no information about participants' income and characteristics of the neighborhoods where they live, which limits the study's ability to account for social and environmental factors including participants' risk of one-year cardiac events and deaths. Also, hospital discharge information about whether patients were sent home, referred to rehabilitation or referred to other care centers such as skilled nursing facilities were not collected. This limited the study's ability to fully assess whether the patients' settings had an impact on their recovery.

""This study provides further support for a 'sit less, move more' strategy and – important for patients recently hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome who may have barriers to more intense exercise – found that increasing light-intensity activities by 30 minutes a day was related to dramatic reductions in the risk of a cardiac event within the next year,"" said Bethany Barone Gibbs, Ph.D., FAHA, a professor and chair of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the School of Public Health at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia, and immediate past chair of the American Heart Association's Physical Activity Committee.

""This study found that replacing sedentary time with light intensity activities, like tidying up the house or strolling at a slow pace, was nearly as beneficial as moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activities, like biking or doing aerobics. In addition, replacing just 30 minutes of sedentary behavior with any intensity of physical activity more than halved the risk of having a cardiac event over the one-year follow-up,"" she said. ""These findings suggest sitting less and doing anything else – like taking a walk, cooking, playing with your dog or gardening – will help you stay healthier.""

Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus belonging to the genus Morbillivirus that rapidly spreads through respiratory droplets. Measles symptoms include a characteristic red rash, as well as cough, high fever, inflamed eyes, and runny nose.1,2 Infants and young children under five years of age are most susceptible to this infection, particularly those who are unvaccinated or immunocompromised.3,4

A safe and effective measles vaccine has been available since 1963, with comprehensive vaccination efforts nearly eradicating measles in the U.S. In regions with low vaccination coverage, measles remains a global health threat that is responsible for substantial mortality, primarily among unvaccinated children.4,5

”Measles at a glance”: microbiology, mechanisms of transmission and infection, symptoms, complications, diagnosis, prevention and treatment.2

In 2024, the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) recorded over 35,000 measles cases, a ten-fold increase from the previous year. About 87% of known measles cases were reported in unvaccinated individuals.1

As of March 2025, over 220 cases of measles have been confirmed across multiple states in the U.S., with children five years of age and younger accounting for over one-third of infections.6

Hospitalizations have been common, and fatalities, though still rare, have occurred. In Romania alone, 22 of 23 measles deaths in 2024 occurred in children under five.1

Complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) are also serious risks associated with measles infection, particularly for young children and immunocompromised individuals.3

Measles is currently spreading in clusters, often within tight-knit or under-immunized communities. In the U.S., outbreaks have emerged in states such as Texas, New York, and California, all of which are regions with both high population density and notable vaccine exemption rates.5

Romania also serves as a hotspot for measles cases, as this country accounts for nearly 87% of EU/EEA cases in 2024.1 Similar trends have been observed in other high- and middle-income nations, where vaccine coverage has declined below the 95% threshold needed to maintain herd immunity.7

The resurgence of measles is not a failure of science but of communication, trust, and policy. Vaccine hesitancy, which is the refusal or delayed acceptance of vaccines despite availability, has emerged as a key driver of the re-emergence of measles.

Misinformation about vaccine safety, particularly false claims linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) combined vaccine to autism, has fueled public fear and skepticism.4 Social media platforms have amplified anti-vaccine narratives, often more rapidly than public health agencies can counter them. The result is a decline in vaccine confidence, especially among parents making decisions for young children.6

Growing distrust in the government and medical institutions, compounded by the politicization of public health during the COVID-19 pandemic, has eroded vaccine uptake.8 Religious and philosophical exemptions from vaccination have similarly contributed to under-immunized clusters, thus facilitating measles outbreaks in regions where overall vaccine availability is not the limiting factor.5,9

Dr. Adam Ratner, director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at New York University (NYU) Langone Health, states that even though measles is one of the most contagious human diseases, it is entirely preventable with the vaccine, but it can be fatal for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated populations, especially children.10

Each measles outbreak places a substantial burden on the financial and operational infrastructure of healthcare systems. Containing a single measles outbreak can require thousands of staff hours for contact tracing, emergency immunizations, and public health messaging.8 Hospitalizations, isolation protocols, and complications such as encephalitis or pneumonia also increase strain on public health budgets and resources.8

Responding to measles outbreaks imposes a significant economic burden on public health systems. Each measles case can cost public agencies between $48,000 and $142,000 in direct response efforts such as case investigation, laboratory testing, contact tracing, post-exposure prophylaxis, and emergency vaccination campaigns.11

These costs scale rapidly during large outbreaks. For example, the 2019 New York outbreak exceeded $8.4 million in public health response expenditures.

Localized outbreaks divert funding and staffing from other essential services, thus weakening the resilience of public health infrastructure. In fact, recent studies have confirmed that measles outbreak costs significantly exceed the cost of prevention through routine immunization programs.5,9

The resurgence of measles also endangers the health of infants who are too young to be vaccinated, immunocompromised individuals, and pregnant women, all of whom are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes.2

In response to the resurgence of measles, public health institutions have implemented a wide range of strategic interventions to increase vaccination rates, rebuild public trust, and address systemic barriers to immunization.

One of the primary approaches has been the rollout of large-scale vaccination campaigns and, in some areas, the declaration of public health emergencies to mobilize resources and ensure that unvaccinated populations are identified and vaccinated promptly.1

Policy changes have also been implemented, with several governments eliminating non-medical exemptions for school entry, thereby reducing the number of children attending educational institutions without immunization. For example, following a significant outbreak linked to Disneyland, California lawmakers passed legislation that led to a substantial increase in MMR vaccine coverage statewide.5

Health professionals and community advocates must also engage with and educate communities to dispel myths and misinformation surrounding vaccine safety. Interactive campaigns that include workshops, social media engagement, and school-based initiatives have shown promise in reversing hesitancy, particularly when they are specific to the values and concerns of each community.8

In many settings, these engagement strategies have shifted public perception and increased willingness to vaccinate. However, the long-term success of these programs depends on sustained investment, government efforts, and public cooperation to ensure comprehensive and consistent vaccination coverage.

To regain control over measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, a comprehensive and multi-factorial approach is essential. Rebuilding public trust in medical institutions remains a top priority and requires transparent, empathetic, and consistent communication. Educational initiatives must address vaccine safety and the severe consequences of preventable diseases, with messaging tailored to the cultural and regional needs of specific communities.4

Technological innovations such as microarray patches (MAPs) also offer promising solutions to improve vaccine accessibility and acceptance by removing barriers associated with needle-based delivery systems and streamlining distribution logistics.8

Given the high transmissibility of measles, effective control depends on strong global coordination to enhance disease surveillance, maintain robust routine immunization programs, and ensure rapid outbreak response across both high- and low-resource regions.7

Advances in medical technology over the last 30 years have made it easier to detect and treat diabetes, leading to significant health improvements in people with the disease. Despite this, workforce participation among people with diabetes has not improved over time, finds new USC Schaeffer Center research in JAMA Health Forum.

Historically, workforce participation rates have been much lower among people with diabetes due to factors like health complications, time needed to manage the disease and workplace barriers. But the surprising failure of substantial health gains to drive economic progress in this population - a phenomenon that researchers call the ""diabetes paradox"" - suggests that rising diabetes prevalence poses a growing threat to the labor market and strain on government disability programs.

Given the major health improvements in the diabetes population, we would have expected to see more people in the workforce. Instead, there is a large and growing population of people with diabetes who are having challenges with labor market performance that should be addressed.""

Jack Chapel, study author, scholar at the Schaeffer Center and research assistant professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy

Researchers analyzed 20 years of National Health Interview Survey data (1998-2018) on nearly 250,000 Americans ages 40-64. This age range includes a person's peak earning years and coincides with a period when most diabetes diagnoses occur - about 1 in 7 Americans ages 45-64 have diagnosed diabetes, according to federal data. 

However, compared to peers without diabetes, they were consistently 21-24 percentage points less likely to be in the labor force and 12-13 percentage points more likely to claim disability benefits. Even after adjusting for demographic differences, these gaps were large and persistent: 8-11 percentage points and 4-6 percentage points, respectively.

The study findings suggest expanded access to powerful new anti-obesity medications, which could prevent or delay diabetes, could have positive effects on the labor market. And for those with diabetes, health improvements alone may not be enough to help them return to the workforce.

The diabetes paradox may be partly explained by shifts in who is diagnosed, disparities in access to medical advances and the changing nature of work, researchers said.

There may be some good news buried in the findings. If more people with worse economic prospects - due to reasons unrelated to health - are diagnosed with diabetes, it seems likely that overall economic outcomes for this group would have declined.

""The fact that economic outcomes have remained stable might mean things are actually improving beneath the surface,"" said study author Matthew Kahn, a senior scholar at the Schaeffer Center and Provost Professor of Economics and Spatial Sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. ""My hunch is that the expansion of health care access to the poor and the proactive steps taken by those diagnosed with pre-diabetes has meant that the new cohort of people diagnosed with diabetes is more economically vulnerable than in previous decades, complicating comparison over time.""

To better understand labor trends among people with diabetes and identify opportunities to improve workforce participation, researchers said more clinical trials for diabetes prevention and management therapies should assess economic outcomes like employment.

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named his 60-man preliminary roster for the 2025 Gold Cup.

Pochettino will have to whittle his roster down to between 23 and 26 players before the June 4 deadline. The USMNT will kick off the tournament on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago, with group-stage matches to follow against Saudi Arabia and Haiti.

As expected, Pochettino did not include players set to be at the Club World Cup in his roster, excluding the likes of Juventus pair Weston McKennie and Tim Weah, as well as Borussia Dortmund's Gio Reyna.

Club América winger Alex Zendejas is on the roster, with his side set for a one-game playoff against LAFC on May 31 for a spot in the Club World Cup. Should América win that match, Zendejas would presumably be left out of the USMNT's final roster. The same goes for LAFC's Timothy Tillman, who wouldn't be expected to make the final squad regardless.

Some early-season MLS standouts are newcomers to the USMNT picture, including Orlando City right back Alex Freeman and Vancouver Whitecaps pair Sebastian Berhalter and Tristan Blackmon.

PSV right back Richy Ledezma, whose international future is still undecided after he applied for a Mexican passport, was also named to the preliminary roster.

Some notable omissions include the injured Ricardo Pepi and Kevin Paredes, as well as Noahkai Banks, who has returned to fitness for FC Augsburg after missing several matches with injury.

Other seemingly healthy names who missed the cut include Roman Celentano, Bryan Reynolds and Cade Cowell, who have all been named to USMNT rosters in the recent past.

Goalkeepers: Chris Brady (Chicago Fire), Matthew Freese (NYCFC), Diego Kochen (Barcelona), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew), Zack Steffen (Middlesbrough), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace)

Defenders: Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps), George Campbell (CF Montréal), Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic), Sergiño Dest (PSV), Maximilian Dietz (Greuther Fürth), Marlon Fossey (Standard Liège), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union), DeJuan Jones (San Jose Earthquakes), Richy Ledezma (PSV), Kristoffer Lund (Palermo), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Shaq Moore (FC Dallas), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel), Auston Trusty (Celtic), Caleb Wiley (Chelsea), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC)

Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Paxten Aaronson (FC Utrecht), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Gianluca Busio (Venezia), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis), Caden Clark (CF Montréal), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC), Emeka Eneli (Real Salt Lake), Brian Gutiérrez (Chicago Fire), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo), Djordje Mihailovic (Colorado Rapids), Matko Miljevic (Huracán), Aidan Morris (Middlesbrough), Yunus Musah (AC Milan), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union), Tanner Tessmann (Lyon), Timothy Tillman (LAFC), Malik Tillman (PSV), Indiana Vassilev (Philadelphia Union), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew)

Forwards: Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC), Folarin Balogun (AS Monaco), Damion Downs (FC Köln), Christian Pulisic (AC Milan), Josh Sargent (Norwich City), Brandon Vazquez (Austin FC), Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps), Haji Wright (Coventry City) Griffin Yow (Westerlo), Alex Zendejas (Club América)","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

International Football

On Monday, Concacaf released the preliminary rosters for each nation participating in this summer's Gold Cup. Teams were allowed to list up to 60 players who would become eligible for the final 26-man squads, which must be finalized by no later than June 4.

Historically, the Gold Cup has often seen the U.S. men's national team field a rotated squad, mixing a few “A-team” mainstays into an otherwise more youthful or prospective roster as a coach vets a wider portion of their player pool. With so few remaining competitive windows between now and the 2026 World Cup, however, Mauricio Pochettino's longlist includes more of the veteran core that established itself ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Here are the notables regarding who could participate in this summer's regional championship — as well as a few who are already deemed unavailable.

The Gold Cup will be one of two major men's international tournaments being played across the U.S. this summer. The other, the FIFA Club World Cup, is newly expanded to include 32 teams from around the world, including some with USMNT regulars who will now miss the Gold Cup altogether. FIFA has given priority to clubs over countries for those participating in the Club World Cup.

Weston McKennie and Tim Weah retained first-choice status as the U.S. transitioned from Gregg Berhalter to Pochettino, but both are omitted given Juventus' participation in the CWC. Borussia Dortmund's involvement also rules out Giovanni Reyna, although it's unclear if the 22-year-old midfielder will still be part of the German club's plans come this summer.

The Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami guarantee that MLS will have at least two participating clubs. This also keeps a handful of regular members of the USMNT pool unavailable, including a few 2022 World Cup veterans (Jordan Morris, Cristian Roldan and Jesus Ferreira) as well as a few more recent additions (Benjamin Cremaschi, Drake Callender and Jackson Ragen).

The play-in match between Los Angeles FC and Club América could also impact two players listed on the preliminary list. Timothy Tillman is a regular midfielder for LAFC, while Alejandro Zendejas is among Liga MX's most in-form attackers over the past 12 months. Tillman (the elder brother of PSV star Malik Tillman) is already a longshot with so many central midfielders in contention, but Zendejas' club form may tempt Pochettino and his backroom as they survey options in attack.

There are some genuine areas of depth in the USMNT pool, as highlighted in the list. Some, like striker and central midfield, offer numerous players who could start at the international level.

Concerningly, center back and goalkeeper are among the thinnest groups, a point exposed during the Nations League window in March.

In goal, Matt Turner may yet remain first-choice despite seldom featuring on a loan spell with FA Cup-winning Crystal Palace. Zack Steffen, Patrick Schulte, Matt Freese and Chris Brady all start regularly for their MLS clubs. Steffen and Schulte issued mixed performances in their recent international starts, while Freese's cross-claiming is below league average for goalkeepers and Brady is often overworked by a porous Chicago Fire defense.

If Pochettino wants to kick the tires on an untested up-and-comer, he could select Diego Kochen. The 19-year-old started regularly for Barcelona B in 2024-25, while occasionally making the senior club's bench in La Liga and the Champions League. Born in Miami, Kochen has represented the U.S. through the U-19 level and may be the program's top prospect in goal.

That status looks even more secure given the omission of Gabriel Slonina, who was left off of Pochettino's 60-man list. The 21-year-old joined Chelsea in 2022 and his commitment to the USMNT over Poland came to great fanfare, but he struggled during a loan spell with League One side Barnsley this season and must rebuild his stock.

Pochettino selected just nine center backs, a relatively small number considering the bloated nature of this longlist. Many have already been vetted at this level, including all five regulars in Qatar: Tim Ream, Mark McKenzie, Chris Richards, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Walker Zimmerman — though it's worth noting that Zimmerman hasn't played for Nashville SC since suffering a concussion on April 5.

Auston Trusty and Miles Robinson have both established themselves as first-choice options for their clubs and offer viable alternatives to the holdovers. The final pair are among MLS's best defenders in the 2025 season: Tristan Blackmon of the Vancouver Whitecaps, and George Campbell of CF Montréal.

Blackmon and Campbell are two of several players in MLS who have played their way into the pool with regular club involvement. That first-choice status goes a long way as a new coach quickly tries to survey his options ahead of a World Cup, and thrust Patrick Agyemang, Diego Luna and Brian White onto Pochettino's Nations League squad. All three remain in contention to crack the Gold Cup roster.

Also among the notables is Alex Freeman, the 20-year-old right back who has dazzled in his rookie season with Orlando City. At 6-foot-2, Freeman is a true two-way full back who arrives right after a lack of depth behind Sergiño Dest (who is available after missing the Copa América with a torn ACL) was exposed in his year-long absence. Max Arfsten and Sean Zawadzki previously earned call-ups thanks to their work with the Columbus Crew, and are among the 60 players available for the Gold Cup. Sebastian Berhalter and Jack McGlynn are two young midfielders who are vital parts of their MLS teams' engine rooms, and could be viable box-to-box options in McKennie's absence. Berhalter's inclusion, given he's the son of Pochettino's predecessor, carries some added significance.

Other notables from the domestic league include Luca De La Torre, restored amidst his loan to San Diego FC, versatile Emeka Eneli of Real Salt Lake, and dynamic attacking midfielder Quinn Sullivan of the East-leading Philadelphia Union.

A day after finishing off a stunning late surge to defend their Eredivisie title, PSV's American quartet learned of their summer status.

As expected, Tillman and Dest are up for selection, as Tillman tries to carve out an attacking midfield starting role under Pochettino while Dest returns from injury. Joining them is Richy Ledezma. The 24-year-old earned his only USMNT cap to date in 2020, but returns after spending much of the season playing right back for PSV. Concacaf lists Ledezma as a midfielder on this list, and his selection comes after some speculation if he'd make a one-time switch to represent Mexico. Whether he makes the final squad remains to be seen, but it's notable that he is not included on Mexico's preliminary squad.

Rounding out the group is the expected absence of Ricardo Pepi, whose season ended in late January with a knee injury against Liverpool. His omission opens the door for other strikers to make their cases, as Pepi was arguably the pool's most in-form forward up until his season's premature end.

The full 60-man preliminary list, assigned to position groups as listed by Concacaf:

Goalkeepers: Chris Brady (Chicago Fire); Matt Freese (New York City FC); Diego Kochen (FC Barcelona); Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew); Zack Steffen (Colorado Rapids); Matt Turner (Nottingham Forest)

Nerazzurri captain Lautaro Martinez says that Inter Milan “will give everything” to win the Club World Cup this summer.

Speaking to the FIFA official social media channel, via FCInterNews, the Argentina gave his thoughts ahead of the tournament.

Next month, Inter Milan will play in the expanded Club World Cup.

In the meantime, the Nerazzurri will wrap up their Serie A campaign. Then, there will be the Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain on the 31st of May.

The Club World Cup will be something entirely new for the Nerazzurri.

For the first time ever, FIFA will hold the competition in the summer.

Moreover, the football governing body has expanded the format of the tournament.

Now, the Club World Cup will feature a total of 32 teams. Inter will be one of two Italian clubs at in the United States for the tournament, along with Juventus.

Inter Milan captain Lautaro Martinez said that “I'm really fired up for the idea of participating in the Club World Cup.”

“I think it will be a fantastic experience,” he went on.

“It reminds me a lot of the World Cup.”

Martinez predicted that “it will be incredible.”

“Because it will be the first time that this competition is played with this format.”

“So I'm excited, and very curious to see how it all ends up,” the Inter captain added.

Meanwhile, Lautaro Martinez predicted that facing Mexican club Monterrey in Los Angeles will be “fantastic.”

“It's going to have a wonderful atmosphere,” he said. “And certainly a hostile one.”

“Because it's a big stadium. So there are going to be a lot of fans in the stands.”

“Mexico isn't far from Los Angeles,” the Inter captain noted. “So it will be fantastic.”

“I like playing in matches like this. The more fans there are in the stadium, the more hostile the atmosphere is.”

“But I think that's good,” Martinez said. “Because it pushes you to give your best.”

“So I hope it goes well for us, of course. But as I always say, the most important thing is that we enjoy ourselves and give our all for Inter.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Pep Guardiola refuses to answer question concerning Dean Henderson's controversial handball. (1:24)

Kevin De Bruyne has cast doubt over whether he will play at the Club World Cup because he fears getting injured before he leaves Manchester City.

De Bruyne is out of contract at the end of the season and will become a free agent but there is the potential he could sign a short-term extension that would enable to him to play in the newly expanded Club World Cup in June and July.

Kevin De Bruyne (2019-20) is tied with Thierry Henry (2002-03) for the most assists registered in a single Premier League campaign (20).

""I think in a way I have to take care of myself because if I get injured in the Club World Cup, what am I going to do?"" De Bruyne said.

""Nobody's going to take care of me at that point. So there's a big chance probably I won't play it, but I don't know, maybe yes.""

De Bruyne will leave City after 10 years and 14 major trophies after the Premier League club decided not to offer him a new deal.

At the age of 33, he is now considering his options, but says there has been uncertainty over whether City wants him to be part of its squad for the Club World Cup in United States.

With two games left to go this season, he said he had to consider what is best for his own career as he prepares for his next move.

""I have to take care of my family. I've got three kids, my wife, it's not an easy process at this time,"" he said.

The timing of the Club World Cup, which has been expanded from seven teams to 32, has led to FIFA introducing a short-term transfer window to enable players whose contracts expire on June 30 to move to clubs participating in the tournament.

It also allows players like De Bruyne to sign short-term deals purely to take part before moving on as free agents.

But that brings with it the risk of him suffering a serious injury that would jeopardise a future transfer.

If he doesn't play at the Club World Cup, De Bruyne will leave City empty-handed after Saturday's FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace.

City also surrendered the Premier League title this season after winning an unprecedented four in a row.

""This year has just not gone the way we wanted it to. You have to accept it. You have to move on and work hard and go again,"" De Bruyne said.

""It's alright. This doesn't change anything that's happened in the past 10 years."" De Bruyne said he has yet to decide on his next move would and whether he would look to join another Premier League team.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo's Al-Nassr contract is set to expire on June 30, and there is still no announcement over his future. Reports in Saudi Arabia suggest he will decide over the coming days, with the SPL season ending on May 26.

The Portuguese international side has not qualified for the AFC Champions League next season, which could mean Ronaldo could rethink his future with the Knights of Najd.

Reports have suggested several teams participating in the FIFA Club World Cup this summer are interested in bringing the 40-year-old in before the competition. According to MaisFutebol, one of those will face Real Madrid in the group stage, the Saudi side, Al-Hilal.

It will likely be Xabi Alonso as head coach as Real Madrid kick off the tournament against Al-Za'eem on June 18. It would be a media dream for Ronaldo to line up against his former club, something he has never done before.

Ronaldo has been linked with various destinations after his contract expires, but has also said he is happy in Saudi Arabia, with his family settled since moving in 2023. However, the lack of trophies could be frustrating, as his goal is always to win.

Al-Nassr are said to have an offer on the table for the forward, who still feels he has more playing years ahead. However, will we see him in the US for the Club World Cup?

Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. trains with Portugal's under-15 squad. (1:58)

Botafogo coach Renato Paiva said ""you can't say no to a star like that"" when asked about reports that Cristiano Ronaldo has received an offer to join his team ahead of the Club World Cup.

Paiva's side, along with other Brazilian teams Fluminense, Flamengo and Palmeiras, will take part in the tournament to be held in the United States from June 14 until July 13.

Marca reported on Sunday that Cristiano Ronaldo has received a tempting offer from an unnamed Brazilian club that would grant the Al Nassr captain the possibility of playing at the Club World Cup.

Asked about those reports, Paiva laughed and told a news conference: ""Christmas is only in December ... But if he came, you can't say no to a star like that. I don't know anything. I'm just answering the question. But, as I said, coaches always want the best. Ronaldo, even at his age, is still a goal-scoring machine. In a team that creates chance after chance, he would be good.""

Paiva then hinted that the only person who could answer that question is Botafogo's American owner John Textor.

""This question needs to be asked in another language,"" he said.

Al Nassr, who will finish the season without a trophy, are not one of the 32 teams that will compete at the Club World Cup.

Ronaldo, who turned 40 on Feb. 5, has yet to sign a new deal with Al Nassr with his current contract expiring on June 30.

The Portugal captain and five-time Ballon d'Or winner has scored 33 goals in 39 appearances across all competitions this season for the Saudi club.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Real Madrid have already wrapped up two signings for this summer, not including the arrival of new manager Xabi Alonso. A third is believed to be close, and Los Blancos are not looking at bringing in a fourth reinforcement ahead of their trip to the United States for the Club World Cup.

Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to arrive alongside Bournemouth central defender Dean Huijsen, whose signing was announced over the weekend. Those deals are part of a three-pronged approach to improve their defence, and Real Madrid are now close to securing a deal for left-back Alvaro Carreras too.

Alonso reportedly wants Real Madrid to look into bringing in a new midfielder this summer too, and while many believe that will be more of a tone-setting player in the engine room, they could add another playmaker too. Having allowed Nico Paz to head to Como last summer, the Argentina international has flourished, and Real Madrid have been linked with a return move for him too.

After a €6m move, Los Blancos have a €9m buyback option this summer, and Cadena Cope say that Paz's return could be brought forward ahead of the Club World Cup. Previously it had been reported that they were planning on making the signing, but there was no certainty on whether he would stay, or be sold on at a profit.

Inter were reportedly keen on bringing in Paz this summer, and if Los Blancos do hold onto him, then their alternative idea was to make a move for Turkish starlet Arda Guler. It looks as if Guler will stay this summer, but it will be difficult for Alonso to give both Paz and Guler, who play in similar roles, the minutes they desire next season.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Blighted buildings will be torn down, shuttles will take visitors nonstop from the airport to the Galleria and the airport will have a designated area added just to help process foreign guests in town for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

And while right now, Carlos Carrillo said his 4 a.m. drive to work on the North Freeway near Parker Road is practically pitch black at times, the city said he can expect to see some light soon.

""I counted because I went all the way over there to the Beltway. I think there's about 80 lights and at least 80 percent of them are out,"" Carrilo told 13 Investigates.

The changes are all a part of the City of Houston's plans to make improvements to the city ahead of the seven Super Bowl-size World Cup games next summer that are expected to draw in millions of people from across the world.

13 Investigates wanted to know more about the projects Houston Public Works is prioritizing ahead of the games, so we requested their emails.

One resident reached out to the Mayor's office about ""an abundance of the tall freeway light towers"" that are ""inoperative"" on Interstate 610 and U.S. Highway 59.

""The area between I-10 and 59 on loop 610 thru the Galleria, 75% were not working. I first called TxDOT and they referred me to the city because it (is) their responsibility,"" the resident said in a Jan. 3, 2025, email to the Mayor's office. ""I know the Mayor campaigned on public safety and I feel like this is an issue for the traveling public and the first responders working accident scenes.""

That email was forwarded to a spokesperson for the Houston Public Works Department and they discussed who could best answer the resident's concerns about the ownership of the freeway lights.

""We are aware of these issues. The major challenges we currently face are wire theft, aging infrastructure, difficulty hiring qualified personnel, unreported damage by unknown contractors and knocked down electrical services,"" a maintenance manager at Houston Public Works said in internal emails. ""The freeway lighting is a major project we are working on, as we are trying to get them all repaired and burning by the 2026 World Cup games.""

When 13 Investigates asked the city about maintaining tower lighting on interstates, they sent us a similar response, citing the challenges with wire theft and aging infrastructure.

""Houston Public Works is committed to maintaining the mast lighting along freeways and highways within Houston city limits,"" a Public Works spokesperson said in a statement. ""Repair work includes coordinating with TxDOT on when they can assist with closing down traffic lanes for our crews to make these repairs while working around their construction schedule. Freeway lighting is a major project as the city prepares for the 2026 World Cup games. We encourage the community to report any freeway lights that are out to 311 so our team can track and add the location to the list for repairs.""

The city is also working to tear down what it calls ""blighted"" and ""dangerous"" buildings ahead of the World Cup, including the old Greyhound station at 2121 Main Street and an old hotel at 801 St. Joseph's Parkway.

""The administration wants to take action against two properties in advance of the World Cup in 2026,"" an attorney with the City of Houston's Legal Department said in a Nov. 27, 2024, email to the Department of Neighborhoods and Houston Permitting Center.

The city sent out inspectors to both properties so they can ""consider (their) options and perhaps reach out to the owners to take down the buildings.""

The city also said there are ""several other properties the city administration would like inspected.""

13 Investigates: Fixing Houston's dangerous buildings is a 'long and drawn-out process'

13 Investigates has reported on the city's dangerous buildings list in the past and the long drawn out process to get these eyesores taken down.

""It's just decaying. It's catching bats, gnats, rats, roaches, insects and diseases,"" David Valdez said as he waited at a bus stop near the St. Joseph's Parkway property. ""You look at the graffiti and then you look at all the woodwork over here boarded up on the windows and you can tell it's abandoned.""

The city is also working to clean up graffiti, perform landscaping, restripe roads and fix sidewalks ahead of the World Cup games. They're also planning to build a park on the east side of downtown near where a month-long fan fest party will be hosted next summer.

A recent study from the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs found that bad road conditions are actually residents' top concern for the city.

In a Jan. 24, 2025, email to the Houston Public Works Director, the department's communications director asks ""Can you shed light on what HPW is doing '500 days to the World Cup' for potholes? Is anything changing from our side? Are we looking at things different? The Mayor's Office is asking for talking points and this is the first I'm hearing of this.""

The Public Works Director responds saying their message needs to be in alignment with what the Mayor previously told the contractors association.

""Our message really ought to be the fact that we're getting Houston ready to be Houston every day. The World Cup is a special event, but our emphasis needs to be on fixing our problems today for everyone to enjoy all the time,"" the Public Works director said.

Houston Mayor John Whitmire only took office in January 2024, and Houston was announced as a host city in 2022, but we wanted to why these city infrastructure projects can be deemed ""high priority and aggressive"" for the World Cup but not always year-round.

The Mayor's office declined an interview about preparations leading into the World Cup. But, during a city council meeting in January, Whitmire doubled down on the need to make changes for residents.

""I go to meetings on a regular basis about how we have to improve 'this' or 'that' for the World Cup, and I interrupt them to say, 'No, we need to get it ready for Houstonians and if we get it ready for Houstonians and Harris County residents on a daily basis, we will be ready for FIFA,'"" Whitmire said.

Chase Murphy, who has lived in Houston the last eight years, said the city needs to make sure it cares more about its local community.

""We shouldn't have to wait for large events like the World Cup coming. This is a melting pot. Hundreds of people move here every day and so we want to make sure that our city has a good reputation outside of all the external people coming from Europe and all other countries coming to our town,"" Murphy said.

Luka Vušković

Zlatko Dalić has named a 24-man Croatia squad for the opening matches of the European qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Croatia are set to kick off their World Cup qualifying journey in June. The Vatreni will face Gibraltar in Faro, Portugal on 6 June (20:45 CET), before hosting the Czech Republic at the Opus Arena in Osijek on 9 June (20:45 CET).

Captain Luka Modrić continues to lead the team, while young defender Luka Vušković receives his first senior call-up after an impressive season in Belgium.

“Through the Nations League, we've shaped a squad that will carry us into the qualifiers. Our goal is well-known and clear – to qualify for the World Cup,” said Dalić. “We mustn't underestimate Gibraltar, as that game will be key for gaining momentum before facing the Czech Republic, which is one of the crucial fixtures of the qualifiers.”

Dalić stressed the importance of mental and physical preparation for the June matches, as the team aims to secure six points at the start of their campaign.

There are a few notable absentees. Nikola Vlašić is sidelined due to a health issue, while Borna Sosa has been left out after a lengthy period without first-team football at Torino. 

Marco Pašalić, currently playing in MLS, may be added later, depending on his club's willingness to release him before 2 June.

“Luka Vušković has earned his place with consistently strong performances in Belgium. This is a great opportunity for him to experience the senior national team environment and stay motivated to keep progressing,” Dalić added.

He also congratulated players who recently won domestic titles or fulfilled club ambitions, expressing hope that this success would carry into the national team's performances.

The squad will gather in Rijeka on 30 May for preparations, travelling to Faro on 5 June. After the Gibraltar match, the team returns to Osijek to prepare for the clash against the Czech Republic.

Due to Croatia's participation in the UEFA Nations League quarter-finals, they join the qualification campaign later than others. 

After the June fixtures, Croatia will play two matches in each of the remaining international windows: in September (Faroe Islands away, Montenegro home), October (Czech Republic away, Gibraltar home), and November (Faroe Islands home, Montenegro away).

Gary Lineker will leave the BBC, the broadcaster has announced.

His final show will be next Sunday's Match of the Day and he will not present the broadcaster's coverage of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Lineker will bring an early end to his BBC tenure via mutual agreement, days after he apologised for sharing a post which led to accusations of anti-semitism.

The broadcaster has now confirmed his exit date in a statement on Monday.

It has also been reported that the former England striker, who is paid around £1.35m, will not receive a payoff from the BBC.

Gary Lineker said: “Football has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember – both on the pitch and in the studio.

“I care deeply about the game, and about the work I've done with the BBC over many years. As I've said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic – it goes against everything I stand for.

“However, I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.”

Lineker came under fire for re-sharing a pro-Gaza video which likened supporters of Israel to rats.

The image of rats has historically been used as part of anti-semitic propaganda, including in Nazi Germany during the 1930s.

The post was soon deleted but not before it was widely viewed and sparked calls for the BBC to part ways with Lineker.

The 64-year-old issued an apology the following day and said: “On Instagram I re-posted material which I have since learned contained offensive references.

“I very much regret these references. I would never knowingly share anything anti-semitic. It goes against everything I believe in.

“The post was removed as soon as I became aware of the issue.

“Whilst I strongly believe in the importance of speaking out on humanitarian issues, including the tragedy unfolding in Gaza, I also know that how we do so matters.

""I take full responsibility for this mistake. That image does not reflect my views.”

It was announced last October Lineker would depart flagship show Match of the Day at the end of the 2024/25 season.

The former England international had presented the highlights show since 1999.

In the announcement, it was revealed Lineker would remain part of the BBC's football coverage for a further 18 months before cutting all ties with the broadcaster.

He had agreed a contract extension to stay on and present next season's FA Cup coverage along with the 2026 World Cup.

But that will be no longer be the case.

Tim Davie, BBC Director-General, said: “Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made. Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.

“Gary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades. His passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.”

Lineker's future at the BBC was a hot topic earlier in the season given his contract was due to expire at the end of the 2024/25 campaign.

The 64-year-old also commanded a salary more than £1.3million-a-year at the BBC, the broadcaster's highest declared salary for a presenter.

Lineker had previously come under fire for his social media usage.

In March last year, Lineker was briefly suspended from hosting Match of the Day after a Twitter post about the British government's asylum policy prompted a row about BBC presenters expressing political views on social media.

Lineker's fellow presenters and pundits, including Alan Shearer and Ian Wright, refused to appear on the show in solidarity with Lineker and it was reduced to a 20-minute highlights package, which contained no hosts, pundits or commentary.

The ex-Everton, Leicester, Barcelona and Tottenham star was reinstated to the programme just over a week later.

The 64-year-old replaced Des Lynam in the MOTD role in 1999 after moving into punditry and presenting following his playing career.

He headed up the BBC's coverage of the FA Cup final on Saturday, which saw Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 1-0.

Here's the latest information on how to watch the expanded tournament across North American markets next year

2025 marks the start of a brave new frontier for the FIFA Club World Cup as - for the first time - an expanded tournament will bring together almost three-dozen of the biggest and best teams from across six continents to compete for the ultimate prize.

Having been touted for several generations, the new-look format for arguably what is the biggest prize in club football will invite a host of teams from multiple nations to contest for the glory in the United States, one year before the United 2026 FIFA World Cup.

From UEFA Champions League heavyweights Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich to South American giants Boca Juniors and Palmeiras, and the return of Lionel Messi with Inter Miami, there are plenty of big names to follow along with.

But just how will you be able to watch it all unfold? Who will show the tournament in full? And which cable, satellite and streaming providers will be your best bet to see some of the greatest players in the world?

Here, GOAL offers you the answers on how to watch and stream the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Opinion articles provide independent perspectives on key community issues, separate from our newsroom reporting.

It has been an astounding decade-plus for sports in the Kansas City metropolitan area: three Super Bowls, a World Series title, a Major League Soccer Cup, the first purpose-built stadium for women's sports and the annual Big 12 Basketball Championship. Kansas City's selection as one of only 16 FIFA World Cup host cities in 2026 highlights its rise as a top place to live both for fans and casual observers.

Yes, our region and nation face challenges larger than sports — but that doesn't diminish the opportunity. Regardless of the political climate, we rely on our elected leaders to advocate for resources needed to maximize the impact that events like the World Cup can have, and to support the services required to safely host 650,000 visitors over six weeks next year.

Planning is well underway. Hotel rooms are booked within a 250-mile radius. FIFA has identified three potential base camps in Lawrence, Kansas City and KCK. While these cities won't know if they're selected as camp sites until early next year, our central location is ideal for teams competing across North America.

Kansas City's existing rental cars and ride-hailing vehicles won't meet the demand to move people to World Cup events. Transit agencies nationwide are scrambling to get the vehicles and operators necessary to scale up their services, and to identify and prepare for the challenges to public safety and security that such a large event will bring. Johnson County plans to pilot a new service connecting Kansas City International Airport to the Sheraton in Overland Park, with a stop in Lenexa — funded by a federal grant and partnerships among local governments and the Mid-America Regional Council. 

But simply getting visitors to hotels isn't enough. Johnson County has also designed a circulator route to connect visitors to cultural attractions, businesses and the FIFA Fan Festivals at the National World War I Museum and Memorial. This could be a turning point for public transit, showing its value to a new generation.

Yet, no funding exists for the circulator route. Without it, we risk missing the full economic potential. When Sens. Jerry Moran of Kansas and Maria Cantwell of Washington seek $50 million for host cities, or Reps. Sharice Davids of Kansas and Buddy Carter of Georgia push for transit support, they are working to secure the federal assistance local agencies need — not only to safely transport tens of thousands of international visitors to and from World Cup activities, but to our local parks, downtowns, shops and restaurants. 

The World Cup is fewer than 400 days away. It will impact law enforcement, emergency response and public transit. Local governments are preparing — and we deeply appreciate any support that helps us deliver a safe, secure and successful event.

Neil Ryan's squad is packed with talent, with plenty who have the potential to become household names in the coming years

There might be no senior tournament for the England men's team this summer, but that doesn't mean it has to be a quiet off-season for Three Lions supporters. In June, Lee Carsley's Under-21s will defend their European Championship crown in Slovakia, while the U19s will kick-off their own Euros at around the same time in Romania.

First up, though, are the U17s, who have travelled to Albania for their own continental competition as they aim to win the Euros for the third time, and first since 2014. Dominic Solanke was the star of the show back then, while the likes of Wayne Rooney, Cesc Fabregas and Toni Kroos have been named Player of the Tournament down the years.

It is a competition, then, where stars of the future can catch the eye, and coach Neil Ryan certainly has an extremely talented squad to work with as England prepare for group games against Belgium, defending champions Italy, and the Czech Republic.

But which players have the potential to use this tournament as an initial springboard towards becoming a key member of the senior squad further down the line? GOAL has picked out six players to keep a particular eye on...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

There's a reason many tennis fans around the world have a soft spot for Alexander Bublik. It's not just his electrifying, unpredictable style of play - a blend of speed and creativity rarely seen on the tour - but also his charisma and humor. After winning the third edition of the Piemonte Open Intesa Sanpaolo with a commanding 6-3, 6-3 victory over China's Yunchaokete Bu on Sunday, Bublik charmed the crowd by opening his speech with a flawless “Buongiorno signore e signori,” in Italian, sealing an already unforgettable performance.Held at the Circolo della Stampa Sporting in Turin, the ATP Challenger 175 event saw Bublik deliver some of his best tennis on clay, a surface where he'd never before won such a high-level title. The former World No. 17 won five high-quality matches in six days, showcasing peak form throughout the week. In the final, he capitalized on his opponent's back issues and was dominant from start to finish. Even when briefly broken in each set, Bublik responded immediately, closing the match in just 73 minutes with a second-serve ace.

Plus, how are former Roland Garros finalists Casper Ruud and Alexander Zverev one week out of a Paris return?ByJoel DruckerPublished May 19, 2025 copy_link

Published May 19, 2025

Following consecutive ATP Masters 1000 clay-court tournaments, the Mutua Madrid Open and Internazionali BNL d'Italia, comes five storylines ahead of Roland Garros. Here's what we're taking away going into Paris:1. Per Usual, Two at the TopThe seemingly monolithic structure of an individual sport such as tennis has invariably lent itself to two or possibly three dominant players in many a given era. Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall. Margaret Court and Billie Jean King. Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe. Connors, McEnroe, Ivan Lendl. Martina Navratilova Chrissie Evert, Tracy Austin. Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker. Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. Serena and Venus Williams. And, of course, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic.Though it was barely over a year ago that Jannik Sinner joined Carlos Alcaraz as a Grand Slam winner, there is no question that these two are the pace horses of contemporary men's tennis. Back in action following a three-month suspension, Sinner in Rome picked up where he left off, showing scarcely a sign of rust to reach the finals before he was beaten by Alcaraz.“After three months coming here making this result means a lot to me,” said Sinner. “For sure it's a good lesson then for Paris.”

“After three months coming here making this result means a lot to me,” said Sinner. “For sure it's a good lesson then for Paris.”

Sinner's ability to generate pace and depth from just about anywhere on the court is incredible. Added to that is his tremendous tranquility, a powerful form of detachment that greatly helps Sinner excel. It all adds up to a clinical brilliance, similar in many ways to Djokovic's playing style.Alcaraz's approach to point construction and crowd interaction is completely different. While Sinner mostly keeps his blinders on akin to such greats as Borg and Lendl, Alcaraz wants to bring the audience into the action, more in the spirit of Connors and Nadal. Alcaraz's sheer enjoyment for the sport and joyful opportunity to interact with his rivals is rare and endearing.“I love watching him play,” Alcaraz said about Jack Draper prior to their quarterfinal match in Rome. “It's going to be a beautiful match to watch.” Note that Draper had beaten Alcaraz the most recent time they'd played one another—and there was Alcaraz, prior to the battle more enthused than vengeful.Patiently blending speeds, spins, short and deep shots, along with intermittent forward movement, Alcaraz's victory over Sinner, at least this time, proved the case for breadth over depth. In the first set, the Spaniard fought off two set points, eventually took it in a tiebreaker, then snapped open the second set, 6-1, to end Sinner's 26-match winning streak. This was the fourth straight time Alcaraz had beaten Sinner (victory number three was the bookend start to Sinner's streak). The Spaniard now leads their rivalry 7-4.Said Alcaraz, “[This was] probably one of the best matches I played so far in terms of level, maintain all the level during the whole match. . . [versus Jannik] I have to be ready and I have to think clear every time that I'm going to play the point or a game, the things that I have to do if I miss just to keep it going in the same way. And yeah, at the beginning I knew what I have to do, and I maintained that kind of strategy during the whole match.”With all these achievements in mind, two words I'd like to see eliminated regarding Alcaraz's playing style: high risk. When someone of any age—much less Alcaraz's 22—has won four majors and seven Masters 1000 titles, such a notion is absurd. Those spectacular shots Alcaraz hits that construct and conclude many a rally? They are not leased. They are owned.

Coming into Roland Garros this year, which three-time Grand Slam finalist would you rather be, Casper Ruud or Alexander Zverev?Ruud will arrive at Roland Garros having won Madrid and reached the quarters in Rome—where he won but one game versus Sinner. Still, Madrid marked Ruud's first Tennis Masters 1000 title. Zverev won an ATP 500 event in Munich, lost in the round of 16 of Madrid to Francisco Cerundolo and was beaten in the quarters of Rome by Lorenzo Musetti.And yet while Zverev's resume boasts more accomplishments—including seven Tennis Masters 1000 titles and a 4-2 edge over Ruud—when it comes to matters of conduct and the poise it often takes to sustain an excellent career and perhaps even win a major, Ruud has a distinct edge.In an imagined tennis laboratory, located in an ITF-approved region, might it be possible for Ruud to take receipt of Zverev's backhand and Zverev obtain Ruud's manners?For now, though, these longstanding top tenners head to Roland Garros armed with their own blend of style, confidence, and the strong desire to capture the one big prize that has eluded each of them.But as the likes of David Ferrer, David Nalbandian, Todd Martin, Brian Gottfried, Cliff Richey, Tom Okker, and Dennis Ralston have shown, many shapes, sizes, styles, and plot twists define the journey of the best man to have never won a singles major. Honorable Mention in the 2025 version of this category goes to two-time Slam finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas.

The current state of Novak Djokovic is in large part a litmus test. If you don't like your job, you wonder why someone who's done so much and is worth millions continues to grind away, particularly amid recent occurrences.In the last five tournaments he's played this year, Djokovic has lost his opening match four times (the only exception was a run to the finals in Miami). Included in that are a pair of instant exits at clay court events in Monte Carlo to 32nd-ranked Alejandro Tabilo and in Madrid to No. 33 Matteo Arnaldi. Djokovic subsequently withdrew from Rome and, for the second year in a row, took a wild card into Geneva.He also announced the end of his working relationship with Andy Murray. Per several recent news stories, Djokovic appears ready to start working with his fellow Serbian, Viktor Troicki.But if you like your job, you grasp Djokovic's desire to squeeze every last drop out of a game he's loved since childhood.“Kind of new reality for me,” said Djokovic following the loss to Arnaldi. “I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament.”“It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments. But, you know, that's, I guess, the circle of life and the career, eventually it was going to happen. Now I'm trying to, you know, use this as a driving force for the future. Obviously Grand Slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me. Which doesn't mean that I don't want to win here, of course I wanted to, but, you know, Grand Slams is where I really want to play the best tennis. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that in Roland Garros, but I'll do my best.”

We now you bring you what may well be the longest running question in tennis history: Why can't American men win more on clay?Save for the 1989-1999 period when Michael Chang, Jim Courier and Andre Agassi collectively reached eight Roland Garros finals and won four titles there (Courier twice), we can just about always count on a dry red season of European clay court results for American men.In Madrid, four American men—Taylor Fritz, Brandon Nakashima, Tommy Paul, Frances Tiafoe—reached the round of 16. All lost. In Rome, only Paul got that far, eventually advancing to the semis for the second straight year before losing to Sinner by the topsy-turvy score of 1-6, 6-0, 6-3.Concurrently, just as they had once examined the clay court hotbed of Spain, USTA officials have been studying Italy to learn lessons about player development. One answer, of course, is to build more clay courts and provide more clay court training from a young age. But since when have fast-moving Americans—be it at work or play, as children or adults—had what it takes to build and subsequently master the nuances of a surface that demands exceptional patience and frequent maintenance?For at least when it comes to tennis, our nation's tennis sensibilities learn more towards the mass and monetizable utilitarian than the carefully cultivated craftsmanship clay demands. No question, America's cadre of highly skilled men will fight the good fight at Roland Garros and make every effort possible versus many a dirt-trained warrior. There will definitely be some impressive moments. Still, as has been the case for years, the bigger message will be: Onward to Wimbledon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Second Serve: Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner renew rivalry which could become one for the ages","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cx2e0reevr7o","Mon, 19 May 2025 11:20:47 GMT","

In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko discusses the rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

There are a number of factors which turn an exciting rivalry into an epic, enduring duel that transcends the sport.

The core talent. The blend of personalities. The gripping encounters on the biggest stages.

The tussle between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz - ranked one and two in the men's game - has all those components.

It also has arguably the most important ingredient: each player being pushed to a greater height by the other.

Their rivalry resumed in the final of the Italian Open, marking a fitting end to the men's singles at a tournament where Sinner returned from a three-month ban for failing two doping tests.

Spain's Alcaraz, benefiting from more matches in the tank, ruined the perfect homecoming for Italy's Sinner to record his seventh victory in their 11 meetings.

Sinner, 23, has been the ATP's dominant player for the past 18 months, winning 85 of his 92 matches and claiming nine titles.

But Alcaraz is the one dominating their head-to-head record. 

Alcaraz has won four Grand Slam titles (2022 US Open, 2023 & 2024 Wimbledon, 2024 French Open), while Sinner has claimed three majors (2024 & 2025 Australian Open, 2024 US Open)

Alcaraz understands he has to go to a different place to get the better of Sinner, who was on a 26-match winning streak going into the Rome final.

The 22-year-old Spaniard, a gifted and sometimes flashy shot-maker, can lose focus on court and pick the wrong shot.

But there was none of that in a disciplined performance against Sinner.

""If I don't play at my best it's going to be impossible to beat him,"" Alcaraz said afterwards.

""That's why I'm more focused when I'm playing against him, or I feel a little bit different when I'm going to face him.""

It was a final many in the sport wanted, one everybody was excited about.

And it was another tantalising reminder of how the Alcaraz and Sinner rivalry - which the ATP Tour has long pinned its hopes on filling the Federer-Nadal-Djokovic void - could be a blockbuster for years to come.

""I'm not going to say I'm feeling like when Rafa and Roger are playing,"" Alcaraz added. 

""But I'm feeling like it is a different energy when we are facing each other than other players.""

Roll on Roland Garros - where the smart money would go on the top two seeds meeting again in the French Open men's final.

While it was never going to be a long-term arrangement, the timing of Andy Murray's stint coaching Novak Djokovic coming to an end before the French Open - and Wimbledon - surprised many.

Italian fans have waited 40 years to celebrate a home singles victory in Rome. A jubilant Jasmine Paolini ended that run on Saturday.

At the start of the clay-court swing we discussed how Iga Swiatek had a mountain of ranking points to defend - and it could not have gone much worse for the four-time French Open champion.

Swiatek has slipped to fifth in the WTA rankings and will be seeded outside of the top four at Roland Garros.

The means she could face any of the top four seeds - Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula or Jasmine Paolini - as early as the quarter-finals.

In the ATP rankings, Alcaraz made the most significant move, while Italy's Lorenzo Musetti - who lost to the Spaniard in the semi-finals - climbed another place into a new career-high of eighth.

Czech powerhouse Jakub Mensik - the highest ranked teenager in the top 100 - has cracked the top 20 for the first time after reaching the Rome last 16.

Just call her 'Clay-tie'. 

Katie Boulter gave herself a new nickname after claiming a WTA 125 title on the red dirt.

Clay is a surface where the 28-year-old still has very limited experience and has struggled to adapt her aggressive baseline game at the top level.

Winning the Paris tournament on the tier below the main WTA Tour will boost  Boulter's confidence before the French Open, where she is still to win a main-draw match.

Victory means Boulter has moved up to 38th in the rankings, putting a little more light between the British number one and her nearest rivals Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal.

Raducanu has climbed to 43rd after her run to the Rome last 16, where Gauff showed the gulf that remains between the Briton and the world's leading players. 

On the men's side, Jack Draper demonstrated again how he is becoming a force on clay by reaching the quarter-finals in the Italian capital.

There was also strong British involvement in the latter stages of the men's doubles.

All-British pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski, along with Australian Open champion Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara, were beaten in their respective semi-finals.

Bonjour Paris! Most of the leading players will take the week off from competition and head to Roland Garros before the main draw begins on Sunday.

But those who feel they need a bit more match practice have options to play tournaments.

Novak Djokovic has taken a wildcard for the ATP 250 event in Geneva, Alexander Zverev has headed to the ATP 500 in Hamburg, while Jessica Pegula and Raducanu are in the WTA 500 tournament in Strasbourg.

For those not ranked higher enough to earn direct entry into the French Open, the qualifying events begin on Monday.

British players Billy Harris and Dan Evans face each other in the first round, while Jan Choinski, Harriet Dart, Francesca Jones and Heather Watson - also aim to win three matches and make the main draw.

Second Serve will take a break over the French Open before returning on Monday, 9 June.

Paolini and Gauff, two former finalists in Paris, made plenty of noise across Madrid and Rome themselves.ByJoel DruckerPublished May 19, 2025 copy_link

Published May 19, 2025

Following consecutive WTA 1000 clay-court tournaments, the Mutua Madrid Open and Internazionali BNL d'Italia, comes five storylines ahead of Roland Garros. Here's what we're taking away going into Paris:1. Aryna Sabalenka: Keen to Make a StatementExcellent yet frustrating are two words that describe world number one Aryna Sabalenka's 2025 campaign. There have been title runs on three continents—Australia (Brisbane), North America (Miami), Europe (Madrid). But there have also been tough losses in finals—the Australian Open, Indian Wells, Stuttgart. Add it all up, though, and Sabalenka remains the player to beat. Sabalenka's career reveals the power of self-awareness and the attendant capacity for change. The younger Sabalenka made a lot of noise with everything from her strong groundstrokes to highly expressive demeanor. In recent years, the latter has calmed down considerably, Sabalenka constantly revealing increasing maturity.As she said in Rome, “Some of the finals I lost were really heartbreaking and were really tough to kind of like accept. At the same time I understand that sometimes you just have to learn and sometimes you're not that good on court, you just have to accept, learn from that loss, and come back stronger. What I'm actually proud of that I was able to come back in those finals and I was able to change things and see if the lesson was learned, try to bring better tennis in the next final.” With those kinds of comments and her exceptionally forceful arsenal, Sabalenka has much in place for a good run at Roland Garros.

Billie Jean King has many great sayings. “Pressure is a privilege” is the title of a popular book authored by King. “Champions adjust” is also very familiar. Here's one lesser known, but highly relevant King quote worth applying to Coco Gauff: “Persistence is a talent.” To watch Gauff go about her business is to witness that principle applied thoroughly and impressively. It doesn't matter how many instructors and coaches I've spoken to who have their own take on how to fix her forehand. What dare we say about someone who double-faulted 15 times in a gritty semifinal victory?What matters most is that Gauff reached the finals in Madrid and Rome. In Madrid, Gauff's notable victories included Belinda Bencic, Mirray Andreeva, and Iga Swiatek, the latter in commanding fashion, 6-1, 6-1. In her last four matches in Rome, Gauff handily defeated Emma Raducanu, beat Andreeva to take a 4-0 lead in their rivalry, persisted for nearly four hours to squeak past Zheng Qinwen in a third-set tiebreaker, but then, in the finals versus Jasmine Paolini, was unable to effectively assert herself, losing 6-4, 6-2.Speaking after the Rome final, Gauff said, “Definitely proud of the two results, but also disappointed. It's a bittersweet feeling. Jasmine played great tennis today. Unfortunately I felt like I didn't bring my best, which I knew I needed today.” Still, back-to-back finals, along with a runner-up showing at Roland Garros three years ago, should give Gauff plenty of confidence this year in Paris.

A sharp sense of urgency and has been the key to Iga Swiatek winning five Grand Slam singles titles. But over the last 11 months, those very qualities appear to have rebelled. Over the course of this year's clay court season, Swiatek has been beaten badly by Jelena Ostapenko, Gauff and Danielle Collins. All are great players, but to see Swiatek competing in such a distraught way is jarring. Most notable is her lack of comfort in the transition area of the court, a weakness that compels her to overhit groundstrokes. Nor have I ever been a fan of her truncated and stiff service motion—a motion I believe under pressure makes the serve's direction both obvious and hittable. And so the downward cascade continues. One hopes Swiatek can give a much better account of herself in her quest to win a fourth straight Roland Garros title.Four radical suggestions: Purge the entire coaching team. Hire a trusted friend to handle logistical matters related to equipment and practice. Return to the starting court that every player has and rediscover that ten-year-old who simply loved hitting tennis balls. Play doubles again with the eternally optimistic Bethanie Mattek-Sands (they reached the Roland Garros final in ‘21). And though Swiatek now appears likely to be seeded fifth in Paris, triggering all sorts of dialogue about theoretically treacherous matchups, I'll pose the question I always ask when seeding is discussed: Do you think such champions as Rod Laver, Pete Sampras, Chrissie Evert, or Martina Navratilova ever gave a rip what they were seeded?

A year ago, following 17 appearances at the majors, Jasmine Paolini had only once reached the round of 16. Then came an incredible June and July, Paolini going all the way to the finals at both Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Holding on to a spot in the Top 10 is not easy for a newcomer. Following that Wimbledon effort, Paolini went ten months without reaching a final. Then came Rome, where she played excellent tennis to get past six formidable opponents: Lulu Sun, Ons Jabeur, Jelena Ostapenko, Diana Shnaider (rallying from a set and 4-0 down), Peyton Stearns and Gauff in the final to earn the joint-biggest title of her career. When playing her best tennis, Paolini reminds me of an upbeat Simona Halep. “Yeah, it's pure joy,” she said following the final. “It's a dream to win in Rome, of course, I don't know for every maybe kid that's playing in Italy. It's amazing. I'm really happy about it.” Once Roland Garros gets underway, it will be intriguing—better yet, fun—to see how this happy warrior builds off her Rome run.

It's been pleasing to see past US Open champions Emma Raducanu ('21), Bianca Andreescu ('19) and Naomi Osaka ('18 and '20) take a few steps forward this spring. Raducanu was ranked outside the Top 60 as '25 began. In Rome, she won three matches and has now made her way into the Top 50. Will her growth as a competitor and healthy athlete continue? After adding Tennis Channel commentator Mark Petchey to her team, will the Raducanu coaching carousel at least slow down?Andreescu played great tennis in Rome, earning wins over Donna Vekic and Elena Rybakina. Long plagued with injuries, Andreescu has altered her training regimen and should, at least theoretically, be in a place to play her brand of exceptionally versatile tennis.And Osaka, in her quest to improve her clay court skills, took a page from the Andre Agassi playbook by entering a lower-tiered event in Saint-Molo. Winning that title, Osaka subsequently won three matches in Rome—and also while in Rome shared new insights about what it would take for her to succeed on clay. “For me, I feel like I didn't know this before,” she said, “and I think I talked about it a little bit last year, but I feel like clay is very strength-reliant. I realized that going into the corners, just like pushing off, you need a lot of muscles to do that. I never realized that before. It's something that I prioritized this year and I think it's working.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Three WTA players who are also really struggling on clay other than Iga Swiatek ahead of the French Open","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/opinion/three-wta-players-who-are-also-really-struggling-on-clay-other-than-iga-swiatek-ahead-of-the-french-open/","Mon, 19 May 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Roland Garros is fast approaching, with the second major of the season set to begin on the 25th of May. 

On the women's tour, two more tournaments are up for grabs before the French Open begins, with a WTA 500 in Strasbourg and a 250 in Rabat presenting one final opportunity for players to sharpen their clay-court games. 

With the conclusion of the Italian Open, where world number four Jasmine Paolini emerged victorious, it's still unclear who the favourite is going into Roland Garros. 

Four-time champion Iga Swiatek will be the popular pick amongst fans, but the Pole has struggled during the clay swing so far, having crashed out in the third round in Rome.

Swiatek isn't the only one finding consistency hard to come by on the dirt, however, with three other big names on the WTA Tour looking to find a clay resurgence in Paris.

Despite winning her opening tournament of the clay season, world number three Jessica Pegula hasn't been able to get it going in April and May.

Since clinching the Charleston Open title, Pegula has suffered three consecutive early exits at clay-court tournaments.

The American lost in the quarter-final of the Stuttgart Open to Ekaterina Alexandrova, getting bagelled in the first set, with the final score finishing 6-0, 6-4.

Pegula then went out in the third round of two consecutive WTA 1000 events, with defeats at the Madrid Open and Italian Open.

Having not appeared at Roland Garros since 2023, she will be looking to improve on her best campaign in the French capital; a quarter-final finish in 2022.

Pegula's compatriot, Madison Keys, has also had tough times on clay as of late.

The Australian Open champion has failed to build on her triumph in Melbourne, where she clinched a maiden Grand Slam title. 

Keys made the semi-final at Indian Wells, but fell to Alexandra Eala in the third round of the Miami Open. 

She began her clay season, like Pegula, at the Charleston Open, where in the Round of 16 Keys lost to Anna Kalinskaya 6-2, 6-4.

Following a promising start to the Madrid Open, she ultimately fell to Swiatek in the quarter-final over three sets.

Keys' campaign in the Eternal City was cut short in round three, where she suffered a defeat at the hands of fellow American Peyton Stearns.

The world number seven has failed to make it past the third round of Roland Garros since 2019, when she reached the quarter-final.

Since her back-to-back tournament victories in Dubai and Indian Wells, Mirra Andreeva has taken a slight dip in form. 

Her clay season kicked off in Stuttgart, where, after her sister, Erika Andreeva, retired due to injury in their first-round clash, the world number six lost in the second round to unseeded Ekaterina Alexandrova. 

She made the quarter-final at both the Madrid Open and the Italian Open, but fell both times to Coco Gauff, unable to find an answer for the former US Open champion. 

Still just 18 years old, Andreeva remains a future star on the WTA Tour, and will enter her third French Open, having already made a semi-final in Paris last year. 

The Russian took the tennis world by storm at the second major of 2024, where she enjoyed an impressive run to the semi-final, overcoming world number one Aryna Sabalenka en route. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu has a strong chance of being seeded for Wimbledon in what would be a huge boost to her hopes at SW19. The British star has enjoyed a soaring rise up the rankings in recent months.

Raducanu has made an excellent comeback from two years of hell with injuries and form issues. Her performances at the upcoming Strasbourg International and then the French Open could put her in a good place ahead of Wimbledon, which takes place across June and July. Reaching the fourth round at the Italian Open last week is set to see Raducanu rank as the world No. 42 when the updated WTA leaderboard is released.

The 22-year-old is now only 276 ranking points away from world No. 32 Peyton Stearns. Ranking inside the top 32 would land Raducanu a seeded spot at Wimbledon, protecting her from the more challenging opponents in the early rounds of the tournament.

Strasbourg offers 500 points to the winner, while a positive run at the French Open will also be an excellent opportunity to build points ahead of the grass-court season. She will also have British rival Katie Boulter in her sights, with the 28-year-old now only four places ahead. Boulter won a WTA 125 event in Paris yesterday.

Asked if she felt the pressure of being the British No. 1, Boulter responded: “I don't feel any pressure at all. I'm very comfortable in my seat, and I know that every single person has a different journey.

“My journey is not going to be compared to anyone else's. I'm proud of that. I've been the British No.1 for two years, it's been a fair while now. It's something which I'm quite used to.”

After being beaten by Coco Gauff at the Italian Open, Raducanu was set the target of ranking 32nd in the world by former British No. 1 Tim Henman.

He told Sky Sports: “Her game is moving in the right direction. I think she's around 42 in the live rankings. A number in the back of my mind is 32 pre-Wimbledon. Can she get to be seeded and have that protection in the early rounds on grass?""

Raducanu was ranked as high as No. 10 in the world in the aftermath of her US Open triumph in 2021. Injuries and inconsistency prompted her to tumble. She is now restoring her best form ahead of a busy summer.

Welcome back to the Monday Tennis Briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories from the past week on court.

This week, fan behavior was a key topic at the Italian Open, preparations for the French Open escalated — in esports — and American college tennis changed things up regarding the U.S. Open.

If you'd like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here.

While Carlos Alcaraz danced through the second set of the Italian Open final against Jannik Sinner, he did so in near total quiet. As it had done throughout the tournament, the crowd at the Foro Italico in Rome made its feelings known — this time with silence, rather than rancor.

During her quarterfinal defeat against Zheng Qinwen, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka told a fan to “shut the f— up” after they yelled out at her. In the previous round, world No. 22 Clara Tauson confronted a crowd member who heckled her after she served a double fault against Mirra Andreeva, asking, “Who are you?” before imploring the chair umpire to intervene.

Jakub Menšík, the world No. 19, engaged in a similar confrontation during his match against Fábián Marozsán, while in her last-eight meeting with home favorite Jasmine Paolini, world No. 10 Diana Shnaider riled the baying Italian faithful after they cheered her getting broken.

Not all tennis atmospheres are created equal, and partisan support can quickly devolve into unwarranted abuse, especially when the spectators delivering it are not in support of a particular player but of whatever outcome makes them money on sports betting. For Shnaider and Alcaraz, one met with roars and one with not even a smattering of applause, they can put things down to playing a home hope. While it's possible that Andreeva and Marozsán both have a secret coterie of Roman ultras, it's the kind of needling that Menšík and Tauson experienced that presents the sport with a problem.

Elite players have documented how abuse during matches bleeds onto social media. Nearly every player will have a story of logging onto Instagram or X to floods of abusive messages after a defeat, not from their fans nor their opponent's followers but from people who simply decided that they might win them a bet and ended up not getting a pay-off.

Fans not being ejected — or at least disciplined — when they engage in abuse on a match court only encourages them to continue, but umpires and security staff are rarely able to distinguish between partisan support, which the sport should embrace over silence, and the kind of directed heckling that needs discouraging.

Tauson at least got a measure of revenge. Straight after that double fault, she smashed an ace down the T and gestured mockingly to the same fan behind her for some noise.

The French Open's main draw begins Sunday, May 25, but for esports devotees, the action begins in earnest a day before, when the annual Roland Garros eSeries takes place at the same venue, in the Musée du Tennis' auditorium.

Eight players, whittled down from more than 500,000 original applicants, will battle it out on a bespoke French Open version of the mobile game Tennis Clash for a €5,000 (£4,210; $5,636) prize pot, which is shared between the winner and the runner-up.

The mere mention of esports is enough to make many tennis purists recoil in disgust, but it's something that all four of the sport's Grand Slams have adopted. This is the eighth edition of the Roland Garros event, while Wimbledon held its first esports competition in 2024. The Australian Open has a whole gaming division, while the U.S. Open last year introduced an interactive gaming zone at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center.

This year's French Open event will see the eight players competing as individuals, but split into two teams. One will be captained by former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli, the other by former world No. 6 and home favorite Gilles Simon.

A keen gamer, Simon actually competed in the event himself last year, and picked up a couple of victories. He always travelled with his PlayStation during his career, including for France's Davis Cup ties, and it was a mutual interest he shared with former U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who he coached until February and with whom he still games online.

Simon, 40, is well aware of the scepticism towards esports from many tennis fans, but believes that events such as the Roland Garros eSeries can serve a valuable purpose.

“If some of the guys that are playing Tennis Clash play good and are then coming to the stadium, or they want to finally pick up a racket and start to play, then it's a win,” he said in a recent video interview. He added that the Grand Slams should be looking to attract as diverse a crowd as possible, and that esports gives the tournaments an even more compelling package of events.

The lack of a good tennis video game has long been lamented as a missed opportunity for the sport in providing a gateway for young people.

In 2024, there were 200 spectators on site for the esports event, but there were over 200,000 more who watched via live-streaming platform Twitch. Tennis has also lagged behind other sports in using such outlets to broaden its fandom: elite soccer players and Formula One drivers are some of the most-viewed celebrities on Twitch, some of them becoming megastars in online gaming before breaking through in their respective sports.

For tennis, having access to these communities is key to its growth.

A good while before college sports in the United States officially changed its rules to allow student-athletes to earn gobs of cash, university-level tennis there had its own version of prize money.

Traditionally, American winners of the NCAA title received a wild-card entry into the main draw of the U.S. Open. If those champions had turned professional after winning the collegiate championship, which many of them do, they got to keep the first-round payment, which last year reached $100,000.

This year, everything has changed.

The NCAA decided that it was too much for players to participate in both its team and individual championships consecutively. It moved the individual championships to November. But that put nine months of separation between the NCAA tournament and the following year's U.S. Open. The United States Tennis Association (USTA), which organizes the latter, decided that was too long. Also, who doesn't like a little more competition?

Instead of going directly to the U.S. Open, Michael Zheng of Columbia University in New York City and DJ Bennett of Auburn University, Al., won automatic qualification into a four-person playoff. Zheng won the men's individual championship; Bennett qualifies as a losing finalist.

It will be held between June 16 and 18, with a committee selecting the three other participants on both the men's and women's side.

The winners get into the U.S. Open main draw. The runners-up get a wild card into qualifying. There will be men's and women's doubles playoffs as well.

“Michael Zheng and I knew at the beginning of the NCAA Individual Championships in November that — given that the event was in the fall — the wild card would be determined by a playoff,” said Howard Endelman, head coach at Columbia.

Congratulations, you're the NCAA champ! Now just win two more matches and you get into the U.S. Open.

In this week's team championships, held at the Hurd Tennis Center in Waco, Tex., Wake Forest University took the men's title, while the University of Georgia took the women's. Wake Forest defeated Texas Christian University, while Georgia beat Texas A&M.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","USTA's Master Plan: Inside the $800M renovation of Billie Jean King National Tennis Center","https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/05/19/ustas-master-plan/","Mon, 19 May 2025 10:05:49 GMT","

Shortly after the conclusion of the 2024 U.S. Open, the USTA began what it projects will be $800 million of self-funded renovations to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The phased project, to be completed by the 2027 U.S. Open, represents the largest single investment the organization has made into the home of its revenue-rich Grand Slam.

“When I came into this role [in 2022], one of the first things I asked the team that leads the U.S. Open is: ‘What are the next significant opportunities for growth?'” said USTA CEO and Executive Director Lew Sherr, who was chief revenue officer from 2010-22. “Venue upgrades, from a fan experience standpoint, was one of the things that came out of that.”

More than two years of plotting those upgrades followed. Now, for the first time, senior leaders from the USTA and Rossetti — the architect of this project, the last significant round of upgrades between 2014-18 and Arthur Ashe Stadium's original build in the 1990s — laid out the full scope of their plans exclusively to Sports Business Journal. Through an extensive renovation of Ashe and the construction of a multistory player performance center next door, the fan experience and athlete accommodations will be transformed at the Flushing, N.Y., site.

About 70% of the funds — or $550 million — allocated to the project will be spent rebuilding the interior of Ashe, according to USTA Chief Operating Officer Daniel Zausner. The last round of renovations equipped the stadium with a retractable roof, but did little to modernize the fan experience, which the USTA acknowledges is presently ill-equipped to handle the crush of general tournament-goers and demand for premium hospitality. Last year, the event broke one million visitors across Fan Week and main draw play for the first time.

“When Ashe was built, the thought process was, ‘Fans would watch tennis in Ashe, and then they would go out to the grounds to eat and shop and all of that,'” Sherr said. “The reality is, for many of our fans, there's an expectation that the Ashe experience will be similar to any other arena.”

The USTA will increase the stadium's concourse square footage by 40% on the promenade level and eliminate its food-cart program to reduce concourse congestion. Ashe's mezzanine-level suites, meanwhile, will be rebuilt, and a second row of suites will be added above that. This will reduce the loge level's footprint by 3,500 seats (another measure executives say will lessen congestion) while adding suite and courtside inventory. The USTA will also add a few hundred upper promenade seats that were previously not sold.

Timeline: 2024-2027

Cost: 
 $800 million

Architects: Rossetti, Daniel Libeskind (entrance redesign), Garrett Singer (new club/restaurant spaces)

Construction: AECOM Tishman

Structural engineer: WSP Group

Construction: AECOM Tishman

Mechanical engineer: ME Engineers

The concourse space will enable the USTA to add 17 points of sale, two retail locations and 55 bathroom stalls at the promenade level, as well as a new deck and bar overlooking the south plaza, which will be open to the public. (Twelve points of sale, one retail location and 15 bathroom stalls will be added at the club level.) 

The USTA will add three elevators (two at the south entry, one at the east) and two escalators (specific to promenade entry at the south gate) to aid with ingress and egress.

Thanks in large part to its New York market, the U.S. Open hosts some of American sports' most premium clientele and corporate sponsors. The renovation will add between 700-800 suite seats and about 2,000 “courtside” seats at Ashe, plus rebuild the entire inventory of each (about 2,600 suite seats and 5,000 courtside seats).

“We've had an excess amount of demand for the courtside area for the last decade that we can't satisfy,” said USTA Chief Commercial Officer Kirsten Corio, adding that the organization's revenue attributed to experiential hospitality has jumped by triple-digit percentage points over the past two years. “Combined with the No. 1 complaint of our loge and promenade subscribers being that they never have an opportunity to move down to the courtside, this [renovation] will open up more opportunity for both that demand and for the subscriber who is interested in upgrading to the lower bowl.”

In all, the seating capacity of Ashe will remain about the same after the renovations (about 24,000), but the mix will change. Pricing for the new inventory is being determined.

Moving the player facilities from the underbelly of Ashe to their own building on the west side of the campus will free up space for eight club areas inside the stadium, representing an inventory increase and strides in convenience, as all club amenities will reside under one roof. Presently, some offerings include courtside seats at Ashe and luxury dining space at the campus' indoor tennis facility in the east plaza.

“Adjacency is critical,” said Rossetti President and CEO Matt Rossetti, the lead architect on this round of renovations and work done to the grounds between 2010 and 2018. “One of the ideas that [Zausner] came up with was, ‘Hey, we could use this idea of taking care of the players and premium at the same time. Pulling player facilities out of the [Ashe] base opens all this additional space that we need and we could use for premium.'”

The USTA held focus groups with subscribers, hospitality clients and sponsors, beginning in 2020, to inform the strategy behind upgrading premium experiences. Elevate, a USTA partner since 2020, aided in the research and will be doubling the size of its sales team dedicated to the U.S. Open to accommodate the additional inventory. The USTA also last week announced the hire of Laura Lefton, former NFL vice president of club business development, as managing director of ticket sales and premium experience, a new role that reports to Corio and reflects the organization's enhanced focus on premium.

“What we heard [was] a lot more corporate hospitality demand, a lot more experiential demand — meaning, they want to get closer to the players, they want opportunities for meet-and-greets, to host corporate events,” Corio said. “These new spaces are purpose-built to meet those needs and to surprise and delight in a way that we just can't today.”

Aesthetic changes to Ashe will be noticeable from the outside as well, primarily on the south facade. There, the USTA plans to erect a curved gateway encasing the new deck bar, which is designed to complement the Unisphere sculpture just outside the campus' south entrance.

The remaining $250 million dedicated to the project will be directed toward the construction of a multistory player performance center to the west of Ashe and north of the campus' outdoor practice courts. The bottom two floors of the building will expand the parking garage currently on the plot from 200 to 350 spots, while the top two stories will encompass 150,000 square feet of player amenities. The space will be a far cry from the current setup in the basement of Ashe, which Sherr said players have called cramped.

“The three dimensions that always come up in the athletes' feedback for us [are] larger fitness [areas], indoor/outdoor training opportunities and player-only areas,” said Stacey Allaster, USTA chief executive of professional tennis and U.S. Open tournament director, citing the organization's annual player survey. “That has been the compass for the design.”

In this vein, the third floor will be reserved for players and include a private café, locker rooms, indoor/outdoor fitness areas (the latter with turf and court surfaces and a running track) and a sensory room for relaxation. 

The fourth floor is slightly more public-facing — as it will also accommodate credentialed visitors — and include a dining hall, lounge spaces, outdoor terrace, coach locker rooms and media areas, such as the U.S. Open interview room and a broadcast studio. 

Among athletes, their support staffs and families, the USTA accommodates around 2,800 people in its player facilities each U.S. Open.

This project is expected to be staggered in such a way that the two-level parking structure will be finished by the 2025 U.S. Open; new courtside seats and hospitality areas in Ashe will open in 2026 (although the suites and club spaces will be unfinished); and the full renovation will be completed by 2027.

By that time, Sherr said, the USTA will have invested about $2 billion in the tennis center since 2014, between the $800 million committed to these renovations, $700 million poured into the last major round and improvements in between. The previous project also was entirely self-funded.

“There's a lot of positive momentum behind the mission side of the organization and the U.S. Open,” he said. “So, we're in a position to capitalize on that.”

Indeed, in 2024, operating revenue associated with the U.S. Open reached nearly $560 million, about a threefold jump from the 2020 edition held without fans, and comprising about 90% of the USTA‘s $624 million in overall revenue. Sherr said the USTA‘s spending on the “mission” side of the organization — i.e., court renovations, section support, etc. — is up 20% as well. 

“We are not tapping out or maxing out on our ability to fund the growth of this event,” Sherr said of the U.S. Open. “We feel we're in a good place.”","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","tennis"

It was a good day at the office for Canada's Bianca Andreescu. 

The 24-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., cruised past Xinxin Yao 6-0, 6-0 during the opening round of French Open qualifying Monday. 

Andreescu needed just 57 minutes to complete the first double-bagel victory of her pro career. She accomplished the feat once previously during the Junior Billie Jean King Cup in 2016, according to wtatennis.com.

The 2019 US Open champion fired only one ace but won 68 per cent of her return points to convert on six of 10 break point attempts. 

Fellow Canadians Marina Stakusic and Carson Branstine also advanced to the second round of qualifying. 

Stakusic scored a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Lauren Davis while Branstine defeated Whitney Osuigwe 6-4, 6-2. 

Andreescu will face Nao Hibino, Stakusic takes on Tamara Korpatsch and Branstine faces Rebeka Masarova in the second round Wednesday.

In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko discusses the rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

There are a number of factors which turn an exciting rivalry into an epic, enduring duel that transcends the sport.

The core talent. The blend of personalities. The gripping encounters on the biggest stages.

The tussle between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz - ranked one and two in the men's game - has all those components.

It also has arguably the most important ingredient: each player being pushed to a greater height by the other.

Their rivalry resumed in the final of the Italian Open, marking a fitting end to the men's singles at a tournament where Sinner returned from a three-month ban for failing two doping tests.

Spain's Alcaraz, benefitting from more matches in the tank, ruined the perfect homecoming for Italy's Sinner to record his seventh victory in their 11 meetings.

Sinner has been the ATP's dominant player for the past 18 months, winning 85 of his 92 matches and claiming nine titles.

But Alcaraz is the one dominating their head-to-head record.

Alcaraz understands he has to go to a different place to get the better of Sinner, who was on a 26-match winning streak going into the Rome final.

Alcaraz, a gifted and sometimes flashy shot-maker, can sometimes lose focus or discipline on court.

But there was none of that in a disciplined performance against Sinner.

""If I don't play at my best it's going to be impossible to beat him,"" Alcaraz said afterwards.

""That's why I'm more focused when I'm playing against him, or I feel a little bit different when I'm going to face him.""

It was a final many in the sport wanted, one everybody was excited about.

And it was another tantalising reminder of how the Alcaraz and Sinner rivalry - which the ATP Tour has long pinned its hopes on filling the Federer-Nadal-Djokovic void - could be a blockbuster for years to come.

""I'm not going to say I'm feeling like when Rafa and Roger are playing,"" Alcaraz added.

""But I'm feeling like it is a different energy when we are facing each other than other players.""

Roll on Roland Garros. The smart money would go on the top two seeds meeting again in the French Open men's final.

While it was never going to be a long-term arrangement, the timing of Andy Murray's stint coaching Novak Djokovic coming to an end before the French Open - and Wimbledon - surprised many.

Italian fans have waited 40 years to celebrate a home women's singles victory in Rome. A jubilant Jasmine Paolini ended that run on Saturday.

At the start of the clay-court swing we discussed how Iga Swiatek had a mountain of ranking points to defend - and it could not have gone much worse for the four-time French Open champion.

Swiatek has slipped to fifth in the WTA rankings and will be seeded outside of the top four at Roland Garros.

The means she could face any of the top four seeds - Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula or Jasmine Paolini - as early as the quarter-finals.

In the ATP rankings, Alcaraz made the most significant move, while Italy's Lorenzo Musetti - who lost to the Spaniard in the semi-finals - climbed another place into a new career-high of eighth.

Czech powerhouse Jakub Mensik - the highest ranked teenager in the top 100 - has cracked the top 20 for the first time after reaching the Rome last 16.

Just call her 'Clay-tie'.

Katie Boulter gave herself a new nickname after claiming a WTA 125 title on clay.

Clay is a surface where the 28-year-old still has very limited experience and has struggled to adapt her aggressive baseline game at the top level.

Winning the Paris tournament on the tier below the main WTA Tour will boost Boulter's confidence before the French Open, where she is still to win a main-draw match.

Victory means Boulter has moved up to 38th in the rankings, putting a little more light between the British number one and her nearest rivals Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal.

Raducanu has climbed to 43rd after her run to the Rome last 16, where Gauff showed the gulf that remains between the Briton and the world's leading players.

On the men's side, Jack Draper demonstrated again how he is becoming a force on clay by reaching the quarter-finals in the Italian capital.

There was also strong British involvement in the latter stages of the men's doubles.

All-British pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski, along with Australian Open champion Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara, were beaten in their respective semi-finals.

Bonjour Paris! Most of the leading players will take the week off from competition and head to Roland Garros before the main draw begins on Sunday.

But those who feel they need a bit more match practice have options to play tournaments.

Novak Djokovic has taken a wildcard for the ATP 250 event in Geneva, Alexander Zverev has headed to the ATP 500 in Hamburg, while Jessica Pegula and Raducanu are in the WTA 500 tournament in Strasbourg.

Second Serve will take a break over the French Open before returning on Monday, 9 June.

#NextGenATP Croatian Dino Prizmic has climbed 11 spots in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah following his title run at the ATP Challenger Tour event on home soil in Zagreb.

The 19-year-old, who won a set against Novak Djokovic at last year's Australian Open, is up to eighth in the Live Race To Jeddah, boosting his early hopes of qualifying for this year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF.

Prizmic overcame former Jeddah finalist Luca Van Assche in the title match to clinch his second Challenger Tour title on clay and first since 2023. Prizmic will next play at the Challenger Tour event in Skopje.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Sabalenka owned Madrid, and there's no reason to doubt what comes next","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4258560/sabalenka-owned-madrid-and-theres-no-reason-to-doubt-what-comes-next","Mon, 19 May 2025 05:28:22 GMT","

When it was over and the ecstatic crowd at La Caja Magic jumped to its collective feet in applause, Aryna Sabalenka did not fall to the crushed red clay beneath her, didn't scream or pump her fists or even openly exult. She merely raised her arms in a perfect V -- for victory.

And then, blowing kisses to the camera, strolled to her changeover chair, fished a camera out of her bag, crossed the court and snapped a picture of her team. After that thoroughly professional 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory over Coco Gauff on Saturday, Sabalenka is now a three-time Mutua Madrid Open champion. That equals the record total of Petra Kvitova and, not insignificantly, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as well.

Winning is never guaranteed, but in Sabalenka's mind, this was expected. Her will manifested itself in the moments that mattered. Sabalenka's earned that confidence because -- by an uncommonly wide margin -- she is the best player in the sport.

On Monday, the World No. 1 will become only the third woman to amass more than 11,000 ranking points and is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the PIF WTA Rankings. That gap is likely to grow. With Swiatek defending titles in Rome and Paris, she'll also be defending 3,000 points across the next month. And because Sabalenka missed Wimbledon last year, this year's result will be a ranking points windfall.

Sabalenka is more than 1,600 points clear of No. 2 Madison Keys in the PIF Race to the WTA Finals in Riyadh. She's the only player with three titles so far -- Brisbane, Miami and Madrid -- and has collected back-to-back WTA 1000 titles on vastly different surfaces. Her 31 match-wins are also the most among Hologic WTA Tour players.

This was Gauff's 10th match against Sabalenka in six years. How has her game evolved?

“I feel like she just got a lot better in everything,” Gauff said. “I think she just probably is more confident, so that's why the consistent results are happening.”

Examine the timeline and you'll find that the catalyst for all of this, oddly enough, was a loss.

Back in January, Sabalenka was going for her third consecutive Australian Open but Keys was simply too good in the final. For Sabalenka, who started the year 11-0, it was a devastating loss. She left the Middle East in something of a funk, having lost an unheard of three of four matches.

But then, she rallied and reached four straight finals -- Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart and Madrid -- winning two of them. Sabalenka's won 19 of her past 21 and even with the slow surfaces in Rome and Paris looming, she's going to like her chances.

A few hours after the win in Madrid, Sabalenka fielded some questions from wtatennis.com:

Looking back, how did losing that Australian Open final motivate you to produce the best start of your career heading into Rome?

Sabalenka: Yeah, honestly, that final was the toughest one. I really struggled to accept that match, tough loss. And I think, February I was kind of trying to figure my way. Then I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder. Kind of explains to me that you have to really work hard in finals and you have to earn your victories. It was a good push for me.

Your last two matches, four of six sets went to seven games -- you won them all … how proud are you of the fact you competed so well in the most important moments?

Sabalenka: I'm super happy that I was able to bring the level in those key moments. Super happy with the level I played this week and hopefully I can keep going the way everything is going. 

Your defense doesn't get a lot of attention, but … against Coco how important was it to stay in some of those long points?

Sabalenka: It's very important to not only be an attacking player, but in those key moments to be a good defender and dig really deep in there, try to steal a few points. It definitely brings more confidence in your game.

Only four women in 40 years won their first six matches against Top 10 players in straight sets – their names are Martina Navratilova (1986), Steffi Graf (1994, 1995 and 1996), Serena Williams (2014) -- and Aryna Sabalenka … what do you think of that?

Sabalenka: I … don't know. I mean, they are legends. They achieved so much, these players I look up to. Me, being in the same line with them … it just sounds crazy and I couldn't be more proud.

Of all the ups and downs you've experienced, how good do you feel about your game right now?

Sabalenka: I definitely feel really good about my game. But I think the key for me was that I was always looking for something to improve. And now, still, I want to get better.

Three Madrid titles … the way you're playing, in your mind, can you win in Rome or Paris for the first time?

Sabalenka: [Laughing]. I mean, in my mind, in my dreams, yes I can. But sometimes the reality is different. I will definitely go out there and compete and fight and see if my dream will be the same in real life.

5 Winners and 5 Losers from Emilia-Romagna – Who impressed at Imola? 

Fernando Alonso was left to rue ‘pure bad luck' in Imola after tumbling down the order from his fifth-placed start to finish the race in 11th, despite his Aston Martin upgrades making the car look competitive for the first time this season.

Those upgrades combined with the tactical astuteness to save an extra set of medium tyres for Qualifying saw both Aston Martins make Q3 for the first time this season. Alonso started fifth, and ran there in the early stages of the race.

With Lance Stroll a few places behind, the team looked on for a double score – but after pitting early, their race unravelled when many got a cheap pit stop under the subsequent Virtual Safety Car.

Worse was to come, the late Safety Car gifting the opportunity for half the field to fit fresh tyres again, at a point when Aston martin had no realistic compounds left to use. That left the Spaniard to make a balanced judgement of how his day unfolded.

Alonso was able to fight near the front of the field at Imola 

“It was just unlucky,"" Alonso said. ""The car was super today, we followed the McLaren and [George] Russell at the beginning of the race, which was definitely a good surprise for us to be that competitive at the front of the field.

“And then I think we were okay to secure P6, P7 with both the cars and then the Virtual Safety Car gave the opportunity to everyone to stop and exit in front of us and our race was over. So extremely unlucky, the car was competitive, I had a good fight.

“Even at the end I overtook three or four cars in nine laps. It's something we are not used to this year, so definitely a step forward.”

Alonso on P11 finish: ‘The final result is just extreme bad luck'

The pace at the end of the race was especially impressive, given at that time Alonso was on old medium tyres. He rose to 11th, agonisingly close to a points finish that has eluded him so far this season.

The good news is that the Aston Martin upgrade package seems to have worked, making the team look more competitive than at any point this season, even with Alonso's team mate Stroll finishing back in 15th. He was unable to clear the traffic he dropped into after his first pit stop, but wants more data before making his own mind up about how potent the upgrade package was.

“We'll see next week at a different kind of track, so we'll see if we can continue the form,” he concluded.

Aston Martin remain in seventh in the Teams' Standings, four points ahead of Racing Bulls.

5 Winners and 5 Losers from Emilia-Romagna – Who impressed at Imola? 

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella admitted he and the team were ""surprised"" by the pace exhibited from Max Verstappen and Red Bull as the four-time World Champion claimed victory at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.

With Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri left to settle for second and third respectively, Verstappen's success was founded on a bold overtaking move through the Tamburello chicane to steal the lead from polesitter Piastri on the first lap.

However, after dominating the field last time out in Miami, many expected the papaya cars to reign Verstappen back in – either on track, or during the pit stops – but the McLaren duo were unable to catch the Dutchman at any stage during the race.

“I have to say today we were a little surprised, I think I have to be honest here, by the pace of Red Bull, which was very competitive,” Stella said after Sunday's Grand Prix.

“Well done to Max, well done to Red Bull, for being able to pull off this kind of performance, which meant that the race was very much decided by the episode, or just a swap of position between Oscar and Max in corner one. After that we tried to chase him but effectively we didn't have enough race pace today to be able to beat Max taking the lead after lap one.”

Late on in the race it looked like Norris could have had a late chance to challenge Verstappen for the win, with the Safety Car – deployed following Kimi Antonelli's retirement – peeling in late on to give the drivers one last race to the line. At the time Piastri was ahead of his team mate on old tyres, while Verstappen and Norris had pitted for fresh rubber.

FACTS AND STATS: Verstappen's Imola record and Hamilton's best Ferrari result to date

However, McLaren opted not to enact team orders, instead letting Norris fight past Piastri on merit – but by then Verstappen was six seconds up the road, a gap Norris could not even begin to reel in.

“We attempted to unlock various scenarios to try and beat Max, but at no stage I think we saw that we had enough race pace,"" Stella added. ""Even when, with the final Safety Car, Lando could pass Oscar and try to push as much as possible, pretty much Max was responding to Lando.

“So here to overtake you need seven, eight tenths of a second, so I think it's what it is. The main factor remains the swap of position and the outcome of Lap 1.""

As for Piastri's strategy, which appeared to be a two-stop until the race was upended by a VSC and then Safety Car, Stella explained that the Australian's earlier than optimal pit stop was as a result of the tyres initially not lasting as long as expected.

“At the time Oscar's tyres were going off by a good chunk and Oscar was passing some feedback that that was the case,"" Stella clarified. ""It was unclear entering this event whether it would have been a one or a two. If it was a two, that was the time to go.

“And if the hard tyres had behaved just a little bit better, then the two would have been a very strong strategy, despite having to overtake some other cars. But once he went on hard tyres, actually it wasn't much faster than Lando and Max that stayed out on the used medium.

READ MORE: Piastri concedes he 'braked too early' in battle with Verstappen at Imola race start

“So, I think the hard tyres were a little less competitive than we thought, but we needed to deviate and create the condition to beat Max today. I think this is something that you can only judge in hindsight, but if you deviate, that was the time to go for a two-stop.

“So, no regrets and ultimately for the team it's the same outcome and for Oscar it could have been the way to win and sometimes, when you take some risks to win, there may be a little bit of a downside.”

Piastri remains in the lead of the Drivers' Championship, although his team mate has reduced that advantage from 16 to 13 points, with Verstappen a further nine adrift.

Franco Colapinto admitted he was ""not quite there yet"" after a challenging first weekend back in F1 with Alpine, as the Argentinian finished 16th in the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix following a hefty Qualifying crash.

While Alpine failed to score for a third straight race – with Pierre Gasly only able to finish 13th despite a 10th-placed starting spot – there were some positives to take, namely Colapinto gaining vital experience and the one-lap potential of the car.

READ MORE: Verstappen talks through bold Piastri pass that ‘unleashed' Red Bull's pace in statement Imola victory drive

Colapinto's Grand Prix build up was far from ideal after his heavy crash in Qualifying brought out the red flags on Saturday. Then, on Sunday, his inexperience showed at the start of the race as a tentative first few corners saw him lose places from his P16 start, a trip through the gravel not helping matters a few laps later.

The 21-year-old ran a long first stint, but Lady Luck was not on his side either as he pitted just before the Virtual Safety Car period triggered by Esteban Ocon's retirement.

Colapinto on his first race with Alpine: ‘Not the result we wanted by a lot of learnings'

“We had good pace at the start of the race compared to the others,” Colapinto explained following the Grand Prix. “I made the C5 – the medium – last very long, so we were on a one-stop and that VSC came just a few laps after I made my stop.

“It kind of just put me in a very difficult situation with already eight laps on the tyres and struggling a bit to keep up with the pace of the guys boxing for new tyres under the VSC. It was okay, it was more experience and good to learn a bit more the car.

“I think better tracks are coming for us, especially Monaco. It is a place which requires very high confidence. I'm not quite there yet, I'm still learning more and more each time I am in the car so I'll build it up and I'm looking forward to it next weekend.”

Colapinto did not race at Monaco in F1 last season, his stint for Williams coming in the second half of the season, so it will be another new experience for the youngster next weekend as he continues to bed in at Alpine.

However, he can take further confidence from Gasly's one-lap pace and the potential in the car with Qualifying of extra importance in Monte Carlo.

‘I battled hard… too hard' – Gasly talks us through his fight with Leclerc at Imola

Gasly's Qualifying in Imola certainly stood out, with a top-10 start, and he should have been in the mix for points in the race. But a rash moment battling Charles Leclerc at the start saw the Frenchman skate off through the gravel, dropping down the order as a result.

“First of all not happy with my race as I made that mistake which should not really happen,” Gasly said as he reflected on his Imola outing.

""I battled hard, I tried too hard and I thought I would be able to stick around the outside leaving some room for Charles on the inside but unfortunately when I turned in, I had no grip and couldn't make the corner.

READ MORE: Piastri concedes he 'braked too early' in battle with Verstappen at Imola race start

“That for sure made us drop four positions I think initially. Then we revert or, let me say, we decided to go on a two-stop. It was looking decent, I think we would have been fighting the one-stopper at the end of the race. The late Safety Car gave them a free pit stop, so luck wasn't really on our side.”

Gasly did state that the car had “good pace” over one lap, as he already turned his sights to Monaco next weekend, with the races coming thick and fast in the second triple-header of the season.

“Next week we know it is all about the quali, mainly about the quali and that's where we can hopefully capitalise on the strong quali this weekend,” he concluded.

Trump's tariff bombshell provided an epic buzz kill to what promised to be a robust film market, but the strength of this year's lineup (and some pointed anti-Trump rhetoric) is keeping fest spirits high.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Politics continues to trump business at this year's Cannes film festival, with little in the way of deals out of the Marché, but lots of activist agitation on the red carpet and beyond. 


	Cannes' first weekend, traditionally the period when the bidding wars begin and the first big buys are announced, has been almost frighteningly quiet. There was a single big deal — Mubi's $24 million multi-territory deal, including North America, the U.K., Latin America and other countries — for the Lynne Ramsay's Jennifer Lawrence Robert Pattinson starrer Die, My Love. It was a major deal for a finished film but also threw into sharp relief the lack of major pre-sales at Cannes so far, despite a market featuring jam-packed with hot packages.

	The cautious, wait-and-see approach from buyers — already in evidence in Sundance and Berlin — continues amid growing uncertainty over financing and distribution models and, let's face it, over the future of the movie business itself. 


	Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on “foreign-made” films, launched just ahead of Cannes, went off like a bomb under the already shaky foundations of the indie industry. Just how much damage has been done will only be possible to assess post-market when the dust has settled. 


	“The idea of tariffs is spooking people, especially financiers,” said one veteran indie producer. “Financiers are already a jumpy bunch, and anything that gives them a reason to doubt the viability of the domestic market, the value of a U.S. presale, is poison.” 


	Most sales execs don't expect the Trump pronouncement to adversely affect deals — there are no tariffs yet, and it isn't clear if there ever will be — but the news killed any positive vibes sellers had going into Cannes. Not that things were sunny on the sales front. On the domestic side, the Sundance Film Festival had some of its slowest dealmaking in recent memory. Neon's deal for thriller Together, Netflix's for likely awards hopeful Train Dreams and A24's for Eva Victor's Sorry, Baby (also screening in Cannes) were the standouts of an otherwise demoralizing market. In the months after the Park City fest, smaller operations like Magnolia, Briarcliff, Greenwich and Mubi have scooped up a handful of the best-reviewed of the fest, leaving the majority still in limbo. 

	











	Berlin also started out slow — most of the deals reported during the EFM were smaller domestic pickups of international art house features, with Sony Pictures Classics taking Rebecca Zlotowski's French-language murder mystery Vie Privée starring Jodie Foster (a Cannes premiere), Mubi snatching up North American rights to Oliver Hermanus' gay romance The History of Sound (a Cannes competition title), and IFC Films and Shudder jointly acquiring Sean Byrne's shark and serial killer thriller Dangerous Animals, which also screened at the Marché. 


	But a pre-buy bidding war that started in Berlin over the Lena Dunham-directed rom-com Good Sex, set to star Natalie Portman, closed in the weeks after the market, with Netflix emerging victorious, inking a worldwide deal with CAA Media Finance and FilmNation reportedly priced at the $55 million mark. 


	So it may be with the Marché. Several festival titles, still unsold for the U.S., are attracting interest, and if deals aren't signed on the Croisette, many will likely close by the summer. Sean Baker, who triumphed here last year with Anora, winning the Palme d'Or en route to awards season glory and a best picture win at the Oscars, is drawing interest for Shih-Ching Tsou's Left-Handed Girl, the feature Baker co-wrote, and edited, which screened in Cannes Critics Week. The drama follows a single mother and her two daughters who return to Taipei after several years of living in the countryside to open a stand at a buzzing night market. Le Pacte is handling sales. 

	











Urchin, the directorial debut of Babygirl and Triangle of Sadness star Harris Dickinson, which had its bow in Un Certain Regard, also has multiple buyers circling. Frank Dillane plays a self-destructive addict in the dark drama, which Charades is selling worldwide. THR's review said the film gives Dickinson “a convincing claim for multihyphenate status.” The jury is still out on Kristen Stewart's claim to that title. The Twilight star's hotly anticipated turn behind the camera, The Chronology of Water, bowed in Un Certain Regard to mixed reviews and a muted response from the premiere crowd. The film, adapted from Lidia Yuknavitch's acclaimed 2011 memoir of the same name, stars Imogen Poots, Thora Birch, Nick Cave's son Earl Cave and Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon. 


	Stewart has acknowledged she rushed to finish the film for Cannes, so she may be going back to the editing suite before a final cut emerges. Whatever the critical response — and many seem to love the movie — Stewart's global fan base means the title will sell (WME Independent are handling North American sales, Les Films du Losange international). It's only a question of when and for how much. 


	On the foreign-language side, Óliver Laxe's Sirat is heating up, with sales outfit The Match Factory fielding multiple offers. In the French-born Spanish director's fourth feature, his first in Cannes competition, a father and son join a group of itinerant ravers in the deserts of Morocco. The Hollywood Reporter's review called it a “techno-infused meditation on death and grief.” Shot entirely on Super 16mm, Sirat may be too art house for studio speciality labels, but expect the indie buyers to step up. 

	











	Fatih Akin's Amrum, an out-of-competition title, sold well ahead of Cannes, with Beta Cinema closing multiple international deals, including for France, Spain, Japan and Brazil. Beta says it is in negotiations with multiple domestic buyers for the period coming-of-age tale, set on a picturesque, windswept German island in the final days of World War II. Diane Kruger, who last teamed with Akin for In the Fade (2017), which won her the best actress honor in Cannes, has a supporting role in Amrum. 


	Business aside, the festival is getting high marks from the critics, with the competition line-up already throwing up multiple Palme d'Or contenders. At the half-way mark, Sirât is a strong contender for the top prize, as is The Sound of Falling, the second feature from German director Mascha Schilinski (Dark Blue Girl), which depicts four generations of young women inhabiting the same farmhouse in northeast Germany. In a rave, THR called the drama a “haunting meditation on womanhood and rural strife that heralds the arrival of a bold new talent.” But the film's slow pace and long running time — it clocks in at 2 hours 29 minutes — had some viewers stifling yawns. 


	Ari Aster's Eddington, arguably the most-hyped movie coming into Cannes, split audiences. Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone, Austin Butler, Micheal Ward and Luke Grimes star in the drama, which is set in a small town in New Mexico in May 2020 and depicts a mayoral campaign between the COVID-sceptic sheriff Joe Cross (Phoenix) and the COVID-conscious incumbent Ted Garcia (Pascal). As the campaign intensifies, so does the pandemonium of the pandemic era, with news coverage and social media posts stoking the flames of right-wing conspiracy, rising racial reckoning and protests against police brutality. The film drew raves and pans in equal measure. THR was definitely in the pan camp. “A neo-Western, which confuses absurdism with incoherence,” was our verdict (see page 34). 

	











	But the critics have never been great at predicting which film the Cannes jury will go for. In a week's time, the nine jury members under president Juliette Binoche could surprise us all.

Neil Druckmann breaks down that devastating porch scene in season two's sixth episode.


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Note: This episode contains spoilers for The Last of Us season two episode six. 


Pedro Pascal‘s return to HBO's The Last of Us in a flashback-filled episode packed an emotional wallop, filling in several blanks in Joel and Ellie's (Bella Ramsey) tumultuous relationship. Starting with a look at Joel's abused childhood, a series of sequences followed, set during Ellie's birthdays — since the duo settled in Jackson — and showing what went down on the porch the night before Joel's murder.




	The scenes throw all sorts of complex lighting into previous events, but perhaps most simply, they remind the audience of Joel's extraordinary level of caring for Ellie — showing that the two had started down the road of reconciliation before Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) changed their fates forever.

	Below, Neil Druckmann — who co-wrote the PlayStation game The Last of Us Part II and serves as a showrunner on The Last of Us, directing this week's episode — discusses some of the hour's pivotal moments and tangled moral and emotional quagmires.


This might be one of those rare episodes of TV where people cry repeatedly through the hour, not just in one key moment. 


	Well, I'm glad it worked for you. Just to see Pedro and Bella one more time; to see their happiest they've ever been, maybe the saddest they've been with each other, and the angriest they've ever been. And it was such a joy to explore all those nuances along the way. 


	I'm extremely proud of how it turned out, and I was really nervous. That porch scene, especially, means so much to myself, to my co-writers on this episode, Craig [Mazin] and Haley [Gross], and to everyone that worked on the game and the show. But specifically, when I was working on this episode, I had two people on the front of my mind, which were Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, who originally played these characters in the game. They gave such brilliant performances for very similar scenes that I wanted to honor what they've done, because they helped create those characters. 


I just re-watched the game version of scene (watch it below). For this, I was particularly caught by Ellie asking Joel those questions that had been on her mind for so long, and the choice to just have Joel just be silent and nod. 


	In the game, Ellie asked those questions at a different point. Here we took several flashback scenes and collapsed them into the one on the porch. So Ellie has to understand what Joel has done, get angry at him, and then move towards forgiveness — all within one scene. I thought Bella gave a beautiful performance. I can't imagine how difficult that would be.And I remember the day of shooting, I pulled Pedro and Bella aside and mentioned how important the scene is and how powerful it can be, and how important it is for their characters. Specifically, “This is your last conversation with each other. You've been withholding all this stuff, all these questions, so hold nothing back.” If you watch Bella's Ellie this season, she wears more of a mask than Ashley's Ellie in the game. Here, the masks are fully off. And now Joel knows that she knows, and the last gift he can give her is to give her the truth. And since they were “yes or no” questions, it felt like he wouldn't even need to say it, he could just nod or shake his head. 

	











One thing that fascinates to me about this season is the structure, which is obviously taken from the game, as well, where you lose Joel, and then have these flashbacks and each one changes how you view their relationship and his death, though they're much more spaced out. 


	Yeah, let me talk to you about our thought process. You're right that in the game, these scenes are spaced out, sometimes hours apart. If we spaced out these scenes and planted them throughout the season, I believe they wouldn't land as powerfully because they're short moments and work better when they're next to each other and you can just see the comparison — it's like their relationship is slowly deteriorating. If we put one in an episode, and then you have to wait a week to see the next, you have to remember what the last one was, and then wait another week again. I think the show would start feeling like it has a template — “What's the Joel flashback this week?”Also it was important that the audience, like the characters, miss Joel. So we would kill him early in the season, we decided not to show him back until close to the end of the season. Then it became a question of where should it land. It felt appropriate to land after Ellie has just committed the darkest, most violent act she's ever committed in her life — torturing an unarmed woman to try to get information about where Joel's killer is hiding. There's a contrast of “look how far this character has come.” They're almost unrecognizable in that scene. Here's our reminder of who they were, and what they're fighting for — the memory of this person. 


That makes a lot of sense. I did wonder if there was a part of you that would have been tempted to hold the porch moment to the series finale, and also wondered if the pragmatic issue of not having Pascal signed beyond season two might have factored into that. 


	No, but let's assume we could shoot it and hold it and reveal it later. Craig brought this up to me and I bought into it immediately: He [pointed out] that when you buy the game, you have the entire story. You could play for the whole thing in two days. We have to take into account that the story is being delivered week by week, season by season, with more story coming potentially years later. There would be a high risk of the porch scene not landing if he held onto it. 

	











When I was looking at the porch scene, one of the comments read: “Ellie's vengeance wasn't just about killing the people who took Joel from her, but about taking revenge on them for taking away her chance at forgiving him.” Is that true, do you think?


	I agree with that interpretation, because we get to see that Joel hurt Ellie maybe the worst way possible — by taking the choice away from her to honor the people that died on her journey to be delivered to the Fireflies. Ellie's so angry, and she means it when she says, “I don't know if I could ever forgive you for that, but I would like to try.” She wanted to move towards that forgiveness, because I think she understood that — as much as Joel hurt her — his motivation was unconditional love, and she shares that unconditional love for him. Now she can never get the chance. 


Oddly enough, the simplistic reaction I had to watching the scene was relief — “Oh, they weren't in quite as bad of a place, relationship wise, when he died as we thought.” There is something oddly reassuring about that. 


	It's bittersweet because he was finally honest with her and they confessed their love to each other on in that scene, but they never moved back to when we saw them at their happiest at that Space Museum.

	











Speaking of which, the rocket ship scene was one of my favorite cutscenes from the game. What did that scene mean to you? 


	I've always liked that Ellie is fascinated with our world, that things we take for granted are like fantasy to her. And by the way, that quality of Ellie came from Ashley Johnson. She loved the idea of wanting to be an astronaut. So I wrote that to make Ellie more like her and now it has remained all the way through for  another actor to reinterpret it. To me, it speaks to how children can just tap into their imagination and picture they are somewhere else. Ellie wants something that she could never have in this world, and Joel kind of gives it to her.


Joel is so amazing in this episode as the World's Greatest Apocalypse Dad that it also caused me to feel some annoyance at Ellie — like, “How can you not appreciate this man more than you do?” Though I also understand that she's at an age where you naturally pull away from your parents and if there aren't things to be correctly mad about, you'll find reasons anyway. And, obviously, he was not perfect.


	There are several big lies my parents have told to me that only now, in my forties, I'm able to forgive and move past because I see their motivations were in the right place. And now, as a dad myself, I had this feeling of like, “I know how to raise my kids better than my parents. I'm always going to be completely honest.” And there was a moment in time where I was too honest with my daughter when she was too young and it was about something violent and dark, and she was traumatized by it. It speaks to the complexity of being a parent and how difficult it is — even when you're doing the right thing, you might be causing your kids to hate you. That's the choice of the job.

 Jason Ning will serve as showrunner on the series, which the studio will shop to potential buyers. 


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The studio behind SWAT — and the show's lead actor — are taking another shot at keeping the franchise going.


Sony Pictures Television has greenlit a spinoff of the crime procedural titled SWAT Exiles. Like the recently ended CBS series, Exiles will star Shemar Moore, reprising his role as Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson as he works with a team of young recruits. Sony will also distribute the series worldwide and will shop it to potential buyers in the near future.




	The studio made the announcement Sunday evening at its annual L.A. Screenings event.

	“We are thrilled to usher this beloved franchise into a new era with SWAT Exiles,” said Sony Pictures TV chairman Keith Le Goy said in a statement. “We believe in championing powerful storytelling and in our teams' exceptional ability to create and deliver these stories to audiences around the world. This belief is embedded in our DNA and central to every decision we make.”


	Jason Ning (The Brothers Sun, Mrs. Davis) will be the showrunner on the spinoff as part of a recently renewed overall deal with Sony (Ning is also working on the studio's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon series, which is in development for Amazon's Prime Video, with Ron Moore). Ning will executive produce SWAT Exiles with SWAT EPs Shemar Moore, Neal H. Moritz and Pavun Shetty of Original Film, and James Scura.


	“I couldn't be more thrilled to partner with Sony to bring SWAT Exiles to life,” said Ning. “It's an incredible honor to carry forward the legacy of a show that fans around the world have come to love. Working with Shemar Moore, who defines what it means to be a leading man, and introducing a new generation of characters into this world is a dream.”


	Sony has ordered 10 episodes of Exiles, with development going on now. The studio hopes to begin production in the summer in Los Angeles, noting that the spinoff will keep about 200 members of SWAT's L.A.-based crew employed. 


	“My eight seasons on SWAT have been epic and memorable. We entertained the world, defied the odds, came back from the dead twice, and continued to woo fans and families worldwide,” said Moore. “I am excited for this next generation and iteration of SWAT with Sony. [Sony Pictures TV Studios president] Katherine Pope, Neal H. Moritz, Jason Ning and I will keep the franchise, thrill ride action, heartfelt drama and storytelling of SWAT alive.”

	











	“We couldn't be more excited to bring the next chapter of SWAT to life — both for our incredibly dedicated fans of the original franchise and for a new generation of viewers,” added Pope. “We're grateful to our incredible partners Neal H. Moritz, Pavun Shetty, Jason Ning and Shemar Moore for embarking on this journey with us. This team's commitment to the global fan base, to our beloved crew and to our city runs deep.”


	The spinoff announcement comes just two days after SWAT concluded after eight seasons on CBS. The network initially canceled the series after its sixth season in 2023, then reversed course and renewed SWAT for what was billed as a seventh and final season. CBS then changed its mind again and ordered an eighth season before canceling the show for a second time in March. Seasons one through seven of SWAT stream on Netflix, while the just-finished eighth season is on CBS' sibling streamer Paramount+.  


	Here is Sony's description of SWAT Exiles: “After a high-profile mission goes sideways, Daniel ‘Hondo' Harrelson is pulled out of forced retirement to lead a last-chance, experimental SWAT unit made up of untested, unpredictable young recruits. Hondo must bridge a generational divide, navigate clashing personalities, and turn a squad of outsiders into a team capable of protecting the city and saving the program that made him who he is.”


	After CBS announced SWAT's cancellation in March, Moore said in an Instagram video that he wasn't ready to say goodbye to the show — and called out potential new homes for the series: “Hey, Netflix, how you doing?” Moore said. “Netflix, if you're interested in a show that is in autopilot that the world is watching, we'd love to come play. NBC, Fox, ABC, hey, you want to come flirt with me? You're invited to the barbecue. Pick your favorite restaurant. I will pay the bill.”

The latest deal signals Regal Cinemas is back spending on theater upgrades after parent Regal Cineworld emerged from a financial restructuring process. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Regal Cinemas has added another four Imax theaters.


	The second-largest movie theater chain in the U.S. has expanded its partnership with the wide-screen exhibitor for new laser projection screen locations in Los Angeles, Houston and Washington, D.C. Expanding its longstanding partnership with Imax signals Regal is back spending on upgrades to its domestic circuit after parent Regal Cineworld emerged from its financial restructuring process.




	That includes turbocharging the theatrical movie experience with premium experiences like Imax and other investments. “At Regal, we are committed to providing the latest and most innovative technologies in our theatres with the overall goal of delivering the best moviegoing experience for our guests,” Eduardo Acuna, CEO of the Regal Cineworld Group, said in a statement.

	“Through our partnership with Imax, we are able to expand on this commitment by bringing their most advanced entertainment experience to some of our top performing locations,” he added. Exhibitors like Regal, AMC Theatres and Cinemark have focused for years on upgrades in order to draw moviegoers out of the house with a more premium experience. 


	As part of its latest deal, Regal will open an 80-foot Imax screen in the L.A. Live entertainment complex in Los Angeles. The agreement will also bring new Imax theaters to the Regal Greenway Grand Palace in downtown Houston, the Regal Virginia Gateway in a suburb of Washington, DC, and Regal Sherman Oaks in Los Angeles.


	The latest agreement with Regal includes the renewal of 33 Regal Imax locations across the U.S., and installing ten previously contracted upgrades to Imax with laser projection in 2025. Regal Cineworld operates 132 Imax screens at 640 locations worldwide.

Episodes will also continue to air on PBS, debuting the same day as they launch on Netflix.

Netflix is stepping in to save Sesame Street.


	The streaming giant has inked a deal with Sesame Workshop for new episodes of the long-running children's show, just months after Warner Bros. Discovery opted not to renew its output deal for the program in a strategic shift at its streaming service Max (which will soon return to being HBO Max).




	In a notable change from the HBO deal, new episodes of Sesame Street will also run day and date on PBS and the PBS Kids app, ensuring that they are easily accessible. Sesame Street has been available on PBS for more than 50 years, though during the HBO deal, the episodes debuted on PBS months after their HBO premieres.

	“This unique public-private partnership will enable Sesame Workshop to bring our research-based curriculum to young children around the world with Netflix's global reach, while ensuring children in communities across the U.S. continue to have free access on public television to the Sesame Street they love,” Sesame Workshop CEO Sherri Westin said in a statement.


	“I strongly believe that our educational programming for children is one of the most important aspects of our service to the American people, and Sesame Street has been an integral part of that critical work for more than half a century,” added Paula Kerger, president and CEO of PBS. “We're proud to continue our partnership in the pursuit of having a profound impact on the lives of children for years to come.”


	The Netflix deal begins later this year with season 56 of the program. Season 56 will be reimagined, with the show dropping its magazine style format in favor of a longer segment, joined by a new animated element called Tales From 123. The new season will be released in three “batches,” Netflix says.


	Sesame Workshop has been seeking a new home for the show since the HBO talks ended (some of the Sesame Street library will remain on HBO Max), and the nonprofit has faced a budget crunch, forcing layoffs earlier this year.


	The deal with Netflix and PBS not only provides much needed financial stability for the non-profit (it is slated to host its annual fundraiser next week), but also provides expanded access to the program for free, an extremely unusual arrangement for Netflix.

As the recorded-music business worldwide grew for the 10th consecutive year, these are the executives driving success for artists outside the United States.


													By
												

	Thom Duffy


Editor


Recorded music is a small but mighty sector” of the world's business, IFPI CEO Victoria Oakley said as she introduced the organizations's annual report in March. “It's a part of the global economy that really matters. Above all, it's a powerful example of human artistry and connectivity.”


	Oakley quantified the impact of that artistry with a report full of good news — mostly. The recorded-music business worldwide grew for the 10th consecutive year, despite concerns raised by generative artificial intelligence (AI) using copyright-protected music to train its systems.


	Total recorded-music revenue climbed to $29.6 billion in 2024, a rise of 4.8% on the previous year, with streaming revenue surpassing $20 billion for the first time, representing just under 70% of global recorded-music sales, according to IFPI's Global Music Report 2025. Similarly, CISAC in October reported that global royalty collections for song rights holders grew 7.6% in the previous year. In the concert industry, Live Nation's adjusted operating income rose 14% in 2024.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Today, we celebrate not just these results and these phenomenal artists, but also the amazing hard work that goes into making it happen behind the scenes,” Oakley said.


	Those working behind the scenes are celebrated here, on Billboard's Global Power Players list.


	Nominated by their firms and peers and chosen by our editors from selected industry sectors, these executives have primary responsibility for markets outside the United States, which account for some 60% of the world's recorded-music revenue.


	They work where the action is — or at least, the greatest growth. While the United States held its place as the No. 1 recorded-music market in the world, its revenue increased only 2.2% in 2024, compared with 7.2% in 2023.


	Japan, still the world's second-largest recorded-­music market, was flat in 2024. But among the world's remaining top 10 markets, IFPI reports rates of growth in the United Kingdom (up 4.9%), Germany (up 4.1%), China (up 9.6%), France (up 7.5%), Canada (up 1.5%), Brazil (up 21.7%) and Mexico, the top 10 market where its revenue increased 15.6%. (South Korea was down 5.7%.)


	In other regions, recorded-music growth has been even more dramatic. Latin America experienced growth of 22.5%. The Middle East and North Africa, which are almost entirely dominated by streaming, had music sales grow 22.8%, and sub-Saharan Africa recorded a 22.6% rise in revenue to surpass $100 million for the first time, albeit from a modest baseline. Just as the rise of file-sharing dramatically cut the fortunes of the music industry at the turn of the 21st ­century, today, executives nervously watch the rise of another technology — generative AI — due to its potential and its threat to copyright. Many of the executives profiled in this list cite AI as the biggest issue facing the industry.


	IFPI's presentation in London took place against the backdrop of a campaign in the United Kingdom to oppose proposed changes by the government to copyright law that, if implemented, could let AI developers freely use creators' content to train their algorithms, unless rights holders “opt out.”


	“We are asking policymakers to protect music and artistry,” Oakley said in a statement accompanying the Global Music Report. “We must harness the potential of AI to support and amplify human creativity, not to replace it.”


Fred GillhamManaging director, U.K. and Europe, Concord Label GroupRebecca BermanSenior vp of international, Concord Label Group, Concord


	It's hard to top the success of breakout star Tommy Richman's “Million Dollar Baby.” Concord's Berman says the Billboard Global 200 chart-topping smash that also was a massive hit on TikTok and global radio “was a huge achievement for both Richman and Concord,” after its initial U.S. release through ISO Supremacy and Pulse Music Group. In addition, she says that the continued expansion of Concord's global marketing network has contributed to the label group's growing prowess around the world. “We have expertise in every major market in the world,” she says, “dedicated to executing globally minded campaigns to reach fans everywhere and find new audiences.”


Biggest issue now: “The changing nature of how audiences consume and how difficult it can be to find your engaged audience. These changes are emphasized further with the globalized nature of the music industry, where platforms, DSPs [digital service providers], etc., may be different from country to country or region to region,” Berman says. “Blanket approaches to international marketing are ineffective.”


Adam GraniteCEO, Africa, the Middle East and AsiaMichelle TehSenior vp of global classics and jazz, Universal Music Group


	Granite sees “our growth across Greater China, India, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa through ­organic A&R success” as being among the highlights of the past year for UMG. He also cites “the expansion of our distributed label business in partnership with Virgin and our continued merger and acquisition focus.” However, he adds that finding “the appropriate monetization for real engagement” could challenge growth going forward. Granite also spent valuable time over the past year community­building, including visiting Dharavi Dream Project's After School of Hip-Hop in Mumbai, India, a partnership involving UMG that provides youth outlets for artistic expression utilizing hip-hop culture.


The music business today in a word: “Exciting,” Granite says.


Celine JoshuaExecutive vp of global marketingJohannes von SchwarzkopfChief strategy officer, BMG


	BMG reported in March that it generated 963 million ­euros ($1 billion) in revenue in 2024, marking a 6.4% increase over the previous year, with major wins coming from artists like country superstar Jelly Roll and rap hit-maker Mustard. Von Schwarzkopf considers the successful execution of the company's BMG Next strategy to be a big factor in its recent success: “In the last 12 months, we've built global teams in recorded catalog, sales and marketing to better support our artists and songwriters worldwide, while also strengthening our local artist career teams where proximity to the market matters,” he says. “By working collaboratively across borders, our teams are strengthening our international business relationships, improving our service to artists and songwriters and positioning BMG for sustainable growth.”


The music business today in a word: “Opportunity,” von Schwarzkopf says.


Melissa ThomasExecutive vp of international marketing for U.S. repertoireWouter JansenSenior vp of international marketing, digital and commercial strategyNaoise RyanVp of international marketing, Columbia Records, Sony Music Entertainment


	Sony's international team recently worked on campaigns for Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter; Tyler, The Creator's Chromakopia; and both Future's collaborative albums with Metro Boomin, We Don't Trust You and We Still Don't Trust You, and solo release Mixtape Pluto. They also marketed multiple singles from SZA's SOS Deluxe: LANA ahead of her headlining slots at Glastonbury and London's BST Hyde Park festivals in the United Kingdom. The Sony team also worked on campaigns for Travis Scott, Tyla, PartyNextDoor and Addison Rae, as well as Blackpink stars Lisa and Jennie. Sony Music's key to success, Thomas says, is that “all of our campaign highlights from the past 12 to 18 months have had one through line: fan strategy.”


The music business today in a word: “Competitive — in the best way possible,” Thomas says.


Eric WongPresident of EastWest Records/head of global A&RJessica Keeley-CarterChief marketing officerTony CoreySenior vp of global marketingZac FroudVp of global marketing, Warner Music Group


	WMG's global teams have “collaborated to secure standout results across key markets” for its rising stars, according to Keeley-Carter. Blackpink's Rosé charted in the top 10 in more than 10 countries and has spent 19 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Global Excl. U.S. chart with “APT.” with Bruno Mars. Teddy Swims' recent album, I've Tried Everything but Therapy (Part 2), hit No. 1 on the Australian Recording Industry Association chart; Benson Boone's single “Sorry I'm Here for Someone Else” reached Spotify charts in 30 different markets; and Alex Warren's “Ordinary” hit No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart in the United Kingdom.


The music business today in a word: “Noisy,” Keeley-Carter says. “We're here to help our artists rise above it and make their mark.”


Julie AdamPresident/CEO, Universal Music Canada


	According to Universal Music Canada, it released the top seven of the 10 best-performing albums of 2024 thanks to Post Malone, Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter, The Weeknd, Morgan Wallen, Noah Kahan and Taylor Swift. “We anchored and supported each project with Canada-specific campaigns, content and fan events,” Adam says. “Our domestically signed acts continue to impact international markets. Rising pop star Sofia Camara is exploding in the U.K., country breakout Josh Ross continues to climb the charts in the U.S. and beyond, comedian turned singer-songwriter Mae Martin released their debut album, Owen Riegling is breaking out with national brand partnerships, and Punjabi super-producer thiarajxtt is driving artist discovery with fans from South Asia to Canada.”


The music business today in a word: “Artists. All that we do is for, about and in support of artists.”


Kirsten BurkePresident, Warner Music Canada


	“One of Warner Music Canada's biggest success stories this past year was the extension of our partnership with Karan Aujla,” Burke says, noting the extended joint venture between Warner Music Canada and Warner Music India. “As the most streamed Punjabi artist on Spotify worldwide in 2024, Karan's influence is undeniable,” says Burke, who adds that the Indian rapper is known for constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of both Punjabi and global music. “We kicked off the year with the release of ‘Tell Me,' a dynamic Punjabi-English collaboration with OneRepublic. The song quickly charted in Canada, [the United Arab Emirates], Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Pakistan and India, further underscoring his global appeal.”


Biggest issue now: “The impact of AI on creativity, rights management and artist compensation.”


Shane CarterPresident, Sony Music Entertainment Canada


	“I am honored to be part of the team who brought Céline Dion's deeply personal, moving story to the world in the documentary I Am: Céline Dion,” says Carter, who worked as an executive producer alongside teams at Sony Music Canada, Sony Vision and several global partners to bring the film to life. “Everyone involved in this project was so talented and 100% committed to the collaboration required to tell Céline's story with sensitivity and authenticity. It was a highlight of the year — and also my career.” The journey culminated in Dion's powerful return to the stage at the opening ceremonies for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.


Biggest issue now: “We work alongside artists to build their audience authentically over time. This requires ­deeper collaboration across teams and innovative, strategic campaigns that truly connect. It's a challenge — but also an exciting opportunity to match artists' creativity with bold new ways to share their music with the world.”


Frank BriegmannChairman/CEO, Universal Music Central Europe and Deutsche GrammophonOlivier NusseCEO, Universal Music France and Universal Music Africa (French-speaking)Patrick BoulosCEO, Universal Music Group Middle East and North AfricaFranck KacouManaging director, Universal Music Africa


	It was a banner year for UMG throughout Africa and Europe, particularly in Germany, where half of the top 10 albums on the year-end 2024 charts belonged to UMG, and the company held six places among the top 10 most streamed music artists. “We are also very proud that we have been able to break six domestic artists,” Briegmann says. Deutsche Grammophon artists were No. 1 on the German classical chart in 10 out of 12 months in the last year. In Italy, UMG landed six of the top 10 albums on the year-end 2024 chart, while UMG albums were No. 1 in the Netherlands for 33 out of 52 weeks. For Nusse, Stromae & Pomme's “Ma Meilleure Ennemie,” which was featured in the Arcane TV series, became a global success with nearly 470 million streams, “85% of which came from international markets,” he says.


The music business today in a word: “Artist-centric,” Nusse says.


Tony HarlowCEO, Warner Music U.K.


	From his post leading Warner Music in London, Harlow has supported Warner Music Group developments, including the overall reorganization of the company and the restructuring of its leadership in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Both changes “have opened new doors for us,” he says. “The return of Warner Records U.S. and Atlantic Records U.S. as a repertoire powerhouse has hugely helped us,” Harlow says, giving a shoutout to the executives guiding those companies who have helped drive the global success of U.K. artists including Charli xcx and Coldplay.


Biggest issue now: “Pessimism. If you talk yourself down, guess where you will end up?”


Jason IleyChairman/CEO, Sony Music U.K. and Ireland, Sony Music Entertainment U.K.


	Iley and his Sony team are celebrating the success that Myles Smith and Central Cee are having “at a global level,” he says. Cee's debut album, Can't Rush Greatness, hit No. 9 on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, Smith, who signed to RCA on Christmas Eve in 2023, won the BRIT Awards' Rising Star honor in March, and his track “Stargazing” topped the Alternative Airplay chart. “Beyond chart success,” Iley says, “I'm really pleased to see results from the holistic work we've put into strengthening our business,” with a focus on employee wellness and an award-­winning childcare policy. Such initiatives, he adds, “demonstrate the importance of listening — listening to what our artists and people need from us in order to succeed.”


Biggest issue now: “AI is a global issue and one that we are at the forefront of in the U.K. We have been working to help the government understand the implications of their proposed copyright reforms [that would] present a serious threat to our artists and their work.”


Daniel LieberbergPresident of continental Europe and Africa, Sony Music EntertainmentChristoph BehmCEO, Sony Music Entertainment Germany, Switzerland and AustriaMarie-Anne RobertManaging director, Sony Music Entertainment FranceSean WatsonManaging director, Sony Music Entertainment Africa


	“It's been a great year, with a series of successes for our local and international artists thanks to the incredibly hardworking teams across Europe and Africa,” says Lieberberg, who oversaw Sony's growth in Greece and the Czech Republic through acquisitions, including Supraphron, the latter country's longest-established record label. In Germany, Sony “delivered a global viral feat” thanks to Raffaella Carrà, Jaxomy and Agatino Romero's collaboration, “Pedro.” Sony also opened the recording complex ONE Studios in Amsterdam. Artist Shiva set records in Italy by earning 100 million streams in a week, and Sony established a presence in Accra, Ghana, thanks to a partnership with Crux Global.


The music industry today in a word: “Culture-driven,” Lieberberg says.


Alistair NorburyPresident of U.K., Europe and Asia-PacificLevy IsabellaManaging director of Benelux and Scandinavia, BMG


	BMG enjoyed a variety of European wins in 2024, with top five debuts on the United Kingdom's Official Albums Chart for bands Soft Play, Travis and The Script, as well as No. 1 bows for British indie-pop band Blossoms and global pop legend Kylie Minogue, whose Tension also topped charts in Scotland and Belgium. Norbury cites the most significant recent developments of BMG delivering its repertoire directly to digital platforms (while moving physical distribution to Universal) and dabbling in related fields like film and literature. “We are fully focused on being a global music publisher and recordings business,” he says.


Biggest issue now: “Fair compensation for artists and songwriters in relation to streaming platforms,” Norbury says.

These include 91 North Records, a joint venture between the label's India and Canada outposts, which Robson says had “strong success” in breaking rapper AR Paisley, Punjabi hip-hop lyricist Chani Nattan and Punjabi-focused producer Gminxer, all of whom are Canadian. Warner Music India and Warner Music Canada have also been working together with Karan Aujla and recently released “Tell Me” with OneRepublic. WMG also launched an Africa Francophone brand emphasizing French-speaking sub-Saharan African artists. “We also recently incorporated Warner Music U.K. into our EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa] structure to help further boost creative collaborations and align our artist campaigns,” he says.


Biggest issue now: “Recent IFPI figures showed that global industry growth [in key markets] slowed last year,” Robson says. “That means we must be even more focused on innovation, creativity and strategic deal-­making to ensure sustainable growth for the future.”


Dickon StainerChairman/CEO, Universal Music U.K.


	“I would like to highlight the incredible work of our U.K. teams, working with our global partners to put great British artistry back at the heart of international culture — in the shape of Lola Young, Sam Fender, The Last Dinner Party and Olivia Dean,” Stainer says, “and to prove the lasting value of our labels to long-term artist career-building and storytelling on a global scale.” Stainer was named to lead Universal Music U.K. in September 2024, following a long career at UMG, most recently as president/CEO of UMG's global classics and jazz division. He oversees divisions including Island EMI Label Group, Polydor Label Group, Decca Records and the recently formed Audience and Media Division, as well as Abbey Road Studios.


Biggest issue now: “To be compelling and relevant to audiences who are bombarded with noise and distraction.”


Alejandro DuquePresident, Warner Music Latin AmericaGuillermo González ArévaloPresident, Warner Music IberiaLeila OliveriaPresident, Warner Music BrazilTomas RodriguezPresident, Warner Music Mexico and Mexican Music


	Warner's regional approach in the last year has focused on new artist development across the board. Argentine artist Yami Safdie's track “En Otra Vida” charted in over 20 countries; Venezuela's Elena Rose not only broke out in multiple countries, but her “Caracas en el 2000” became an anthem in her home country; Danny Ocean's “Imagínate” soared on Spotify's global charts; and Colombia's Blessd amassed millions of monthly listeners. Warner also struck deals with Puerto Rico's CLARENT, Dominican provocateur Tokisha and partnerships with label Street Mob Records that include rising regional Mexican artists like Armenta, Clave Especial and Calle 24. Warner Music Brazil opened a new headquarters and a creative hub in Rio de Janeiro, together with Warner Chappell Music Brazil and ADA Brazil. “We've continued to prove ourselves an instrumental force in developing the voices that are shaping the future of Latin music,” Duque says.


Biggest issue now: “Music is still extremely undervalued compared with other forms of entertainment,” Duque says.


Jesús LópezChairman/CEO, Universal Music Latin America & Iberian PeninsulaAlfredo DelgadilloPresident/CEO, Universal Music MexicoManuel PeñaManaging director of Andean, Central America and Caribbean, Universal MusicPaulo LimaPresident, Universal Music BrazilLuis EstradaPresident of Southern Cone, Universal Music Argentina


	Universal Music Group's focus on artist development resulted in back-to-back best new artist wins at the Latin Grammys in 2023 (Joaquina) and 2024 (Ela Taubert). The company's global approach was also evident in Colombia's Feid, who landed in the top 10 of Billboard's year-end 2024 Top Latin Artists chart, while Karol G's 2023 set, Mañana Será Bonito, was the fourth most streamed album globally on Spotify in 2024. Another Colombian, Morat, wrapped a 24-date stadium tour; in Brazil, UMG's artists included chart-toppers Felipe e Rodrigo, Lauana Prado and Henriquez & Juliano; and in Spain, Lola Índigo was Spotify's top female artist for 2024.


Biggest issue now: “Keeping the artist-centric model to protect the rights of artists, composers and music workers, as well as fair reward for real artists and real music,” López says.

	Sony had a phenomenal year in Latin music. After leading the Top Latin Albums chart with Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, Shakira's tour of the same name also made history by ruling Billboard Boxscore's Top Tours ranking for February (the first for a solo female Latin artist), repeated the feat for March and sold out a record number of stadiums in Mexico City. Rauw Alejandro debuted at No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart and No. 6 on the Billboard 200 with Cosa Nuestra, and newcomers Ca7riel y Paco Amoroso's NPR Tiny Desk performance was the most successful of 2024, with over 30 million YouTube views. Other newcomers who crossed the threshold toward stardom include Colombia's Kapo, Mexico's Oscar Maydón and Argentina's Emilia.


The music business today in a word: “Un lindo quilombo [A nice mess],” Verde says.


Andrew ChanManaging director, Greater China, Sony Music EntertainmentVanessa PickenChair/CEO, Sony Music Australia and New ZealandShridhar SubramaniamPresident of corporate strategy and market development in Asia and the Middle East, Sony Music EntertainmentVinit ThakkarManaging director, India, Sony Music Entertainment


	Sony Music's operations in Australasia scored several big wins in the past 18 months. It acquired DRM New Zealand for The Orchard. The Australia-New Zealand division of the merchandising company Ceremony of Roses expanded operations in the Asia Pacific region and is now working with over 30 international tours. The company created Sony Music Masterworks Australia and New Zealand, a live-music and experiential division of SME that successfully staged Lightscape, Dark Spectrum and Jurassic World Exhibition, as well as a sold-out film/orchestral performance of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Sony also signed Angus & Julia Stone, Gang of Youths and Sydney electronic trio Mansionair.


Biggest issue now: “To thrive in today's diverse and decentralized music landscape,” Picken says, “artists and companies must adapt, embrace emerging technologies and build stronger, more direct connections with their audiences.”


Chris GobalakrishnaCOO, Warner Music Asia; CFO, Asia Pacific, recorded music, Warner Music/Recorded MusicDan RosenPresident of records and publishing, Australasia, Warner Music Group/Recorded Music and PublishingJay MehtaManaging director, Warner Music India and South Asian Association for Regional CooperationBrayden CrossleySenior vp of marketing, Warner Music Asia, Warner Music/Recorded Music


	“Warner Music Australasia lives by its goal,” Rosen says, “to take our local artists global and make our global artists local.” Among the success stories are New Zealand band Balu Brigada, which hit No. 1 on the Alternative Airplay chart in the United States with its track “So Cold” and is touring the world with Twenty One Pilots. Recent Australian signing Esha Tewari is already selling out shows for her first U.S. solo tour, and Oliver Cronin has had many of his tracks go viral across the world, including in India, the Philippines and Germany. Australia and New Zealand are also breakout markets for Teddy Swims, Benson Boone, Maisie Peters and Charli xcx, according to Rosen.


Biggest issue now: “As an industry,” Rosen says, “we need to harness the benefits of technology and minimize the potential harms to ensure value is returned to our artists, songwriters and rights holders.”


Matt GudinskiCEO, Mushroom Group


	As costs rise across the music ecosystem, creating new business challenges, Mushroom Group keeps evolving. Led by Gudinski, the Melbourne, Australia, independent music company saw one of its “most significant achievements” in 2024 by consolidating its rights companies under the Mushroom Music banner, including recording, publishing and neighboring rights activities. “Additionally, we've experienced substantial international growth across the Mushroom Group,” Gudinski says, “reinforcing our position as a dynamic, forward-thinking company that continues to evolve alongside the ever-changing music industry.”


The music business today in a word: “Competitive, but it's an exciting time as we enter a new generation where more people than ever are immersed in music.”


Katsumi KuroiwaCEO, AvexBrandon SilversteinCEO, Avex Music Group


	The biggest story at Avex this year was the launch of Avex Music Group, a U.S.-based entity led by S10 Entertainment CEO Silverstein that will focus on expanding the global reach of Avex artists and building the company's publishing portfolio, among other endeavors. That deal includes Avex's acquisition of S10 Music Publishing's song catalog and an additional stake in S10 Management. Meanwhile, Avex boy band One or Eight reached No. 1 on Billboard Japan's Heatseekers Songs chart with “Don't Tell Nobody,” while producer-writer Grant contributed to eight tracks on Tate McRae's 2025 Billboard 200 chart-topper, So Close to What.


Biggest issue now: “As the business environment surrounding artists continues to evolve in the global market, it is increasingly important to invest across a wide range of areas,” Kuroiwa says. “In order to do so, having strong local partner companies is essential.”


Cussion PangExecutive chairmanRoss LiangCEO, Tencent Music Entertainment


	“Our company's music content ecosystem continues to gain vitality,” Pang says. In 2024, TME expanded beyond licensing into music events and artist merchandise. The company also launched three offline events: Tencent Music Entertainment Awards, WaveMusic Awards and QQ Music Super Live. Enhancements to its platforms — QQ Music, Kugou Music and Kuwo Music — helped TME's subscribers grow 13.4% to 121 million, including more than 10 million Super VIP subscribers. “Our dual-­engine content-and-platform strategy [creates] a virtuous cycle of growth,” Liang adds. (TME is a Billboard licensee in China.)


Timothy XuChairman/CEO, Universal Music Greater ChinaCalvin WongCEO, Universal Music Southeast Asia; senior vp of Asia, Universal Music GroupDevraj SanyalChairman/CEO, Universal Music India and South Asia; senior vp of strategy, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, Universal Music GroupNaoshi FujikuraPresident/CEO, Universal Music JapanSean WarnerPresident, Universal Music Australia and New Zealand


	Growth, the expansion of local content and blossoming partnerships are some of the high points of Universal Music's operations in Asia and Australasia over the past 18 months. Universal Music Japan reported 11 consecutive years of revenue growth. The China business nurtured partnerships with artists such as Jay Chou (the only Chinese-language artist ever to reach No. 1 on IFPI's Global Albums chart). The India company achieved a global hit with “Big Dawgs” from Hanumankind and Kalmi, and the Australasian affiliate is undergoing changes as well — part of a mission to break artists on a global stage.


Biggest issue now: “One of our biggest challenges in Japan is maintaining the market despite the population decline, especially among younger generations,” Fujikura says. “To sustain growth, we need to implement strategies that prevent the market from shrinking. Key efforts include expanding the senior user base, increasing revenue per user and developing overseas markets.”


Gitte BendzullaCOONigel HardingVp of artist relationsPedro KurtzDirector of content and operations, Americas, Deezer


	Harding says that Deezer remains a pioneer in music streaming; he cites the company's strides toward fairer remuneration (involving both recording and publishing rights) through Deezer's Artist Centric Payment System initiative. Deezer is focused on fans, too, with its Deezer Flow wheel that personalizes music recommendations based on users' tastes and features like the Deezer Shaker and discovery programs including Deezer Next. Plus, it's offering exclusive live experiences like Purple Door, Listening Sessions and rooftop sessions that provide fans intimate access to artists. “These innovations combine technology, engagement and exclusivity to create deeper connections between fans, music and artists,” Harding says.


Biggest issue now: “The rise of AI-generated content flooding streaming platforms. To address this, Deezer has developed a tool to tag AI-generated content, improving transparency for users and protecting creators' rights,” Harding says. “We've already discovered that over 10% of the tracks delivered daily to the platform are AI-generated and, to safeguard creators, this content will be excluded from algorithmic recommendations.”


Dan ChalmersDirector of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, YouTube MusicLizzie DicksonHead of music, YouTube U.K.Sandra JimenezHead of music for Latin America and U.S. LatinPaul SmithManaging director, Asia Pacific, YouTube Music


	Reaching a new milestone of 125 million subscribers to YouTube Music and Premium, the platform's ad-free video tier, was a highlight of the past year, Chalmers says. “We added 25 million in the past year alone, outpacing industry trends and reinforcing our role as a major revenue driver for the music business.” As global subscription growth slowed slightly in 2024, YouTube Music, which ­accounted for 10.1% of the 818 million subscriptions worldwide, according to MIDiA Research, was the only major subscription service to post accelerated subscriber growth compared with 2023.


Biggest issue now: “Ensuring that people can turn their artistry into sustainable careers and cut through the clutter,” Chalmers says. “Artists need more than just streams or views; they need a strategy for visibility, engagement and monetization. They need the tools to build deep, lasting connections with fans.”


Paul FirthDirector of global music industryRocío GuerreroHead of music, Latin-IberiaLaura LukanzHead of music, U.K.John MurphyHead of music, Canada, Amazon Music


	Building on its success in music streaming, Amazon officially integrated “Audible's unparalleled catalog of audiobooks” into the app for users in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada before then expanding into Australia, New Zealand and France, Firth says. “This launch really solidifies our position as an all-audio destination for subscribers across music, podcasts and audiobooks and was my highlight of 2024,” he says. The platform is also trying to help artists get discovered. “In order to have a thriving music scene, there needs to be a consistent flow of exciting new artists, and they need the opportunity to find audiences around the world,” he adds. “Both our Breakthrough and Artists To Watch programs are designed to provide this support.”


The music business today in a word: “Fan-centric,” Firth says.


Georges FornayDeputy CEODan MacktaManaging director of North America and Northern Europe, Qobuz


	Paris-based audiophile streaming service Qobuz achieved significant milestones in the past year, Mackta says, “including our expansion into Japan, the launch of the Studio Student plan and Qobuz Connect. With the U.S. now our leading market, Qobuz has solidified its status as a global company. These achievements reflect our commitment to delivering a unique and deep music experience and to strengthen our position as the go-to platform for music lovers and audiophiles worldwide.” In March, Qobuz became the first streaming company to publicly release the per-streaming royalty rate it pays to rate holders. The all-in rate, which covers both recorded music and publishing, works out to $18.73 for every 1,000 streams.


Biggest issue now: “Building a fair and sustainable streaming model that ensures all artists receive proper compensation and have equal opportunities to reach their audience,” Mackta says.


Matt GralenPresidentSofia IlyasChief community officer, The Beatport Group


	One of the most significant achievements at Beatport has been the company's investment in expanding its infrastructure. “By adding a chief community officer role —my role — and a dedicated team to focus on fostering community within the electronic music space, we are able to support grassroots organizations that champion ­diversity, many of which are volunteer-led and often overlooked despite being a crucial part of the music ecosystem,” IIyas says. The latest recipients of Beatport's Diversity + Parity Fund include Change the Beat, Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, One Off Traks, Other Village People, Saffron and We Are Moving the Needle.


Biggest issue now: “The industry faces several challenges, but one of the most pressing is how artists navigate their careers in a rapidly changing digital landscape,” Ilyas says. “Many artists today seek more autonomy and direct ways to connect with their fans, but the pressure to constantly engage on social media has become overwhelming.”


Emmy LovellGlobal head of musicAma WaltonSenior vp of content partnerships/deputy general counsel, SoundCloud


	SoundCloud has partnered with popular club Hï Ibiza in Spain “for a season-long residency that'll bring James Hype, Meduza and Hannah Laing to one of the biggest stages in electronic music,” Lovell says. “As Hï Ibiza's first-ever brand partnership in its 10-year history, this is a massive moment that reinforces SoundCloud as a trailblazing platform where global dance music movements are born.” Additionally, Ascending, the artist development program designed to boost upcoming artists, continues to drive real results, with select artists seeing a 60% or more spike in followers. “Ensuring our platform remains a launchpad for emerging talent is something I care deeply about,” Lovell adds, “and with these milestones, we're making it clear: SoundCloud is the place where artists can break through the noise.”


The music business today in a word: “Unpredictable,” Lovell says.


Rachel NewmanGlobal head of editorial and contentAnjali MalhotraGlobal director of classicalJuan PazGlobal head of Latin music business, Apple Music


	Apple Music's global footprint was strengthened by a branding initiative that saw the creation of the Apple Music 100 Best Albums and by the addition of Tokyo to the company's Apple Music Studio network. “This past year has seen us really lean into what we do best,” Newman says. “The thing that has always differentiated us is our editorial strength across the world.” In constructing the 100 best albums, “we pulled together an enormous editorial feature that [included] votes from our Apple Music editorial teams across the world,” she adds, “as well as a range of other expert opinions — musicians, songwriters, producers, managers and music journalists.” As for the Tokyo studio, “Japan is such an important market for us, and bringing an Apple Music Radio studio online there expanded our Apple Music Studio network to seven studio spaces worldwide.”


Andy Sloan-VincentHead of global music programsManuela WurmHead of global editorialKossy NgHead of music, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and TaiwanJungJoo ParkHead of music, Korea, Spotify


	Spotify has been leaning into superfan communities more, and this past year, the company's work with South Korean boy band Seventeen illustrates that determination to “build deeper connections with their fans around the world,” as Park puts it. That included a first-ever countdown page and listening parties in Indonesia, as well as in-person fan experiences at the group's shows in Seoul; New York; Tokyo; Manila, Philippines; and Jakarta, Indonesia, among others. “It was an incredible journey that not only brought fans closer to the group,” Park says, “but also helped boost their global presence and streaming numbers on Spotify.”


The music business today in a word: “If we had to sum up the music business today in two words, they'd be ‘innovative' and ‘ever-evolving,' ” Park says. “The industry is rapidly embracing new technologies, and we're seeing a surge in artist-driven content that ­pushes creative boundaries.”


Rebecca AllenPresident, audience and media division, Universal Music U.K.


	Universal Music U.K. combined its leading labels under Island EMI Label Group and Polydor Label Group last year and launched an audience and media division helmed by Allen to work across artists and labels. She will ­continue collaborating with some of the acts she aided in her former EMI role alongside Jo Charrington, including English singer Olivia Dean. Allen describes Dean as “the definition of a world-class artist,” noting, “We saw just how hard Olivia and her manager, Emily [Braham], worked to connect with audiences beyond the U.K. Her Coachella and Glastonbury moments, for me, were a huge highlight in 2024.”


Biggest issue now: “The lack of funding for the arts in schools. Our pipeline of talent into this industry, into the creative industries, will be decimated without a real investment into young people and creativity. The funding crisis for the arts in schools needs to be addressed, and as an industry, we must step up and play a role in this.”


Tricia ArnoldExecutive vp of global artist and label services and salesPrashant BahadurChief strategy officer and managing director, Asia, Middle East, and AfricaChris ManningManaging director, U.K. and Europe, The Orchard


	Emphasizing The Orchard's global reach, Arnold points to Japan's YOASOBI playing pivotal shows in the United States, including appearances at the 2024 Coachella and Lollapalooza festivals and a sold-out Radio City Music Hall gig in New York last August. In addition, Mexican superstar Peso Pluma's second album, Exodo, charted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart and had the biggest ever debut for a Mexican artist on Spotify. The Orchard also celebrated the No. 20 debut on the Billboard 200 for Mexico's Tito Double P's Incomodo (the album later peaked at No. 11), BINI becoming the first Filipino winner of best Asia act at the MTV Europe Music Awards and British singer RAYE winning six BRIT Awards, scoring three Grammy noms and putting on show-­stopping performances at the Grammys and Academy Awards.


The music business today in a word: “Global, in the truest sense of the word,” Arnold says.


Bang Si-HyukChairmanJason Jaesang LeeCEO, HYBEJonghyun KahCEO, HYBE Latin AmericaYoung Jae ShinPresident, BigHit MusicYoo Jin OhGM, HYBE 360


	While HYBE boasts an artist roster with BTS (and its members' solo releases), Tomorrow X Together and NewJeans, its global expansion gets a boost from an unlikely source: AI. Supertone, an AI audio company that HYBE acquired in 2023, launched virtual pop group SYNDI8 and enhanced Tomorrow X Together's concert videos with multilingual pronunciation technology. Lee thinks that AI benefits musicians, but its regulation isn't keeping pace with technological advances. “I believe the future of the industry will be shaped by how deliberately and appropriately we design the utilization and regulation of ­technology,” he says.


Biggest issue now: “The music industry as a whole is still undervalued,” Lee says. “A simple calculation reveals this: The hourly cost of streaming is remarkably low compared with other forms of entertainment and services. It affects not only the revenue of companies but also the people who work in the music industry — from creators to the staff on the ground — who aren't being compensated for their true worth.”


Kimberly BedoyaHead of Latin marketing, Roc Nation Distribution


	The recently launched Roc Nation Distribution “has provided a solution for indie artists to distribute their music globally,” Bedoya says. “We've significantly strengthened our international presence through strategic partnerships and collaborations and successfully executed global marketing campaigns for high-profile music artists.” That includes Dominican rapper-singer Yailin La Más Viral, whose viral song “Bing Bong” trended at No. 1 on YouTube across multiple markets, Bedoya says, and “demonstrated our expertise in managing large-scale international initiatives and deepened our relationships with global partners and media platforms across Latin America, Europe and North America.”


The music business today in a word: “Innovative. The music business today is transforming, driven by rapid technological advances, new platforms and the shift of consumer behaviors.”


Louis BloomPresident, Island EMI Label Group, Universal Music U.K.


	Not even halfway through 2025, Bloom already calls it “Chappell Roan's year.” After Roan picked up two BRIT Awards in March, her song “Pink Pony Club” ruled the Official Singles Chart in the United Kingdom for two weeks, “proving that Chappell's music is utterly timeless,” he adds. Meanwhile, Roan's 2023 album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, has spent 41 weeks in the top 10 on the Official Albums Chart. Bloom says “another remarkable achievement” is the Wicked soundtrack breaking “the U.K. chart record for the longest consecutive reign at No. 1 on the Official Compilations Chart, staying on top for an unprecedented 16 weeks.”


The music business today in a word: “Three words: relentless yet edifying.”


Alec BoatengPresident, 0207 Def Jam, Universal Music U.K.


	Last summer, veteran electronic duo Chase & Status and rapper Stormzy teamed up for “Backbone,” which hit No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart in the United Kingdom. “Seeing this song [a joint release with EMI] have international reach is amazing, and obviously, the fact it was such a huge No. 1 in the U.K. is something we're really proud of,” Boateng says. “Given the range of choices facing an artist nowadays,” he continues, 0207 Def Jam is focused on providing “bespoke individual services of quality to each artist that we work with.” In the music industry now, “everyone has a different time in which the moment happens,” according to Boateng. “And patience is required for those who take a longer time to get there.”


The music business today in a word: “Unpredictable.”


Joseph ChangCo-CEO, Kakao EntertainmentDaniel JangDmitry YJ TakCo-CEOs, SM Entertainment


	“Over the past few months, Kakao Entertainment has solidified its position as a key player in the K-pop scene,” Chang says. Finding a new twist on the K-pop model, Kakao's joint venture with SM Entertainment launched a five-member British boy band, dearALICE, which reached No. 2 on the U.K. Official Physical Singles Chart with its debut single, “Ariana.” Both companies had successful world tours, too. Kakao's IVE staged its first large-scale world tour and played to 420,000 fans in 28 cities across the globe, according to SM. SM's aespa did its second world tour from June 2024 to March 2025, staging 43 concerts in 28 cities.


The music business today in a word: “ ‘Boundary-breaking' is the word that best describes today's music industry,” Chang says. “The industry is no longer hemmed in by walls of language, nationality, platform or genre.”


Jo CharringtonPresident, Capitol Records, Universal Music U.K.Kieran ThurgoodExecutive vp of global marketing, Capitol Music Group


	Working closely with U.S. labels — Capitol, Island and Mercury — has paid off in breaking U.K. artists stateside, Charrington says, as evidenced by the success of DJ-producer Sammy Virji. “Sammy played Coachella [in April] and is set to play two dates at Brooklyn Mirage in June,” Charrington says, adding that British neo-soul singer Olivia Dean is touring the United States and opening for Sabrina Carpenter at Madison Square Garden in New York in October. For Thurgood, global campaigns for songs by Good Neighbours, Quavo & Lana Del Rey, Ice Spice and Troye Sivan have all yielded global hits, as well as his team's work on the meteoric ascent of Doechii, whose latest hit, “Anxiety,” just topped the global Spotify charts, “with 70% of consumption originating outside the U.S.,” he says.


Biggest issue now: “Pointedly, achieving optimal success for our artists and portfolio of labels fundamentally relies on aggressively, but authentically, driving and harnessing the power of superfandom,” Thurgood says.


Brianne DeslippeSenior vp of marketing, Big Loud Records


	At Big Loud, “we scaled our international business rapidly this year with aggressive global marketing efforts, promotional events, creative social and digital campaigns, multiformat radio No. 1s and nearly 250 tour dates and festivals,” Deslippe says. Morgan Wallen's One Night at a Time World Tour spanned 10 countries and 87 shows, while other Big Loud artists including Stephen Wilson Jr., Dylan Gossett, Ashley Cooke, Charles Wesley Godwin and Kashus Culpepper experienced growth in global market reception, driving surges in streaming and audience numbers. Still, Deslippe says of the obstacles in marketing rising talents, “Discoverability is a constant challenge as new artists fight for attention in overcrowded spaces.”


The music business today in a word: “Evolving.”


Sipho DlaminiPresident/managing director, gamma.


	Dlamini and his team signed over 35 distribution deals across Africa and the Middle East, establishing the company's presence in the latter region by producing Steve Harvey's Open Fire Food Festival in collaboration with BET Africa. He also A&R'd a remixed track by Tamela Mann by bringing in South African amapiano/3-step producer Mörda. They also opened gamma.'s first office in Lagos, Nigeria, offering full label services and local representation for its distribution platform Vydia, and formed strategic partnerships with Sol Generation (Kenya's leading label, owned by Sauti Sol) and Gallo Music Group (South Africa's oldest and largest independent label).


The music business today in a word: “Confused.”


Denzyl FeigelsonCo-founder/CEO, Platoon


	Last year, Platoon, the Apple-owned artist services, A&R and music distribution company, increased its efforts to provide career-boosting services to acts worldwide by delving into the classical world. These efforts paid off in November, when the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Gustavo Dudamel's Fandango album featuring violinist Anne Akiko Meyers and composer Arturo Márquez won two classical categories at the Latin Grammy Awards, and again in February, when Gabriela Ortiz's Revolución Diamantina with Dudamel and the L.A. Phil spotlighting violinist María Dueñas took home an unprecedented three Grammy Awards, including best orchestral performance.


Biggest issue now: “There are of course multiple issues and, in turn, opportunities,” Feigelson says. “One that is top of mind is the perception of quick overnight success versus career development.”


Arthur FitzgibbonManaging director, BrazilAndrés López-QuirogaExecutive vp of business development, Latin Iberia, ONErpm


	“ONErpm has continued to grow and establish itself as a modern label for artists at various stages of their careers,” including local, international and global acts, “demonstrating that our global structure, technology and flexible deal structures benefit both artists and the current industry landscape,” López-Quiroga says. He points to international success with hits like Chance Peña and Andres Castro's “Vaquero Vaquero,” Chimbala's “Che Che,” Brytiago's “Kilerito” and emerging artist Alejo. “Our ability to rapidly adapt to the evolving industry landscape — leveraging our technology, global and organizational structures — and flexible deal structures,” he adds, “has enabled ONErpm to increase its global market share while maintaining a top five position in various markets worldwide.”


The music business today in a word: “Ever-changing,” López-Quiroga says.


Kenny GatesCo-founder/CEO, [PIAS]


	In October last year, [PIAS] co-founder/CEO Gates and co-founder Michel Lambot sold their remaining shares of the indie label group to Universal Music Group to support their dream of offering truly global distribution services to the independent music community. Six months later, Gates says the partnership has allowed [PIAS] to retain its autonomy and core values while becoming “an added dimension in the UMG ecosystem,” as [PIAS] has continued to demonstrate its commitment to artists through recent successes like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' new album, Wild God, and the breakout success of controversial Irish hip-hop act Kneecap.


Biggest issue now: “Getting access to media and to engaged audiences for truly great and passionate artists is becoming harder and harder as the DSPs and the market generally become ever more overwhelmed with the sheer volume of mediocrity clogging the system.”


Jonas HaentjesCEO, Edel


	One of the biggest independent music companies in Europe, Edel owns several labels (earMUSIC, dance-focused Kontor Records), a sizable vinyl pressing plant (Optimal Media, which also manufactures CDs, DVDs and books) and a distribution operation. Last year, sales were down 7.7% overall, but with a 3.2% increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and strong growth in digital distribution, balanced by a stable manufacturing business. The vinyl business suffers from overcapacity, but “everyone knows us, everyone trusts us, and we're trying to push our process further,” Haentjes says.


Biggest issue now: “We really need to watch out with what we allow the AI companies to do.”


Tor HansenCo-founder/executive, RedeyePelle ErikssonManaging director, Border Music/Redeye


	As leaders of the Swedish indie distributor Redeye, Hansen and Eriksson have spent the past year streamlining how music from their global label partners reaches fans around the world — from physical products at retailers to DSPs — and focusing on products delivered to stores in Scandinavia. “We have intensified our efforts on spreading the news, and the music, from local independent labels we work with throughout the world,” Eriksson says. “The key to keep the physical part of the industry alive and well is to continue to offer quality products, vinyl and CD — at fair prices, all to keep the record-buying public happy.”


The music business today in a word: “For the Scandinavia market, I would say, ‘Steady,' ” Eriksson says. “For Border's international releases, I would say, ‘Growing.' ”


Paul HitchmanCOOBen AkinbolaHead of growth, AWAL


	“Last year, marquee AWAL artists like Jungle [in the United Kingdom] and The Beaches [in Canada] — winners of group of the year honors at the BRIT Awards and Juno Awards, respectively — reached new heights in their careers internationally. Building off those international successes, we now also have local artists charting on every inhabitable continent, with a presence on the ground in over 15 markets,” Akinbola says, pointing to successes in South Africa with Yanga Chief, the Philippines with Zae and India with Loka. “All of our successes are ultimately the combination of AWAL's unique model for artist development, our partnership with local Sony Music teams in growth markets and, most importantly, an incredible roster of independent artists who continuously push creative boundaries.”


The music business today in a word: “Democratization,” Akinbola says.


Ed HowardBriony TurnerCo-presidents, Atlantic Records U.K.Samantha StrumDirector of global marketing, Atlantic Records


	Thanks to the campaign waged by Charli xcx and Atlantic, 2024 became known in multiple markets as the year of Brat Summer. “We helped to define culture,” Howard says of the campaign's bright green aesthetic that “took over everything from fashion, sports, U.S. politics and beyond.” He adds, “Charli is a great example of a long-term artist development. Having signed with Atlantic at just 15, she's had the time and backing to develop with artistic freedom, pushing the boundaries of alternative pop.” Looking ahead, Turner is excited about the U.K. signings of Kingfishr and Yaelokre, plus artist Alex Warren, whose “Ordinary” hit No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart in the United Kingdom.


Biggest issue now: “We increasingly face challenges in maintaining and expanding our [U.K.] export reach due to a combination of political, economic and competitive factors,” Howard says.


Manu KaushishPresident of international, Create Music Group


	In June 2024, Create Music Group reached a significant milestone when it received a $160 million investment from Chicago-based private equity firm Flexpoint Ford. The move elevated CMG to “unicorn” status after getting a $1 billion valuation. The capital allowed CMG to acquire the catalogs of deadmau5 and his label, mau5trap. Founded in 2015, CMG includes marketing agency Flighthouse and independent music distribution platform Engine Label, which handled Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's Billboard 200 No. 1 Vultures 1. “We are poised for continued aggressive expansion in 2025, empowering and onboarding even more international artists and labels,” Kaushish says.


Biggest issue now: “How to adequately and fairly compensate music creators in a world of ever-changing streaming royalties and algorithms, especially with the dominance and power that DSPs and their stakeholders have right now.”


Joe KentishPresident, Warner Records U.K.Luke ArmitageSenior vp of global marketing, Warner Records (Export Marketing)


	Warner Records delivered a strong performance in the United Kingdom and globally in 2024. Dua Lipa and Coldplay headlined Glastonbury, which was streamed worldwide for the first time. With Radical Optimism, Lipa also attained “massive global success with [over] 3 billion streams and a sold-out global tour,” while Coldplay's Moon Music “became the fastest-selling album of 2024 by a British act,” Kentish says. Also of note: Linkin Park's From Zero comeback album notched No. 1 debuts in multiple countries including the United Kingdom, Australia and France; Benson Boone landed a No. 1 on the U.K. Official Singles Chart with “Beautiful Things”; and Teddy Swims ushered in 2025 with his first No. 1 album in Australia, I've Tried Everything but Therapy (Part 2).


Biggest issue now: “On a broader level, it's the decoupling of artists and their narratives from their songs,” Kentish says. “The way music is consumed today makes it increasingly challenging to tell important new stories through those channels.”


Lyn KoppeExecutive vp of global catalogCharlie StanfordSenior vp of international, commercial music group, Sony Music Entertainment


	Sony Music's global catalog team is “truly exceptional and inspiring,” says Koppe, who manages the expansive Legacy Recordings/Sony Music catalog. “With the privilege of overseeing some of the most iconic music from the last 100-plus years, our team focuses on innovating, sharing learnings and developing best practices among countries as trusted collaborators.” Meanwhile, Stanford says his purview across all of Sony Music's international catalog continued to expand thanks to several of the company's major acquisitions. “As always,” Koppe adds, “our passion for music, our artists and their fans remains the top priority guiding our strategies around the world.”


Biggest issue now: “Fans have a lot of choice,” Stanford says, “so from a catalog perspective, we must focus on developing unique and authentic ways to cut through and help audiences discover decades of incredible music from around the world.”


Ben LarsenExecutive vp of international, Interscope Geffen A&M


	“Being given license to reimagine how we develop artist careers globally and how we do business around the world has meant that my team and I are able to evolve the partnerships with our UMG affiliates to greater effect,” Larsen says. That freedom played an integral role in paving a two-way-street — creative and execution — that delivered “amazing results” over the last year. As examples, Larsen cites Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar and Playboi Carti, who had “some of the biggest global rollouts in years, topping album and singles charts.” Then to also see Gracie Abrams “break through with a huge No. 1 single [“That's So True”] all over the world is exciting,” Larsen adds, “and sets the tone for what's to come.”


The music business today in a word: “Relentless.”


Federico LauriaFounder/CEO, Dale Play


	The Argentina-based company made impressive gains across its divisions: Dale Play Management, Dale Play Records and Dale Play Live. On the management side, Lauria's marquee client Duki became the first rapper — and only Argentine artist — to sell out Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Meanwhile, Lauria says Dale Play Live sold over 1 million tickets in Argentina alone during 2024, promoting shows for global acts Travis Scott and Karol G, to name a few. Furthermore, Dale Play Records — home to artists like Cazzu and Paulo Londra — and Bad Bunny's Rimas Entertainment teamed for a strategic alliance, “playing a key role in developing and amplifying a new wave of Spanish-language urban music around the world,” Lauria adds.


The music business today in a word: “Passion. At least in Dale Play, that's our engine. It's what drives every risk, every idea and every action. Without it, nothing else works.”


Nando LuacesFounder/CEO, Altafonte


	Since Sony Music Group's acquisition of Altafonte in January 2024, “we continue to operate independently but have all the financial capacity and know-how to grow in a very competitive and dynamic market,” Luaces says. On industry challenges, Luaces emphasizes adapting to technological advances: “AI and the challenge of how to be fair in royalty payments for streaming is the problem of today, and we must solve it,” he says. “In order to have a prosperous and larger business, we continue to adapt to changes and technological advances, as has been the history of music for the last 130 years.”


The music business today in a word: “Acceptance. Accept that the world is unstable and changing. Anything can happen.”


Roni Maltz BinFounder/CEO, Sua Música Group


	Brazilian indie distributor Sua, known for its focus on independent regional artists, has now begun its “international expansion into the Latin market,” Maltz Bin says, noting that the company has plans to launch labels in key territories including Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico in the next 24 months. In December, Sua opened a recording studio and urban music label Único Música in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for emerging talent. The ­company also hired its first A&R executive in Medellín, Colombia, with plans to launch a label there. “There has never been a time with so many opportunities in the music industry for artists, producers, labels, record companies and entrepreneurs,” Maltz Bin says. “We are living in the golden era of the music business.”


Biggest issue now: “The two biggest challenges are the rise of AI-powered tools and the increasing amount of artificial streaming and fraud.”


Martin MillsChairmanPaul ReddingCOOBrandon BeckerGlobal vp of streaming, Beggars GroupJean-Philippe AlineGM, Beggars FranceBen BeardsworthManaging director, XL RecordingsCaius PawsonFounder, Young


	In 2024, XL Recordings worked closely with The Smile, as well as DJ Peggy Gou. “(It Goes Like) Nanana,” Gou's debut release for XL, topped singles charts around the globe ahead of the 2024 release of her acclaimed solo album, I Hear You. Mills is particularly proud of how Beggars Group also helped take Irish band Fontaines D.C. “to the next level.” Last September, the band made its Billboard 200 debut with its fourth album, Romance (released on XL Recordings), which peaked at No. 2 on the U.K. Official Albums Chart. Meanwhile, lead single “Starburster” became a top 20 hit on the Alternative and Triple A airplay charts. As Mills says, “It was a major global success story that we are all very proud of.”


Biggest issue: “The biggest issue is money,” Mills says. “Commerce and art have always been uncomfortable bedfellows, never more so than now.”


Ben MortimerPresident, Polydor Label Group, Universal Music U.K.


	Mortimer's focus over the last year was “integrating the incredible artist rosters and executive talent at Capitol Records and 0207 Def Jam into the Polydor world.” He says, “It's gone remarkably smoothly, which is a testament to all involved.” Polydor star Sam Fender also released his People Watching album, which channels classic heartland rock; it hit the top of the U.K. Official Albums Chart with 107,000 chart units — the biggest opening week for a British solo act since 2022. Fender will play select stadium shows in the United Kingdom this summer.


Biggest issue now: “Vying for attention amid the breadth of music from around the world. However, the U.K. has always punched above its weight creatively, and I feel we are on the cusp of a new wave of breakthrough British talent.”


Suhel NafarManaging director of West Asia and North AfricaJeffrey YooSenior vp of East AsiaTaeko SaitoSenior vp of business development and strategies, Asia Pacific, EMPIRE


	“EMPIRE has made significant strides in bridging global music markets, fostering cross-cultural collaborations and amplifying diverse voices,” including a “strong foundation in the African music scene,” Nafar says, citing as an example Moroccan rapper Dada and Sudanese rapper Soulja recording an Arabic remix of Los Angeles rapper 310babii's 2024 Rhythmic Airplay No. 1 breakout hit, “Soak City (Do It).” And signing some of the biggest acts in South Korea and Southeast Asia like K-pop icon G-Dragon has further cemented “EMPIRE's reputation as a key player in shaping the future of the global music industry,” he adds.


Biggest issue now: “Instead of merely capitalizing on what performs well in the data,” Nafar says, “the industry must do better in nurturing and developing talent, ensuring that artistry and innovation remain at the heart of the music business.”


Donny NovakovicVp of international marketing, Disney Music Group


	“This year, we brought our storytelling passion to life with exciting global soundtrack campaigns for two highly anticipated films, Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King,” Novakovic says, adding that last year, Disney made the soundtracks available in 29 languages, “ensuring that the magic of these stories reaches cultures worldwide.” Earlier in 2025, the company introduced the soundtrack to Disney's Snow White, “a captivating addition to our repertoire that continues to celebrate the timeless tales that have inspired generations,” he says. Novakovic also notes the momentum of pop trio almost monday, which wrapped a sold-out 19-city headlining run through Europe.


	The music business today in a word “Abundant — overflowing with creativity, talent and opportunity across a constantly expanding global landscape.”


Jamie OborneFounder, Dirty Hit


	Oborne says that Dirty Hit — the home of a diverse indie-­leaning stable of acts, including The 1975, Bleachers, beabadoobee and Saya Gray — spent the past year expanding its global reach with international partnerships and placement on live and digital platforms in different countries. “One highlight has been our efforts in expanding into emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America, where we've seen a growing fan base for our artists,” Oborne says. “Through these initiatives, we have strengthened our international business relationships by pushing our artists into new territories and enabling them to connect with a wider audience than ever before.”


Biggest issue now: The streaming model “heavily favors large corporations and major labels, leaving independent artists and smaller labels with a much smaller share of the revenue. As a result, there's an ongoing need for fairer revenue-sharing models, better protection for intellectual property and more support for independent artists to ensure the sustainability of the industry.”


OlamideFounder/CEO, YBNL Nation


	“YBNL Nation has made significant strides in expanding our global footprint and solidifying our presence in key international markets,” says artist Olamide, who also runs his own company. Asake sold out London's O2 Arena for the second time in September 2024, becoming the third Nigerian artist after Davido and Wizkid to sell out the venue multiple times, according to YBNL Nation. The show was held a month after he released his third album, Lungu Boy, which included collaborations with Travis Scott (“Active” hit No. 1 on Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs), U.K. artists Central Cee and Stormzy and Brazil's Ludmilla. “MMS” (featuring Wizkid) earned Asake his second Grammy nomination for best African music performance. “Collaborations with international artists and producers have helped bridge the gap between Afrobeats and other genres,” he adds, “further establishing our label as a key player in the global music scene.”


The music business today in a word: “Disruptive.”


Alejandra OleaManaging director, Americas, BelieveAndreea GleesonCEO, TuneCoreRomain VivienGlobal head of music/president of Europe, Believe


	Believe, and subsidiary TuneCore, represent “artists and labels across every genre in local markets all around the world,” Vivien says — including about 50 artists who were either nominated for or won awards at some two dozen awards ceremonies worldwide, according to the company. Its strategy of working with local independent labels and producers led to deals with legendary Punjabi label White Hill Music, Krumolo in Southeast Asia and the launch of Playcode, Believe's first local hip-hop imprint. Rising stars that charted internationally in 2024 include Canada's Cheema Y, Germany's Lacazette and Japan's ¥ellow Bucks and Red Eye.


The music business today in a word: “Dynamic,” Vivien says. “This is true across every area of the industry, around how music is created, discovered, consumed and then redefined. This has been powered by the increasing digitalization, which allows for more creation, faster and wider distribution to reach audiences more directly and accurately and for a wider and more diverse artist community.”


Maykel PironCo-founder/CEO, Armada Music Group


	For over 20 years, Armada Music co-founder/CEO Piron has remained a driving force in electronic dance music, especially for independent artists. With teams across the United States and sections of Europe, Armada Music Group has been focused on international expansion. The company has expanded its publishing division and doubled the size of its London office. “With teams strategically positioned across Europe, the U.K. and the U.S.,” Piron says, “we're able to operate synergistically across markets, providing comprehensive global support for our artists.”


Biggest issue now: “With an overwhelming number of releases dropping each week, cutting through the noise is more challenging than ever, especially in electronic music. Labels must collaborate closely with their artists to tailor strategies specific to their needs — a one-size-fits-all approach simply doesn't cut it.”


Jeff RemediosPresident of strategic developmentMike AlexanderExecutive vp of global marketing strategy, REPUBLIC CollectiveSteven RowenSenior vp of global marketing strategy, Island RecordsZoe BriggsVp of global marketing strategy, Republic Records/Mercury RecordsMyra deCastro-YournettVp of international marketing, Republic Records/Def Jam Recordings


	Alexander says 2024 was “a massive year” for REPUBLIC Collective thanks to artists such as The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Noah Kahan. Last year's highlights include Carpenter's Short n' Sweet debuting at No. 1 in 15 countries and moving 10 million units globally, according to REPUBLIC, as well as her becoming the first non-British artist to win the global success trophy at the 2025 BRIT Awards. Plus, Roan won best international artist and song at the 2025 BRITs, Kahan's “Stick Season” became the year's No. 1 single in the United Kingdom and the Wicked soundtrack broke the record for longest consecutive No. 1 reign on the U.K. Official Compilations Chart.


Biggest issue now: “I don't see them as issues as much as I see them as opportunities,” Alexander says. “There are so many untapped audiences around the world that we're just starting to reach.”


Kaiya SarkisGM, SALXCO UAM


	Sarkis says SALXCO UAM takes “pride in breaking Arabic music, culture and sound globally” since CEO Wassim “Sal” Slaiby founded the label in 2021. Palestinian-Chilean pop star Elyanna, who made history at Coachella in 2023 by becoming the first artist to perform an entire set in Arabic, made her TV debut on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in May 2024. In October, she joined Coldplay alongside Argentine actress-singer-songwriter TINI to perform “We Pray” — which became Elyanna's first Billboard Hot 100 entry, peaking at No. 87 — during the band's Saturday Night Live gig. “Our records have also made their mark on U.S. and global charts, including Nancy Ajram, Saint Levant and more,” she adds, “further solidifying our commitment to making a lasting impact and expanding the reach of Arabic music worldwide.”


Ed ScottHead of international label and artist marketingOlukorede “Kay” IkazobohCountry manager, NigeriaAmit SharmaCountry manager, IndiaLiza FuadyRegional director, Southeast Asia, Virgin Music Group


	In October 2024, Virgin Music Group expanded its global reach after acquiring Outdustry, known for its artist and label services and rights management across China, India and other large-growth markets. Outdustry founder Ed Peto joined Virgin as senior vp of international strategy. Along with that acquisition, Virgin also scored wins with its Nigerian division. According to Ikazoboh, Virgin Music Nigeria invested more in homegrown ventures such as Dapper Entertainment and Rain Labs in Ghana, with the latter yielding impressive wins, including a Ghana Music Awards nomination for best hip-hop song from local artist Joey B.


Biggest issue now: “The ongoing struggle for fair and sustainable monetization,” Ikazoboh says. “While streaming has revolutionized access to music, revenue structures remain disproportionately skewed in favor of platforms rather than the creators themselves. For African artists and local music companies, this challenge is compounded by limited financial infrastructure, difficulties in collecting royalties across multiple territories and the need for greater industrywide transparency.”


Adriana SeinGlobal head of artist and market development, ADAHoward CornerManaging director, ADA U.K.Cesar LoresManaging director/head of EU A&R, ADA IberiaBen RalphManaging director, ADA AustralasiaNikoo SadrVp of international services and business development, ADA Nordics


	ADA, the global independent music distribution and artist services division of Warner Music Group, spent the last year-and-a-half focused on growth in key markets. In Latin America, ADA invested in Brazil's Sua Música Group and Venezuealan band Rawayana earned its first U.S. and Latin Grammy wins. In the United Kingdom, ADA renewed its partnership with Sonny Fodera, whose hit track “Somedays” was the country's biggest-selling independent single of the year, according to ADA U.K. In Southeast Asia, ADA deepened its collaboration with DPM, one of Indonesia's largest music companies, and forged a new deal with GMM Music, the region's largest independent label. Plus, Norwegian star Emma Steinbakken won artist of the year at awards show P3 Gull and held the No. 1 spot on local radio for several weeks.


Biggest issue now: “We need to keep up with how rapidly technology is evolving the way fans discover and consume music,” Sein says.


Per SundinCEO, Pophouse Entertainment


	In March, Pophouse announced that it had raised over 1 billion euros ($1.1 million) to invest in music rights. The company already has made deals with acts including KISS, Cyndi Lauper, Avicii and Swedish House Mafia. “The Avicii documentary I'm Tim, which premiered on New Year's Eve 2024, was met with an overwhelmingly positive response, and we have several projects cooking on all of our catalogs with our fantastic artists,” Sundin says. “Our production leg is also thriving. ABBA Voyage — the avatar show expanding the legacy of a globally beloved band, and in which we are funding investors — has sold over 3 million tickets in under three years since being launched in May 2022. And Mamma Mia! The Party continues to sell out shows in London, Stockholm and Rotterdam [Netherlands].”


The music business today in a word: “Essential. And it always has been. Throughout history, during times of political chaos or uncertainty, music and entertainment have been a lifeline.”


Darius van ArmanCEOTom DaviesDirector of global marketing and campaigns, Secretly DistributionAli MurphySenior international marketing director, Secretly Group


	The Secretly Group of labels and Secretly Distribution have been focused on fostering “key markets while working global campaigns, a recent highlight being Grammy-nominated Khruangbin's A La Sala, which hit the top 10 across multiple European markets,” Murphy says. While the company is predominantly American, she notes that it is gaining solid footing in a number of international markets with albums or singles from Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski and Bon Iver “going gold in the U.K. in the past 12 to 18 months; a true testament to the quality of artists we work with and the teams we've built internationally.”


Biggest issue now: “Secretly is an artist-first company, and while we need to make sure to be pulling all the levers, we're also dealing with real people — artists and fans,” Murphy says. “So it's about striking a balance between authenticity, efficiency and creating unique moments that feel true to the artist and to which fans can connect.”


Pieter van RijnCEO, Downtown MusicRenato VanzellaGM of Latin AmericaLiz NortheastSenior vp of Europe, Middle East and Asia, FUGARaymond TapiaVp of A&R, Latin, Downtown artist and label services


	Downtown Music CEO van Rijn says this year's awards season was a “testament to the remarkable global talent we have the privilege of supporting.” Downtown reports that its artists and writers were involved with more than one-third of this year's Grammy winners and garnered six wins at the Latin Grammys, while its publishing clients won 13 honors at the BMI Latin Awards. Successes came from FUGA client and Th3rd Brain artist Zerb, who topped Spotify's and Shazam's dance charts; Froukje, with the most streamed and best-selling Dutch album of 2024; and Netón Vega, a Peso Pluma collaborator whose debut album, Mi Vida Mi Muerte, hit No. 19 on the Billboard 200.


Biggest issue now: “Striking a balance between embracing innovation while building robust frameworks that protect rights holders and ensure long-term value for artists, songwriters and music businesses is key,” van Rijn says.


Dan WaiteCEO, Better Noise Music


	Better Noise has long been one of the most dominant labels in mainstream rock, topping the Mainstream Rock Airplay Labels year-end chart for the third time this decade in 2024, while also claiming the top song (Nothing More's “If It Doesn't Hurt”) by the group Nothing More. Waite sees Better Noise as well-positioned to take advantage of streaming-era globalization, as evidenced by its success with Mongolian rockers The Hu. “The music industry today has never had a greater global opportunity for music inclusion and consumption across platforms, technology, communities,” he says. “The music taste palate of the world has evolved, and this gives rise to the next breakthrough band being from anywhere.”


Biggest issue now: “There is still only 24 hours in a day, and the music business faces headwinds from attention-competing alternatives for people's time, lack of fair compensation for prior work from AI tech, the squeeze at the new-creator level by thresholds on payment and lack of truly independent distributor routes to market.”


Benjamin BuddeCEO, Budde Music


	Over the past decade, Budde Music has expanded from its roots as a music publisher into talent management, concert promotion and the agency business. So in 2024 the company hired Maximilian Paproth to run its German publishing business and global A&R, freeing CEO Budde to drive further growth. The big creative win for the company — the biggest publisher in Germany after the majors and BMG — was celebrating the 40th anniversary of Alphaville's “Forever Young.” Budde partners with Warner Music Group on the act's recordings and ­publishes its songs globally. Its campaign sent the song to No. 1 on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 list and a David Guetta remix with singer Ava Max to No. 2 on Hot Dance/Electronic Songs.


Nestor CasonuPresident of Latin AmericaStephane BerlowManaging director of FranceSimon MoorManaging director of Asia-PacificFrederica WongDirector of AsiaSwantje WeinertSenior vp/head of A&R for Germany, Switzerland and Austria, Kobalt


	“We've seen significant growth and success across our international operations,” Casonu says, pointing to Kobalt Music Publishing's win for contemporary Latin publisher of the year at the 2025 BMI Latin Awards. (The ­publisher reports that it represents at least part of seven of the genre's most performed songs in 2024.) “This was a huge milestone for Kobalt and something we are very proud of,” he says. “Our regional Mexican catalog continues to evolve. This year alone, we have officially signed Pedro Tovar of Eslabon Armado, Kartel Music, Hitkidz, Kevin Kaarl, Ana Bárbara and many more.” Meanwhile, in Asia, Kobalt has secured partnerships with Tencent and NetEase, as well as setting up licensing frameworks for streaming video on demand.


Biggest issue now: “Artificial intelligence is definitely the biggest issue we face,” Casonu says. “AI poses a significant threat due to the lack of regulations or a cohesive plan to control its use within our industry at this moment.”


Justin DowlingExecutive vp of U.K. and Europe, Primary Wave; director, Blue Mountain Music


	The release of the biographical screen drama Bob Marley: One Love early in 2024 reenergized the catalog of the pioneering Jamaican reggae artist, Dowling says, creating one of the past year's most notable spikes for the company's roster. Marley's catalog reaching billion-stream status was a huge win for Primary Wave, he says. “We waited a long time for it, and aided by the very successful One Love biopic, we achieved this for not one but two songs in the catalog in 2024.”


Biggest issue now: “Music should be cohesive. It should unite us, not divide us. So I am a smidge concerned about where the next stadium-filling act is going to come from that will draw in folks from across all generations and divides.”


Kim FrankiewiczExecutive vp of worldwide A&R, Concord Music PublishingTina FunkManaging director, Concord Music Publishing Germany, Switzerland and AustriaJaime GoughManaging director, Concord Australia and New Zealand


	For Frankiewicz, 2024 was a year that “really demonstrated the global blend and reach” of Concord's roster. “While homegrown in the U.K., the global sensation that is [Charli xcx's] brat is truly unmatched,” she says. “It's been thrilling to be a part of a cultural phenomenon and work with Grammy-winning executive producer A. G. Cook, as well as other contributors from our roster like George Daniel of The 1975, Julian Casablancas and more.” After diligently curating and developing a roster of writers and producers around the globe in a variety of genres, Concord found success with producer Sammy Soso's work with South Africa's Tyla, as well as Thai superstar and Blackpink member Lisa, co-writing multiple songs on her breakout solo album, Alter Ego.


Biggest issue now: “One of the biggest issues facing songwriters and publishers is the continually low royalty rates from streaming,” Frankiewicz says.


Shani GonzalesManaging director, Warner Chappell Music U.K.; head of international A&R, Warner Chappell MusicNatascha AugustinManaging director, Warner Chappell Music GermanyGustavo MenendezPresident, U.S. Latin and Latin AmericaSantiago Menendez-PidalPresident, Southern EuropeArica NgPresident, Asia Pacific, Warner Chappell MusicMatthieu TessierManaging director, Warner Chappell Music France


	Warner Chappell Music had a fabulous year across all of its territories. Gonzales says she's especially proud of ­signee Daniel Blumberg, who took home an Academy Award and a BRIT Award for his score for The Brutalist; producer P2J for his work on recent Burna Boy and Wizkid tracks; RAYE and Jon Shave for their abilities to “grow from strength to strength … with cuts across the globe”; and Amy Allen's Grammy songwriter of the year win. Allen's co-writes had a combined 11 straight weeks at No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart in 2024 and 2025. “This win is massive in addressing the lack of recognition for songwriters,” Gonzales says.


Biggest issue now: “The need to respect U.K. copyright law and not let AI companies trade on music without permission,” Gonzales says. “The Make It Fair [campaign] was a great show of strength from the U.K. industry and goes to show just how big an issue it really is.”


David GrayManaging director, U.K./head of global A&RAlexandra LioutikoffPresident of Latin America and U.S. LatinThomas VidovicManaging director of Germany/senior vp of Austria and SwitzerlandYadira MorenoManaging director of Mexico and Central America/vp of new business development, Latin AmericaAna Rosa SantiagoSenior vp of Latin music, Universal Music Publishing Group


	Since UMPG's 2022 launch of its Global Creative Groups — a team of worldwide A&R executives that expand creative opportunities for songwriters across different markets — the major publisher has found multiple ways to use its globe-spanning offices as a competitive advantage. “Whether you're talking about the music, the artists or the business side, the reality is that geographical boundaries are less significant than ever,” Lioutikoff says. In the last year, her team earned the ASCAP Latin publisher of the year award and celebrated signings and renewals with some of the best writers and artists in the region, including Carín León, Carla Morrison, Gerardo Coronel, Icon, Telefe, Babasónicos, Grupo Firme, Jorge Mexia, Deolli, JAO and JotaPé. “[It's] another hugely successful year,” Lioutikoff says.


Biggest issue now: “We are constantly fighting for our writers' work to be properly valued and fairly compensated,” Lioutikoff says. “The globalization of Latin music is obvious, and we want the monetization to match.”


Ben KatovskyCEO, Recognition Music Group


	It's been a busy few months for Katovsky and his team at Recognition Music Group, the newly rebranded company formerly known as Hipgnosis. Katovsky took over the helm of the catalog giant last year from its founder, Merck Mercuriadis, and is hard at work to reestablish the company after a roller-coaster year that led to Blackstone acquiring its public fund for $1.6 billion. Now Recognition is pivoting to become a “selective buyer” of music rights, as Katovsky puts it. “Recognition Music will be a very collaborative player in this space in ways that it was not historically. We want to work with other partners in this industry to do that.”


Biggest issue now: “Creating a legitimate and fully licensed market for generative AI that both embraces innovation and safeguards and stimulates the future of music and investment in music.”


Golnar KhosrowshahiFounder/CEOAnnette BarrettManaging director/global strategic liaison, ReservoirAlison WenhamCOO, Blue Raincoat Music; COO, Chrysalis RecordsJeremy LascellesCo-founder/CEO, Blue Raincoat MusicHussain “Spek” YoosufFounder/CEO, PopArabia; executive vp of international and emerging markets, Reservoir


	“Reservoir's work in emerging markets continues to be a key strategic element of our business,” Khosrowshahi says. The company has been investing heavily through its partnership with PopArabia in the Middle East/North Africa region. One focus has been Egypt, where the company recently completed deals with rappers El Sawareekh, artist Omar Kamal and production/distribution company RE Media. Other deals in the region included Lebanese star Nancy Ajram and her label/publisher, In2Musica, and Saudi Arabian hip-hop label Mashrex.


Biggest issue now: “A lack of transparency continues to plague the industry,” Khosrowshahi says. “We need greater transparency regarding generative AI to ensure concrete copyright protections that yield clarity around, permission for and compensation of [intellectual property] being used to train AI platforms. Second, we need continued greater transparency from DSPs on the royalties paid to publishers and songwriters so we can continue advocating to close the gaps in compensation across the publishing and recorded-music industries.”


Mary Megan PeerCEOElizabeth RoddaPresident of U.S. Latin, Latin America and global society relations, peermusic


	Peermusic continued to expand globally, especially in specific European markets like Poland and Norway. The independent publisher acquired Arctic Rights, Norway's largest indie publisher, and also opened its 40th branch in Poland. “We're expecting growth in both of these territories as a result of our direct presence there,” Peer says. “We've already had our Norwegian writers work with Asian writers in both Seoul and Taiwan and expect these collaborations to continue.” Meanwhile, Rodda, who leads peermusic's Latin American operations, is continuing to build up the company's historically strong presence in the Spanish-speaking world.


Biggest issue now: “Data,” Peer says. “It is the key to getting our writers paid fairly and faster. I'm hopeful that the combination of industry focus and AI computing power will help us attack this challenge.”


Emily StephensonPresident, Downtown Music PublishingThando MakhungaManaging director, Sheer Publishing Africa


	Downtown Music Publishing's songwriters contributed to four 2024 Latin Grammy wins, 13 wins at the 2025 BMI Latin Awards and one ASCAP El Premio Award, according to its own tally. The division also struck global publishing deals in 2024 with Latin superstar Peso Pluma's Double P Records and legendary Italian singer Mina, and “Parade” by Downtown Publishing client and French composer Victor Le Masne became the official theme song for the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games. In addition to helping drive 40% year-over-year growth, Stephenson says these accomplishments helped Downtown achieve “soundtrack global milestones.”


Biggest issue now: “The ongoing fight for fair compensation for songwriters,” Stephenson says. “Despite their role in creating the music that drives the industry, songwriters still face disproportionate earnings compared with the value their work generates.”


David VenturaPresident/co-managing director, U.K./senior vp of internationalTim MajorCo-managing director, U.K.Jorge MejiaPresident/CEO, Latin America and U.S. LatinNasra ArtanHead of international A&RJohnny TennanderManaging director, Scandinavia/senior vp of A&R internationalPatrick StrauchManaging director, Germany, Sony Music Publishing


	To foster the best songwriting around the globe, SMP “places a real emphasis on creative collaboration across territories, with A&R teams working hand in hand with their counterparts on a daily basis,” Artan says. “The focus is truly on creating opportunities for our songwriters beyond their home territories and helping ensure their songs travel.” In the last 12 months, Artan says the company has hosted songwriting camps in locations including Ghana, Spain, Taiwan and South Africa, inviting talent from around the world to connect and collaborate.


Biggest issue now: “The continued existence of traditional ‘buyout' structures in some emerging markets,” Artan says. “In a world where music can go big internationally from day one, it is really important for songwriters and their teams to understand the value of their work and ensure they avoid unintentionally stifling future success and opportunities for a short-term gain up front with these types of deals.”


Siavash AghaiepourTalent agent, HRBooking


	“Over the past year, we've had the opportunity to execute major international tours and expand our global footprint through strategic partnerships,” says Aghaiepour, who has worked with 21 Savage, A$AP Rocky, Cardi B and others. He points to HRBooking's collaborations as an agency and a promoter with companies such as Live Nation and IAG, as well as its support of live events from Coachella and Rolling Loud to Juicy Fest in Australia. The company, which is headquartered in the United Arab Emirates, also secured artist bookings at cultural tentpoles like Fashion Week, the Super Bowl and Formula 1 races. Of the agency, which boasts 30 years in business, Aghaiepour says, “Relationships and loyalty mean everything to us. Our focus is always on doing good, honest business while continuing to grow with integrity and purpose.”


The music industry today in a word: “Fast. The pace of the industry is relentless — from how artists break to how trends shift and content circulates. Things can change overnight, and as a company, we've had to stay nimble, evolve quickly and anticipate the next move.”


Alfredo AlonsoPartner/entertainment directorDaniel MerinoEntertainment manager/promoter, Bizarro Live Entertainment


	Bizarro Live Entertainment promoted some of the most important Latin tours in Chile, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador in the last 18 months. Most notably, Karol G's Mañana Será Bonito two-show stop at Estadio San Marcos in Lima, Peru, and three-show stint in Chile's Estadio Nacional in April 2024 generated more than $25 million in revenue combined. Other key concerts the company ­promoted included Maná, Ha*Ash and Duki, all in both Chile and Peru, as well as Emilia in Chile, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. “We also produce and promote the Viña Del Mar Festival” in Chile, Alonso says, “the most important Latin festival in the world.”


Biggest issue now: “To work and create new spaces and formats for live music in an industry full of concerts,” Alonso says.


Alejandro ArceCEO, Zignia Live


	Zignia Live's operation includes venue management of Mexico's Arena CDMX and Arena Monterrey and live-event production and ticket sales through its proprietary platform Superboletos. The vertical business model helped it sell over 2 million tickets to 250 events in Mexico last year, including more than 20 stadium dates. Standouts include 24 dates and over 500,000 tickets sold for Los Temerarios' Hasta Siempre Tour, including eight sellouts at Arena CDMX. Zignia also promoted 22 dates for icon Luis Miguel, selling 300,000 tickets, and selling out 10 shows at Arena CDMX. Zignia is the official promoter of the NBA in Mexico, where it hosts games by the Boston Celtics, Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls. “Our next challenge is opening Arena Guadalajara,” Arce says. “In addition to promoting shows, we transform experiences.”


Melvin BennManaging director, Festival Republic


	Benn runs Live Nation-owned Festival Republic, one of the leading U.K. festival promotion companies and home to a portfolio of festivals including Reading & Leeds, Latitude, Wireless, Wilderness, The Great Escape and Electric Picnic. The company also hosts shows at outdoor music venues such as Finsbury Park and Gunnersbury Park. Festival Republic's Wireless Festival won best festival at the 2024 Music Week Awards. Meanwhile, Reading & Leeds benefited from continued innovations with a new, 40,000-capacity open-air Chevron dance stage and featured acts like The Prodigy, Nia Archives and Denzel Curry. Benn has also supported the efforts of Live Nation and the Rio Ferdinand Foundation to increase access to music industry careers. In March, he relaunched the ReBalance initiative to support female and nonbinary artists, which, as he told Music Week, “made a genuine positive impact” during its first three years.


Dion BrantCEO, Frontier Touring


	“We're seeing artist trajectories moving faster than ever before, and our team has shown great prowess at thinking one or two steps ahead,” Brant says. Gracie Abrams played a sold-out run of 3,000- to 5,000-capacity shows in Australia, which sold roughly 21,000 tickets in 2024. “She is now returning this year to a 12-date arena run that is tracking to sell out at 150,000 tickets,” he adds. Likewise, when Benson Boone's single “Beautiful Things” took off, Frontier rebooked his run of shows from sold-out theaters and clubs into sold-out midsize venues, and Teddy Swims has already progressed to a multidate arena tour.


Biggest issue now: “Climate risk is real. We need to be clever and work out how promoters, affected venues, festivals and artists can work together with the insurance industry to protect everyone in the business — because extreme weather events will continue to happen.”


Chris BrayPresident, Europe, Legends/ASM Global


	“Over the past 18 months, we've made tremendous progress in our European business through transformative redevelopments, strategic expansions and new partnerships,” Bray says, highlighting the transformation of Avicii Arena in Stockholm, the redevelopment of AO Arena in Manchester, England, and the launch of the new ChorusLife Arena in Bergamo, Italy. The Legends/ASM Global portfolio has also expanded with the additions of Sheffield City Hall and Sheffield Utilita Arena in England and its expansion in Portugal with taking over operations at Lisbon's LX Factory. “Perhaps our most significant recent achievement has been seamlessly integrating the exceptional teams at Legends with our ASM teams,” Bray adds, “creating what I believe is now the best team in the industry.”


Biggest issue now: “One of the biggest challenges in live music is making it sustainable when costs are on the rise.”


Paul DaintyPresident/CEO, TEG Dainty


	In 2023, Dainty was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for his “distinguished service to the community,” and he continues to distinguish himself. He booked Hugh Jackman's international touring (including dates in Europe and North America) and several Broadway productions including Tina: The Tina Turner Musical, which sold more than 780,000 tickets for its Australia run. TEG's 2025 shows include Cyndi Lauper, Katy Perry and comedian Nikki Glaser. The promoter that operates under the umbrella of TEG — the tech, live-entertainment and ticketing company — will also bring video game Stardew Valley's theatrical show, Symphony of Seasons, to Australia and New Zealand this fall. Among Dainty's top-grossing shows reported to Billboard Boxscore is a three-night stand by Jerry Seinfeld at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia, last June that grossed $5.5 million.


Biggest issue now: “Exchange rates for international touring; increased costs across the board.”


Sebastian de la BarraMaximiliano del RioPartners/promoters, Lotus Producciones


	With the launch of Lotus Records — the booking, management and recording-deal division of Lotus Producciones — Del Rio and De La Barra can support local artists with live shows while focusing on international markets. “We are developing our artists from theaters and clubs to arenas and stadiums,” Del Rio says, highlighting Easykid's booking at Pal Norte and Vive Latino and Soulfia at Lollapalooza Argentina. Between February and March, Lotus Records also teamed with its artists Francisca Valenzuela, Joe Vasconcellos, Movimiento Original and Lucybell to offer free shows throughout Santiago, Chile, where over 20,000 fans gathered.


Biggest issue now: “Exploring the development of new venues is a must in today's business,” Del Rio says. “Just one arena is not enough for a market like Santiago, with local and Latin live music being so strong after the pandemic.”


Dennis DesmondChairman, Live Nation U.K. and IrelandDennis ArgenziaPresident of global touring, Asia Pacific, Live NationMarek LieberbergCEO/managing director, Live Nation Germany, Switzerland and AustriaErik HoffmanPresident, Live Nation CanadaJohn ReidPresident, Live Nation Europe, Middle East and AsiaMark VaughanSenior vp, Live Nation Australia and New ZealandRoberto De LucaPresidentCorrado RizzottoHead promoter, Live Nation Italy


	Desmond says that 2024 “was the best year ever for live music with fantastic sales for Coldplay, Taylor Swift, P!nk and incredible growth for artists like Charli xcx, Fontaines D.C., Sleep Token, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, RAYE and Teddy Swims.” He notes the strong buzz for marquee Live Nation shows from Oasis, Beyoncé, Robbie Williams, Kendrick Lamar/SZA, Lana Del Rey and Drake. “There is nothing better than a good live show,” Desmond says. “Artists continue to excel; the future is bright.” In February, Live Nation reported it had achieved a record $2.2 billion worldwide in adjusted operating income in 2024, up 14%, on record revenue of $23.5 billion, up 2%. Despite having 30% fewer stadium shows in 2024, the total number of fans grew to a record 151 million from nearly 55,000 Live Nation events, up 9.2% year over year, according to the company.


Marcelo FigoliOwner/CEO, Fenix Entertainment


	Argentina-based conglomerate Fenix Entertainment — which encompasses live shows, amusement parks, soccer teams and media — has achieved many milestones as a global entertainment company. “However, without a doubt, one of the most significant achievements in the past 18 months was Luis Miguel's world tour,” Figoli says. The executive partnered with Henry Cárdenas' Cárdenas Marketing Network for Luis Miguel's 2023-24 tour, which became not only the highest-grossing tour by a Latin artist of the year but also the top-grossing tour by a Latin artist ever. The outing welcomed more than 2.8 million fans and grossed over $404.4 million.


The music business today in a word: “For me, it has always been the same … happiness.”


Kaori HayashiPresident/CEO, Hayashi International Promotions


	HIP leads one of Japan's largest and most established concert promotion companies and enjoyed a string of big-time sellouts in the last year that included two sold-out Dua Lipa shows at Saitama Super Arena, the “Levitating” singer's first arena dates in Japan. Hayashi also booked “a record-breaking seven sold-out Tokyo Dome shows of Bruno Mars in January 2024,” she says, along with three sellout Maroon 5 shows at the 55,000-capacity Tokyo Dome, “surpassing the box-office receipts of their groundbreaking 2022 tour in Japan.” In April, Live Nation acquired HIP, giving the world's largest concert promoter a major new presence in the market.


Biggest issue now: “Some resistance to higher-priced tickets, which previously had been the first ticket tier to sell out in Japan.”


Ashish HemrajaniFounder/CEO, BookMyShow


	BookMyShow has played a pivotal role in redefining India's live-entertainment landscape, establishing the country as a must-visit destination on global touring circuits. The company worked with Live Nation to bring the iconic Lollapalooza festival to Mumbai, India, starting in 2022 and, this year, hosted headliners Green Day and Shawn Mendes. “The momentum has been accelerating through pop music as well, with Maroon 5's India tour and the six-city Ed Sheeran +-=÷x Tour spanning seven shows in February 2025, following a successful Mumbai show in March 2024 with over 50,000 fans,” Hemrajani says. BookMyShow and AEG Presents Asia co-promoted Sheeran's shows this year. BookMyShow also produced and promoted Coldplay's Music of the Spheres world tour across Mumbai and Ahmedabad, which broke the record for the biggest stadium shows in the 21st century.


The music business today in a word: “Transformative.”


Alex HillPresident/CEO, AEG InternationalAdam WilkesPresident/CEO, AEG Presents, Europe and Asia-PacificJohn LangfordCOO, AEG EuropeJim KingCEO of European festivals, AEG PresentsSteve HomerCEO, AEG Presents U.K.Michael HarrisonSenior vp of global touringSimon JonesSenior vp of international touring, AEG Presents


	AEG reorganized its operations for Asia-Pacific and Europe earlier this year following the sale of its share in ASM Global and a corporate restructuring to bolster its international divisions. Wilkes was named to the new position of president/CEO of AEG Presents, Europe and Asia-Pacific, while Hill was appointed to head of AEG International. Together, they will continue overseeing projects including the development of the 6,000-seat theater and UOB Live entertainment district in Bangkok; the Bangkok Mall Arena, a multipurpose arena project in Nagoya, Japan; and an arena-anchored entertainment district project planned for Expo Park in Osaka, Japan.


Biggest issue now: “The industry is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic,” Harrison says. “Despite some massive recent tours, rising costs, insurance challenges and global economic uncertainty continue to make touring — especially for midlevel artists — financially difficult. These factors hinder artist development and the ability to build international audiences sustainably.”


Walter KolmFounder/CEOPascual EgeaHead of Europe, WK Entertainment


	Latin music continues to make waves worldwide, and WK Entertainment artists are helping to drive its success. “Maluma is setting the tone for Latin music globally — his + Pretty + Dirty 2025 Tour is selling out arenas across Europe, including three nights at Madrid's Movistar Arena, each with over 15,000 fans,” Kolm says. The company also celebrated Carlos Vives' Person of the Year win at the 2024 Latin Grammys, calling it “a well-deserved recognition for his impact on our culture.” Rising star Emilia — Billboard Español's February cover star — sold out 10 shows at Movistar Arena in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in April 2024 in 10 hours and packed four nights at Estadio Vélez in Argentina, according to Kolm. “It's an exciting time,” he adds, “not just for our artists, but for Latin music as a whole on the global stage.”


Biggest issue now: “Fans just don't have the same [disposable] income as before, and globally, we're seeing the effects,” Kolm says.


Jessica KoravosPresident of internationalGary HutchinsonExecutive vp of global touring and content, Oak View Group


	The U.S.-based Oak View Group opened its first international arena, Co-op Live in Manchester, England, in May 2024 with a show from veteran local band Elbow. Despite several rescheduled concerts and a three-week delay due to safety issues, the arena has been a triumph for the OVG team, and it sold over 1 million tickets for 60 concerts by the close of its first calendar year. And with the launch of OVG Stadia last fall, Hutchinson believes 2025 will be even bigger for the global team. “I would highlight the level of stadium shows we are handling with our clients in 2025,” he says. “The market is busier than ever, and we have a huge 2025 ahead.”


Biggest issue now: “Keeping up with the ever-changing ecosystem in such a big business while also meeting the greater consumer demands,” Koravos says.


Simon MoranManaging director, SJM Concerts


	Moran leads Manchester, England-based SJM Concerts, which finished at No. 5 on Billboard's year-end 2024 Top Promoters chart, with the equivalent of $347.6 million and 4.4 million tickets sold across 733 shows. Among SJM's 20 highest-grossing engagements were 10 by pop group Take That, including a six-night stand at London's O2 ­Arena that sold 90,811 tickets and grossed the equivalent of $11.3 million. SJM has teamed with Live Nation, MCD Productions and DF Concerts for the long-awaited return of Oasis, with the Gallagher brothers booked for a 19-date U.K. and Ireland tour this summer. The company's 2023 year-end financial report stated: “We remain focused on connecting artists with their fans and understanding the needs of the fan base.”


Huston PowellPromoter, C3 Presents


	Since its inception as a touring festival in 1991, ­Lollapalooza has staged its U.S. edition at Chicago's Grant Park and, beginning in 2010, has expanded internationally to markets including Chile, Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Sweden. In 2022, Lollapalooza India debuted in Mumbai with C3 Presents working alongside Indian promoter-ticketer BookMyShow. “We had our first Lollapalooza India festival sell out this year,” Powell says of the event that included headlining performances from Green Day and Shawn Mendes. “This was only our third edition, and our partners, BookMyShow, worked incredibly hard to ramp up and deliver a world-class show in a market where multigenre shows like Lolla have never existed before.”


Biggest issue now: “As a festival promoter, we continually are challenged to look for ways to provide the best fan experience to stand out from the endless options fans have today.”


Klaus-Peter SchulenbergCEO, CTS Eventim


	With 2024 revenue of 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion) — up 19.1% over 2023 — CTS Eventim is Europe's biggest ticketing company and concert promoter, and it's making global moves. In late 2023, the company broke ground on a Milan arena to open in 2026, expanded in South America and France and partnered with AXS on ticketing for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2024, the company also closed its deal to acquire See Tickets, which “reinforced our position as one of the world's leading ticketing providers,” Schulenberg says. “This unique combination of local expertise and global reach enables us to offer artists a truly international touring platform deeply rooted in local markets.”


Biggest issue now: “One of the biggest opportunities — and responsibilities — for the music industry is to make even better use of data. At CTS Eventim, we already leverage our data to help artists and promoters connect with their audiences more effectively and to create outstanding fan experiences.”


Tricia SilliphantManaging director of music and live entertainment, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment


	Despite rising costs, Silliphant and MLSE still find ways to consistently deliver record-breaking grosses, as well as ticket and merchandise sales for Toronto venues like Scotiabank Arena, the Coca-Cola Coliseum and BMO Field. “Toronto is a market known as one of the most culturally diverse cities in the word,” Silliphant says. “This rich diversity is mirrored in our venues showcasing an international scope of content.” While full-scale renovations are underway at Scotiabank Arena and BMO Field, Silliphant remains more motivated than ever to match the demand for live music across the globe, stating, “We look forward to the continued growth possibilities as we invest to meet the constantly evolving needs of artists and fans alike.”


Biggest issue now: “The rising cost of touring and producing live events is an issue that stands out. From production expenses to travel and labor costs — and, in our case, the fluctuating Canadian dollar — combined with local or venue-specific operating costs, all continue to increase significantly.”


Alejandro SoberónFounder/CEOLeizer Guss GussFestivals director, OCESAOctavio PadillaDirector, OCESA Seitrack


	Now part of Live Nation, OCESA remains a leader in the live-entertainment landscape across Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Colombia, setting new standards in production, reach and fan engagement. “One of our proudest achievements has been the full renovation of Estadio GNP Seguros — now recognized as the world's leading concert venue,” Soberón says of Mexico City's iconic venue formerly known as Foro Sol, home to Shakira's unprecedented seven-show residency as part of her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran world tour. Guss Guss highlights how “fast and effective” OCESA was to jump on the new wave of regional Mexican music with the development of two Mexico City events: Arre Festival and the female-­centered Hera HSBC Festival. For Padilla, OCESA Seitrack's alliance with Warner Music on Touring the World, a booking agency based in Colombia to develop Warner's roster in America and Europe, is worth celebrating.


The music business today in a word: “Unstoppable,” Padilla says.


Jasmine YoungCo-founder, West Africa Music & Arts Festival


	Young says that last June, when the inaugural, four-day West Africa Music & Arts Festival was held in Accra, Ghana, 20,000 fans attended Area Code Jam, the closing-night concert in partnership with Ghana's premiere urban radio station, YFM; Ghanaian singer Black Sherif headlined. “We have built bridges between global music markets and emerging talent in West Africa, opening new pathways for cross-border collaborations and creating sustainable opportunities for artists and music professionals alike,” says Young, who is also director of the Warner Music/Blavatnik Center for Music Business at Howard University in Washington, D.C. She adds that this year's WAMA festival will return to Accra in June.


Biggest issue now: “The lack of practical knowledge for aspiring executives and artists” is a pressing concern, Young says. “Our goal is to educate, excite and empower the next generation of music industry leaders.”


Emma BanksChris DalstonMike GreekMarlene TsuchiiCo-heads of international touringNigel HasslerMusic touring agent, CAA


	The team guided stars like Charli xcx, Gracie Abrams, Sabrina Carpenter and Tate McRae on global tours in increasingly larger venues, from “theaters to arenas, as well as headlining festivals and stadiums,” Tsuchii says. Alongside these young female powerhouses, clients including Sam Fender, Hozier and Noah Kahan achieved similar success on the road. Kahan's 2024 run ranked as one of the year's top-grossing tours, bringing in $102 million and drawing 1.1 million fans. Meanwhile, CAA's music brand partnership department used this momentum to secure major endorsement deals for multiple clients.


Biggest issue now: “Unfortunately, we are faced with the same issues we have combated for years: rising ticket charges, the secondary-ticketing market and scalping,” Tsuchii says. “These issues remain as much of a problem as they have for years, and now, with the rabid young fan base for these rising superstars, the appetite for tickets is unprecedented.”


Matt BatesManaging partner/CEORick LevyPartner/board memberBen WinchesterBoard member/agentPete NashPartner/agent, Primary Talent International


	The powerhouse U.K. indie agency continues to place its artists on the biggest stages, including Glastonbury, where this year clients The 1975 will headline the festival's first night. (Other clients including beabadoobee, Wolf Alice and The Libertines are also on the bill.) After brief stints under ICM and then CAA, Primary Talent International went independent once again in 2023, and Levy says it's proud to “remain an independent music-only agency … able to book so many of the incredible artists on our roster into the largest international festival in the world, giving fans what they want.”


Biggest issue now: “AI,” Levy says. “This will not be the first time that technology has disrupted the business. But the challenge for us as agents is to ensure that the opportunities that are presented benefit not just the labels and big companies operating in our ecosystem but the artists themselves, who are our sole concern.”


Tomas CookmanFounder, Nacional Records/Latin Alternative Music Conference; partner, Magnus Talent Agency


	Cookman — whose Nacional Records label is marking its 20th anniversary with ongoing success by YADAM, Nortec Collective, Los Master Plus, DJ Raff, Marrón and Marco Flores y la Jerez — more recently partnered with Magnus Talent Agency (Marc Anthony and Michel Vega's company) to unite booking and management teams across countries. Cookman also celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Latin Alternative Music Conference. “Both our virtual format and our recent in-person conference, which was our biggest one yet, were impactful to both industry and artists,” he says. Cookman adds that on the management side, “the global growing success of Trueno has been a highlight for me.”


Jeff CraibCEOTom KempPresidentJoel BaskinVp, The Feldman Agency


	Canadian powerhouse The Feldman Agency remained one of the country's key live players in 2024. According to the company, among its achievements are three sold-out Shania Twain performances in Newfoundland (which sold over 45,000 tickets and grossed more than $8 million) and a very successful Avril Lavigne arena tour (which sold over 100,000 tickets for nearly $10 million in gross). “After 50 years in business, we've just celebrated our best year yet,” Craib says, citing “a year marked by growth in arena-level touring, exciting new artist signings, talent-buying and a significant year-over-year increase in global bookings.”


Biggest issue now: “The new costs of touring and reaching the fans,” Craib says.


Amy DavidmanDevin LandauFounding partners, TBA Agency


	Over the past year, TBA Agency's clients have expanded their international reach, with Argentina's Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso appearing at such events as Coachella, Glastonbury, Roskilde and Fuji Rock. The company also booked the first shows for artists such as Mexico's Dámaris Bójor and Australia's Delivery. “We are not afraid to get involved early and work with the artist and their team from the ground up,” Davidman says. “We believe that hard work and a clear strategy early in an artist's career can really position them for future success.”


Biggest issue now: “With all the current uncertainty worldwide, we are worried about the accessibility of our internationally based artists, our politically outspoken artists and our queer artists,” Davidman says. “What can we do as agents to help support not only our clients but also the cultural institutions we lean on for funding and opportunities? We all need to support this touring ecosystem from all angles over the coming years.”


Lucy DickinsGlobal head of contemporary music and touringJosh JavorPartner/co-head of London officeBrian CohenRob MarkusPartners/agentsJames SimmonsAgent, WME


	Among WME clients, Coldplay's Music of the Spheres tour surpassed $1 billion in global revenue; Luis Miguel's run has become the highest-grossing tour by a Latin artist of all time; Dua Lipa's Radical Optimism tour has sold over 350,000 tickets and grossed $43.4 million so far, with more than 50 dates left on the books through December; and Olivia Rodrigo's GUTS tour sold over 1 million tickets. Plus, Linkin Park and Zach Bryan scored huge numbers on tours that continue into 2025. Dickins notes the booking advantage of WME's presence in the Asia-Pacific region and says the agency also recently expanded its Latin division by opening a Miami office. “I'm proud of our truly global presence,” she says, “which continues to grow year after year.”


Biggest issue now: “The rising cost of touring continues to be top of mind for us as it affects both artists and fans,” Dickins says. “Logistics, travel and accommodation costs have made it more difficult for emerging artists to get out on the road.”


Jon OllierCEO/agent, One Fiinix Live


	The British firm booked a worldwide arena tour for Japanese artist Ado, “which we hope could become the biggest international tour for a Japanese artist,” Ollier says. One Fiinix Live also promoted an eight-city regional tour for Ed Sheeran on the Indian subcontinent, “much of which was a first for a Western artist,” he says, and worked on Sheeran's six-night stand in Hangzhou, China. “All of which,“ Ollier says, “speaks to international business cooperation on a profound scale.”


Biggest issue now: “I am very sad to say it, but I think, yet again, we find our industry's biggest threat intertwined with that of the rest of humanity: global security.”


Peter PappalardoExecutive vp/head of global touringKeith NaisbittExecutive vp of global touring, Independent Artist Group


	“Our international roster continues to grow with headlining talent who had great success this past year,” Pappalardo says. That includes Billy Joel, who last August sold out Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales; Rod Stewart, who sold out several European arenas and booked the Legends slot at this year's Glastonbury Festival; and Disturbed, Ghost, Falling in Reverse and Ne-Yo, all of whom also sold out arenas on the continent, according to Pappalardo. He adds that grosses for Dream Theater's European and South American shows “were double what they have done in the past.”


Biggest issue now: “Profitability,” Pappalardo says. ­“Ticket sales and fan support have been great, but the cost of touring, along with high taxes, makes for ­ever-challenging margins.”


Julien PaquinVinny CinquemaniCo-presidents, Paquin Artists Agency


	The Canadian agency had plenty of wins at home — including signing U.S. artists such as The Offspring, John Fogerty and Papa Roach for representation in Canada — but those were just one part of an impressive global expansion. In recent months, Paquin says, “our international business has seen remarkable growth, with record-setting success in Canada and significant breakthroughs across the U.S., Australia, [Middle East and North Africa] and South America.” Together, those moves helped Paquin's “touring business [shatter] previous milestones, driving strong engagement and revenue growth across these key markets,” he adds.


The music business today in a word: “Resilient,” Paquin says. “The industry has not only adapted but remained strong in the face of challenges, with a major return to live touring fueled by heightened demand, excitement and urgency. This persistence has led to some of the most successful box-office years in recent history.”


Narcís Rebollo MelcióPresident/CEO, Global Talent Services


	Originally launched by Universal Music Group in 2007 as a full-service Latin artist services agency focused on management, booking, promotion and brand partnerships, GTS now has 10 offices in key markets, a roster of 150 acts and has “solidified its position as the first global Latin management company,” Rebollo Melció says. Notably, according to GTS, Morat's stadium tour generated over $50 million in revenue across 25 stops, David Bisbal's Todo es Posible en Navidad album featured a performance atop New York's Empire State Building and Aitana premiered her Metamorphosis documentary on Netflix and forged a major partnership with Santander Bank for ticket presales. Additionally, Spanish singer-songwriter Pablo Alborán joined the roster, GTS managed the first edition of the talent show Operación Triunfo on Amazon Prime and its direct-to-consumer platform sold over 1 million tickets, “a testament to the company's innovative approach, utilizing technology, data and [customer relationship management] to benefit the artists,” Rebollo Melció adds.


Neil WarnockCo-head of U.K./head of global touringIrene AgbontaenDirector of artist brand strategy, music brand partnershipsTom JonesScott MantellJames WrightMusic agents, UTA


	Wright says that UTA has been “increasingly strategic and intentional” about building teams around the company's clients, a roster that includes global superstars and touring juggernauts such as Karol G and Bad Bunny. The approach is “really delivering” as the agency and its clients maneuver in an increasingly dynamic international market. “As our teams become more than the sum of their parts,” Wright says, “we're unlocking new opportunities for our artists — be that new audiences in live or connecting them to the right brand and commercial partners.”


Biggest issue now: “Costs,” Wright says. “On the artist side, touring has become increasingly expensive due to inflation, rising production costs and logistical challenges, making it difficult for artists to break even. On the venue side, operating costs are substantial, making it especially challenging for grassroots venues to remain financially viable — despite their crucial role in nurturing the next generation of headliners.”


James WhittingExecutive vp/managing executiveDave BlackgroveMichael Harvey-BrayAdele SlaterSenior vpsAnna BewersVp, Wasserman Music


	Whitting says Wasserman Music “continues to be the agency known for breaking acts globally,” citing the incredible success of Chappell Roan as a “great, recent and obvious“ example, but “there are plenty more.” He calls this sustained success a testament to the company's strength in A&R, but also a function of its creative approach to touring and long-term career development. “The old, traditional ways don't work anymore,” Whitting says. “You need to think differently, tour differently, market differently and time everything perfectly at global scale. When all those things work together in concert — no pun [intended] — the results are plain for all to see.”


The music business today in a word: “Live,” Whitting says.


Manuel AbudCEO, Latin Recording Academy


	This year, the Latin Recording Academy announced a new field and category for best music for visual media and a new category for best roots song — singles or tracks only — as well as revisions to the names or rules for six other categories. “Music is dynamic, and the landscape continues to change with the lines between genres becoming less defined as creators develop a fusion of sounds,” Abud says. The Latin Grammys return this year to their longtime base in Las Vegas, following ceremonies in Spain in 2023 and Miami in 2024. Interest in hosting the next Latin Grammy Week has since been enormous. “We have defined and implemented a formal [request for proposal] process for potential host cities,” Abud says, “and the response has been overwhelming.”


The music business today in a word: “Strong. The mainstream cultural powerhouse that is Latin music is undeniable, with Spanish-language artists topping global streaming charts and flexing unprecedented dominance on the world stage.”


Charlie LextonCOO, Merlin


	In the last year, Merlin has focused on data. “The data analytics capability we have built within Merlin allows us to take the vast array of data received under our partnerships around the world and transform it into actionable intelligence [that delivers] unique insights to our record label and distributor members,” Lexton says. “These insights are derived from billions of streams generated by music from tens of thousands of record labels globally, helping our members to better understand audience behavior, optimize revenue opportunities and make data-driven strategic decisions, equipping them to thrive in a highly competitive and ever-evolving digital music landscape.”


Biggest issue now: “Accepting and embracing that AI isn't Napster, it's fire. By ‘fire,' I mean it would be a mistake to treat the advent of AI as merely a technological disruption. It is a fundamental transformation.”


Victoria OakleyCEO, IFPI


	Oakley, who joined IFPI in June, says the global recording business trade organization's March 2025 Global Music Report “was a great moment for IFPI,” as well as for her. “This year's report tells a fascinating story of an industry that continues to evolve and innovate” as IFPI's member labels continue to invest in artists while facing challenges from online distributors and AI music — which Oakley identifies as the industry's biggest issue. “It is very clear that the developers of generative AI systems are using copyright-protected music to train their models without authorization,” she says. “This poses a massive threat to human artistry.”


The music business today in a word: “Innovative.”


John PhelanDirector general, International Confederation of Music Publishers


	In 2024, ICMP's efforts helped get the Artificial Intelligence Act passed by the European Union, which, among other things, requires technology companies to keep detailed records of data sets used to train generative AI so copyright holders can track (and potentially block) usage. “The team here eats up the biggest industry difficulties for dinner,” Phelan says. “The ICMP team has engaged with more than 100 laws around the world that directly affect the world's music publishing companies and the tens of thousands of songwriters and composers they represent. Almost 40 of those are different AI laws.”


Biggest issue now: “That if we're to succeed and build the basis for future growth, it's a case of moving hundreds of needles, not a handful, as in the past. So increasing digital streaming rates, growing emerging markets, preventing risks to business, enabling licensing efficiency, shortening long tails, preventing commercial-scale piracy, technologizing metadata, working with every government out there… there are no shortcuts to ‘right.' ”


Helen SmithExecutive chair, IMPALA


	Smith, as IMPALA's executive chair, has led the nonprofit organization in “taking a stance on tricky issues that are pivotal for the whole sector, and we have a few right now — consolidation, reform of streaming, remuneration, AI, [electronic data interchange], sustainability and basic copyright, including in the USA,” where recording rights holders are not compensated for radio play, she says. “Our members are leaders and their work at labels is more important than ever, as illustrated in the first report published last year by ORCA [the Organization for Recorded Culture and Arts], the think tank for international independent labels.”


Biggest issue now: “The need to invest in diversity to grow the market. We believe our streaming plan has many of the answers, as it identifies diversity as holding the biggest potential for the whole market to grow. ­However, juggernaut economics as manifested in consolidation and two-tier streaming allocation models are getting in the way.”


Honorees in this sector were chosen solely by Billboard's editorial team and not through industry nominations.


Casper BjørnerCEO, STIM


	In 2023, the Swedish collective management society celebrated its 100th anniversary with record-high revenue of 3.1 billion krona ($291.9 million), up 14.2% from the previous year. STIM expects that its 2024 results (to be announced in May) will surpass that, fueled in part by the success of Swedish songwriters in K-pop, which STIM has supported with the public-private partnership Export Swedish Music. Like its sister societies when it comes to AI, Bjørner says STIM is developing a licensing framework that embraces the technology while protecting creators' rights. “We're always in the room” with policymakers, he adds, “making sure there's a balance.”


The music business today in a word: “Ever-changing.”


Andrea Czapary MartinCEO, PRS for Music


	U.K. collecting society PRS for Music distributed in 2023 943.6 million pounds ($1.3 billion) in royalties, 13% more than the previous year, and its revenue broke the billion-pound barrier. For 2024, it expects to distribute over 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion). Czapary Martin is driving innovation to lower costs, and last year PRS reduced multiterritory online administration fees by 20%. “We continue to drive industrywide improvements in metadata management through our Nexus project,” Czapary Martin says. “I can't wait to see the long-term improvements it will bring over the coming years to songwriter credit identification and royalty accuracy.”


The music business today in a word: “Globalized. Music is increasingly transcending geographic boundaries, with music creators from all over the world collaborating and blending diverse cultural influences.”


Tobias HolzmüllerCEO, GEMA


	The German collective licensing society took in 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2024, 4% more than in the previous year. “We're still growing faster than the German economy,” Holzmüller says, “and we have a transformative agenda in terms of speed and transparency.“ It has also taken a lead in protecting creators' rights from AI companies — suing OpenAI and Suno for copyright infringement in the course of training their algorithms — in cases that could shape the future of the technology in Europe. GEMA is also setting up a series of cooperative initiatives with other societies, including One Arena, a multiterritory platform for big tours.


The music business today in a word: “Solid.”


Peter LeathemCEO, PPL


	PPL continues to break revenue records, having surpassed 300 million pounds ($396 million) in collections in 2024, the organization's 90th year in business. “Collections are up over 100 million pounds [$132 million] in the last decade” since 2014, Leathem says. In 2014, PPL paid over 60,000 performers and recording rights holders, while last year, it paid over 172,000 performers and rights holders, he adds. Also, PPL collections include taking responsibility for neighboring rights internationally, which it has been doing for around 20 years. “Today, PPL is the leader, with 113 agreements with CMOs [collection management organizations], covering 95% of the neighboring rights markets by value,” Leathem says. Lastly, he adds that PPL has recruited and retained hundreds of performers as members, including Charlie xcx, Lewis Capaldi and the estate of John Lennon.


Gadi OronDirector general, CISAC


	As head of the international trade organization of collecting societies, Oron helps steer a thriving sector of the music business — global revenue grew 7.6% to $12.7 billion in 2023 and is up 31.7% since 2019. Oron supports that growth by advocating for creators' rights in AI and CISAC supported the first global economic study on its possible effects. Oron also helps drive innovation in collections and distributions, and CISAC is working to modernize the data exchange system CIS-Net and to expand the International Standard Musical Work Code system that identifies works to get creators paid faster and more accurately.


The music business today in a word: “Supercharged.”


Cristina Perpiñá-RobertCEO, SGAE


	Over the past year, SGAE has achieved record-breaking collections of 390 million euros (over $423 million), the highest in its 125-year history, while international revenue has reached an all-time high of 35 million euros ($40 million). “We have also focused on continuous modernization to enhance efficiency, transparency and accuracy in royalty collection and distribution,” Perpiñá-Robert says, noting that a key achievement has been the implementation of digital tracking technology to better monitor music usage, particularly on streaming platforms. Among other significant accomplishments: “securing a 5% cap on publishing returns from TV broadcasters, a major step toward fairer and more transparent distributions.”


Biggest issue now: One trend that will erode the sustainability of the music industry is “festival promoters disputing fair tariffs, arguing that music is not the primary asset in their business models.”


Cécile Rap-VeberCEO, SACEM


	Over the past few years, the French collective rights management society has set successive records for both revenue and distributions: it collected a record 1.6 billion euros ($1.73 billion) in 2024, up 7.7% from 2023. Much of that success reflects Rap-Veber's modernization efforts, including the current SACEM 2030 strategy, which emphasizes collections efficiency (SACEM reduced its expense ratio to a historical low of 10.8%) and service for members. SACEM also worked with Deezer to apply the artist-centric royalty model to the streaming service's publishing payouts.


Biggest issue now: “One of the main challenges facing the music business today lies in the growing impact of artificial intelligence. AI raises crucial questions about the transparency and remuneration of works used to develop these tools.”


Jose Luis SevillanoCEO, AIE


	Sevillano has positioned the artist performing rights society AIE as “the key bridge between Europe and America.” Based in Spain, AIE represents the rights of over 40,000 artists and has expanded beyond Spain to the “neighboring rights” of Spanish-language performers around the world. “We have established ourselves as the leading organization in managing the Spanish-language Latin repertoire with a continuous and sustained increase in artists,” Sevillano says. Last year, AIE achieved “record-breaking” distribution of royalties to its artists and developed advanced platforms to establish a Spanish Music Data Space that will contain all information on Spanish music, including consumption, export numbers and individual artists' ­royalty numbers in a single place.


The music business today in a word: “Disruption, first and foremost, in the sense of a radical change that completely reshapes the way this industry operates. Disruption also in how new musical content is being created across all areas: video games, audiovisual productions and mainstream music.”

The president called for an ""investigation"" into their endorsements of Kamala Harris in 2024.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	President Donald Trump has accused Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen and more stars of participating in an “illegal election scam” run by Kamala Harris‘ campaign during the 2024 election, with the billionaire calling for a “major investigation” into their allegedly “corrupt” endorsements of the former VP.


	In two Truth Social posts from the early hours of Monday (May 19), Trump first accused the Boss — whom the POTUS also called “highly overrated” and “dumb as a rock” just a few days prior — of illegally accepting an undisclosed payment to appear at one of Harris' rallies last year before lumping the “Texas Hold ‘Em” singer, as well as Oprah Winfrey and U2's Bono, into the alleged scheme. “HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump began. “WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS?”

	











	“ISN'T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? …AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???” he continued early Monday morning. “I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter. Candidates aren't allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment. In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds.”


	“IT'S NOT LEGAL!” Trump added. “For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,' this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system.”


	In a follow-up post about seven hours later, Trump doubled down on his claims. “According to news reports, Beyoncé was paid $11,000,000 to walk onto a stage, quickly ENDORSE KAMALA, and walk off to loud booing for never having performed, NOT EVEN ONE SONG!” he wrote. “Remember, the Democrats and Kamala illegally paid her millions of Dollars for doing nothing other than giving Kamala a full throated ENDORSEMENT. THIS IS AN ILLEGAL ELECTION SCAM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL! IT IS AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION! BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, OPRAH, BONO AND, PERHAPS, MANY OTHERS, HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO!!!”


	When that 11-million figure first surfaced last year and made the rounds on social media, fact check organizations found no evidence to support the claim. Billboard has reached out to reps for Beyoncé, Springsteen and Bono for comment.

	











	The president's remarks come about three days after he first targeted the “Born in the U.S.A.” rocker shortly after Springsteen slammed Trump's “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” administration during a concert in Manchester. Trump called the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer a “pushy, obnoxious JERK” who “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT” on Friday (May 16). That same day, Trump also wrote that Taylor Swift is “no longer ‘HOT'” following her September endorsement of Harris and his subsequent “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” post.


	Springsteen was vocal in his support of Harris throughout the 2024 election, performing at rallies in Pennsylvania and Georgia as well as appearing in an advertisement supporting the Democratic politician's campaign. Beyoncé also appeared at a Harris rally in Houston, delivering a speech in which she asserted: “I'm not here as a celebrity. I'm not here as a politician. I'm here as a mother. A mother who cares, deeply, about the world my children and all of our children live in.”


	An Irish citizen, Bono did not endorse a candidate in the 2024 U.S. election or participate in any campaign events.


	The E Street band leader and Destiny's Child alum were just two of many stars who backed Harris during the 2024 election, with Megan Thee Stallion, Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Cardi B, Eminem and more throwing their support behind the former prosecutor's campaign. Finance records do not show that any of them were paid for their endorsements — something Harris would have needed to disclose if that were the case — and Harris' campaign has denied in the past that it ever paid artists to perform at events. “We have never paid any artist and performer,” senior spokesperson Adrienne Elrod stated to Deadline when rumors to the contrary first surfaced last year. “We have never paid a fee to that person.”

	











	Beyoncé's camp has also denied that she accepted payment for her endorsement of Harris, as has the 35-time Grammy winner's mother, Tina Knowles. “The lie is that Beyonce was paid 10 million dollars to speak at a rally in Houston for Vice President Kamala Harris,” Knowles wrote on Instagram in November. “When In Fact : Beyonce did not receive a penny for speaking at a Presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harrris's Rally in Houston. In fact she actually paid for her own flights for her and her team, and total Glam . They are not only lying and disrespecting Beyonce's name but they are trying to further discredit the power of our vice president! When does the lies and rumors stop?”


	There is record of Harris paying Bey's production company, Parkwood Production Media LLC, $165,000 after the Texas event; that payment would be in accordance with federal law, which prohibits corporations from giving directly to a candidate's campaign and mandates that campaigns reimburse the costs of large event production, according to The Hill.

	Ashley Iasimone



JIN‘s new Echo EP tops this week's new music poll.


	Music fans voted in a poll published Friday (May 16) on Billboard, choosing the BTS member's latest solo endeavor as their favorite new music release of the past week.


	JIN's seven-track collection saw a landslide victory, with a staggering 93% of votes placed in support of the EP. Voters chose Echo over new releases from artists across genres, including Morgan Wallen, Rihanna, Laufey, Avicii (a posthumous compilation album), Lola Young, Sebastián Yatra and Rico Nasty.


Echo — the follow-up to JIN's debut solo EP, 2024's Happy — was released on Friday (May 16). “Don't Say You Love Me,” “Nothing Without Your Love,” “Loser” featuring YENA, “Rope It,” “With the Clouds,” “Background” and “To Me, Today” make up the tracklist for the K-pop star's new project. “Don't Say You Love Me” also got an official music video, directed by Yongseok Choi and shot across various locations in Singapore.

	He'll be celebrating the new release in the upcoming week in New York City with a televised performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon!, on an episode set to air on Wednesday (May 21) on NBC.


	Since its announcement, Echo has been described by JIN's team as a “perspective on universal life experiences, capturing everyday emotions with warmth and sincerity. Built on dynamic band sounds, the album showcases his versatile vocals across a spectrum of moods and styles. It reflects a deeper layer of vocal maturity and personal storytelling that underscores Jin's evolving artistry.”


	Among the new music trailing behind Echo on this week's poll are Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem, Rihanna's “Friend of Mine,” Laufey's “Tough Luck” and more, all with a very minor percentage of the vote.

The tribute follows Donald Trump calling Bruce Springsteen ""highly overrated"" and ""dumb as a rock.""

	Jessica Lynch



Eddie Vedder paid tribute to Bruce Springsteen during Pearl Jam's concert in Pittsburgh on Friday night (May 17), performing a solo acoustic rendition of “My City of Ruins” in what appeared to be a quiet but powerful response to Donald Trump's recent public criticism of Springsteen.

	Vedder did not reference Trump directly and did not mention Springsteen by name before performing the song. But the choice was likely intentional, as Springsteen has been performing the 2002 track during his tour alongside fiery speeches condemning what he describes as attacks on civil liberties by Trump and his allies.

	During the kickoff of his European tour on May 14, Springsteen told the audience, “In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.”


	Trump responded on Truth Social on May 16, calling Springsteen “highly overrated,” “dumb as a rock,” and “a dried out prune of a rocker.” He also threatened to bar the musician from returning to the U.S. after his tour, writing, “Springsteen ought to keep his mouth shut until he gets back into the country. Then we'll all see how it goes for him.”


	Springsteen did not back down. “Things are happening right now that are altering the very nature of our country's democracy, and they're too important to ignore,” the rocker said to the crowd in a three-minute speech on Manchester's Co-op Live stage on Saturday, as heard in a video posted by the L.A. Times.


	“In my home, they're persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. That's happening now,” Springsteen said, echoing what he'd spoken about at his May 14 show. “In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world's poorest children to sickness and death. That's happening now. In my country, they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers.”


	Springsteen continued, “They are removing residents off American streets without due process of law and deploying them to foreign detention centers as prisoners. That's happening now…They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American.”

Sesame Street has a new streaming home. Netflix has picked up the children's series, which will make its debut on the streamer later this year with an all-new, reimagined 56th season — plus 90 hours of previous episodes — available to audiences worldwide. 


	Netflix is coming on board after HBO Max opted not to renew its Sesame Street streaming deal at the end of last year. 


	The new episodes, which will now center on one 11-minute story, will be available same day-and-date in the U.S. on PBS stations and PBS KIDS digital platforms, keeping U.S. kids' free access to early learning for free.

	











	In addition to format changes, the new season will feature the return of fan-favorite segments like Elmo's World and Cookie Monster's Foodie Truck. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Sesame Workshop is the global nonprofit behind Sesame Street, with Sal Perez and Kay Wilson Stallings serving as executive producers; Emmy, Humanitas, and NAACP Award nominee Halcyon Person (Karma's World, Dee & Friends in Oz) joins as head writer.


	Netflix will also be able to develop video games for both Sesame Street and Sesame Street Mecha Builders. 


	While HBO Max shifted focus away from kids and family programming a couple of years ago, it represents 15% of Netflix's total viewing with shows such as CoComelon.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Wendy McMahon has announced her resignation as the president and CEO of CBS News and Stations, the latest departure from the network amid the pending acquisition by Skydance. 


	McMahon wrote to staffers, “Championing and supporting the journalism produced by the most amazing stations and bureaus in the world, celebrating the successes of our shows and our brands, elevating our stories and our people … It has been a privilege and joy.


	“At the same time, the past few months have been challenging. It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It's time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.”

	Her exit comes as the network has been in negotiations with Donald Trump's team over a settlement of a $20 billion lawsuit he filed over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris. Many legal experts see the lawsuit as without merit, but Paramount Global is seeking the administration's approval over the Skydance merger.




			Watch on Deadline		







	McMahon was seen as a defender of the news division — and 60 Minutes — amid the corporate tumult and Trump's attacks. Last month, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, Bill Owens, exited his role, citing corporate interference. 60 Minutes has continued to produce hard hitting segments on the Trump administration.


	Even in the wake of Owens' exit, CBS News staffers have been bracing for more shoes to drop amid the expectation that Paramount Global and Skydance would settle.


	One senior staffer, who declined to be identified, said that McMahon's exit was not much of a surprise given Owens' exit. “It indicates that they are probably closer to a settlement,” the staffer said, while noting that 60 Minutes finished its most recent season on Sunday, meaning that McMahon had seen the show through further Trump attacks over its content.


	George Cheeks, the co-CEO of Paramount Global and president and CEO of CBS, wrote in a memo to staffers that CBS News president Tom Cibrowski and CBS Stations president Jennifer Mitchell would now report to him. He said that McMahon would be with the network for a few more weeks “to support the transition.”


	McMahon also oversaw CBS Media Ventures. Cheeks wrote that Scott Trupchak, head of advertising sales, and John Budkins, who oversees programming and production, will now report to Bryon Rubin, the network's chief operating officer and CFO.

	











	Cheeks wrote, “In a rapidly changing world, Wendy and her teams have worked diligently to articulate a vision and lay a foundation that adapts our news operations for the future. This includes advancements in data journalism, community journalism, technology and centralizing editorial decisions to help teams move faster.”


	McMahon was named president and co-head of a combined CBS News and Stations in 2021, along with Neeraj Khemlani. When Khemlani departed in 2023, she became sole leader of the divisions, combining that with oversight of domestic syndication.


	Last year, McMahon and then-CBS News President Adrienne Roark rebuked CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil over the way that he handled an interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates, on the show to promote a book that was critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinians. But Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, called out the CBS News leadership for their handling of the incident, saying that Dokoupil “did a great job with that interview.”


	The 60 Minutes interview with Harris also is the subject of a conservative group's complaint at the FCC, which is considering the Skydance-Paramount Global transaction. The complaint was initially dismissed by the agency under Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, but it was revived by her successor, Brendan Carr, appointed by Trump.


	FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, wrote on X that McMahon's departure was “beyond alarming.”


	“Independent journalists are being silenced simply because their reporting may threaten the ambitions of their corporate owners,” she wrote. “It will only embolden an Administration hell-bent on censoring speech and controlling content.”


	The consternation over a potential settlement of the Trump lawsuit has spread beyond the news division. Last week, as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) guested on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Colbert asked him about a letter he and other senators sent to Redstone about the dangers of settling the Trump lawsuit.


	“What effect would settling something like that have?” Colbert asked.


	“To give in to Trump is to allow him to say, ‘I gotcha. Anybody who speaks up against me, you're in trouble,'” Sanders said.


	McMahon's memo to staffers is below:


	Hi everyone,


	Today, I am stepping down from my position as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures.


	This has been one of the most meaningful chapters in my career.  Leading this extraordinary organization has been the honor of a lifetime because I got to work alongside all of you. Your commitment to truth, fairness and the highest standards is unassailable.


	Championing and supporting the journalism produced by the most amazing stations and bureaus in the world, celebrating the successes of our shows and our brands, elevating our stories and our people … It has been a privilege and joy.


	At the same time, the past few months have been challenging. It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It's time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.


	I have spent the last few months shoring up our businesses and making sure the right leaders are in place; and I have no doubt they will continue to set the standard.


	You are in incredibly good hands with Tom, Jennifer, John, Matt and Robert. They are phenomenal leaders and people who will continue to protect and celebrate your work. I am sure of it.

	











	To George: Thank you for this opportunity.


	To our viewers: Thank you for your trust. You hold us accountable, and you remind us why this work matters.


	To the CBS News and Stations and CMV teams: Thank you for your passion, your professionalism and your partnership. It has been a privilege to walk this path with you.


	Wendy

					By Matthew Carey 

Documentary Editor, Awards


	The late actress Jayne Mansfield became a regular at the Cannes Film Festival in the 1950s and ‘60s, sometimes photographed on the Croisette with her husband, Mickey Hargitay, and on at least one occasion accompanied by her pet pooch.


	Decades after her death in a tragic car crash, Mansfield again enjoys a place of honor at the festival, thanks to her daughter, Mariska Hargitay. The star known for her role as Det. Olivia Benson on Law & Order: SVU, makes her directorial debut with the documentary My Mom Jayne, which just premiered in the Cannes Classics section of the festival.

	“Obviously I've grown up with images of my mother. There were certainly a lot taken,” Hargitay said as she stopped by Deadline's Cannes Studio. “But the photos of her in Cannes in particular were always so meaningful to me because of how free and happy and in love she was with my father. And so those photos were always kind of seared in this emotional place in my heart. To be here, to bring her back here and to tell her story was quite beautiful.”


	Hargitay was only three when her mother was killed in the accident in Louisiana. Mariska and her older brothers Zoltan and Mickey Jr. were in the backseat at the time and all three were injured. As the film reveals, paramedics left the scene without realizing Mariska was trapped inside the vehicle; they only returned after Zoltan asked them about the whereabouts of his sister.


	The Hollywood studio system forced the shapely Mansfield into the role of a blond bombshell – dyeing her hair to help achieve the desired effect. Underneath the glamour girl image lurked a woman of substance; Mansfield was a polyglot, classical pianist and violinist, and took the craft of acting seriously.


	“Seeing all this artistry and seeing that she never was able to do the kinds of films or make the kind of art that she wanted to was so intriguing,” Hargitay noted. “I wanted to know that story and again, get to know the person. I just longed and ached to know the real person and what made her tick and what made her afraid and what was her pain and her joy and all of that.”

	











My Mom Jayne, which premieres June 27 on HBO and HBO Max, contains startling revelations about the identity of Hargitay's biological father – details the actress-director has never shared before. We won't spoil those here.


	Later in the summer, Hargitay will return to work on the 27th season of SVU. As Deadline reported exclusively, she will be rejoined by her friend, actress Kelli Giddish, who is coming back to the show in the role of Det. Amanda Rollins.


	“She is a formidable actress and an incredibly creative partner and has been such a joy and huge part of the fabric of SVU,” Hargitay told us. “I love her, and I love acting with her and co-creating with her, and it feels like home with her. So, I am ecstatic about her return.” 


	Watch the full conversation in the video above.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Independent Film Company and Shudder have acquired U.S. rights to Whistle, the new horror film from The Nun director Corin Hardy, starring Dafne Keen (Logan), Sophie Nélisse (Yellowjackets), Sky Yang (Rebel Moon), Percy Hynes White (My Old Ass) and Nick Frost (How to Train Your Dragon).


	The film will be released wide in theaters at a date not yet disclosed. Black Bear is handling international sales.


	Owen Egerton adapted the screenplay for Whistle from his own short story. The film watches as a misfit group of unwitting high school students stumble upon a cursed object, an ancient Aztec Death Whistle. Soon, they discover that blowing the whistle and the terrifying sound it emits will summon their future deaths to hunt them down. As the body count rises, the friends investigate the origins of the deadly artifact in a desperate effort to stop the horrifying chain of events that they have set in motion.

	“Whistle is made with the same heart-on-sleeve, disenfranchised-teen-spirit found in my favorite genre movies that I grew up watching,” said Hardy. “I was drawn to the mysterious mythology surrounding the ‘Death Whistle' and how it presented me with the opportunity to create a variety of cinematic, imaginative and terrifying deaths. This film is built for the big screen experience, so I can't wait for audiences to blow the WHISTLE with Independent Film Company and Shudder in cinemas!”

	Commented Adam Koehler, who serves as Director of Acquisitions and Productions for Independent Film Company, Shudder, and RLJE Films, “Corin Hardy is a master of his craft and we're overjoyed to be bringing this horrifying vision to audiences across the country. With WHISTLE, he's created a vicious and bloody treat that will stand tall among the best and scariest horror films in recent box office history.”


Whistle is produced by David Gross and Jesse Shapira for No Trace Camping, and Macdara Kelleher for Wild Atlantic Pictures. Koehler repped the buyers, with CAA Media Finance repping the filmmakers.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Kenneth Branagh, Hiam Abbass (Succession) and Boyd Holbrook (A Complete Unknown) are teaming on a feature adaptation of 2012 New Yorker article Atonement.


Atonement, which rolls cameras this month in Jordon and Texas, is about a troubled marine who seeks to reconcile with the survivors of an Iraqi family he and his unit fired on back in 2003.


	The movie is the feature directorial debut of Reed Van Dyk, who was Oscar-nominated for his 2017 short DeKalb Elementary. Based on a 911 call, that pic followed a gunman who enters an elementary school and encounters a compassionate employee.

	The ensemble trio lead the movie that comes 13 years after Dexter Filkins' resonant New Yorker article, which was also titled Atonement. Delving into the psychological and emotional aftermath of the Iraq War on both Iraqi civilians and U.S. Marines, it centered on Lu Lobello, haunted by memories of a deadly incident in Baghdad, whose journey of guilt and remorse leads him to reach out to Nora, the sole surviving member of the family he believes he may have harmed.

	Decorated British Oscar-winner Branagh (Belfast) can soon be seen in Apple TV+'s Mayday opposite Ryan Reynolds. Emmy-nominee Abbass is best known for her role as the icy Marcia Roy in Succession, while Holbrook recently played Johnny Cash in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown.


	Shooting will commence this month on Atonement, which marks the first major production to shoot at Talon Entertainment's recently renovated and reopened South Side Studios. Tim and Trevor White are producing on behalf of Star Thrower. Van Dyk will also produce alongside David Wulf and Steven Demmler of Talon Entertainment. Wayne L Rogers will EP.


	Holbrook is repped by WME, Range Media Partners, Viewpoint and Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman. Branagh is repped by WME, Berwick & Kovacik and the Gochman Law Group. Abbass is repped by Authentic and Agence Adequat. Van Dyk is represented by CAA, Entertainment 360 and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols, Feldman, Rogal, Shikora & Clark.

“Home Alone 2” and “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” icon Tim Curry made a rare public appearance on Thursday, May 15. The 79-year-old actor was seen in Los Angeles accompanied by his carer after years away from the spotlight.

In the photos obtained by DailyMail, Curry was seen leaving Gelson's supermarket while being pushed in a wheelchair. The “It” star kept it casual in a red long-sleeve shirt, black pants, and matching red sneakers. He completed the look with dark sunglasses, fitting for the sun-soaked afternoon outing. 

A post shared by Tim Curry (@officialtimcurry)

Curry's latest appearance may come as a surprise to some, as the actor has remained relatively private about his condition over the years. In 2012, the veteran actor suffered a stroke after collapsing at his home in California. The medical emergency left him partially paralyzed on one side and affected his speech, prompting a long road to recovery.

Following the life-changing stroke, which he suffered at 66 years old, Curry remained largely out of the public eye.

In April, Curry told PEOPLE that he will publish his first memoir, “Vagabond.” The book will highlight his childhood and college years, as well as his first on-stage gig. He'll also tackle the nuance of alternating between television, film, and stage acting.

Curry's memoir is set to launch on October 7, 2025, and is now available for pre-order.

A post shared by Tim Curry (@officialtimcurry)

Curry's latest outing sparked an outpouring of support online. Fans sent their heartfelt comments, expressing their admiration for the actor.

One user commented, “I actually didn't know this. Such a good actor. May he still have quality of life in some way.”

Another chimed in, “I had no idea as this has been kept relatively quiet. Very sad and a tragic reminder how our lives can be changed so dramatically in an instant.”

One fan wrote, “This man is responsible for my fear of clowns, my love of musicals. And ‘Home Alone 2' being one of my favorite films. Truly so sad,” while another said, “This news really took the wind out of my sails. All the very best, Mr. Curry.”

Some of Curry's notable roles include Dr. Frank N Furter in “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” Mr. Hector in “Home Alone 2,” and Pennywise in the horror mini-series “It.”

In 2015, Curry was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 19th annual Actors Fund Tony Awards Viewing Party in Los Angeles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans React To Jessica Simpson's ‘American Idol' Moment","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/fans-react-jessica-simpsons-american-idol/","Mon, 19 May 2025 08:30:44 GMT","

Jessica Simpson is back on TV for the first time in 15 years. The singer, 44, performed on the “American Idol” Season 23 finale on Sunday, May 18.

Simpson stepped out on stage in a stunning sparkly dress with a high slit. She also debuted dirty blonde locks—a subtle yet striking shift from her signature platinum blonde hair.

For her first performance, Simpson sang her brand new single “Blame Me.” She was later joined by eliminated contestant Josh King for a crowd-pleasing duet of her iconic 2005 rendition of “These Boots Are Made for Walkin'.”

Simpson has been gearing up for her big TV comeback. On Sunday, she shared on Instagram a behind-the-scenes look at her preparations ahead of the performance.

The singer posted a video of herself moments before the “American Idol” rehearsal. Her preparation clearly paid off when she received a standing ovation from the show's judges, Luke Bryant, Carrie Underwood, and Lionel Richie.

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Fans were quick to sound off on Simpson's return to the stage. While many were thrilled to see the singer back in the spotlight, others were more critical of her overall performance.

One Instagram user commented, “Bravo! So happy she is back with incredible new music!”

Another impressed fan wrote, “Wow, I never knew she sounded so good live. She's still got it and back on stage better than ever.”

A fan praised Simpson saying, “Kudos to her for getting on that stage and having fun. People will always have something negative to say. She looks great.”

Interestingly, not everyone's impressed with Simpson's delivery of the songs. One commenter noted, “She has a good voice, I just wish she would relax when she sings. It always seems like she's trying too hard.”

Another chimed in, “I love JS but she's always forced her voice so much instead of just finding her vocal comfort zone. She's never been strong at belting out ballads IMO.”

One user criticized, “She really just never learned how to use her voice. Perfect example of natural talent with terrible technique.”

Meanwhile, Josh King expressed his excitement about sharing the stage with Simpson, commenting, “It was an absolute honor to perform with Jessica!”

A post shared by Jessica Simpson (@jessicasimpson)

Aside from music, Simpson is also busy with her acting comeback. The “Take My Breath Away” singer is set to make a surprise appearance in the upcoming Hulu legal drama “All's Fair.”

In the trailer, Simpson is seen dramatically tossing a drink into someone's face. Despite the brief glimpse, it was more than enough to send fans into a frenzy.

“All's Fair” stars Kim Kardashian, Naomi Watts, Glenn Close, Sarah Paulson, Niecy Nash-Betts, and Teyana Taylor.

Simpson is no stranger to acting. The singer is best known for her roles in the movies “The Dukes of Hazzard,” “Employee of the Month,” and “Blonde Ambition.” She also had a recurring role in “That '70s Show” Season 5.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Is ‘American Idol' on TV Tonight?","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/airing-schedule-on-tv-tonight/","Mon, 19 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

If you're flipping through channels hoping to catch a fresh episode of “American Idol” tonight (Monday, May 19, 2025), we've got some news; it's not on. The show has already wrapped for the season. The live Season 23 finale aired last night (Sunday, May 18) on ABC in a jam-packed, three-hour event that delivered everything fans could've asked for: powerhouse vocals, big-name guest performances, and the final vote to crown this year's winner.

So yeah, no new “Idol” tonight, but that doesn't mean the party's over. There's still plenty of time (and content) to catch up on if you missed any of the madness.

Let's be real; Season 23 had more plot twists than a soap opera. The talent came in strong, but the biggest shake-up? Judge drama. Katy Perry stepped away from the panel, and in a full-circle moment, “Idol” legend Carrie Underwood stepped in. That's right… Season 4's winner became the newest face at the judges' table, joining Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie to round out the trio.

The Top 3 this season brought wildly different vibes but shared one thing in common: serious star power, which explains why they made it so far.

Missed the finale? No big deal. You can stream the entire episode (and the rest of the season) on ABC.com or Hulu. And if you just want the highlight reel, keep an eye out for clips of Jamal's winning performances—they're worth the hype.

Even though Season 23 is done, “American Idol” is far from over. According to Variety, the show's been officially renewed for Season 24, and auditions are already open. So if you've got the pipes (or just the guts) now's your shot. Head to abc.com/shows/american-idol/auditions to get started.

While there's no new episode tonight, the “Idol” buzz isn't dying down anytime soon. Consider this your reminder to catch up, rewatch your favorites, or maybe even start planning your own audition.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","""American Idol"" Season 24: Everything We Know about Next Season","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/american-idol-season-24/","Mon, 19 May 2025 14:05:00 GMT","

After an epic Season 23 finale, the stage is set for “American Idol” Season 24, slated to premiere on ABC in spring 2026. This marks the show's ninth year since its revival. Announced on May 9, 2025, the next season will promise another round of unsigned talent chasing stardom, with Ryan Seacrest returning as host and a judging panel that has fans speculating. Following Season 23's intense finale, where Jamal Roberts clinched the title after a record-breaking 26 million votes, the iconic singing competition is poised for a fresh chapter. From auditions to mentors, here's everything we know about “American Idol” Season 24.

The judging lineup remains a hot topic. Season 23 featured Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie alongside Carrie Underwood, a Season 4 winner, who replaced Katy Perry after her seven-year tenure. Underwood's debut boosted ratings to nearly 6 million for the March 2, 2025 premiere, American Songwriter reported. Her return for Season 24 is unconfirmed, with her 2026 album and tour potentially conflicting with filming. Potential replacements include Kelly Clarkson, who declined in 2024 for family reasons, Alicia Keys, who is known for  her soulful expertise, and Post Malone, a genre-blending wildcard. Bryan and Richie, fixtures since 2018, are likely to stay, but no confirmation has emerged, keeping fans on edge.

An exact premiere date is pending, but “American Idol” typically airs in February or March, with Season 24 expected around March 2026, TV Insider predicted. Past seasons launched on March 11, 2018 (Season 16), Feb. 14, 2021 (Season 19), and March 2, 2025 (Season 23), establishing a late-winter trend. Production is underway, with online auditions open since May 9. In-person auditions in cities like Los Angeles and Nashville will filter talent for the judges' round. Filming will likely mirror Season 23, with Hollywood Week at Los Angeles' Orpheum Theatre and Top 24 performances at Disney's Aulani Resort in Hawaii.

Season 24 will retain its core format: auditions, Hollywood Week, a Showstopper Round, and live shows ending in a May finale. The “platinum ticket,” introduced in Season 20, will return, allowing judges to advance up to three contestants directly to Hollywood Week's second round, as seen with Season 23's Kolbi Jordan, Filo Ebid, and Canaan James Hill, Parade noted. Aulani mentors, a staple since Season 20, will feature big names, following Season 23's Josh Groban, Ashanti, and Jelly Roll, who debuted as the show's first mentors on set. No Season 24 mentors are confirmed, but X speculation suggests stars like Lainey Wilson or Pink. The “Idol Arena,” where over a hundred contestants faced random solo auditions in Season 23, may return for added intensity.

Season 24 aims to capitalize on Season 23's momentum, where Jamal Roberts won with his soulful “Heal,” outperforming John Foster and Breanna Nix in a star-studded finale featuring Patti LaBelle, Jessica Simpson, and The War and Treaty, EntertainmentNow reported. The show's talent-spotting prowess shined with performances like Foster's “Tell That Angel I Love Her,” dedicated to his late friend, and Nix's emotional “Higher,” both released as singles with 19 Recordings, American Songwriter noted. Expect themed weeks like Disney Night or Rock and Roll Hall of Fame tributes, with live voting via phones, apps, and text. Seacrest, the show's consistent and iconic host since 2002, remains its heart. Producers teased “fresh surprises” to keep viewers engaged, TV Insider noted. The finale, likely May 17, 2026, on ABC and Hulu, will crown the next star, cementing “American Idol's” pop-culture legacy.

Tom Cruise is looking to do the impossible: Act for almost a century. The former teen star turned Hollywood icon (turned mega action producer turned stuntman) told The Hollywood Reporter that he has no plans to retire…ever. 

“I will never stop. I will never stop doing action, I will never stop doing drama, comedy films — I'm excited,” Cruise said when asked about his former statement that like Harrison Ford, he will keep acting into his 80s. Cruise also had one amendment: “I actually said I'm going to make movies into my 80s; actually, I'm going to make them into my 100s.” 

 










The “Mission: Impossible – the Final Reckoning” star added that filmmaking is constantly a learning process. “There's been so many levels of reward with the filmmakers that I've collaborated with, the crews, the people, the cultures that we've worked in. Everything that I've learned and continue to learn about storytelling, about life, about leadership, about character and every aspect of filmmaking,” Cruise said. “It's been exceptional, it really is exceptional. I feel very fortunate to be able to make the films that I make and I love it. I love just making movies.”

Just don't expect Cruise to be hanging off a biplane again in his 100s: The actor confirmed that “Mission: Impossible – the Final Reckoning” is in fact his final appearance as franchise lead Ethan Hunt. “It's the final! It's not called ‘final' for nothing,” he said. 

He is, however, reprising his role for a third “Top Gun” and also plans on collaborating with Michael B. Jordan on a feature. “I'm a huge fan of Michael B. Jordan, that film ‘Sinners' is amazing,” Cruise told ET. “We're going to make a movie together.” 

Cruise continued that he is looking to foster the next generation of actors, as evidenced by his mentorship of Glen Powell and more rising talents. “I think there are so many other talented actors out there that I want to see crush it,” he said. Cruise further pointed to other blockbusters set for this summer, including “Ballerina” starring Ana de Armas and “F1” with Brad Pitt.

Four years after Julia Ducournau won the Palme d'Or with her jaw-dropping body horror car sex drama “Titane,” the filmmaker is back on the Cannes Croisette with her “Alpha.”

Ducournau's third feature which, like “Titane,” will be distributed by Neon, centers on a titular teen whose life is upended after a mysterious decision. The film‘s official logline reads: “Alpha (Mélissa Boros) is a troubled 13 year old who lives with her single mom (Golshifteh Farahani). Their world collapses the day she returns from school with a tattoo on her arm.” Tahar Rahim, Emma Mackey, Finnegan Oldfield, and Louai El Amrousy star.

 










“Alpha” is premiering in competition at Cannes, with Ducournau being one of seven female directors with new films in the main competition. Kelly Reichardt will also launch “The Mastermind,” while Mascha Schilinski has “Sound of Falling,” Lynne Ramsay has “Die My Love,” along with Hafsia Herzi's “La Petite Dernière,” Chie Hayakawa's “Renoir,” and Carla Simón's “Romeria.”

While it's unclear yet if “Alpha” will thematically tie to Ducournau's earlier feature films “Raw” and “Titane,” the filmmaker told IndieWire in 2021 that she does enjoy having “small Easter eggs” across her filmography. However, she added to Vanity Fair in 2025, “I realized that I was saying something I'd already said in my two previous films. I got bored with it — and annoyed with myself for allowing myself to stay in that comfort zone. From film to film, I always feel like I can go further in the way I expose myself, which is incredibly hard to do.”

Ducournau continued, “With each film, I'm thinking that I can put myself in a more vulnerable place, in order to relate to the audience more and more,” she says. “And I'm not done digging. It's an eternal path: How can I be more sincere? How can I get closer to my emotions? How can I show them in a more precise way, with more generosity? To me, that is the only path. That's why I make films.” 

Ducournau previously announced an A24 TV series in the works in addition to “Alpha”; IndieWire can confirm the project is still in the works.

Neon will premiere “Alpha” in theaters this fall. Check out the teaser below.

It's hard these days to create an original film from scratch, tougher still to launch a first film in the Cannes Selection. Three actors have achieved that feat this year, all playing in Un Certain Regard, where the spotlight tends to be less harsh: Scarlett Johansson's “Eleanor the Great,” starring American veteran June Squibb; Kristen Stewart's “The Chronology of Water,” starring British actress Imogen Poots; and from the U.K., Harris Dickinson‘s “Urchin,” which will propel Frank Dillane (son of British actor Stephen Dillane) into Best Actor Oscar contention if a distributor does right by it. All the key North American distributors attended the debut on Saturday after good word leaked out of early New York screenings. Yes, it played well.

“The applause was lovely,” said Dickinson, sitting with Dillane on the roof of the J.W. Marriott Hotel with stunning views of the Gulf of Napoule. “We soaked it all in. We had all of our crew. We felt the love in the room. That's a good feeling, to have given so much to somebody.”

Dickinson, who has yet to crack 30, has been a rising star ever since he broke out in Eliza Hittman's New York indie “Beach Rats” in 2017, followed by Ruben Östlund's “Triangle of Sadness,” which won the Palme d'Or en route to a Best Picture nomination. The actor has written and directed countless shorts, which gave financiers confidence to back his riveting portrait of a struggling London addict (Dillane) who is by turns charming, manipulative, desperate, angry, violent, loving, joyful, childlike, and needy.

It still took six years for “Urchin” to get to Cannes. Dickinson started writing the script after working in Walthamstow on an outreach project “that was focusing on furniture reissue with people that were unhoused,” he said. “It was a way for them to make money. And it was also a commune where they could have a safe haven. There were welfare checks, and people close to me struggled with cyclical behavior. I've always tried to be compassionate around that and tried to understand why and how people have ended up in certain positions.”

Dickinson auditioned many actors but offered the role to Dillane early on. “I'd seen him in ‘Fear of the Walking Dead' years before,” said Dickinson. “I was intrigued about him as a performer. But then we didn't cross paths, or we never met each other. The script for me was one thing. I knew that it needed an actor to come in and elevate it and change it and turn it upside down as well. Because there's only so much a script takes you, right? And that's what he did. He was doing tai chi and breathing exercises whilst he was doing the scene: ‘This is very strange, and it's perfect for the character.'”

 










It took a couple of years to get made once Dillane was on board. “Frank attached before we had full finance, which is rare for an actor to do,” said Dickinson. “We were lucky that Frank believed in the project enough to just say, ‘Yeah, I'm game.' And we already were prepping, even though we didn't know we were going to make it.”

As soon as he read the script, Dillane was eager to jump on board. “I remember I called you because I got the part,” Dillane said to Dickinson, “because I just wanted to say ‘yes' straight away. I didn't want there to be any lag, to go through the agents. You were in Berlin, so I was recording ‘Yes, I'll do it.' The script lent itself to almost anything. It was a real opportunity to carve out our own narrative, because it was ambiguous as to what the arc was, and it seemed like the arcs completed in each scene.  It was almost like Mike had no throughline, and I found that exciting as an actor, to do each scene separate from the next one. He almost lived and breathed now. He was born again, and then he dies again, and then he goes there, and he's born again. And I loved that about Harris's script, because it was completely unconventional.” 

In one heartbreaking scene, after seven months sober, Mike takes some ketamine with his girlfriend and her parents and is dancing and having a joyous time. He feels like he's part of the family, everybody's happy and good, and then he takes too much, and he can't contain it. He doesn't know where to stop. 

 










Dillane had played an addict during “Fear the Walking Dead.” “When a character is on drugs at different times,” said Dillane, “I always tend to research the spiritual element of the drug. From researching ‘Fear the Walking Dead,' the idea about heroin that got me was the idea that your cells are living and dying constantly, so you're constantly dying and being reborn. That stuck with me a bit with this, the idea of physically continuing to be born and dying.”

The movie works because Dillane makes you care about this deeply flawed yet innocent character. “People that have gone to the brink of behavior,” said Dickinson, “the brink of morality, or brink of themselves, often are also joyous and naïve, because it helps them forget. It's like an optimism that is in the moment for today.”

“He is innocent,” said Dillane. “That was the core of it. In order for us to be with him and to empathize with him, we have to just forgive him. And the reason we forgive him is he's a child, he's innocent, he's an orphan. He's not a bad person, just an open window. Harris kept distilling this thing of hope within me. We talked a lot about dignity in Harris. And that allowed the authenticity. So when he's making a friend, this friend that he's making is so important to him. When he relapses, it's like family, ‘Finally, my people, oh, this is OK. Now, this is what we do. Everyone's just cool.' Some of us, we can't do that. Unfortunately, Mike is one of those. It's like an open window. Once you open it, you can't close it again.”

 










Of course, Mike Leigh and “Naked” came to mind while prepping the film, but also “Career Girls” and “High Hopes,” said Dickinson, “there's no misses with Mike Leigh. I love his use of humor. He's so good at humanizing the mundane as well. It's important, because there's comedy in the simplicity of things sometimes, he does that so well.”

Another reason why Dillane wanted to work with Dickinson was that he admired his short films. “This was a big reason I did it,” said Dillane. Dickinson had been shooting shorts, including a series of skateboard videos, since he was 10 or 11. “I made loads of short films,” he said. “And then I made a more professional short film with BBC that led to the theatrical film. It was quite a rudimentary short, but it was a way for us to try and prove a little bit.”

As production loomed, Dickinson lost one of his actors in a key role playing a friend of Mike's and reluctantly took on the role himself. “We auditioned people,” said Dickinson. “We got some tapes in, but I got a bit protective over that role because this is a member of the community. This is someone who is struggling, a vulnerable individual. Frank had months and months of research and time spent with advisors to understand this world and these issues. I couldn't just expect an actor to pop in a week before and get that kind of person, whereas I'd been doing that work.”

 










It may have been the right decision, but it wasn't easy, said Dickinson. “It was hard to direct myself and also be in a scene with someone you're directing, because I started to lose track of the background and what things were happening. And you get even more neurotic; acting is neurotic.”

The film deploys long lens cinematography to capture Dillane on crowded streets. “We always knew we wanted to enter into Mike's world in a pragmatic and simplistic way, unromantic and not trying to do trickery around life on the streets,” said Dickinson. “We wanted to be observational and simplistic, and that was also to avoid any romanticism around it, but also just to ground it in that community. That was always important to us, and the story that we enter into as well. We believe it and we understand it, and we get a real sense of it. And then we allow ourselves to introduce surrealism, a slightly different language. We earned that.”

Next up: Dillane is going home to London to do some auditions. (His stock is going to rise considerably after “Urchin.”) And Dickinson is following up “Babygirl” and “Blitz” as John Lennon in Sam Mendes' series of four Beatles films. Dickinson swears he'll have time to do other things as well. “I wrote this script whilst I was working,” he said, “I didn't take time out to write the script. I was always writing. I write when I'm on a plane. I'll be able to write and direct still. I'll have to finish the films first.”

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Season 2, Episode 6. For previous coverage, check out last week's review.]

“The Last of Us” Episode 6 is built around a dead man, so it's only fitting that so much of it is shaped by ghosts. Ghosts, after all, are just echoes of the past; reminders of what should not or could not be forgotten, because of how much those memories mean, or because they still have something to teach.

“I just really wanted to wear short-sleeves again,” Ellie (Bella Ramsey) says to Joel (Pedro Pascal). It's 2023, and a nearly 15-year-old Ellie comes home with her arm wrapped in gauze after burning it with a hot pan. The implication, of course, is that she did it on purpose. Ellie already has a scar on her arm from when an infected bit her, which proved her immunity, but she has to hide that scar from everyone — hence the perpetual long sleeves — and it's exhausting. Her immunity is a secret that's difficult to bear, and anything Ellie can do to lighten the load — even if it's just being able to wear lighter clothes on warm days — is worth a few hours of pain.

“I really wanted to wear short sleeves again,” Ellie says to Dina (Isabela Merced). It's 2029, and Ellie wakes up next to the woman she loves, who's asking about her arm. The night before, an infected bit Ellie — again. Looking closely in the morning light, Dina can see more than just the freshest wound. There's a burn under her tattoo. “You did it to yourself?” Dina asks, to which Ellie echoes the reasoning she gave to Joel, years ago. The tattoo, the burn, the bites — they connect Ellie's past and present; they connect her loved ones, too: Joel and Dina.

“If I were ever to lose you, I'd surely lose myself,” Joel sings to Ellie. It's 2023, and Joel has just given Ellie a guitar for her 15th birthday. He got her a cake, too, but while Seth (Robert John Burke) did the baking, Joel put the guitar together himself. He sourced the parts, carved the pieces, and tuned it up just for Ellie. She doesn't know how to play — yet — so she asks him to sing something for her, and he chooses Pearl Jam's “Future Days.”

The song frames Episode 6 well. We get to see the days Joel cherished most — the ones he spent with Ellie, the “days of you and me” — knowing he won't get as many of them as he would've liked. But it's those opening lyrics that haunt Ellie six years later, in Episode 5, when she picks up a different guitar in a Seattle theater and sits down to sing. “If I were ever to lose you,” she starts, but she can't go on. Is it the memory of Joel that stops her, or is it the lyrics themselves?

 










“If I were ever to lose you, I'd surely lose myself.” That forecast held true for Joel, as it applied to his daughters. He lost who he was for a long time after losing Sarah (Nico Parker), and the memory of that loss is what drove him to “save” Ellie for himself. Now, Ellie is on the same path. Her “you” is Joel, and now she's lost him. But will she lose herself, just as he did? The memory that makes her stop singing, the ghost in the auditorium with her, maybe it can also turn her heart toward mercy again.

Episode 6 reframes many-a-scene from throughout Season 2. Joel and Ellie's trip to the museum lends heartbreaking meaning to her appreciation of astronauts, like the doomed Apollo 1 explorers she mentions to Dina in Episode 4 when they first enter Seattle. On the flipside, Ellie's angry message to Joel after he knocked Seth over on New Year's Eve — “I don't need your help” — is given shattering significance to Joel, who was just told by his sister-in-law, Maria (Rutina Wesley), that “families help each other.” If Ellie doesn't want Joel's help, is she really still his family? 

Directed by series co-creator (and video game architect) Neil Druckmann and written by Druckmann, Halley Gross, and Craig Mazin, the episode also adds key context to how Joel and Ellie ended up in a cold war to start Season 2, like the fight they have when Kat (Noah Lamanna) gives Ellie her moth tattoo. (Side note: Kat and Ellie's tender familiarity when Joel walks in on them in Episode 6 stands in stark contrast to their icy remove in the premiere, when they're out on patrol.) Joel tries to understand its meaning but that matters less to Ellie than his initial repudiation of her sexuality. (“It wasn't a fucking experiment,” she says.) Plus, Joel being Joel, he still misses the point. The moths, as Gail later informs him, are more about death than rebirth: Ellie can't get past her failed attempt to die for a cause; to give her life, her immunity, a “greater purpose.” 

 










Two years later — after moving out of the house and into the garage — Ellie is working up the nerve to tackle her issue with Joel head-on. She's prepared a list of questions to ask him about what really happened in Salt Lake City. But then Eugene (Joe Pantoliano) gets bit, and Joel kills him. It's not the death that gets to Ellie, although one gets the sense she was friendly with Eugene; it's the lie. Another lie. “You swore,” she seethes at Joel, after coldly, selfishly exposing the truth of her husband's death to Gail. He'd promised to walk Eugene back to Jackson and let him see his wife one more time. Instead, he walked him to a lake and shot him. He lied to Eugene, and he lied to Ellie.

“You looked me in the eyes and it was the same face,” Ellie says. “The same fucking look.” It's nine months later, on New Year's Eve. Ellie is finally ready to confront Joel. His ghost has caught up to him. Ellie sees it — she sees it in Joel's face, when he promises to take Eugene back to Gail, just as she saw it five years prior, when he promised he was telling the truth about Salt Lake City. Now, he has no choice but to address it.

“Making a cure would've killed you,” Joel says. “Then I was supposed to die,” Ellie wails. “That was my purpose. My life would've fucking mattered. You took that from me. You took that from everyone.”

 










Joel is simultaneously crushed by the weight of his betrayal yet resolved enough to keep shouldering the burden. He says he would do it again. He's willing to pay the price, and after spending just a few days with Ellie over the five years he got with her, it's easy to see why he would risk everything just to have that time with her. 

“[It's] because you're selfish,” Ellie says.

“[It's] because I love you,” Joel replies. 

In “The Last of Us,” those two feelings aren't mutually exclusive but inescapably linked. Love is selfish. Put another way, as Mazin did in an interview, “Love is immoral. It's immoral because it doesn't follow rules. […] Love is the problem.” That belief reverberates throughout the series, whether it's in Joel's actions in Salt Lake City, Kathleen's (Melanie Lynskey) actions in Kansas City, Abby's (Kaitlyn Dever) actions outside of Jackson, or Ellie's actions thus far in Seattle.

But the opposite is also true. Love can be the solution. Frank (Murray Bartlett) and Bill (Nick Offerman) proved as much by turning a dystopia into a utopia (especially Frank, whose love transcended Bill by extending to others). Ellie's love for Riley (Storm Reid) was pure and good, too. Her love for Joel saved him from the love he lost with Sarah, and it saved him again that night, when she told him, “I don't think I can forgive you for this. But I would like to try.”

 










Mercy. Sweet mercy. If Abby hadn't caught up to Joel the next day, who knows what his life would've become? What he could've done, who he could've been, now that he'd been forgiven? Ellie's implicit forgiveness is so powerful because it upends expectations; what feels at first like the definitive nail in a heartbreaking split instead reverses course to become a staggering gesture of compassion. In just a few seconds, our hearts are broken and healed.

Love can be the problem or the solution, and never is that clearer than in Episode 6's loudest echo, which is first heard from Joel's dad (played by the great Tony Dalton). It's 1983, and Joel is protecting his little brother, Tommy, from a beating they know one of them has to endure. Joel and Tommy are afraid of their father, but the aging sheriff doesn't see himself that way. “OK, yeah I've hit you. And I've hit Tommy,” he says. “But never like [my father hit me]. Not even close. Maybe I go too far. […] But I'm doing a little better than my father did. And when it's your turn, I hope you do a little better than me.”

It's 2028, New Year's Eve, and Joel is trying to explain himself to his daughter, just like his dad once tried to explain himself to Joel. “I love you,” Joel says, “in a way you can't understand. Maybe you never will. But if that day should come, if you should ever have one of your own, well then, I hope you do a little better than me.”

 










It's 2029. Ellie is in Seattle, and that day has come. Can she find the mercy she was once ready to show Joel, or did she lose that part of herself when she lost him? Episode 6 proves she hasn't forgotten who she was; she remembers the moments that mattered with Joel, and those ghosts still have lessons to share with Ellie. They're trying to bring back the person she once was and, maybe, can be again. 

“The Last of Us” releases new episodes Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max. The Season 2 finale will premiere May 25.

An “old-world” quality suffuses Grails' new album Miracle Music, co-founder Emil Amos has said. It's something that runs deeper than the Eastern Orthodox aesthetics that have often cloaked the Portland band's records, or the influences from South Asian music and pulp zombie and Western soundtracks that give their music such a distinctive whiff of countercultural freakiness—it's more akin to the sensation you feel in Tristan und Isolde when the wall of strings kicks in, or upon beholding a bruise-colored canvas by El Greco or Velázquez. Miracle Music is one of Grails' most painterly records, but the swaths of color only occasionally cohere into an image.

This is the second album from the revamped Grails lineup featuring multi-instrumentalists Ilyas Ahmed, Jesse Bates, and AE Paterra alongside the core duo of Amos and Alex Hall. Coming less than two years after 2023's Anches En Maat, it's their fastest turnaround between albums since their early days, but while that record brimmed with '70s funk-rarity grandeur, this one operates on a much lower register. The drums are reduced to a patient cymbal tap, only occasionally breaking into a groove. The dynamic interplay is subtle, with ambient soup yielding reluctant rhythms; the destination of these nine tracks is the point of departure for most other Grails songs.

The boldest new splashes on the canvas are the horn arrangements—courtesy of Kelly Pratt, who's lent marching-band pomp to everyone from Beirut to Bob's Burgers—and a malignant swirl of sampled choir that swoops through the margins like a ghost. The cleverest moments on the album come courtesy of these new toys, not least when “Silver Bells” peaks with a brass fanfare so pompous and triumphant you half expect Underdog to fly in and save the day, or when “Strange Paradise” fades into a doleful horn solo that'll inspire nods of recognition in anyone who knows the name Dick Parry.

By no coincidence, those are the moments that push the music furthest toward filmic cheese. Calling instrumental rock “Morriconean” is a little like calling a movie Lynchian at this point, but film music runs deep in the band's DNA. Paterra plays with kino-proggers Zombi, named in tribute to one of the great '70s horror films, and Grails' recent list of recommended records for Aquarium Drunkard is full of soundtracks to films you've probably never heard of. Miracle Music shines when it channels these influences, as on the high Western drama of “Harmonious Living,” whose tension and twang would've made a great theme from a primetime TV show in the quasi-Western backwash of Breaking Bad. But aimless tracks like “Primeval Lite I-III” and “Earthly Life” feel too much like watching a movie where you find yourself zoning out no matter how much you try to pay attention.

Grails have framed the album as an antidote to Spotify-era complacency, with Amos initially envisioning an album sleeve that resembled an old industrial record: “We thought the record was going to have that spirit,” he told Sun 13, “an attitude where you throw your body into the gears of society to try and stop the machine.” Grails are too skunky and weird to endear themselves to playlist gatekeepers, and that shows no signs of changing—but shouldn't music with such an attitude grab you, rather than fading into the margins of consciousness like so much indica smoke?

When it comes to being the drippiest brand an ascendant rapper could wear, nothing beats Chrome Hearts right now. And out of all the Chrome Hearts pieces MIKE could have purchased for a courtside fit at a recent Knicks game, he chose a pair of understated eyeglasses for $2000. It was a fittingly chill pick-up from a luxury label known for flashy silver jewelry and jeans that vibe more with Playboi Carti. But like Clark Kent throwing on a pair of specs to blend in with the masses, MIKE's new Tony Seltzer-produced Pinball II demonstrates how even indie hip-hop's superhero sometimes hangs up his cape to make some viciously fun flex raps on his own terms.

When MIKE first emerged in the 2010s, his pensive coming-of-age raps sharply contrasted the hyperactive, ethereal energy of clout-goggled SoundCloud rap contemporaries. But since then, MIKE's music has brightened under a spotlight that's turned him into an underground icon on par with mentor Earl Sweatshirt. Pinball II doesn't boast Opium-style rage beats or radio-ready singles ripe for a Weeknd feature; instead MIKE shares a recipe for rock-star aura on “WYC4,” where slowly dripped raps weave a come-up story about rejecting the hustler's lifestyle to grind for the rap money that earned him “Cartier like Playboi.” Like most MIKE songs, there's just one verse effortlessly tied together with a fleeting hook. It's up to Seltzer's ear-rattling distorted bass and intergalactic synths to elevate MIKE's matter-of-fact raps to nearly the same heights as the rocket ship producer Harry Fraud commanded on Carti's “Location.”

If there's any beatmaker prepared to counter the viral narrative that the pit at a MIKE show is a place to read a book or play chess, it's Brooklyn-based Seltzer, who electrified last year's Pinball. By the time Seltzer first linked with MIKE on 2017's May God Bless Your Hustle, he was already orchestrating a generation of local New York talent with beats that could turn tiny Brooklyn DIY venues into Travis Scott-esque rage pits. Whether it was high-octane drill slaps for Brooklyn outfit Gloss Gang, ghoulish beats for Lower East Side tread rap demon Trippjones, or gothic trap ballads for Uptown Manhattan's Vinny Fanta, a “Hey Tony” tag promised to shake the room as hard as any 2016 XXL Freshman. Seltzer's track record with artists like Wiki and Jay Critch demonstrates his dexterity: meeting artists where they're at while constructing a distinct sound of his own, shaped by everything from old VHS-tape samples to death metal drums.

Pinball II has plenty in common with its predecessor. Opener “Sin City” maintains the crash-through-the-wall velocity of Pinball intro “Two Door” with blaring horns and horror-movie strings that evoke Lex Luger's production on Flockaveli. Snappier Pinball standouts like “Skurr” are rivaled by Pinball II tracks such as “#71,” where MIKE stitches lines about growing up wearing True Religion and North Face into a bouncy instrumental that's almost like a refreshed DJ Webstar litefeet beat. He again taps unexpected collaborators: co-producer Clams Casino on “Prezzy,” Lunchbox for an hypnotizing Auto-Tuned hook on “Dolomite.” It's a more digestible iteration of MIKE that feels authentic to him, not the kind engineered by a major label A&R.

What's new about this hidden MIKE character that Pinball II unlocks for a second playthrough is that he sounds more self-assured both in his take on “stadium rap” and in the introspection typically more apparent on albums like Showbiz. Even Pinball II's most upbeat tracks, “Money & Power” and “Dont Force It,” nod to the pitfalls of fame. The theme is explicit on closer “Chest Painz,” where MIKE plainly states, “I need money, I could do with even less fame/All the love I felt was screwed up in the best way” over a somber Seltzer beat that feels attuned to the sound of his earliest albums. It's the raw honesty that's shaped him into one of the most captivating rappers to emerge from New York's underground over the past decade. On Pinball II, he displays this vulnerability with a smile—no prescription lenses necessary to alter his vision.

Manufacturing jobs may not be coming back, but industrial is in. Since its commercial high point in the mid-1990s, when you could say “I wanna fuck you like an animal” to the percussive hiss of a steam valve opening and headline the Woodstock sequel, the often-brutal, occasionally ridiculous form of machine music has mostly stayed underground. Blame it on '90s nostalgia, or on the world's drift toward the kind of ruinous techno-wasteland that birthed industrial in the first place, but it's suddenly everywhere. Folk singers are wearing demon horns. Superstars are fawning over Trent Reznor, who is himself preparing for Nine Inch Nails' first world tour in several years. The record that most fully captures the rank spirit of 2025—aya's hexed!—is a blown-out collage of panic and distorted beats forged by an artist from Manchester, a city whose fortunes rose and crashed with the Industrial Revolution so dramatically it helped to birth communism. On Yours, With Malice, Youth Code return after half a decade to a cultural moment primed for their throat-bleeding industrial and EBM with an EP that hammers away so relentlessly, it pounds the line between machine and human into dust.

While their music has always borrowed as heavily from hardcore and metal as from the likes of Front 242 and :wumpscut:, Youth Code's records have never been as intense and messy as they feel like they should. While that tension between snarling attitude and relatively accessible music made for compelling listening, it suddenly feels pale in the light of Yours, With Malice. The five-song EP is the first new music Sara Taylor and Ryan George have released since 2021's King Yosef collaboration A Skeleton Key in the Doors of Depression and their first true Youth Code record in nearly a decade. It feels like Youth Code mk2, a hard reset of their sound in which the specter of violence that's always haunted their music comes fully alive, drenched in sweat and showered in sparks.

Taylor's vocals have always been the key to Youth Code's music, and on Yours, With Malice, they charge forward, in lock-step with the frying synths and programmed d-beat drums. While EBM and industrial singers can sometimes come off as the magician at the controls of the throbbing machine, her agender bark seems to come from within the machine itself, as if her veins are fused into oil lines. She commands these songs as if she's a hardcore singer, and the music believes her. “I'll never pretend to be something I'm not,” she spits in the chorus of opener “No Consequence,” and you can see her lashing at the crowd on each syllable. Textures clash all around her—fist-pumping drums, overheating synths, a sinister keyboard line, everything on the edge of misfiring. It's like someone poured vinegar into New Order's circuitry. She screams the bitter triumph of “In Search of Tomorrow”'s chorus like she's flinging her convictions into an angry sky.

“No Consequence” and “Wishing Well,” which follows it, are thrillingly boxed productions, like they're being played in a small room whose walls are creeping in. “In Search of Tomorrow,” though, blasts these small spaces apart without losing any of the built-up intensity. Taylor's melody is buzzy and breathless, and she's pulled forward by a leashed rhythm track that strains toward breakbeat. The synth pattern at the song's core, though, is a gauzy and conventionally beautiful chord progression that, ripped out of this ferocious context, could've powered a minor hit in the New Romantic '80s. While not as demanding as the EP's heavier songs, these moments are where this new version of Youth Code feels most accomplished. The airiness of that chord progression, combined with how powerfully Taylor pushes the limits of the chorus, gives the song a bittersweet tang that is, in the proper sense of the word, sublime: hostile, powerful, and awe-inspiring.

In times of urgency, menace, and social claustrophobia, it makes sense to cling to music that is vicious and confident in the righteousness of its anger. Yours, With Malice is exactly that kind of music, obviously. Nearly every second of this EP's 17 minutes is reactive, in that it feels like the result of provocation. You can feel an implied history tangled in the wake of the songs, scraps of ruined beauty and thwarted will clattering in the rear distance. Even the conceptual framing of EBM—dance music, but mean—implies a fallen state, a ruined party, a spiteful good time. In its frenzy and indignation, Yours, With Malice is powered by the adrenalized panic that comes in the moment between realizing you've been wounded and feeling the pain—a state of opportunity.

	In 2018, Shia LaBeouf was feeling heartbroken, adrift, in a state of what he called “spiritual sickness.” So the actor did what a lot of us were doing back then when we found ourselves in serious need of help: He went on Twitter. In the video that LaBeouf posted on the platform (now known as X), he declared that he had an idea. There was a space in South Central Los Angeles called the Slauson Rec Center. He was going to be there on Saturday morning, and the next Saturday, and the Saturday after that. Whoever wanted to join him was welcome to show up. It would kinda sorta be structured as a “class,” though don't expect acting lessons. LaBeouf was really looking for collaborators for some to-be-determined project. Previous industry experience was not required. Participants just needed to have “a story that needs telling.” And they had to be devoted to the truth. Being 100 percent truthful is a big deal to LaBeouf. Remember that thought.


	One of the people who answered the call was a 21-year-old from Texas named Leo Lewis O'Neil. A relatively recent transplant to the City of Angels, he'd been having a rough time since he arrived. The thought of not only meeting a movie star but getting in on the ground floor of some bold new creative endeavor that LaBeouf was willing into motion felt too good to pass up. Plus the center was five minutes from where he lived. The first Saturday was more of a happening than a class, to be honest. But there was an unpredictable, live-wire energy to the exercises and exchanges that was undeniable.

	











	A budding filmmaker, O'Neil had brought along a camera out of habit. LaBeouf had been happy to let him film everything. The next Saturday, he asked LaBeouf if he could be the official archivist of what would soon be known as the Slauson Rec Theater Company. The actor said yes.

	Years later, long after the chairs had all been thrown, and the jet-engine-level screaming had died down, and the tears had dried, and what had been a beacon of hope for a handful of artists-in-training was dashed on the rocks of one man's inability to hold his inner demons at bay, O'Neil asked LaBeouf another question. Could he turn the footage he'd been sitting on into a documentary regarding what went wrong? It'd have to be 100 percent truthful, LaBeouf replied. But the actor once again said yes. Thank god he did. Otherwise, we would not have what is one of the most damning, unfiltered, take-no-prisoners portrait of a celebrity losing his shit ever recorded for posterity.

	Premiering at the Cannes Film Festival on Sunday night, Slauson Rec captures the good, the bad, and the ugly of the company's two-years-and-change existence. But to suggest that the end result is a three-way tie would be a lie; the “ugly” wins by a mile here. Documenting how LaBeouf's growing impatience with the group eventually led to biblical rage spirals, physical assaults, and some truly Grade-A asshole behavior, it paints a truly terrifying picture of its subject. Even if O'Neil signals this is a work of love for his old mentor, LaBeouf still comes off like a monster. Those who care to bask in the Shia-denfreude of seeing more evidence of his nastiness presented to the public will be in heaven. The rest of us are simply forced to watch between our fingers as the celebrity-driven car wrecks keep getting exponentially worse.


	All that sound and fury and Category 5 temper tantrums come later, naturally. Slauson Rec treats those glorious early days, filled with endless promise and all-access star adjacency, in a way that mirrors the students' own swooning. LaBeouf has given these dreamers not just a safe place to fail, but a “laboratory” where they can indulge their imagination alongside someone with the juice to make moves. He offers encouragement, excitement, and the sense that they're all an equal part of his mission to make “as many creative churches as possible.” O'Neil also singles out a few of Shia's apostles, notably Zeke, a Hispanic twentysomething with the modest goal of becoming “one of the greatest actors of all time,” and an earnest, horse-loving young woman named Sarah. They might seem like random choices to put the spotlight on. Spoiler: They are not.

	Yet the overall focus is on the utopian community orbiting around the intense figurehead. Not even handwringing over the way their presence affects the South Central community around them — are they being inclusive enough? Socially responsible enough? — and losing their original space slows them down. When they begin workshopping 10 minutes of a larger piece LaBeouf calls “The New Human” to show the public, the vibe is one part “Let's put on a show” enthusiasm and one part Kool-Aid-sipping cult. The positive reception they get to what feels like a modern-dance reinterpretation of The Human Centipede is enough make them think that their fearless leader's goal of changing the world is just around the corner.


	Cut to: March 2020. The pandemic saps some of the company's momentum, and Zoom meetings tend to devolve into power plays among competing politburos, with LaBeouf exercising veto power. Everyone's frustrated. No one wants to give up. The solution to their stasis is a drama set in a Covid testing set that will combine theater, improvisation, and cinema. Called 5711 Avalon, it will be performed in a parking lot and is destined to become, in LaBeouf's words, “a Cirque du Soleil-sized epic.” By this point, O'Neil has already shown us what happens when the group's guru gets pissed, courtesy of a scene in which he raises his voice over what he feels is unsatisfactory focus and storms off. Once they start rehearsing in the outdoor space, Shia's short fuse has become even shorter. One day, the players' rendition of this slowly evolving work is the second coming of Death of a Salesman. The next day, it's total “dog shit.” Cryptic, contradictory notes are given, and when they're not followed to the letter, things get volatile. You can sense the storm on the horizon moving closer, closer, closer.…

	











	And when it arrives, its gale-force winds designed to destroy everything in its path, good luck. Slauson Rec doesn't sugarcoat or soft-peddle the scenes in which LaBeouf unleashes torrents of high-volume verbal abuse, or shirtlessly skulks around a set in which no actor or folding chair is safe, or seriously hulks out over an actor he feels is giving him “attitude.” It simply presents them as you stare on, slack-jawed in disbelief. There is no other way to describe LaBeouf attacking the smaller, younger Zeke or backing another actor up against a wall, his forearm on the guy's throat, than “assaults.” The threat of violence hangs over every single scene as the rehearsals start to tick into the 70-days-in-a-row mark, punctured only by moments of actual violence. Sarah, the most devoted of Shia's disciples, refuses to see her sick mom at the hospital because she's afraid missing a rehearsal will get her fired. LaBeouf waits until she goes to her mom's funeral. Then, having run her scenes with another actor he deems worthy in her absence, he fires her.


	These are the cringeworthy, can't-look-away moments, and there are many, that people will talk about when they talk about Slauson Rec. And trust us when we say they are genuinely hard to stomach. You feel embarrassment for LaBeouf, who is clearly (and self-admittedly) turning his inner monologue of self-loathing into outer tirades of abuse on those who simply want to please him. He's the first to tell you he's his own worst enemy — but listen, my frogs, why did you let a scorpion like me climb onto your backs? You feel empathy for those stuck in this cycle along with him. You feel your own rage as you clock that his celebrity is, in the eyes of many helping to facilitate this ongoing experiment, allowing him a free pass to be ghastly. (Sarah actually calls this out. It doesn't help her.) The idea that genius forgives all, and the favoring of “honesty” above all means never having to admit you're just an asshole at heart, is rigorously tested here. None of this shit is excusable. It's a portrait of an artist as an authoritarian megalomaniac.

	When O'Neil caps off this two-and-a-half-hour labor of love with a coda, which takes place two years after the final performance of 5711 Avalon and the dissolution of the group, he does manage to capture two extraordinary moments of honesty. He's arrived at LaBeouf's house, and is recording a sort of postmortem interview. The star says that he's signing off on this because it's “the ultimate virtue signal.” Look how cool I look for being cool with this, he says, letting his self-knowingness wrestle it out with his self-hatred and self-regard. That's the first bit. The second comes when LaBeouf admits that he owes everybody apologies, some more than others. He's not sure he can make amends, but he wants to try. And you can suddenly hear crying happening behind the camera. O'Neil lets the shot go on for an uncomfortably long time, his sobs audible and LaBeouf silently choking up onscreen. 

	











	You realize that Slauson Rec is about a lot of things, from the perils of good intentions to the way fame doesn't exterminate your flaws so much as exacerbate them. But in the end, it's really an extraordinary act of grasping for closure. And it was hard not to think that, standing in the audience as a crowd of people at the world's most prestigious film festival gave him a standing ovation, O'Neil might have felt more than a little sense of closure at that point too. LaBeouf was there as well, sporting a mustache that  was a cross between 1970s cop and 1870s gunfighter. But he kept ceding the spotlight to the filmmaker, knowing that this was O'Neil's night. This doc will ultimately be the legacy of the whole Slauson Rec experiment. The star had set out to change the world. Instead, he stood back and watched as another person's life changed right in front of his eyes.

	Elmo's brief unemployment era is over. Sesame Street has found a new home at Netflix following the expiration of its contract with Warner Bros. Discovery, which began in 2016 when new episodes went into production at HBO after the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS, could no longer afford the expenses required to keep the series afloat.


	“We are excited to announce that all new Sesame Street episodes are coming to @netflix worldwide along with library episodes, and new episodes will also release the same day on @PBS Stations and@PBSKIDS platforms in the US, preserving a 50+ year relationship,” Netflix shared in a statement published on social media. “The support of Netflix, PBS, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting serve as a unique public-private partnership to enable Sesame Street to continue to help children everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder.”


	At HBO, new Sesame Street episodes would premiere nine months before they would air on PBS. Netflix plans to close the gap with its same-day release schedule beginning with Season 56.

Elmo is sad. Elmo loved his time at Sesame Street.” 


	On May 1, Trump announced an executive order demanding the end of all federal funding for NPR and PBS, on the grounds that they allegedly “receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news,'” according to a White House social media post.

This post contains spoilers for this week's episode of The Last of Us, now streaming on Max.


The Last of Us co-creator Neil Druckmann was behind the camera to direct the penultimate episode of the postapocalyptic drama's second season, and it was an imposing assignment. Within the span of an hour, Druckmann had to chronicle five years in the lives of Joel and Ellie, squeeze in a flashback to Joel's teenage years, and create fully fleshed-out versions of Joel's father and Gail's husband Eugene in the span of a couple of scenes. He had to direct Pedro Pascal after his former leading man had been off on another project after Joel was killed in the season's second episode. 


	And as the chief creative force behind the two Last of Us video games, he felt had to be even more careful than usual about giving fans of the game the moments they've been expecting to see in live-action for years.  




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Last week, Druckmann spoke with Rolling Stone about getting to direct Pascal with Bella Ramsey one more time, working with guest stars Tony Dalton and Joe Pantoliano, and whether watching Pascal and Ramsey together ever gave him any doubts about killing Joel. 

	











Logistically, was this filmed around the same time as the season's first two episodes?No. We shot out Pedro for Episode Two, then he went to work on a different project.


So even the New Year's Eve party scenes weren't filmed at the same time that Craig Mazin was shooting his version for the season premiere?  We had to restage the entire thing. I jokingly told people this must have been what it felt like for Robert Zemeckis having to shoot Back to the Future II. Luckily, I had two monitors. One monitor had what Craig shot on episode one, and the other monitor had what I was shooting live. I was able to cut in certain footage from that episode, but we had to reshoot the whole thing, including the Seth argument with Ellie and Dina from Joel's point of view.


This was a very emotional episode, and it's also likely the last episode with a lot of Pedro and Bella together. What was it like getting to direct them in this?  It's such a joy. They're so talented. They now understand these characters so much. I'm in such a unique position, because I've lived with these characters and these scenes for so long, and to get to revisit them in these scenes that mean so much to fans, but also to me personally… I was very nervous. I wanted to make sure I did it justice for not only the show, but just The Last of Us as a whole, and what the gamers are going to expect from these sequences coming off the game. In the moment, I was so pleasantly surprised by what they were putting in front of the camera. There's certain moments in live-action where you have happy accidents, like you can't plan for something. When they're in the space capsule, and Joel is asking Ellie how he did, and then you see he has this just beautiful smile on his face, and he turns, and you see the glint of a tear in his wrinkles. You don't see him cry; just that. We couldn't plan for that, and the fact that we caught it, I'm like, it's just… you just catch these beautiful moments that are just there, and then they're gone. That is the beauty of live-action.

So Pedro had been away for a while, and then he came back to play Joel one more time. Was he more emotional than usual filming this?Yes, although in the day-to-day, you wouldn't feel it. But definitely, as we were getting closer to the end, you could feel this parting of the ways coming. And then the last day, specifically, it got really emotional when we finished the last shot and we hung out for a while and just hugged it out and chatted and reminisced.


When you were making the first season of the show, and watching the magic that Pedro and Bella were making together, was there ever a moment where you reconsidered the Abby storyline? Where you thought that this kind of chemistry doesn't come along every day, and maybe you should hang onto it?No. I knew because of their chemistry, because of what they brought, how painful this would be. And it needed to be painful to tell this story. If they didn't have chemistry, I would have been worried about how we tell this story. So for me, it was more of a question of, that story can be complete, that story can live on its own. That's how we made the first game. But we put in certain changes and tweaks prepping for the next story if we got the chance to tell it. And luckily, the show was successful to such a degree that HBO was, with open arms, excited to have us continue to tell the story.

I suppose the compromise version would have been to save Abby for another season or two, and in the interim just give us more Joel and Ellie adventures during the five-year gap. Was that discussed? Yes, because we discuss everything. We even discussed what if we didn't kill Joel, just to interrogate it. Because everything should be on the table. Everything should be interrogated to make sure we're making the best choices for this version of the story. We even discussed, could we tell this other story, could we prolong this moment?  But the more we discussed it, the more it just felt wrong. It felt like we would only be doing it for business reasons, to maintain this feeling that people have for longer. But there wasn't a story there to motivate it. The inciting incident, the origin of this story is Joel's death. Any inciting incident, you have to get to it as soon as possible. What motivates this entire journey that Ellie goes on starts with Joel. 


Do you remember what was discussed about the version where you didn't kill Joel?I don't, because that was a very short conversation that didn't have any impact on us. Because we knew we were exploring something that, you know, we're not going to get much out of this, and we didn't.

	











I haven't played the games, but friends who have, told me that the porch scene, where Ellie tells Joel that she wants to try to forgive him, doesn't appear until the end of the second game. Why did you move it up to this point? The reason we moved it, and the reason it wasn't a big, difficult choice for me, is when we were making the game, we knew we wanted that scene. That scene was written. We didn't know where that scene should go, and for a long time, it was at a very different place than the end of the game. And [it went there] only when we were finishing production of the game. It's hard because I don't want to talk about why we moved it to the end, because then I get into where the show ultimately goes. But it felt appropriate for it to go there. And the way the game is delivered is, you buy the game, and then you have the whole story, and you decide how you want to experience it. The game is roughly between 20 to 30 hours, depending on how you play it. You decide, do I want to play an hour a day or an hour a week, or do I want to go through 30 hours without any sleep? People have done all those different versions, but the story is all there for you. With the show the way it's delivered, it's one-hour-ish chunks every week, and [we knew] we're not going to finish the story this season, then there's a gap, potentially a multiyear gap before we continue. Therefore, there are certain setups that are paid off that we felt in our conversation of how this story would be delivered, would be too long of a wait that potentially won't land as well as when they're contrasted here with these events. And it will become clear when you watch episode seven and see where the show goes, of why we couldn't wait that long to have the porch scene show up.


Earlier, you talked about having a responsibility to the people who knew and loved the game to deliver these moments that they know so well. How have you figured out how to balance that with trying to please the people like me who have not played the game and are just experiencing this as a television show?In my conversations with Craig, we talk a lot about where the show goes. What is this show about? What is the soul of this story that, to me, must remain the same? If we lose that, then we've gone too far. Because it's an adaptation, it's a different medium, there are going to be changes. Just fundamentally. It's a highly collaborative art, both on the game side and the show side. So the best way I can honor both is to just do the best version possible of the story, and to make sure that our destinations are the same. The meandering, how we get there, different choices, those can vary. I know people will pick those apart and some people will be OK with it. Some people won't. That's just the nature of the beast that is part of the package. When you do something so popular and it's viewed by millions of people online, you're gonna get every reaction under the sun, especially when it's an adaptation of something people love so much. But I also know to do a good job, we have to make certain changes. It's just fundamental to what we do. I just have to protect its soul all the way through.

Finally, we should talk about the episode's two notable guest stars. Let's start with Tony Dalton.The most charming and intimidating man on TV. It's kind of a difficult role. It's very short and very poignant. He has to come in and be so intimidating that you have to think that this guy might snap and hit his son. But also he has to have so much empathy, and maybe you even have sympathy for him, that this guy with the tools in front of him does the best he can to raise his kid, and he's insecure that he might be getting it wrong. But the hope is that he's doing better than his father, who beat the shit out of him. It was important to get this idea of not only generational trauma, but generational hope and repair. Because that gets into the porch scene. And that's a message that Joel leaves with Ellie. When we wrote that scene, Tony Dalton was my first choice. I immediately pictured him in that role, and I remember jumping on a Zoom call with him and Craig and describing this scene to him — I was very nervous that he would say no — and he was just on board. He's like, “That sounds awesome. When do we start?”


And Joey Pants [Joe Pantoliano]? In just a couple of minutes, he makes me cry. It speaks to the brilliance of Joey Pants. And it's so interesting, because when we cast him, I don't think we gave him enough credit for how versatile he is. The scenes originally had more humor in them, because we could see Joey having this gallows humor. When he's looking at the lake, there was a line initially where he says, “I don't need a Bob Ross painting. I need Gail.” On paper, that's funny, and we could see Joe doing it. But he took the performance somewhere else. There's an innocence and a purity to it. And he just gave this beautiful performance, and it was just a joy to see. But when you're watching the episode, you're seeing one version of that performance. There were so many other beautiful choices that he was giving us, and it was actually hard to choose that one.

Wes Anderson‘s films are painstakingly detailed to capture his signature style. Donald Trump‘s plan to impose a supposed 100 percent tariff on American films produced outside of the U.S., on the other hand, is not particularly detailed or well thought out. During a press conference for The Phoenician Scheme at Cannes Film Festival, Anderson poked some holes in the president's logic — or lack thereof.


	“The tariff is interesting because I've never heard of a 100 percent tariff before,” Anderson said. “I'm not an expert in that area of economics, but I feel that means he's saying he's going to take all the money. And then what do we get? So it's complicated to me. Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn't ship that way.”


	Earlier in the press conference, Anderson joked that the tariff announcement was a free promo for The Phoenician Scheme, which was filmed in Germany and will be released in U.S. theaters on May 30. “I thought you said he was giving us a plug or something,” he said. “Did Trump see it?”

	Trump announced earlier this month that he is authorizing the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to start the process to impose a 100 percent tariff on American films that are produced in “foreign lands,” also known as runaway productions. He claimed filming movies outside of the U.S. posed “a national security threat” and that doing so is causing the movie industry to die “a very fast death.”

	Per Variety, the U.S. domestic box office brought in $8.7 billion in 2024, which saw the release of films that were delayed, either in completion or in release, by the double Hollywood strikes in 2023. So far, 2025 has seen successful releases with Sinners, Thunderbolts, Captain America: Brave New World, A Minecraft Movie, and Final Destination Bloodlines. 


The Phoenician Scheme will receive a wide release on June 6. It marks Anderson's first film since 2023's Asteroid City. The film stars Benicio del Toro, Michael Cera, Mia Threapleton, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Jeffrey Wright, Riz Ahmed, Scarlett Johansson, Mathieu Amalric, Rupert Friend, and Hope Davis.

Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage


Dawn Richard testified she “frequently” saw Sean Combs beat his longtime ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, while on the stand for her second day of testimony at Combs' sex trafficking trial.


	“He would punch her, choke her, drag her, slap her in the mouth,” Richard said. “I saw him kick her, punch her in the stomach.”


	Richard added that Combs would get violent with Ventura for a variety of reasons, whether it was a response to Ventura “speaking up for herself,” or just a “random” outburst. “We didn't even know where it came from,” Richard said. 


	Richard entered Combs' orbit as a breakout talent from his MTV reality series Making the Band. She later joined the Bad Boy girl group Danity Kane, and was also part of the R&B trio Diddy-Dirty Money with Combs and Kalenna Harper.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	One instance of alleged abuse Richard testified to witnessing took place at Combs' home in New York City in 2009, with Harper also present. Richard said Combs “punched [Ventura] in the face” during an argument, leaving Ventura's face so swollen she had to wear sunglasses and make-up to hide the injury. 


	The jury was then shown a photo of Ventura, Richard, and Harper in public, with all three women wearing sunglasses. Richard said she and Harper wore the sunglasses “to have solidarity, to be a friend, to be a support system for someone who needed it.” 

	











	Another alleged attack occurred at a restaurant where several record label personnel were also present. Combs and Ventura had been arguing quietly, according to Richard, when Combs punched Ventura in the stomach. In the car home afterward, Richard continued, Ventura told Combs the public incident had “embarrassed” her. In response, Richard said, Combs allegedly “grabbed [Ventura] by the neck and popped her, slapped her in the mouth.” Combs' security personnel were present, but did not do anything, Richard said, and the ride continued in silence. 


	Richard went on to say that she encouraged Ventura to leave Combs after witnessing these alleged instances of abuse. Richard described Ventura as “torn,” during these conversations, adding, “She would listen but you could see, I could see the fear…” (her statement was cut off by an objection from the defense, which the judge sustained).

	But when Combs heard about these conversations, Richard continued, the mogul told her to stop “or else we would pay for it.” Richard added: “I made a decision that it would be best for the safety of myself to not interfere, because I don't think that she was really ready to do anything.”

	











	Richard began her testimony last Friday, May 16, taking the stand after Ventura finished her own lengthy and emotional testimony. During her time on the stand, she corroborated and bolstered Ventura's claims that Combs brutally beat her throughout their relationship. 


	During her testimony last week, Richard alleged that she saw Combs attack Ventura with the same skillet Ventura was using to cook him eggs. “It didn't seem that it hit her fully,” Richard said. “She went into the fetal position … I was scared for her.”


	When Combs' defense lawyer, Nicole Westmoreland, took over for cross-examination, she focused on this incident, suggesting Richard's account had changed over time. She first cited a demand letter Richard's lawyers sent Combs last year, which claimed that Richard heard the skillet hit the wall, but didn't see the alleged altercation. They mentioned two interviews Richard gave to prosecutors, one in which Richard claimed Combs struck Ventura with the pan, and another in which she said Combs threw the eggs at Ventura.

	When asked about these changes, Richard responded, “I said the best that I could recall.”


	Westmoreland also asked Richard about her claim on the stand that, the day after the alleged skillet attack, Combs told her, “If you say anything, there will be consequences. People end up missing.” Westmoreland said Richard told prosecutors in an interview that Combs said “this was a love thing,” and not, “people go missing.” When pressed on this, Richard said, “I didn't remember it,” adding that she did remember “everything I am telling you now.”


	On the re-direct, the prosecution attempted to reaffirm Richard's testimony by asking if she'd given much thought to these incidents in the years since she allegedly saw them. “No, it was a hard time, a bad time for me,” Richard said. “It did not all come back immediately … the environment was traumatizing, so I tried to erase those things from my memory.”


	Richard went on to say that memories came back to her the more she spoke to investigators, and that she tried to recall them “as best and accurate as I can.”

	While on the stand, though, Richard did not touch on her own allegations against Combs. Last year, she filed a civil suit against the mogul, accusing him of violent outbursts and sexual abuse, claiming he groped her on numerous occasions occasions, threatened her life, and trapped her in a locked car for two hours as a form of punishment. Richard's civil suit remains ongoing.

	President Donald Trump has demanded an investigation into Bruce Springsteen and other artists who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, after the singer has repeatedly told crowds at his concerts that the president is an “unfit” man running “a rogue government.”


	The president — who is scheduled to hold a high-stakes phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin today — wrote on Truth Social early the same morning that he was “going to call for a major investigation” into what compensation Springsteen received from the 2024 Harris campaign. 


	“HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT? WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN'T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION?” Trump wrote. 


	The president, who had previously used Springsteen's music at his rallies despite objections from the artist, went on to accuse the Harris campaign of paying for endorsements from artists like Springsteen, Beyoncé, and Bono, under the guise of providing entertainment at her rallies. “IT'S NOT LEGAL! For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,' this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Artists like Beyoncé, Eminem, Oprah, and others have denied right-wing claims that they were offered millions to endorse Harris. 


	Trump has been locked in a public back and forth with Springsteen over the artist's criticism of his regime. After the “Born in the USA” rocker told concertgoers in Europe that the United States is currently in the hands of a “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” Trump responded last week with a bizarre warning for Springsteen: “This dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just ‘standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!”

	Springsteen, unfettered, responded to the thinly veiled threats by telling fans in Manchester, England, over the weekend: “In America, my home, they're persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. That's happening now.” 

	











	It's apparently happening to Springsteen, who now might be placed under investigation for the transgression of supporting the political candidate of his choice and exercising his constitutionally protected right to criticize his government.

An unidentified flying object struck a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona last year, damaging the aircraft and prompting concerns about a surge in mysterious aerial activity near American military sites, the New York Post reported. 

According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents, first reported by The War Zone, the incident occurred in January 2023 when an ""orange-white"" uncrewed aerial system (UAS) collided mid-air with the canopy of a $63 million F-16 Viper, forcing it to be grounded. The term UAS typically refers to drones, though the object remains unidentified.

The incident is one of several unexplained aerial encounters reported near US Air Force training zones in Arizona since 2020. A day after the fighter jet incident, three more UAS encounters were flagged in the same region, highlighting the frequency and unusual nature of these sightings. 

Former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo told News Nation that reports of unidentified aerial activity have spiked near Arizona's southern border. 

""There's been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things,"" he said.

The FAA confirmed that it logs sightings of ""Unidentified Aerial Phenomena"" (UAP) when pilots report them to air traffic control. If corroborated with radar or other evidence, the data is shared with the US Department of Defence's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office - the agency handling such national security cases.



Between May 2023 and June 2024, the office received 757 such reports, with only 49 cases marked ""closed"" so far.

Many of the objects spotted near Arizona's military ranges appear in small swarms, sometimes in groups of eight, flying at high altitudes. Some US officials, including former Customs and Border Protection advisor Ron Vitiello, suspect these could be advanced drones operated by foreign cartels for smuggling or surveillance.

""There's a possibility they're using cutting-edge technology we're not familiar with,"" Vitiello said, noting that cartel-funded drone systems have been used to smuggle drugs weighing up to 10 kilograms across the US-Mexico border.

""These groups have the resources to innovate constantly. That's part of their business model,"" he added.

The incidents come amid heightened scrutiny over aerial intrusions, following high-profile events like the Chinese spy balloon sighting in 2023.

An unidentified flying object literally crashed into a U.S. fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona—and it seems our real lives are getting closer to an X-Files plot than we'd probably like. It's real, and it's just one of dozens of increasingly bizarre midair incidents that military pilots have been reporting over restricted airspace in the Southwest.

The collision happened in January when an F-16 Viper jet struck what officials later described as an “orange-white uncrewed aerial system,” or UAS. The FAA confirmed the object hit the plane's canopy mid-flight. That's the transparent bubble that protects the pilot's face. No word yet on how damaged it was, but if it sounds wild, just know this: it was one of four separate drone encounters reported that day.

And that's only scratching the surface.

Since 2020, military pilots flying training routes over Arizona have reported dozens of encounters with strange objects. Some were logged as drones. Others defied easy explanation—metallic spheres moving in groups, eight “silver UAS” flying in tight formation at 20,000 feet, and one suspiciously fast object tearing through the sky at Mach 0.75, or about 500 mph, at 33,000 feet. For context, your average off-the-shelf drone barely clears 500 feet and maxes out at around 45 knots.

On March 25, 2021, two F-35 pilots near Casa Grande described a “large white UAS” hovering motionless at 24,000 feet—something they said resembled either a small plane or a really big drone. Another F-35 crew spotted a glowing blue-green object while cruising at 36,000 feet. At that altitude, you're usually sharing airspace with commercial jets. Not UFOs.

“These reports are coming in constantly,” former Pentagon UAP investigator Luis Elizondo told NewsNation, pointing to the Arizona-Mexico border as a repeat offender. Some officials suspect advanced cartel surveillance drones. Others think it's something more mysterious. Either way, the technology doesn't match what's publicly known.

“Maybe they've got tech we're not used to seeing in the drone space,” said former CBP official Ron Vitiello. He cited cartel money and its tendency to innovate fast “to keep selling their poison.”

From May 2023 to June 2024, the U.S. government logged 757 sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. Just 49 have been marked “case closed.”

With more objects appearing in restricted airspace—and one now confirmed to have struck a fighter jet—the question is no longer if something is out there but who's behind it and how close these encounters are going to get.

A UFO slammed into a US fighter jet over Arizona, cracking the canopy protecting the pilot, and forcing the $63 million plane to land, new reports have revealed.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the F-16 Viper fighter jet was hit by an 'orange-white UAS' - which stands for uncrewed aerial system, better known as a drone - on January 19, 2023.

Within a day of this collision, there were three more unidentified aircraft sightings over the Air Force's Barry Goldwater Range, where the fighter was damaged, the documents stated.

Barry Goldwater Range is an expanse of desert along the Arizona-Mexico border where the military practices air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. 

The FAA's report of the F-16 collision revealed that the fighter was flying in restricted airspace near Gila Bend, Arizona, when it was hit by the object in the rear of the canopy, the glass bubble which protects the pilot.

No injuries were reported. The Air Force did not reveal how much damage the jet suffered, but the plane was grounded for repairs.

These new details come as a stunning report from the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) shows there have been hundreds of UFO reports made in recent years and Arizona is becoming the nation's new UFO hotspot.

AARO serves as a centralized department which looks into all things related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings and reports which could impact national security or air safety.

The F-16 collision is just one of 22 incidents involving Air Force fighter pilots seeing or crashing into strange objects between October 2022 and June 2023, according to azfamily.com.

Most of the encounters took place within 100 miles of Luke Air Force Base, where many of the F-16 fighter jets using Barry Goldwater Range launch from.

Although the FAA said there's no evidence that the collision involved something extraterrestrial, it's one of several recent UFO incidents that have plagued US airspace over Arizona.

In fact, some of these strange sightings involved swarms of up to eight mysterious objects flying over Air Force training bases along the US border with Mexico.

Between 2016 and 2020, military pilots reported seeing unidentified drone-like objects over the state eight times.

The new FAA details come as another government report shows that there were 757 sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) worldwide reported between May 2023 and June 2024 alone - and only 49 of these cases have been solved.

When incidents like the F-16 collision occur, the pilot files a report, which the FAA investigates using radar and other data. If the incident involves a UFO, it's sent to AARO for further investigation. 

At least 410 of these 757 new UAP reports from around the world occurred over the US, with the vast majority being sent in by the FAA between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024.

However, many more of these encounters took place over restricted military airspace, and the AARO report did not reveal where exactly these sightings occurred.

Despite the secrecy, UFO whistleblowers are revealing that many are taking place in Arizona. That includes Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer who investigated these cases before leaving the Pentagon.

'A lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border,' Elizondo disclosed.

Bob Thompson, who spent 14 years with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), also recently shared never-before-seen videos of UFOs spotted over Arizona.

'I've seen orbs that were off in the distance. I've seen crafts that were cigar-shaped, I've seen triangles,' the whistleblower told NewsNation.

Thompson added that over 100 CBP agents have confessed to him that they have seen strange and unidentified objects flying along the US border.

These sightings included US border agents witnessing terrifying 'portals' opening into the sky. 

'I got told that they witnessed a portal opening up in the sky and there were pictures of it on a camera that I was able to see,' Thompson revealed.

Although hundreds of these strange sightings sent to AARO are still marked as open investigations, many in the government are blaming Mexico - not aliens.

Specifically, there's a growing belief that the surge in unidentified drone sightings is due to drug cartels launching high-tech spy missions into the US.

'We're seeing drones… used as scouting patrols, to watch Border Patrol,' NewsNation's border report Ali Bradley explained.

Unlike drones which the US government believed were launched by China, these new drones are harder to detect and also larger so they can potentially carry bigger packages of drugs across the border.

Trump Administration border czar Tom Homan has added that many of these sightings are likely high-tech drones spying on US military bases in Arizona.

Bradley noted that one of the cartels' top goals is to infiltrate US military facilities, so they can stay one step ahead of patrols enforcing illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

Of the 49 AARO investigations that have been closed, the UFOs were determined to be airplanes, balloons, birds, drones, and satellites that were mistaken as alien aircraft.

AARO has recommended that another 243 cases be closed for the same reasons.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

An unidentified flying object literally crashed into a U.S. fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona—and it seems our real lives are getting closer to an X-Files plot than we'd probably like. It's real, and it's just one of dozens of increasingly bizarre midair incidents that military pilots have been reporting over restricted airspace in the Southwest.

The collision happened in January when an F-16 Viper jet struck what officials later described as an “orange-white uncrewed aerial system,” or UAS. The FAA confirmed the object hit the plane's canopy mid-flight. That's the transparent bubble that protects the pilot's face. No word yet on how damaged it was, but if it sounds wild, just know this: it was one of four separate drone encounters reported that day.

And that's only scratching the surface.

Since 2020, military pilots flying training routes over Arizona have reported dozens of encounters with strange objects. Some were logged as drones. Others defied easy explanation—metallic spheres moving in groups, eight “silver UAS” flying in tight formation at 20,000 feet, and one suspiciously fast object tearing through the sky at Mach 0.75, or about 500 mph, at 33,000 feet. For context, your average off-the-shelf drone barely clears 500 feet and maxes out at around 45 knots.

On March 25, 2021, two F-35 pilots near Casa Grande described a “large white UAS” hovering motionless at 24,000 feet—something they said resembled either a small plane or a really big drone. Another F-35 crew spotted a glowing blue-green object while cruising at 36,000 feet. At that altitude, you're usually sharing airspace with commercial jets. Not UFOs.

“These reports are coming in constantly,” former Pentagon UAP investigator Luis Elizondo told NewsNation, pointing to the Arizona-Mexico border as a repeat offender. Some officials suspect advanced cartel surveillance drones. Others think it's something more mysterious. Either way, the technology doesn't match what's publicly known.

“Maybe they've got tech we're not used to seeing in the drone space,” said former CBP official Ron Vitiello. He cited cartel money and its tendency to innovate fast “to keep selling their poison.”

From May 2023 to June 2024, the U.S. government logged 757 sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. Just 49 have been marked “case closed.”

With more objects appearing in restricted airspace—and one now confirmed to have struck a fighter jet—the question is no longer if something is out there but who's behind it and how close these encounters are going to get.

FOLLOW DEVELOPING TELECOMS



Digicel Vanuatu announced on Monday it has signed its 5th Undertaking to expand its mobile coverage to an estimated 99% of the population in Vanuatu as part of its Universal Access Policy (UAP) obligations.

The telco said that the latest commitment demonstrates its resolve to overcome the challenges of covering the entire nation. The challenges are primarily geographical in nature, as Vanuatu comprises over 80 islands spread across an area of 1,300 kilometres.

According to figures from the ITU, 4G coverage for Vanuatu reached 90% at the end of 2023.

Digicel Vanuatu said that despite the infrastructural and logistical challenges involved, in covering remote or underserved areas, it remains dedicated to bridging the digital divide. No timescale was given for the latest undertaking.

Apart from boosting mobile network coverage, the project under the 5th Undertaking will also offer pathways for increased access to Digicel's MyCash mobile wallet, e-learning portals, e-health initiatives and digital finance for unconnected or under-resourced communities.

“This is a leap forward to ensuring that almost everyone in the country has access to the life-changing potential of mobile coverage,” said Digicel Vanuatu CEO Gary Sue-Fong in a statement. “By providing core mobile services, this extension will make access to digital tools and services available that can drive economic growth, increase healthcare access, enhance educational opportunities and open doors to financial inclusion for thousands of Ni-Vanuatu.”","{'href': 'https://developingtelecoms.com', 'title': 'Developing Telecoms'}","other"

An unidentified flying object that struck and damaged a U.S. military fighter jet was among several mysterious objects found near Air Force training ranges in Arizona, according to multiple reports.

The UFO hit the clear bubble ""canopy"" located above the head of a pilot flying an F-16 Viper jet, which caused damaged to the plane and left it temporarily grounded during an incident in January 2023, according to Federal Aviation Administration documents first obtained by the War Zone. The object was described as ""an orange-white UAS"" or ""uncrewed aerial system,"" a term that often describes drones, according to the FAA documents.

Three additional UAS encounters were flagged the following day, according to the outlet.

“What I can tell you is that there has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the [Mexico] border,"" former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo told News Nation earlier this month.

The FAA issued a statement to the New York Post claiming that it “documents Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to an air traffic control facility.""

“If supporting information such as radar data corroborates the report, the FAA shares it with the UAP Task Force,"" the statement added. ""The Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office serves as the centralized clearing house for UAP reporting impacting national security or safety.”

The U.S. government filed 757 related reports between May 2023 and June 2024, which includes 708 aerial incidents, and only 49 were marked as being ""cased closed,"" according to the latest Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office report. The small unidentified objects found in Arizona tend to fly in groups of up to eight during incidents at high altitudes in or near military air combat training sites and have reoccurred since January 2020.

A NASA veteran's multi-year survey of over 1,300 Sun-like stars has discovered several mysterious fast pulses of light that defy traditional cosmological explanations.

Part of a new SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) approach that scans the cosmos for signs of technologically advanced non-human intelligences employing light pulses instead of radio signals to communicate, called ‘optical SETI', the detections could unveil previously misunderstood natural phenomena or may represent actual extraterrestrial communications.

Since the 1960s, SETI scientists like Frank Drake, the author of the Drake Equation used to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations, have scanned the cosmos for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence in the form of radio signals, including scanning the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanet system. Some tantalizing possibilities have emerged, including the infamous “WOW” signal discovered in 1977, although that detection was most likely resolved as a natural occurrence in 2024. As a result, none of these efforts have detected definitive evidence of non-human radio communication.

More recently, scientists have proposed innovative new methods to look for extraterrestrials communicating with one another. Examples include scanning for alien communications using gravitational waves, looking for galactic-level radio communications by alien supercivilizations, and hunting for light pulses caused by extraterrestrials communicating with lasers called optical SETI.

In a recently published study, veteran NASA scientist Richard H. Stanton detailed a multi-year optical SETI effort aimed specifically at Sun-like stars that revealed some unusual results. According to Stanton, whose impressive resume includes NASA's Voyager missions and working as the Engineering Manager of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, several potential explanations exist for his unexpected findings, including the possibility of extraterrestrial communication.

Since retiring, Stanton has been using the 76.2-cm (30-inch) telescope at the Shay Meadow Observatory in Big Bear, California, to look for signs of extraterrestrials trying to communicate, or as a propulsion system to power light sail spacecraft. Unlike other optical SETI projects that hunt for light signals in varying spectra, Stanton's study employed a multi-channel photometer that he designed and the immense patience of a NASA veteran to study the light from stars for these signals.

“My approach is to stare at a single star for roughly 1 hour using photon counting to sample the star's light at what is considered a very high time-resolution for astronomy (100 microsecond samples),” Stanton explained. “The resulting time series are then searched for pulses and optical tones.”

“I'm not sure if anyone else is doing this with a significant time commitment,” he added.

Stanton said that patience finally paid off on May 14, 2023, when his equipment detected an unexpected “signal” while observing the Sun-like star HD 89389. During his one-hour survey, the scientists spotted two fast, identical pulses of light separated by 4.4 seconds. After double-checking previous surveys of the F-type star in the constellation Ursa Major, Stanton confirmed the pulses of light had not been previously detected.

“I am not aware of any discovery of similar pulses,” he writes.

To eliminate potentially false signals, the NASA veteran compared his readings against signals produced by sources known to occasionally confuse astronomical instruments. After some detailed analysis, he was able to rule out lightning, meteors, airplanes, satellites, system noise, and other atmospheric phenomena as the source of the light pulses.

Next, Stanton looked for similar “overlooked” detections in previous historical observation data. As hoped, he found a nearly identical pair of light pulses detected on September 30th, 2019, around the Sun-like star HD 217014. Roughly the same size, age, and mass as our sun, the star is also the site of the first exoplanet detected by humans in 1995.

Stanton discussed another event that occurred on January 18th of this year, after the paper was submitted for publication. According to the scientist, all three events occurred in pairs, with all pairs of pulses of light separated by between 1.2 and 4.4 seconds. Stanton says that in over 1,500 hours of searching, “no single pulse resembling these has ever been detected.”

A deeper analysis of the 2023 detection also revealed an interesting pattern that Stanton found difficult to explain with natural phenomena. When the pulses of light were detected, the star got brighter, fainter, and brighter again before returning to its previous ambient light level, “all in about 0.2 seconds.” Stanton says this variation is much too strong to be caused by the typical false signal culprits, such as random noise or atmospheric turbulence.

“How do you make a star, over a million kilometers across, partially disappear in a tenth of a second?” he asks. “The source of this variation can't be as far away as the star itself.”

A follow-up analysis of photography data captured during the event confirmed that nothing else was detected moving near the star at the time of the detection. Separately, when Stanton took a closer look at the fine structure found within the star's light between pulses, he found a repeating pattern at exactly the 4.4-second mark of the second pulse that seemingly defies conventional explanations.

“No one knows how to explain this behavior,” he writes.

In the study's conclusion, the NASA veteran discusses several potential explanations for the light pulses and the problems associated with each.

For example, the 2019 detection was originally written off as a false signal caused by birds, a determination Stanton was able to refute with new data and analysis. The scientist suggests that a shockwave in Earth's atmosphere could also explain the detections. However, he calls that possibility unlikely, “since shockwaves would have had to occur with perfect timing to coincide with all three optical pulses.”

Stanton also discusses other possible explanations, including starlight diffraction by a distant object in the solar system, partial eclipses caused by satellites or asteroids, edge refraction, and gravitational waves. Still, Stanton says that none of these explanations are satisfying “at this point” and suggests that more study of all three known events is required to further limit the possibilities.

“We don't know what kind of object could produce these pulses or how far away it is. We don't know if the two-pulse signal is produced by something passing between us and the star or if it is generated by something that modulates the star's light without moving across the field. Until we learn more, we can't even say whether or not extraterrestrials are involved!”

The obsession with extraterrestrial life has entered into the pews of the Catholic Church - an attractive tree that has for some become an alternative to the Gospel.

PUBLISHED ON

May 19, 2025

One of the stranger headlines to emerge in the wake of Pope Francis' death wondered about whether the next pope would reveal the Vatican's UFO “secrets,” resurfacing the bombshell congressional hearing about UFOs last summer. Since Pope Leo's election, it has been speculated that he will be the “disclosure pope” about the Vatican's knowledge of UFOs. While even discussing such apparent clickbait runs some risk of carelessly playing into the hands of the conspiracy theorist, I believe it does raise questions worth considering.  What should faithful Catholics make of the whistleblower David Grusch's claims under oath before Congress that the United States government has been engaged in an alien UFO crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program since the mid-20th century (allegedly, in collusion with the Vatican)? At root, this question raises a more basic question: How should the Christian think about the possibility of extraterrestrial life? There are three broad possible attitudes toward claims of intelligent extraterrestrial life one can find among Christians: first, the deniers; second, the believers; and third, the cautiously skeptical. Let's consider them in turn. 
Orthodox. Faithful. Free.

 The denier argues that Grusch's claims and others like them are hogwash because there's no evidence from faith or reason that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists. Christians have the advantage of revelation to guide our thinking about the universe. And the Bible can be interpreted to believe that God privileged Earth with a unique design and place in the universe to be the home of His image-bearers. On this view, the creation narratives in Genesis and Job don't report any non-terrestrial intelligent organisms precisely because there aren't any.  While all orthodox Christians would affirm that the Incarnation is a metaphysical marvel with cosmic implications, the denier would contend that it underscores the unique place of humanity in the universe. The Second Person of the Trinity assumed human nature at a specific point in space-time on the planet Earth, about two thousand years ago. The fact that God has not so interacted with the essential nature of any other material being on any other planet in the universe is telling. Hence, through the lens of reason, the denier would suggest that Fermi's Paradox—which asks: In such a vast universe that has existed for so long, “where is everybody?”—is solved by the answer: we are alone. The denier would chalk up so-called encounters with aliens and alien spacecraft as deriving from natural causation or perhaps demonic influence. For example, the famous Navy “tic tac” video might simply be a recording of a distant plane giving off an infrared glare. And, claimants to contact (i.e., “contactees”) are typically either hoaxers, delusional, or even victims of demonic deception perhaps through involvement in the occult (as Christian apologist Kenneth Samples argues). The believer camp reads Sacred Scripture differently. While the Bible does not directly mention non-human bodily intelligences elsewhere in the galaxy, the believer emphasizes that the Bible does not deny their existence, either. The creation narratives are focused on man and Earth simply because revelation to man focuses on God's dealings with man. Nothing more need be inferred. More than that, some believers find positive evidence in the Bible of alien visitation to earth, taking, for example, Ezekiel's vision of wheels within wheels as a description of flying saucers (Ezekiel 1:15-16). And the believer contends that Jesus Himself can reasonably be read to signal that other life exists when He says, “I have other sheep that are not of this fold” (John 10:16).  Meanwhile, through the lens of reason, the believer tends to find at least some eyewitness testimony of UFO and/or alien encounters to be credible. In this view, the tic tac video and others must be nonhuman spacecraft because they show artificial objects moving in ways that are simply beyond human technology.  The believer leans on the sheer probability that, in the vastness of space, it is more likely than not that other intelligent life exists. A few hundred billion stars exist in the Milky Way Galaxy alone—and ours is just one of a couple trillion galaxies in the observable universe. The number of stars with orbiting planets is too great of a number for the human mind to comprehend: into the sextillions (1×1021). The heavens proclaim the glory of God—and is it really fitting that God would create all of that empty (Psalm 19:1)? The believer maintains that the Fermi Paradox can be solved if it turns out that advanced civilizations are relatively rare due to self-destruction, or cataclysm, or because interstellar travel is difficult, or because we aren't capable of detecting their presence or communications. The cautiously skeptical, in which I place myself, is somewhere between these camps.  By the light of faith, the dogmatic denier goes too far. God certainly could have created nonhuman intelligent life in the universe. The wonderful planet we live on is teeming with countless organisms—each with its own distinct form or kind. Each natural form has its archetype in God's mind, like the maker has in mind the idea of the artifact that he seeks to build. But, while we can mentally consider the exemplary forms in God's mind in themselves, in reality they are simply identical with God's nature, which is infinite. This entails that everything that is real in some sense is imitative of and manifests the divine nature—and that the ways in which creatures could imitate God's nature is potentially infinite.  While God could have created just one creature, Aquinas contends, this could not adequately represent God's infinite goodness. Hence, the great plurality and diversity of created things is fitting. All of this is compatible in principle with the existence of nonhuman and nonangelic intelligences. And, while demonic influence could explain alleged alien encounters, it simply begs the question to assume that any phenomena unexplained by natural causes must be demons. In short, as the Rev. Jose Gabriel Funes, the Vatican's chief astronomer, has put it, there is no contradiction with the Catholic Faith if it turned out we had “extraterrestrial brothers.” On the other hand, there are good reasons to believe that by unaided reason many of the most frequently cited UFO encounters can be explained by natural or human causation. The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day. Yet, it did find a lot of evidence of misidentification of natural phenomenon or other natural causes like hoaxing and delusion. To take one famous example, Kenneth Arnold's sighting in 1947, whence the term “flying saucers” derived, may have simply been misidentified manmade aircraft, or pelicans, or meteors, or an optical illusion.  The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day.Tweet ThisSummarizing the several domestic and foreign governmental investigations that came after Project Blue Book, the Department of Defense's AARO Historical Record Report concluded that none concluded UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin and the “vast majority of UAP [unidentified anomalous phenomena] reports could be resolved as any number of ordinary objects, natural phenomena, optical illusions or misidentifications.” While we obviously can't simply trust whatever the U.S. military claims, the believer who claims that the government is engaged in a massive cover-up bears the burden of proof.  There are also real theological challenges, at least for the dogmatic and exultant believer's view.  First, at least some UAPs may be demonic in origin—and this is the perspective not merely of some of the more thoughtful armchair theologians but of some military officials as well. Reportedly, one of the recent iterations of taxpayer-funded government investigations into UAPs, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which ran from 2007-2012, faced resistance from many officials within the Pentagon because they believed that phenomena unexplained by natural causes were caused by demons. This is certainly possible, for we know from the testimony of exorcists that demons are incredibly powerful beings and masters of deception (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:14-15). If indeed there are good reasons to believe the phenomena are demonic, these officials are right to think that they ought not to be trifled with. Moreover, the attempt to shoehorn aliens into the Bible strains credulity. A better argument is that the Bible doesn't mention lots of things that exist, like narwhals and staphylococcus, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It is the confident and gleeful attitude that some believers have that is troubling. If God created other bodily beings of reason and will, why would He direct or permit them to come to Earth? Either they would be fallen or unfallen. If fallen—that is, corrupted by sin—then they should be seen as a potential threat to humanity and in need of a Redeemer. While contact could be the catalyst for the fallen alien race to come to faith in Christ, the proper attitude is caution, not excitement, as if salvation had arrived.  On the other hand, if the alien race is unfallen, then why would individuals of that race be visiting here? In the spirit of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, in which Earth is the “silent planet”—cut off, as it were, by sin as “lost sheep” from the rest of creation—I imagine it would be fitting that God would warn any unfallen races against visiting the world in which Satan has a kind of princedom (John 14:30). Indeed, if there is an unfallen alien race, some members of that race visiting Earth, for them, could be akin to eating the forbidden fruit in the Cosmic Garden. The visitors in that case would be rogue exiles defying God.  Of course, this is all speculative—but the point is that the attitude of excited religious fervor among some believers is unjustified from a Christian perspective. Indeed, for some, belief in aliens takes on the trappings of a false religion, complete with its own rituals, sacred texts, communal gatherings, and cultus. A number of UFO cults have arisen in the 20th century—and they tend to believe that aliens are delivering some important salvific message. Some, like the Aetherius Society, go so far as to claim that Jesus Christ Himself is an alien (from Venus). For such believers, belief in aliens appears to be an outlet for the unsatisfied, deep religious longing of man for God, which places a false hope in aliens to deliver enlightenment, fulfillment, and salvation from “beyond” this world. So, what of the claims that the United States has a secret alien spacecraft crash retrieval program, the original of which crashed in Italy in 1933 and our intelligence agencies acquired via back channels from Pope Pius XII? Such extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The story of an alleged UFO crash in Magenta, Italy, in 1933 and a cover-up by the Mussolini regime predates Mr. Grusch's claims. It derives from the so-called “Fascist UFO Files,” which were anonymously sent by someone calling himself “Mr. X” to various Italian news outlets in 1996, which refused to publish the story.  Subsequently, UFOlogists Roberto Pinotti and Alfredo Lissoni came into possession of the documents and spread the story in UFO publications and a book, arguing the documents were authentic. Yet, as archivists critical of the story have pointed out, the documents produced are largely photocopies deriving from an unknown source, and the supposed originals have not been made available to scholars for independent examination.  Simply put, extraordinary evidence for such an extraordinary claim has not been provided. Catholics, therefore, have good reasons to doubt whether Pope Leo XIV has anything to reveal corroborating the story. None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).  There is evidence that the U.S. government may have engaged in psyops in this vein in the past. The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

What should faithful Catholics make of the whistleblower David Grusch's claims under oath before Congress that the United States government has been engaged in an alien UFO crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program since the mid-20th century (allegedly, in collusion with the Vatican)? At root, this question raises a more basic question: How should the Christian think about the possibility of extraterrestrial life? There are three broad possible attitudes toward claims of intelligent extraterrestrial life one can find among Christians: first, the deniers; second, the believers; and third, the cautiously skeptical. Let's consider them in turn.

 The denier argues that Grusch's claims and others like them are hogwash because there's no evidence from faith or reason that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists. Christians have the advantage of revelation to guide our thinking about the universe. And the Bible can be interpreted to believe that God privileged Earth with a unique design and place in the universe to be the home of His image-bearers. On this view, the creation narratives in Genesis and Job don't report any non-terrestrial intelligent organisms precisely because there aren't any.  While all orthodox Christians would affirm that the Incarnation is a metaphysical marvel with cosmic implications, the denier would contend that it underscores the unique place of humanity in the universe. The Second Person of the Trinity assumed human nature at a specific point in space-time on the planet Earth, about two thousand years ago. The fact that God has not so interacted with the essential nature of any other material being on any other planet in the universe is telling. Hence, through the lens of reason, the denier would suggest that Fermi's Paradox—which asks: In such a vast universe that has existed for so long, “where is everybody?”—is solved by the answer: we are alone. The denier would chalk up so-called encounters with aliens and alien spacecraft as deriving from natural causation or perhaps demonic influence. For example, the famous Navy “tic tac” video might simply be a recording of a distant plane giving off an infrared glare. And, claimants to contact (i.e., “contactees”) are typically either hoaxers, delusional, or even victims of demonic deception perhaps through involvement in the occult (as Christian apologist Kenneth Samples argues). The believer camp reads Sacred Scripture differently. While the Bible does not directly mention non-human bodily intelligences elsewhere in the galaxy, the believer emphasizes that the Bible does not deny their existence, either. The creation narratives are focused on man and Earth simply because revelation to man focuses on God's dealings with man. Nothing more need be inferred. More than that, some believers find positive evidence in the Bible of alien visitation to earth, taking, for example, Ezekiel's vision of wheels within wheels as a description of flying saucers (Ezekiel 1:15-16). And the believer contends that Jesus Himself can reasonably be read to signal that other life exists when He says, “I have other sheep that are not of this fold” (John 10:16).  Meanwhile, through the lens of reason, the believer tends to find at least some eyewitness testimony of UFO and/or alien encounters to be credible. In this view, the tic tac video and others must be nonhuman spacecraft because they show artificial objects moving in ways that are simply beyond human technology.  The believer leans on the sheer probability that, in the vastness of space, it is more likely than not that other intelligent life exists. A few hundred billion stars exist in the Milky Way Galaxy alone—and ours is just one of a couple trillion galaxies in the observable universe. The number of stars with orbiting planets is too great of a number for the human mind to comprehend: into the sextillions (1×1021). The heavens proclaim the glory of God—and is it really fitting that God would create all of that empty (Psalm 19:1)? The believer maintains that the Fermi Paradox can be solved if it turns out that advanced civilizations are relatively rare due to self-destruction, or cataclysm, or because interstellar travel is difficult, or because we aren't capable of detecting their presence or communications. The cautiously skeptical, in which I place myself, is somewhere between these camps.  By the light of faith, the dogmatic denier goes too far. God certainly could have created nonhuman intelligent life in the universe. The wonderful planet we live on is teeming with countless organisms—each with its own distinct form or kind. Each natural form has its archetype in God's mind, like the maker has in mind the idea of the artifact that he seeks to build. But, while we can mentally consider the exemplary forms in God's mind in themselves, in reality they are simply identical with God's nature, which is infinite. This entails that everything that is real in some sense is imitative of and manifests the divine nature—and that the ways in which creatures could imitate God's nature is potentially infinite.  While God could have created just one creature, Aquinas contends, this could not adequately represent God's infinite goodness. Hence, the great plurality and diversity of created things is fitting. All of this is compatible in principle with the existence of nonhuman and nonangelic intelligences. And, while demonic influence could explain alleged alien encounters, it simply begs the question to assume that any phenomena unexplained by natural causes must be demons. In short, as the Rev. Jose Gabriel Funes, the Vatican's chief astronomer, has put it, there is no contradiction with the Catholic Faith if it turned out we had “extraterrestrial brothers.” On the other hand, there are good reasons to believe that by unaided reason many of the most frequently cited UFO encounters can be explained by natural or human causation. The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day. Yet, it did find a lot of evidence of misidentification of natural phenomenon or other natural causes like hoaxing and delusion. To take one famous example, Kenneth Arnold's sighting in 1947, whence the term “flying saucers” derived, may have simply been misidentified manmade aircraft, or pelicans, or meteors, or an optical illusion.  The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day.Tweet ThisSummarizing the several domestic and foreign governmental investigations that came after Project Blue Book, the Department of Defense's AARO Historical Record Report concluded that none concluded UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin and the “vast majority of UAP [unidentified anomalous phenomena] reports could be resolved as any number of ordinary objects, natural phenomena, optical illusions or misidentifications.” While we obviously can't simply trust whatever the U.S. military claims, the believer who claims that the government is engaged in a massive cover-up bears the burden of proof.  There are also real theological challenges, at least for the dogmatic and exultant believer's view.  First, at least some UAPs may be demonic in origin—and this is the perspective not merely of some of the more thoughtful armchair theologians but of some military officials as well. Reportedly, one of the recent iterations of taxpayer-funded government investigations into UAPs, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which ran from 2007-2012, faced resistance from many officials within the Pentagon because they believed that phenomena unexplained by natural causes were caused by demons. This is certainly possible, for we know from the testimony of exorcists that demons are incredibly powerful beings and masters of deception (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:14-15). If indeed there are good reasons to believe the phenomena are demonic, these officials are right to think that they ought not to be trifled with. Moreover, the attempt to shoehorn aliens into the Bible strains credulity. A better argument is that the Bible doesn't mention lots of things that exist, like narwhals and staphylococcus, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It is the confident and gleeful attitude that some believers have that is troubling. If God created other bodily beings of reason and will, why would He direct or permit them to come to Earth? Either they would be fallen or unfallen. If fallen—that is, corrupted by sin—then they should be seen as a potential threat to humanity and in need of a Redeemer. While contact could be the catalyst for the fallen alien race to come to faith in Christ, the proper attitude is caution, not excitement, as if salvation had arrived.  On the other hand, if the alien race is unfallen, then why would individuals of that race be visiting here? In the spirit of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, in which Earth is the “silent planet”—cut off, as it were, by sin as “lost sheep” from the rest of creation—I imagine it would be fitting that God would warn any unfallen races against visiting the world in which Satan has a kind of princedom (John 14:30). Indeed, if there is an unfallen alien race, some members of that race visiting Earth, for them, could be akin to eating the forbidden fruit in the Cosmic Garden. The visitors in that case would be rogue exiles defying God.  Of course, this is all speculative—but the point is that the attitude of excited religious fervor among some believers is unjustified from a Christian perspective. Indeed, for some, belief in aliens takes on the trappings of a false religion, complete with its own rituals, sacred texts, communal gatherings, and cultus. A number of UFO cults have arisen in the 20th century—and they tend to believe that aliens are delivering some important salvific message. Some, like the Aetherius Society, go so far as to claim that Jesus Christ Himself is an alien (from Venus). For such believers, belief in aliens appears to be an outlet for the unsatisfied, deep religious longing of man for God, which places a false hope in aliens to deliver enlightenment, fulfillment, and salvation from “beyond” this world. So, what of the claims that the United States has a secret alien spacecraft crash retrieval program, the original of which crashed in Italy in 1933 and our intelligence agencies acquired via back channels from Pope Pius XII? Such extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The story of an alleged UFO crash in Magenta, Italy, in 1933 and a cover-up by the Mussolini regime predates Mr. Grusch's claims. It derives from the so-called “Fascist UFO Files,” which were anonymously sent by someone calling himself “Mr. X” to various Italian news outlets in 1996, which refused to publish the story.  Subsequently, UFOlogists Roberto Pinotti and Alfredo Lissoni came into possession of the documents and spread the story in UFO publications and a book, arguing the documents were authentic. Yet, as archivists critical of the story have pointed out, the documents produced are largely photocopies deriving from an unknown source, and the supposed originals have not been made available to scholars for independent examination.  Simply put, extraordinary evidence for such an extraordinary claim has not been provided. Catholics, therefore, have good reasons to doubt whether Pope Leo XIV has anything to reveal corroborating the story. None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).  There is evidence that the U.S. government may have engaged in psyops in this vein in the past. The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

And the Bible can be interpreted to believe that God privileged Earth with a unique design and place in the universe to be the home of His image-bearers. On this view, the creation narratives in Genesis and Job don't report any non-terrestrial intelligent organisms precisely because there aren't any.  While all orthodox Christians would affirm that the Incarnation is a metaphysical marvel with cosmic implications, the denier would contend that it underscores the unique place of humanity in the universe. The Second Person of the Trinity assumed human nature at a specific point in space-time on the planet Earth, about two thousand years ago. The fact that God has not so interacted with the essential nature of any other material being on any other planet in the universe is telling. Hence, through the lens of reason, the denier would suggest that Fermi's Paradox—which asks: In such a vast universe that has existed for so long, “where is everybody?”—is solved by the answer: we are alone. The denier would chalk up so-called encounters with aliens and alien spacecraft as deriving from natural causation or perhaps demonic influence. For example, the famous Navy “tic tac” video might simply be a recording of a distant plane giving off an infrared glare. And, claimants to contact (i.e., “contactees”) are typically either hoaxers, delusional, or even victims of demonic deception perhaps through involvement in the occult (as Christian apologist Kenneth Samples argues). The believer camp reads Sacred Scripture differently. While the Bible does not directly mention non-human bodily intelligences elsewhere in the galaxy, the believer emphasizes that the Bible does not deny their existence, either. The creation narratives are focused on man and Earth simply because revelation to man focuses on God's dealings with man. Nothing more need be inferred. More than that, some believers find positive evidence in the Bible of alien visitation to earth, taking, for example, Ezekiel's vision of wheels within wheels as a description of flying saucers (Ezekiel 1:15-16). And the believer contends that Jesus Himself can reasonably be read to signal that other life exists when He says, “I have other sheep that are not of this fold” (John 10:16).  Meanwhile, through the lens of reason, the believer tends to find at least some eyewitness testimony of UFO and/or alien encounters to be credible. In this view, the tic tac video and others must be nonhuman spacecraft because they show artificial objects moving in ways that are simply beyond human technology.  The believer leans on the sheer probability that, in the vastness of space, it is more likely than not that other intelligent life exists. A few hundred billion stars exist in the Milky Way Galaxy alone—and ours is just one of a couple trillion galaxies in the observable universe. The number of stars with orbiting planets is too great of a number for the human mind to comprehend: into the sextillions (1×1021). The heavens proclaim the glory of God—and is it really fitting that God would create all of that empty (Psalm 19:1)? The believer maintains that the Fermi Paradox can be solved if it turns out that advanced civilizations are relatively rare due to self-destruction, or cataclysm, or because interstellar travel is difficult, or because we aren't capable of detecting their presence or communications. The cautiously skeptical, in which I place myself, is somewhere between these camps.  By the light of faith, the dogmatic denier goes too far. God certainly could have created nonhuman intelligent life in the universe. The wonderful planet we live on is teeming with countless organisms—each with its own distinct form or kind. Each natural form has its archetype in God's mind, like the maker has in mind the idea of the artifact that he seeks to build. But, while we can mentally consider the exemplary forms in God's mind in themselves, in reality they are simply identical with God's nature, which is infinite. This entails that everything that is real in some sense is imitative of and manifests the divine nature—and that the ways in which creatures could imitate God's nature is potentially infinite.  While God could have created just one creature, Aquinas contends, this could not adequately represent God's infinite goodness. Hence, the great plurality and diversity of created things is fitting. All of this is compatible in principle with the existence of nonhuman and nonangelic intelligences. And, while demonic influence could explain alleged alien encounters, it simply begs the question to assume that any phenomena unexplained by natural causes must be demons. In short, as the Rev. Jose Gabriel Funes, the Vatican's chief astronomer, has put it, there is no contradiction with the Catholic Faith if it turned out we had “extraterrestrial brothers.” On the other hand, there are good reasons to believe that by unaided reason many of the most frequently cited UFO encounters can be explained by natural or human causation. The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day. Yet, it did find a lot of evidence of misidentification of natural phenomenon or other natural causes like hoaxing and delusion. To take one famous example, Kenneth Arnold's sighting in 1947, whence the term “flying saucers” derived, may have simply been misidentified manmade aircraft, or pelicans, or meteors, or an optical illusion.  The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day.Tweet ThisSummarizing the several domestic and foreign governmental investigations that came after Project Blue Book, the Department of Defense's AARO Historical Record Report concluded that none concluded UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin and the “vast majority of UAP [unidentified anomalous phenomena] reports could be resolved as any number of ordinary objects, natural phenomena, optical illusions or misidentifications.” While we obviously can't simply trust whatever the U.S. military claims, the believer who claims that the government is engaged in a massive cover-up bears the burden of proof.  There are also real theological challenges, at least for the dogmatic and exultant believer's view.  First, at least some UAPs may be demonic in origin—and this is the perspective not merely of some of the more thoughtful armchair theologians but of some military officials as well. Reportedly, one of the recent iterations of taxpayer-funded government investigations into UAPs, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which ran from 2007-2012, faced resistance from many officials within the Pentagon because they believed that phenomena unexplained by natural causes were caused by demons. This is certainly possible, for we know from the testimony of exorcists that demons are incredibly powerful beings and masters of deception (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:14-15). If indeed there are good reasons to believe the phenomena are demonic, these officials are right to think that they ought not to be trifled with. Moreover, the attempt to shoehorn aliens into the Bible strains credulity. A better argument is that the Bible doesn't mention lots of things that exist, like narwhals and staphylococcus, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It is the confident and gleeful attitude that some believers have that is troubling. If God created other bodily beings of reason and will, why would He direct or permit them to come to Earth? Either they would be fallen or unfallen. If fallen—that is, corrupted by sin—then they should be seen as a potential threat to humanity and in need of a Redeemer. While contact could be the catalyst for the fallen alien race to come to faith in Christ, the proper attitude is caution, not excitement, as if salvation had arrived.  On the other hand, if the alien race is unfallen, then why would individuals of that race be visiting here? In the spirit of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, in which Earth is the “silent planet”—cut off, as it were, by sin as “lost sheep” from the rest of creation—I imagine it would be fitting that God would warn any unfallen races against visiting the world in which Satan has a kind of princedom (John 14:30). Indeed, if there is an unfallen alien race, some members of that race visiting Earth, for them, could be akin to eating the forbidden fruit in the Cosmic Garden. The visitors in that case would be rogue exiles defying God.  Of course, this is all speculative—but the point is that the attitude of excited religious fervor among some believers is unjustified from a Christian perspective. Indeed, for some, belief in aliens takes on the trappings of a false religion, complete with its own rituals, sacred texts, communal gatherings, and cultus. A number of UFO cults have arisen in the 20th century—and they tend to believe that aliens are delivering some important salvific message. Some, like the Aetherius Society, go so far as to claim that Jesus Christ Himself is an alien (from Venus). For such believers, belief in aliens appears to be an outlet for the unsatisfied, deep religious longing of man for God, which places a false hope in aliens to deliver enlightenment, fulfillment, and salvation from “beyond” this world. So, what of the claims that the United States has a secret alien spacecraft crash retrieval program, the original of which crashed in Italy in 1933 and our intelligence agencies acquired via back channels from Pope Pius XII? Such extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The story of an alleged UFO crash in Magenta, Italy, in 1933 and a cover-up by the Mussolini regime predates Mr. Grusch's claims. It derives from the so-called “Fascist UFO Files,” which were anonymously sent by someone calling himself “Mr. X” to various Italian news outlets in 1996, which refused to publish the story.  Subsequently, UFOlogists Roberto Pinotti and Alfredo Lissoni came into possession of the documents and spread the story in UFO publications and a book, arguing the documents were authentic. Yet, as archivists critical of the story have pointed out, the documents produced are largely photocopies deriving from an unknown source, and the supposed originals have not been made available to scholars for independent examination.  Simply put, extraordinary evidence for such an extraordinary claim has not been provided. Catholics, therefore, have good reasons to doubt whether Pope Leo XIV has anything to reveal corroborating the story. None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).  There is evidence that the U.S. government may have engaged in psyops in this vein in the past. The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

First, at least some UAPs may be demonic in origin—and this is the perspective not merely of some of the more thoughtful armchair theologians but of some military officials as well. Reportedly, one of the recent iterations of taxpayer-funded government investigations into UAPs, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which ran from 2007-2012, faced resistance from many officials within the Pentagon because they believed that phenomena unexplained by natural causes were caused by demons. This is certainly possible, for we know from the testimony of exorcists that demons are incredibly powerful beings and masters of deception (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:14-15). If indeed there are good reasons to believe the phenomena are demonic, these officials are right to think that they ought not to be trifled with. Moreover, the attempt to shoehorn aliens into the Bible strains credulity. A better argument is that the Bible doesn't mention lots of things that exist, like narwhals and staphylococcus, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It is the confident and gleeful attitude that some believers have that is troubling. If God created other bodily beings of reason and will, why would He direct or permit them to come to Earth? Either they would be fallen or unfallen. If fallen—that is, corrupted by sin—then they should be seen as a potential threat to humanity and in need of a Redeemer. While contact could be the catalyst for the fallen alien race to come to faith in Christ, the proper attitude is caution, not excitement, as if salvation had arrived.  On the other hand, if the alien race is unfallen, then why would individuals of that race be visiting here? In the spirit of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, in which Earth is the “silent planet”—cut off, as it were, by sin as “lost sheep” from the rest of creation—I imagine it would be fitting that God would warn any unfallen races against visiting the world in which Satan has a kind of princedom (John 14:30). Indeed, if there is an unfallen alien race, some members of that race visiting Earth, for them, could be akin to eating the forbidden fruit in the Cosmic Garden. The visitors in that case would be rogue exiles defying God.  Of course, this is all speculative—but the point is that the attitude of excited religious fervor among some believers is unjustified from a Christian perspective. Indeed, for some, belief in aliens takes on the trappings of a false religion, complete with its own rituals, sacred texts, communal gatherings, and cultus. A number of UFO cults have arisen in the 20th century—and they tend to believe that aliens are delivering some important salvific message. Some, like the Aetherius Society, go so far as to claim that Jesus Christ Himself is an alien (from Venus). For such believers, belief in aliens appears to be an outlet for the unsatisfied, deep religious longing of man for God, which places a false hope in aliens to deliver enlightenment, fulfillment, and salvation from “beyond” this world. So, what of the claims that the United States has a secret alien spacecraft crash retrieval program, the original of which crashed in Italy in 1933 and our intelligence agencies acquired via back channels from Pope Pius XII? Such extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The story of an alleged UFO crash in Magenta, Italy, in 1933 and a cover-up by the Mussolini regime predates Mr. Grusch's claims. It derives from the so-called “Fascist UFO Files,” which were anonymously sent by someone calling himself “Mr. X” to various Italian news outlets in 1996, which refused to publish the story.  Subsequently, UFOlogists Roberto Pinotti and Alfredo Lissoni came into possession of the documents and spread the story in UFO publications and a book, arguing the documents were authentic. Yet, as archivists critical of the story have pointed out, the documents produced are largely photocopies deriving from an unknown source, and the supposed originals have not been made available to scholars for independent examination.  Simply put, extraordinary evidence for such an extraordinary claim has not been provided. Catholics, therefore, have good reasons to doubt whether Pope Leo XIV has anything to reveal corroborating the story. None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).  There is evidence that the U.S. government may have engaged in psyops in this vein in the past. The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

The believer camp reads Sacred Scripture differently. While the Bible does not directly mention non-human bodily intelligences elsewhere in the galaxy, the believer emphasizes that the Bible does not deny their existence, either. The creation narratives are focused on man and Earth simply because revelation to man focuses on God's dealings with man. Nothing more need be inferred. More than that, some believers find positive evidence in the Bible of alien visitation to earth, taking, for example, Ezekiel's vision of wheels within wheels as a description of flying saucers (Ezekiel 1:15-16). And the believer contends that Jesus Himself can reasonably be read to signal that other life exists when He says, “I have other sheep that are not of this fold” (John 10:16).  Meanwhile, through the lens of reason, the believer tends to find at least some eyewitness testimony of UFO and/or alien encounters to be credible. In this view, the tic tac video and others must be nonhuman spacecraft because they show artificial objects moving in ways that are simply beyond human technology.  The believer leans on the sheer probability that, in the vastness of space, it is more likely than not that other intelligent life exists. A few hundred billion stars exist in the Milky Way Galaxy alone—and ours is just one of a couple trillion galaxies in the observable universe. The number of stars with orbiting planets is too great of a number for the human mind to comprehend: into the sextillions (1×1021). The heavens proclaim the glory of God—and is it really fitting that God would create all of that empty (Psalm 19:1)? The believer maintains that the Fermi Paradox can be solved if it turns out that advanced civilizations are relatively rare due to self-destruction, or cataclysm, or because interstellar travel is difficult, or because we aren't capable of detecting their presence or communications. The cautiously skeptical, in which I place myself, is somewhere between these camps.  By the light of faith, the dogmatic denier goes too far. God certainly could have created nonhuman intelligent life in the universe. The wonderful planet we live on is teeming with countless organisms—each with its own distinct form or kind. Each natural form has its archetype in God's mind, like the maker has in mind the idea of the artifact that he seeks to build. But, while we can mentally consider the exemplary forms in God's mind in themselves, in reality they are simply identical with God's nature, which is infinite. This entails that everything that is real in some sense is imitative of and manifests the divine nature—and that the ways in which creatures could imitate God's nature is potentially infinite.  While God could have created just one creature, Aquinas contends, this could not adequately represent God's infinite goodness. Hence, the great plurality and diversity of created things is fitting. All of this is compatible in principle with the existence of nonhuman and nonangelic intelligences. And, while demonic influence could explain alleged alien encounters, it simply begs the question to assume that any phenomena unexplained by natural causes must be demons. In short, as the Rev. Jose Gabriel Funes, the Vatican's chief astronomer, has put it, there is no contradiction with the Catholic Faith if it turned out we had “extraterrestrial brothers.” On the other hand, there are good reasons to believe that by unaided reason many of the most frequently cited UFO encounters can be explained by natural or human causation. The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day. Yet, it did find a lot of evidence of misidentification of natural phenomenon or other natural causes like hoaxing and delusion. To take one famous example, Kenneth Arnold's sighting in 1947, whence the term “flying saucers” derived, may have simply been misidentified manmade aircraft, or pelicans, or meteors, or an optical illusion.

The believer leans on the sheer probability that, in the vastness of space, it is more likely than not that other intelligent life exists. A few hundred billion stars exist in the Milky Way Galaxy alone—and ours is just one of a couple trillion galaxies in the observable universe. The number of stars with orbiting planets is too great of a number for the human mind to comprehend: into the sextillions (1×1021). The heavens proclaim the glory of God—and is it really fitting that God would create all of that empty (Psalm 19:1)? The believer maintains that the Fermi Paradox can be solved if it turns out that advanced civilizations are relatively rare due to self-destruction, or cataclysm, or because interstellar travel is difficult, or because we aren't capable of detecting their presence or communications. The cautiously skeptical, in which I place myself, is somewhere between these camps.  By the light of faith, the dogmatic denier goes too far. God certainly could have created nonhuman intelligent life in the universe. The wonderful planet we live on is teeming with countless organisms—each with its own distinct form or kind. Each natural form has its archetype in God's mind, like the maker has in mind the idea of the artifact that he seeks to build. But, while we can mentally consider the exemplary forms in God's mind in themselves, in reality they are simply identical with God's nature, which is infinite. This entails that everything that is real in some sense is imitative of and manifests the divine nature—and that the ways in which creatures could imitate God's nature is potentially infinite.  While God could have created just one creature, Aquinas contends, this could not adequately represent God's infinite goodness. Hence, the great plurality and diversity of created things is fitting. All of this is compatible in principle with the existence of nonhuman and nonangelic intelligences. And, while demonic influence could explain alleged alien encounters, it simply begs the question to assume that any phenomena unexplained by natural causes must be demons. In short, as the Rev. Jose Gabriel Funes, the Vatican's chief astronomer, has put it, there is no contradiction with the Catholic Faith if it turned out we had “extraterrestrial brothers.” On the other hand, there are good reasons to believe that by unaided reason many of the most frequently cited UFO encounters can be explained by natural or human causation. The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day. Yet, it did find a lot of evidence of misidentification of natural phenomenon or other natural causes like hoaxing and delusion. To take one famous example, Kenneth Arnold's sighting in 1947, whence the term “flying saucers” derived, may have simply been misidentified manmade aircraft, or pelicans, or meteors, or an optical illusion.  The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day.Tweet ThisSummarizing the several domestic and foreign governmental investigations that came after Project Blue Book, the Department of Defense's AARO Historical Record Report concluded that none concluded UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin and the “vast majority of UAP [unidentified anomalous phenomena] reports could be resolved as any number of ordinary objects, natural phenomena, optical illusions or misidentifications.” While we obviously can't simply trust whatever the U.S. military claims, the believer who claims that the government is engaged in a massive cover-up bears the burden of proof.  There are also real theological challenges, at least for the dogmatic and exultant believer's view.  First, at least some UAPs may be demonic in origin—and this is the perspective not merely of some of the more thoughtful armchair theologians but of some military officials as well. Reportedly, one of the recent iterations of taxpayer-funded government investigations into UAPs, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which ran from 2007-2012, faced resistance from many officials within the Pentagon because they believed that phenomena unexplained by natural causes were caused by demons. This is certainly possible, for we know from the testimony of exorcists that demons are incredibly powerful beings and masters of deception (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:14-15). If indeed there are good reasons to believe the phenomena are demonic, these officials are right to think that they ought not to be trifled with. Moreover, the attempt to shoehorn aliens into the Bible strains credulity. A better argument is that the Bible doesn't mention lots of things that exist, like narwhals and staphylococcus, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It is the confident and gleeful attitude that some believers have that is troubling. If God created other bodily beings of reason and will, why would He direct or permit them to come to Earth? Either they would be fallen or unfallen. If fallen—that is, corrupted by sin—then they should be seen as a potential threat to humanity and in need of a Redeemer. While contact could be the catalyst for the fallen alien race to come to faith in Christ, the proper attitude is caution, not excitement, as if salvation had arrived.  On the other hand, if the alien race is unfallen, then why would individuals of that race be visiting here? In the spirit of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, in which Earth is the “silent planet”—cut off, as it were, by sin as “lost sheep” from the rest of creation—I imagine it would be fitting that God would warn any unfallen races against visiting the world in which Satan has a kind of princedom (John 14:30). Indeed, if there is an unfallen alien race, some members of that race visiting Earth, for them, could be akin to eating the forbidden fruit in the Cosmic Garden. The visitors in that case would be rogue exiles defying God.  Of course, this is all speculative—but the point is that the attitude of excited religious fervor among some believers is unjustified from a Christian perspective. Indeed, for some, belief in aliens takes on the trappings of a false religion, complete with its own rituals, sacred texts, communal gatherings, and cultus. A number of UFO cults have arisen in the 20th century—and they tend to believe that aliens are delivering some important salvific message. Some, like the Aetherius Society, go so far as to claim that Jesus Christ Himself is an alien (from Venus). For such believers, belief in aliens appears to be an outlet for the unsatisfied, deep religious longing of man for God, which places a false hope in aliens to deliver enlightenment, fulfillment, and salvation from “beyond” this world. So, what of the claims that the United States has a secret alien spacecraft crash retrieval program, the original of which crashed in Italy in 1933 and our intelligence agencies acquired via back channels from Pope Pius XII? Such extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The story of an alleged UFO crash in Magenta, Italy, in 1933 and a cover-up by the Mussolini regime predates Mr. Grusch's claims. It derives from the so-called “Fascist UFO Files,” which were anonymously sent by someone calling himself “Mr. X” to various Italian news outlets in 1996, which refused to publish the story.  Subsequently, UFOlogists Roberto Pinotti and Alfredo Lissoni came into possession of the documents and spread the story in UFO publications and a book, arguing the documents were authentic. Yet, as archivists critical of the story have pointed out, the documents produced are largely photocopies deriving from an unknown source, and the supposed originals have not been made available to scholars for independent examination.  Simply put, extraordinary evidence for such an extraordinary claim has not been provided. Catholics, therefore, have good reasons to doubt whether Pope Leo XIV has anything to reveal corroborating the story. None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).  There is evidence that the U.S. government may have engaged in psyops in this vein in the past. The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

While God could have created just one creature, Aquinas contends, this could not adequately represent God's infinite goodness. Hence, the great plurality and diversity of created things is fitting. All of this is compatible in principle with the existence of nonhuman and nonangelic intelligences. And, while demonic influence could explain alleged alien encounters, it simply begs the question to assume that any phenomena unexplained by natural causes must be demons. In short, as the Rev. Jose Gabriel Funes, the Vatican's chief astronomer, has put it, there is no contradiction with the Catholic Faith if it turned out we had “extraterrestrial brothers.” On the other hand, there are good reasons to believe that by unaided reason many of the most frequently cited UFO encounters can be explained by natural or human causation. The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day. Yet, it did find a lot of evidence of misidentification of natural phenomenon or other natural causes like hoaxing and delusion. To take one famous example, Kenneth Arnold's sighting in 1947, whence the term “flying saucers” derived, may have simply been misidentified manmade aircraft, or pelicans, or meteors, or an optical illusion.  The United States Air Force's Project Blue Book studied over 10,000 reported sightings and found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin or evidence of craft beyond the scientific technology of the day.Tweet ThisSummarizing the several domestic and foreign governmental investigations that came after Project Blue Book, the Department of Defense's AARO Historical Record Report concluded that none concluded UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin and the “vast majority of UAP [unidentified anomalous phenomena] reports could be resolved as any number of ordinary objects, natural phenomena, optical illusions or misidentifications.” While we obviously can't simply trust whatever the U.S. military claims, the believer who claims that the government is engaged in a massive cover-up bears the burden of proof.  There are also real theological challenges, at least for the dogmatic and exultant believer's view.  First, at least some UAPs may be demonic in origin—and this is the perspective not merely of some of the more thoughtful armchair theologians but of some military officials as well. Reportedly, one of the recent iterations of taxpayer-funded government investigations into UAPs, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which ran from 2007-2012, faced resistance from many officials within the Pentagon because they believed that phenomena unexplained by natural causes were caused by demons. This is certainly possible, for we know from the testimony of exorcists that demons are incredibly powerful beings and masters of deception (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:14-15). If indeed there are good reasons to believe the phenomena are demonic, these officials are right to think that they ought not to be trifled with. Moreover, the attempt to shoehorn aliens into the Bible strains credulity. A better argument is that the Bible doesn't mention lots of things that exist, like narwhals and staphylococcus, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It is the confident and gleeful attitude that some believers have that is troubling. If God created other bodily beings of reason and will, why would He direct or permit them to come to Earth? Either they would be fallen or unfallen. If fallen—that is, corrupted by sin—then they should be seen as a potential threat to humanity and in need of a Redeemer. While contact could be the catalyst for the fallen alien race to come to faith in Christ, the proper attitude is caution, not excitement, as if salvation had arrived.  On the other hand, if the alien race is unfallen, then why would individuals of that race be visiting here? In the spirit of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, in which Earth is the “silent planet”—cut off, as it were, by sin as “lost sheep” from the rest of creation—I imagine it would be fitting that God would warn any unfallen races against visiting the world in which Satan has a kind of princedom (John 14:30). Indeed, if there is an unfallen alien race, some members of that race visiting Earth, for them, could be akin to eating the forbidden fruit in the Cosmic Garden. The visitors in that case would be rogue exiles defying God.  Of course, this is all speculative—but the point is that the attitude of excited religious fervor among some believers is unjustified from a Christian perspective. Indeed, for some, belief in aliens takes on the trappings of a false religion, complete with its own rituals, sacred texts, communal gatherings, and cultus. A number of UFO cults have arisen in the 20th century—and they tend to believe that aliens are delivering some important salvific message. Some, like the Aetherius Society, go so far as to claim that Jesus Christ Himself is an alien (from Venus). For such believers, belief in aliens appears to be an outlet for the unsatisfied, deep religious longing of man for God, which places a false hope in aliens to deliver enlightenment, fulfillment, and salvation from “beyond” this world. So, what of the claims that the United States has a secret alien spacecraft crash retrieval program, the original of which crashed in Italy in 1933 and our intelligence agencies acquired via back channels from Pope Pius XII? Such extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The story of an alleged UFO crash in Magenta, Italy, in 1933 and a cover-up by the Mussolini regime predates Mr. Grusch's claims. It derives from the so-called “Fascist UFO Files,” which were anonymously sent by someone calling himself “Mr. X” to various Italian news outlets in 1996, which refused to publish the story.  Subsequently, UFOlogists Roberto Pinotti and Alfredo Lissoni came into possession of the documents and spread the story in UFO publications and a book, arguing the documents were authentic. Yet, as archivists critical of the story have pointed out, the documents produced are largely photocopies deriving from an unknown source, and the supposed originals have not been made available to scholars for independent examination.  Simply put, extraordinary evidence for such an extraordinary claim has not been provided. Catholics, therefore, have good reasons to doubt whether Pope Leo XIV has anything to reveal corroborating the story. None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).

Summarizing the several domestic and foreign governmental investigations that came after Project Blue Book, the Department of Defense's AARO Historical Record Report concluded that none concluded UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin and the “vast majority of UAP [unidentified anomalous phenomena] reports could be resolved as any number of ordinary objects, natural phenomena, optical illusions or misidentifications.” While we obviously can't simply trust whatever the U.S. military claims, the believer who claims that the government is engaged in a massive cover-up bears the burden of proof.  There are also real theological challenges, at least for the dogmatic and exultant believer's view.  First, at least some UAPs may be demonic in origin—and this is the perspective not merely of some of the more thoughtful armchair theologians but of some military officials as well. Reportedly, one of the recent iterations of taxpayer-funded government investigations into UAPs, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which ran from 2007-2012, faced resistance from many officials within the Pentagon because they believed that phenomena unexplained by natural causes were caused by demons. This is certainly possible, for we know from the testimony of exorcists that demons are incredibly powerful beings and masters of deception (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:14-15). If indeed there are good reasons to believe the phenomena are demonic, these officials are right to think that they ought not to be trifled with. Moreover, the attempt to shoehorn aliens into the Bible strains credulity. A better argument is that the Bible doesn't mention lots of things that exist, like narwhals and staphylococcus, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It is the confident and gleeful attitude that some believers have that is troubling. If God created other bodily beings of reason and will, why would He direct or permit them to come to Earth? Either they would be fallen or unfallen. If fallen—that is, corrupted by sin—then they should be seen as a potential threat to humanity and in need of a Redeemer. While contact could be the catalyst for the fallen alien race to come to faith in Christ, the proper attitude is caution, not excitement, as if salvation had arrived.  On the other hand, if the alien race is unfallen, then why would individuals of that race be visiting here? In the spirit of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, in which Earth is the “silent planet”—cut off, as it were, by sin as “lost sheep” from the rest of creation—I imagine it would be fitting that God would warn any unfallen races against visiting the world in which Satan has a kind of princedom (John 14:30). Indeed, if there is an unfallen alien race, some members of that race visiting Earth, for them, could be akin to eating the forbidden fruit in the Cosmic Garden. The visitors in that case would be rogue exiles defying God.  Of course, this is all speculative—but the point is that the attitude of excited religious fervor among some believers is unjustified from a Christian perspective. Indeed, for some, belief in aliens takes on the trappings of a false religion, complete with its own rituals, sacred texts, communal gatherings, and cultus. A number of UFO cults have arisen in the 20th century—and they tend to believe that aliens are delivering some important salvific message. Some, like the Aetherius Society, go so far as to claim that Jesus Christ Himself is an alien (from Venus). For such believers, belief in aliens appears to be an outlet for the unsatisfied, deep religious longing of man for God, which places a false hope in aliens to deliver enlightenment, fulfillment, and salvation from “beyond” this world. So, what of the claims that the United States has a secret alien spacecraft crash retrieval program, the original of which crashed in Italy in 1933 and our intelligence agencies acquired via back channels from Pope Pius XII? Such extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The story of an alleged UFO crash in Magenta, Italy, in 1933 and a cover-up by the Mussolini regime predates Mr. Grusch's claims. It derives from the so-called “Fascist UFO Files,” which were anonymously sent by someone calling himself “Mr. X” to various Italian news outlets in 1996, which refused to publish the story.  Subsequently, UFOlogists Roberto Pinotti and Alfredo Lissoni came into possession of the documents and spread the story in UFO publications and a book, arguing the documents were authentic. Yet, as archivists critical of the story have pointed out, the documents produced are largely photocopies deriving from an unknown source, and the supposed originals have not been made available to scholars for independent examination.  Simply put, extraordinary evidence for such an extraordinary claim has not been provided. Catholics, therefore, have good reasons to doubt whether Pope Leo XIV has anything to reveal corroborating the story. None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).  There is evidence that the U.S. government may have engaged in psyops in this vein in the past. The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

On the other hand, if the alien race is unfallen, then why would individuals of that race be visiting here? In the spirit of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, in which Earth is the “silent planet”—cut off, as it were, by sin as “lost sheep” from the rest of creation—I imagine it would be fitting that God would warn any unfallen races against visiting the world in which Satan has a kind of princedom (John 14:30). Indeed, if there is an unfallen alien race, some members of that race visiting Earth, for them, could be akin to eating the forbidden fruit in the Cosmic Garden. The visitors in that case would be rogue exiles defying God.  Of course, this is all speculative—but the point is that the attitude of excited religious fervor among some believers is unjustified from a Christian perspective. Indeed, for some, belief in aliens takes on the trappings of a false religion, complete with its own rituals, sacred texts, communal gatherings, and cultus. A number of UFO cults have arisen in the 20th century—and they tend to believe that aliens are delivering some important salvific message. Some, like the Aetherius Society, go so far as to claim that Jesus Christ Himself is an alien (from Venus). For such believers, belief in aliens appears to be an outlet for the unsatisfied, deep religious longing of man for God, which places a false hope in aliens to deliver enlightenment, fulfillment, and salvation from “beyond” this world. So, what of the claims that the United States has a secret alien spacecraft crash retrieval program, the original of which crashed in Italy in 1933 and our intelligence agencies acquired via back channels from Pope Pius XII? Such extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The story of an alleged UFO crash in Magenta, Italy, in 1933 and a cover-up by the Mussolini regime predates Mr. Grusch's claims. It derives from the so-called “Fascist UFO Files,” which were anonymously sent by someone calling himself “Mr. X” to various Italian news outlets in 1996, which refused to publish the story.  Subsequently, UFOlogists Roberto Pinotti and Alfredo Lissoni came into possession of the documents and spread the story in UFO publications and a book, arguing the documents were authentic. Yet, as archivists critical of the story have pointed out, the documents produced are largely photocopies deriving from an unknown source, and the supposed originals have not been made available to scholars for independent examination.  Simply put, extraordinary evidence for such an extraordinary claim has not been provided. Catholics, therefore, have good reasons to doubt whether Pope Leo XIV has anything to reveal corroborating the story. None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).

He is the author of Thomas Hobbes and the Natural Law (University of Notre Dame Press, 2018) and coauthor of the forthcoming book The Classical and Christian Origins of American Politics: Political Theology, Natural Law, and the American Founding (Cambridge University Press).                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                            










None of this necessarily means that Mr. Grusch is consciously lying; he seems to have the marks of a man who believes what he is saying. But without the extraordinary evidence—such as showing us the receipts (e.g., evidence of the spacecraft that he admittedly has not seen himself)—it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Grusch is, perhaps unwittingly, an agent of disinformation (a point that some Catholic commentators have made).  There is evidence that the U.S. government may have engaged in psyops in this vein in the past. The Majestic-12 or MJ-12 documents that started to come out in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War—which purported to show internal governmental memos verifying that the U.S. had recovered crashed alien spacecraft and bodies—turned out to be an elaborate hoax that agents within the government itself may have sown or at the very least tolerated (the FBI did not pursue prosecution of the hoaxers). If your enemies believed you might have alien tech, would they not hesitate before initiating war? If U.S. government agents believed such tactics to be effective psyops against the Russians in the '80s, why not again today? Still, reasonable persons with Christian faith should be open to wherever the evidence might lead. In the meantime, we have a firm rock to stand on and a clear duty to perform, regardless of what hot air or interstellar winds might bring: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Do not be carried away with all sorts of strange teachings” (Hebrews 13:8-9).

Ariana Grande is keeping the Eternal Sunshine era alive. On Monday, she dropped a new video for “Supernatural,” repurposing a sci-fi scene from her Brighter Days Ahead short film for the visual.


	The Christian Breslauer and Ariana Grande-directed video sees Grande, dressed in a silk cream dress, walking through the debris of a city on fire. The pop star sings the lyrics as she looks at the aftermath of a disaster. 


	“This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all/It's like supernatural,” Grande sings. “It's takin' over me, don't wanna fight the fall/It's like supernatural.” Toward the end of the video, Grande walks toward a UFO-like beaming light. As she approaches it, Grande begins to levitate.


	“Supernatural” is the fourth single off of Eternal Sunshine, which received a deluxe edition (and the accompanying short film) in March. “Letting go is harder work than it seems, even when Grande's turning her pain into music,” read a Rolling Stone review of the deluxe album and film. “But that's what makes these songs — like the rest of Eternal Sunshine — reach so deep.”

	Grande led the album with “Yes, And?” in January 2024 and “We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” in March of that year. Following the LP's release, she dropped a video starring Penn Badgley for “The Boy Is Mine” in June last year.


	In mid-April, the singer released a behind-the-scenes video of Brighter Days Ahead, her short film inspired by the 2004 indie classic Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. “When we are young, sometimes we want to erase certain things or rewrite certain things that seem painful to us in the moment, but when we grow older, we would do anything to relive those moments,” Grande said in the clip.

May 19 (UPI) -- Pop icon Ariana Grande released a music video Monday for ""Supernatural,"" a song featured on her Eternal Sunshine album.

The video shows the Wicked actress walking through a city apparently ravaged by aliens, with wrecked cars and fires burning in various places. Grande sings as she takes in the scene, wearing a cream-colored silky dress.

""This love's possessing me, but I don't mind at all,"" she sings. ""It's taking over me. Don't wanna fight the fall.""

She approaches an alien space craft and is beamed up to the ship as the song concludes.

Grande released Eternal Sunshine on March 8. She followed up with Brighter Days, a deluxe version of Eternal Sunshine featuring six new songs, on March 28.","{'href': 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News Canada'}","other"

The Pokémon TCG has unveiled new Japanese Frillish and Jellicent ex cards, with infuriatingly good item lock powers - and more besides.



                    Alex Evans                



Published: May 19, 2025 

The latest crop of card reveals from Pokémon White Flare is in, with a new Frillish and Jellicent ex that could well shoot right to the top of the meta thanks to great stats, tasty energy synergy with the infamous Gardevoir ex, and extreme item locking abilities that'll leave poor Budew back where it started: just a cute little guy.


As revealed via fansite Pokébeach on Sunday, the new Frillish and Jellicent are coming in White Flare – one half of Black Bolt and White Flare, the Pokémon TCG's first ever English 'dual set', due out on June 18. For full details, check our complete list of all Pokemon sets.



And these two psychic-type jellyfish Pokémon have already sent the fandom spinning, with good reason: the new Jellicent ex is an absolute powerhouse. One of the highest HP Pokémon ex around, combined with a relatively do-able 160 damage attack, is a powerful cocktail, but that's not even the best part: Jellicent is packing the best item-locking ability we've yet seen.






With thanks to Pokébeach for the Japanese English translation, here are the stats:



Jellicent ex – Psychic – HP270
Stage 1 – Evolves from Frillish



Ability: Sea Curse
As long as this Pokémon is in the Active Spot, your opponent can't play any Item cards or attach any Pokémon Tool cards from their hand.



[P][C] Power Press: 80+ damage. If this Pokémon has at least 2 extra Energy attached (in addition to this attack's cost), this attack does 80 more damage.



Weakness: Darkness (x2)
Resistance: Fighting (-30)
Retreat: 3



Loading up four energy for the Power Press attack might seem like a bottleneck, but that's where the Gardevoir ex synergy comes in, because – contrary to all watery appearances – these jellies use psychic energy. Use Gardy's ability to hoover up lost psychic energies to power Jellicent, and you'll be giving your opponent very dangerous hugs, very quickly.



That Sea Curse ability is the clincher, though. Shutting down both items and Pokémon tools passively, without being tied to an attack or energy cost, is way beyond any other item lockers around, and a fantastic foil to many of the most powerful strategies in the game currently. Your opponent's best chance is to gust it back to the bench – which they'll find much harder to do without using any items!



With precious few ability-locking cards in the meta just now, this evil jellyfish is going to shut down a lot of opponents' decks with ease. Buffing it to a mighty 370HP with a Hero's Cape, safe in the knowledge that your opponent can't tool up in response, is a fiendish control play that'd make even Magic: The Gathering Blue deck players jealous.






Frillish – Psychic – HP80
Basic Pokémon



[P] Sea Shadows: 20 damage. During your opponent's next turn, they can't play any Item cards from their hand.



Weakness: Darkness (x2)
Resistance: Fighting (-30)
Retreat: 3



The new Frillish isn't just a means to an end, either – it's a solid 80HP Basic Pokémon and a decent item locker in its own right! It's essentially the Budew everyone's been afraid of, but stronger, and in Psychic rather than Grass.



The pay-off is in the eye-watering 3-energy retreat cost, of course, where Budew can hop back to the bench for free. But it's still likely to replace Budew in Gardevoir decks, simply for the ease of psychic energy use – effectively streamlining an already popular deck that didn't need much help.



Expect to see a lot of this little duo when Black Bolt and White Flare drop next month – Jellicent ex might look like a butt wearing a crown, but it's going to rule a lot of tabletops, mark our words. If a Special Illustration Rare version gets revealed, expect it to become one of the most expensive rare Pokémon cards of the dual set.



What do you think? Have we overhyped this big, nasty, psychic butt jellyfish and its Budew-beating younger sibling? Are there some sick plays we missed? Let us know in the Wargamer Discord community – we can aways use some more hype about the newest Pokemon set.

Disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino reaffirmed Sunday, countering conspiracy theories that have lingered since Epstein died while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

“As someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one, and that's what that was,” Patel told Fox News's Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures,” adding that those who believe something nefarious happened “have a right to their opinion.”

“I have seen the whole file. He killed himself,” Bongino added in their joint interview at the FBI's Hoover Building.

Their blunt answers represent a turn in the long-debated Epstein case. The phrase “Epstein didn't kill himself” became a meme after he died, and Republicans in Congress have fueled speculation about the subject through the years.

Multiple members of the Trump administration vowed to provide more insight into the Epstein case and his death after Trump's return to the White House, as questions have persisted over Epstein's alleged sex trafficking of minors and who else may have been involved.

President Trump, who knew Epstein, signed an executive order in January directing a review of classified records that are of public interest, including documents related to investigations of Epstein and political assassinations. A bipartisan congressional panel also has been tasked with going over the documents.

Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to release the “Epstein files” of interest, particularly flight logs and any form of “client list” that may exist, though a flashy unveiling of the initial tranche of records fell flat in March.

Epstein, who owned a Caribbean island, private jet and several mansions, frequently hobnobbed with powerful and wealthy individuals, even after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to solicitation charges. Photos have shown him with Trump, former President Clinton, England's Prince Andrew and a slew of other celebrities.

Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, his alleged co-conspirator in the sex trafficking scheme, was convicted in 2021 on multiple charges, including sex trafficking, conspiracy and transportation of a minor for illegal sexual activity. She is currently serving 20 years in prison.

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Donald Trump Jr. has taken aim at Joe Biden's wife for failing to miss the signs of her husband's prostate cancer. 

The US president's son shared a conspiratorial message claiming that the White House must have known about Biden's diagnosis while he was in office. 

“What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???” Trump Jr. said in a sarcastic jab at former First Lady Jill Biden.

There is no such thing as stage five cancer. The post appears to be a swipe at Dr. Jill Biden, who has a doctoral degree in education. 

Hours earlier, Trump Jr. shared a screenshot calling for respect for the Biden family after the diagnosis. He added, "" 100 percent agree.” 

Trump Jr. wasn't alone in spreading theories without proof. 

Dr. Ronny Jackson, a Republican congressman and Donald Trump's former physician, tweeted his belief that Biden's doctor during his tenure in the White House was “more concerned about assisting with the political cover up than providing world class medical care.”

Meanwhie, right-wing influencers the Hodgetwins, tweeted: “Less than a year ago Biden's doctors stated Biden was healthy. Currently Biden has prostate cancer with metastasis to the bone. With the best doctors money can buy there's no way they didn't know. The Democrats and the media all lied and coverup it up!”

In a statement released by the former president's office on Sunday, it was announced that Biden was diagnosed a week prior after experiencing “increasing urinary symptoms”. 

“Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,” the statement read. 

“On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. 

“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. The president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.” 

Trump, who has often ridiculed Biden following rumours of his ill-health while in office, wrote that he was “saddened” to hear about the diagnosis. 

He wrote: “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis.

“We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”

Scientists say they've created a battery that can stretch and bend without losing power. The discovery paves the way for wearable technology, smart medical devices, and robots with human-like movements.

""The texture is a bit like toothpaste,"" senior author Aiman Rahmanudin, an assistant professor at Linköping University in Sweden, said in a statement. ""The material can, for instance, be used in a 3D printer to shape the battery as you please. This opens up for a new type of technology.""

Traditional batteries face a tradeoff between size/flexibility and power. The scientists at Linköping University's Laboratory of Organic Electronics solved that problem by using materials that can hold and conduct negative and positive charges to power devices regardless of their energy demands. The findings were published April 11 in the journal Science Advances.

""Batteries are the largest component of all electronics,"" Rahmanudin said. ""Today they are solid and quite bulky. But with a soft and conformable battery, there are no design limitations. It can be integrated into electronics in a completely different way and adapted to the user.""

To produce their design, the researchers reimagined the active ingredients, d the connective portions and the terminals that make up a battery. The active ingredients of cathodes (positive charges) and anodes (negative charges) are made of modified lignin, an organic material. The connections or positive and negative terminals of the battery are still metallic but they're made of nanographite and silver nanowires that are small enough to remain flexible with the rest of the battery.

The result is a battery that behaves somewhat like a water balloon — retaining its overall shape and holding a large amount of material while remaining flexible, the scientists said in the study.

""The study from Linköping University demonstrates a groundbreaking approach to battery design,"" Pragathi Darapaneni, a senior product development engineer at Schaeffler Asia, told Live Science in an email. ""By utilizing fluid electrodes, the researchers have created a battery that maintains functionality while being deformable. This could lead to significant advancements in the design of wearable and implantable devices.​""

Potential applications of this discovery include insulin pumps, pacemakers and hearing aids, along with e-textiles containing electronics in clothing that conform to the user's body, and soft robotics that enable robots to bend and flex smoothly.

—'Springy' solid-state battery is twice the width of a white blood cell and could drastically increase EV range

—Future wearable devices could draw power through your body using background 6G cellphone signals

The researchers said in the study that they've based their soft battery on conductive plastics (conjugated polymers) and lignin, a byproduct of the paper production. The battery can be recharged and discharged over 500 times and still maintain its performance. It can also be stretched to double the length and still work just as well.""

While the researchers state the battery isn't perfect, since the concept is proven at 0.9 volts and most batteries charge at minimum 1.5 volts, they are looking for chemical compounds to expand the voltage capabilities.

""While promising, fluid batteries must be evaluated for potential risks, ensuring that the materials used are non-toxic and safe for prolonged contact with human skin,"" Darapeni wrote about the study.

A Chinese woman was allegedly forced to take off her heavy makeup after facial recognition scanners at an airport failed to confirm her identity.

A short clip showing a young woman using wet wipes to clean her face of makeup while being scolded by airport staff went viral on Chinese social media last week, sparking all sorts of humorous comments. According to the boarding pass shown in the video next to the woman's ID, the video was shot in September of last year, at Shanghai Airport, but only recently attracted attention online. During the short clip, the woman holding the camera (presumably an airport official), scolds the young girl, telling her that she needs to wipe off all the makeup until she looks like the picture on her identification document.



“Wipe everything off until you look like your passport photo. Why would you do your makeup like that? You are asking for trouble,” the voice behind the camera says.

It's unclear whether the woman eventually passed the airport's facial recognition scan, but her ordeal did inspire humorous comments on social media.

“It's not like she was able to walk around with a filter on in real life, right?” one person asked.

 

Others took pity on the young woman, saying that she already looked embarrassed enough, and there was no woman for the airport official to nag her about the makeup, while others wondered whether the makeup should be an issue for modern facial recognition scanners.

“No matter how thick the makeup is, the face shouldn't be unrecognizable, right? Isn't it time to upgrade the equipment?” one person wondered.

We reported a similar incident a while back, when several Chinese women had problems entering the country after flying to South Korea for facial plastic surgery, which changed their look so much that they became unrecognizable.

When Gilberto Loureiro spent summers working in a textile factory as a teenager growing up in Portugal, he discovered that he felt ""hate and love"" for how clothes were produced.

The work was tough: Loureiro's job was to spend long days standing and watching for flaws in woven fabric as it ran through machines at a rate of about 15 to 20 meters per minute.

""I really love the textile industry and problem solving, but I hate this … inspection working and inefficiencies and the waste. It's really one of the most difficult jobs in the world,"" Loureiro told CNBC via video call.

In the decade since he undertook his first shift on the factory floor, Loureiro's mindset shifted. After taking a master's degree in physics, he co-founded of Smartex, a tech company that uses cameras, vision software and artificial intelligence to spot defects in textiles during their production, and therefore reduce the proportion of fabric going to waste. Loureiro claims the technology has prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years.

Fashion has a big waste problem, with about a truckload of clothes thrown away and buried or burned every second, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a nonprofit. Smartex claims that its defect-spotting technology means 0.37% more garments can be produced per kilogram of finished fabric — which adds up, if you consider that fashion giant Inditex (owner of Zara) used 678,596 tonnes of raw materials in its products in 2024, per its annual report.

On top of that, fashion is an industry that's yet to fully embrace digitalization, Loureiro said, partly because it's seen as hard to do. Making clothes is complicated because supply chains can be long and fragmented, from growing and processing raw materials such as cotton, to weaving and dyeing textiles, designing patterns and sewing fabric into garments. At the same time, it's a fast-moving and unpredictable industry.

""If this is the largest industry that is still untouched by [the] internet and is one of the largest pollutants in the world, and nobody is working on this in terms of technology [then] there is a massive gap here,"" Loureiro said. About 20% of water pollution globally is caused by dyeing and finishing during textile production, according to the EU.

This lack of technology in apparel production and the potential for the industry to become more efficient has made Smartex appealing to investors, Loureiro said. H&M Group invested in Smartex in 2022, while Tony Fadell — inventor of the iPod and the Nest thermostat — led a $24.7 million investment round with Lightspeed Venture Partners in the same year. Smartex has raised more than $40 million to date, according to Loureiro, but given the industry's complexity and operations in multiple countries, he said, investors are ""brave"" to back it. ""There is a huge value to capture. So that's a big risk, being reward,"" he added, given the size of the industry, which is estimated to be worth more than $1.8 trillion in 2025.

Smartex and its high-profile investors caught the eye of Amazon, which has also put money into the company via its AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship, an initiative that backs tech startups in areas like food security, conservation and climate resilience. Lisbeth Kaufman, head of climate tech business development, startups and venture capital at AWS, launched the fellowship in 2023, with four companies winning a place on the program.

""Climate tech startups, they have so much R&D [research and development] that they need to do ... maybe even more than ... standard tech companies, they have to invent new science or new technology, as well as new business models,"" Kaufman told CNBC via video call. Companies in the fellowship are given access to AWS experts as well as advanced computing services, and 20 firms will be selected to take part this year with a total investment of $4 million. Smartex uses AWS technology to train its machine learning models to identify flaws in fabric, which can vary significantly.

Loureiro spends much of his time visiting textile factories, mostly in Asian countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam, where he finds factory owners keen to understand how quickly an investment in Smartex will pay back.

""If in 30 seconds he's not convinced about the ROI [return on investment] payback, in less than one year, for example, you are out of the game ... We need to prove to them that they will save in materials, in yarn or in electricity,"" Loureiro said. Most of the factory owners who sign up spend ""a few hundreds of thousands of dollars"" on Smartex. ""We need to make sure the savings are much, much bigger than the cost,"" Loureiro said. The average payback period for an investment in Smartex is nine to 18 months, according to the Apparel Impact Institute.

The goal of Smartex is to become an ""operating system"" for factories in the whole fashion supply chain so that brands can track information such as where garments are coming from, where they are in the production process and how much water is used to produce items. ""These are basic questions that are very difficult or impossible to answer by most fashion brands,"" Loureiro said.

Fadell has likened the potential of Smartex to Apple's software ecosystem, Loureiro said. ""It's not about the computer, the Mac or the iPhone or the AirPods, it's about what they can do all together, creates an ecosystem, a layer on top that becomes much more valuable.""
