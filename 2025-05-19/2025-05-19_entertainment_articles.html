Formerly a hyper-capitalistic shoe magnate embodied by the wolfish Toshiro Mifune, Kingo Gondo has been reborn as record executive David King (Denzel Washington, in what might be his most towering screen performance since “Training Day”). Related Stories ‘Splitsville' Review: Open-Relationship Comedy from ‘The Climb' Team Hits All the Right Notes ‘A Poet' Review: A Pathetic Man of Letters Sets the Stage for a Cringe-Inducing Satire of Prestigious Art Spaces Once again, our protagonist is forced into a compromising position on the eve of a critical business deal when a downtrodden kidnapper mistakes his driver's son for his own kid, Trey (Aubrey Joseph). The world is a very different place than it was 60 years ago, but some things never change; when people lose hope, they still turn against the people who gave it to them. Only now, the cash-strapped kidnapper doesn't have to physically look up at the rich man's castle in order to be taunted by his fortune (although Lee makes sure to include a scene where the criminal does that anyway). In the version of the story that screenwriter William Alan Fox has reworked for 2025, the bad guy may not be able to spy his idol and nemesis from his own apartment in Forest Hills, but he feels like David is personally mocking him every time he looks at his phone. Even at a time of immense economic stratification, technology has the power to make people's dream lives seem close enough to reach out and grab for themselves, and that closeness is especially palpable for a young Black rapper (A$AP Rocky, just as good here as he is in recent Sundance highlight “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You”), who sees so much of himself in the multi-millionaire CEO of Stackin' Hits records. The truth, however, is that David King — or King David, as he's been crowned by the New York media — is no longer as secure in his throne as he was during the pre-Spotify golden age of 2000s hip-hop. Despite promising his wife Pam (Ilfenesh Hadera, giving beneficent Queen Macbeth) that he'd sell his empire and saunter off into the sunset, David's wounded pride inspires a desperate bid to buy out his partner and recover full ownership of the label, and he'll need every cent he's got in order to pull it off. Only so much can be gained from comparing Lee's movie against the much tenser and more severe Kurosawa masterpiece that inspired it (and was itself based on the Evan Hunter novel “King's Ransom”), but the relationship between David and his driver is one of the few areas where “Highest 2 Lowest” clearly comes out on top. If Washington owns every minute of this film, riveting as he grasps for a righteousness that his money can't seem to buy him, Jeffrey Wright's heartsick performance as David's best friend and closest employee is the friction that gives purchase to his character's inner conflict. Paul grew up with David, but life took him in another direction, and he's been living in the King's penthouse ever since he got out of jail. Such is the price they pay for trying to pretend — as so many people do — that money is somehow able to exist without a moral dimension. Lee doesn't share Kurosawa's patience for long, talky, single-location sequences, and his attempts at Ice Spicing up this relatively low-event movie can be more trouble than they're worth, even if Ice Spice herself is acquitted on all charges for her two seconds of screen time. Hard cuts, double takes, and strange cameos are par for the course with Spike, but those affectations tend to distract from the primacy of this film's performances. Elsewhere, and everywhere, Howard Drossin's wildly intrusive orchestral score smothers every moment in a wall of sound that burrows into your head like hold music and refuses to discriminate between moods. That garishness also seeps into Matthew Libatique's digital cinematography, but there it works to the advantage of this movie's heated sense of panic (not “Do the Right Thing” or “Summer of Sam” hot, but sweltering enough to feel David lose his cool). Then again, there isn't exactly a lot to see. While it would be absurd to suggest that Lee's reimagination doesn't have its own vivid sense of place (a famous sequence, now set aboard the 6 train as it travels from Borough Hall to the Bronx, flattens New York City into a unified socioeconomic class of Yankees fans), the film's general disinterest in replicating the verticality of Kurosawa's version takes away from a third act plunge into the kidnapper's environment. But Lee is so much more interesting for what he brings to a project than for what he takes away from it, and “Highest 2 Lowest” is naturally at its best when it deviates from its source material. No spoilers, but at a certain point in the movie Denzel Washington is forced to rap for his life. It shouldn't work, and it definitely almost doesn't, but director and star alike commit to the bit with the same intensity that they've always committed to each other, and somehow they make it sing. That's one of several risks Lee takes in service of making “Highest 2 Lowest” significantly more fun and hopeful than any iteration of this story has ever been before — risks which are all in the service of showcasing, to quote the press notes, “the transcendent power of music and the loving bonds of a close-knit African American family.” If this story of economic despair and its malcontents doesn't seem like it was ever intended to be a vehicle for those messages, Lee doesn't seem to have gotten the memo, as he eschews the morally ambiguous despair of Kurosawa's ending in favor of a kumbaya for the richest family in town. And so Lee's reinterpretation strains to leave us on a high instead of a low, as befits the finale of an update so compellingly eager to flip the script on one of Kurosawa's most cynical films. A24 will release it in theaters on Friday, August 22, and it will be available to stream on Apple TV starting Friday, September 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet again a filmmaker has gone to the throne of Japanese giant Akira Kurosawa for inspiration. Among the lauded director's films Hollywood has turned into English-language adaptations are Seven Samurai, which became The Magnificent Seven twice (including once with Denzel Washington); Rashomon, which became Paul Newman's The Outrage; Ikiru, remade a few years ago as Living; Yojimbo, which led to an uncredited inspiration for A Fistful of Dollars; and 1958's Hidden Fortress, unquestionably an inspiration for George Lucas and Star Wars. Now chalk up another one with Spike Lee‘s new take on Kurosawa's 1963 drama High and Low, in which Toshiro Mifune played a shoemaker executive who is torn between paying the ransom to his chauffeur's son's kidnapper after the criminal nabbed him by mistake instead of the executive's son, who was safe. And that is exactly the setup for Lee's thrilling and entertaining new drama Highest 2 Lowest, which has been reset to the contemporary music industry with Washington as David King aka “King David,” a hugely successful music mogul who finds his Stackin' Hits Records is about to be taken over and now has plans to start a new label and return to the top of the charts. When his son Trey (Aubrey Joseph) and godson Kyle (Elijah Wright in a film debut) and son of his best friend and driver Paul (Jeffrey Wright) are mistaken for each other by the inept kidnapper, that criminal demands David pay the $17.5 million ransom anyway or Kyle dies. RELATED: Denzel Washington Gets Surprise Honorary Palme d'Or At Cannes Ahead Of ‘Highest 2 Lowest' Premiere The riveting answer to what David will do is played out in this tense cat-and-mouse game. Should he refuse, he is told social media will just destroy him anyway for the heartless act of turning his back on his friend Paul and his son who are definitely living on a wildly different class level than the Kings do. His wife Pam (IIfenesh Hadera) is distraught at first, thinking the guy had their son, but now has definite ideas of her own about how to proceed. There's also a trio of NYPD detectives on the case (Dean Winters, LaChanze, John Douglas Thompson). The tension mounts as they try to lure the kidnapper, who slyly barks his demands and tries to one-up David in some phone encounters. RELATED: Spike Lee's Denzel Washington Pic ‘Highest 2 Lowest' Scores Six-Minute Ovation At Cannes Premiere Well, it turns out to be a guy whose life's dream was to be discovered by King David and handed a contract for Stackin' Hits as the next great rapper. His name in Yung Felon, and he is played in a sensational supporting turn by A$AP Rocky, whose romantic partner Marisol (Isis “Ice Spice” Gaston) might hold the key to finding him. RELATED: Denzel Washington's Career In Pictures: ‘Glory' To ‘Gladiator II' It has been in various forms of development over 30 years for the likes of David Mamet, Chris Rock and others, and now Washington helped get Lee on board with it for a new take from screenwriter Alan Fox, who adapts material from Ed McBain's book King's Ransom and the original Kurosawa movie. The premise fits like a glove with the music industry, and Washington is smooth as silk, delivering one of his best recent performances as a man caught in an impossible moral quandary. With his fifth collaboration with Lee (Malcolm X, He Got Game, Inside Man, Mo Better Blues), he really finds his groove on this one to be sure. A$AP Rocky, who was seen in the film Monsters, proves he can go toe-to-toe with Washington and shows he has dramatic chops to shine here. RELATED: Denzel Washington, Robert Pattinson & Daisy Edgar-Jones Set For Netflix Heist Pic ‘Here Comes The Flood' From Fernando Meirelles As is the case with most Lee joints, this one has a superb, soaring musical score from Howard Drossin that really feels NYC to its core.

There's a sequence early into “Splitsville,” premiering out of competition in Cannes, that makes you realize just why the team of Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin wanted to make this movie. The writers and actors best known for their indie hit “The Climb” have returned with a flashier cast for this new endeavor, but maybe they weren't seeking bigger profile projects with glamorous movie stars. What results is one of the funniest fight scenes in recent memory. It starts with slapping and then turns to wrestling, followed by increasing levels of destruction as the two lay waste to a gorgeous Hamptons home, breaking tables and bashing in the walls. Covino, who also serves as director, and Marvin let their bodies flail around for maximum hilarity, and each new phase of their brawl includes another surprising, uproarious micro set piece. If “Splitsville” was just this it would be worth the price of admission. Related Stories Kate Mara on Treating ‘Friendship' Like a ‘Dramatic' Indie and the Surprisingly ‘Weird' Connection to Werner Herzog ‘Renoir' Review: An 11-Year-Old Girl Ponders the Mysteries of the Universe in Chie Hayakawa's Extremely Low-Key Coming-of-Age Drama But Covino and Marvin have constructed around it a reliably funny rom-com about the notion of open relationships. It's shaggy in places and favors one side of its story above the other, but ultimately makes for a delightful time. Gym teacher Carey (Marvin) and his wife, life coach Ashley (Adria Arjona), are on the way to the beach house owned by their richer friends Julie (Dakota Johnson) and Paul (Michael Angelo Covino), Carey's childhood best friend. But even though Carey and Ashley duet (poorly) to Stevie Nicks and Kenny Loggins' “Whenever I Call You Friend,” something is amiss. And then an in-transit hand job goes awry when a car in front of them crashes, resulting in at least one death. That's enough to put life in perspective for Ashley. At their place, tending to Carey's emotional wounds and checking him for ticks, Julie and Paul reveal their secret to happiness: They have an open marriage. The next day Paul, a real estate guy, is off in the city and Julie bemoans his absence in her life. Paul, upon learning of their coitus, does not take it well. From there Marvin and Covino spin out their premise to more ridiculous heights as Carey returns to the city to find that Ashley has started taking a series of increasingly needy lovers which he systematically befriends. (At one point, he shows them “Lorenzo's Oil” for movie night. Meanwhile, Paul finds himself in a work crisis that puts the lifestyle of Julie and their rebellious son Russ (Simon Webster) in jeopardy, leading Julie back to the dopey sweetness of Carey. Marvin plays Carey as a charming loser with whom you can't help but fall in love in a performance that's so endearing you have no trouble believing that two of the most beautiful women on the planet would be into him, even when he's pathetic and annoying. (Also the fact that his character has a huge dick which we see on screen multiple times helps support this.) Covino on the other hand plays Paul with a dash of loathsome rich guy energy, that feels like the polar opposite of Carey's mild nature. She channels her frustration into wryly sardonic line deliveries. Arjona on the other hand has more outright comedic scenes as Ashley, who tries on increasingly wacky new personalities as she dates new people. Perhaps because the story immediately turns to Carey after she announces she wants out, we are never really given time to understand her desires. It's harder to be on her side, especially considering that Carey does seem like a nice guy and a good lay from Julie's perspective. Even when beats feel underwritten, Marvin and Covino's script is so consistently funny it doesn't really matter. On top of that, Covino, working with cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra stages the action with a propulsivity and creativity that makes the domestic problems feel cinematically alive. Still, the filmmakers have created an utterly endearing tale of four people trying to negotiate their own desires in the silliest ways possible with unexpected chaos around every turn.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billboard's intrepid reporter goes deep on who performed, who partied, what they ate and drank, and what they wore (or didn't wear) in Alabama. Hunched over a paper plate piled with oysters and snow crab legs, I realized I hadn't worn a shirt now in two days. You could call the lineup that Wallen hand-picked “country-oriented,” though its details might surprise an old-school genre purist. Just past the three-day fest's headliners (the newly roots-y Post Malone, country stalwarts Brooks & Dunn and Wallen himself) are an array of acts which suggest that, at a moment when country music's bigger than it's been in decades, its once strict boundaries are more porous than ever. Among rising country stars like Bailey Zimmerman and Ella Langley are a slew of rappers—some newer (like BigXthaPlug), some veterans (2 Chainz and Memphis icons Three 6 Mafia), though nearly all of them are Southern. Then there's a handful of indie rock bands (The War on Drugs, Wild Nothing, Future Islands) which might seem comically random, were it not for the fact that Wallen's been a champion of them for years. “When the idea of Sand in My Boots started becoming a reality, it was extremely important to me to build a festival of artists that I enjoy and listen to regularly,” Wallen told Billboard by email last week. We created a festival that was centered around my country culture and that just so happens to include a variety of sounds.” Whatever you want to call the Sand in My Boots vibe, all 40,000 tickets sold out in less than two hours last October. passes started at $549, while VIP packages ranged upwards of $5,000, and private luxury cabanas by the main stage were even steeper.) Sand in My Boots' two stages sit at either end of a pristine stretch of white sand beachfront along a body of water whose name no one can seem to agree on: while the festival's website offers the opportunity to “cool off in the Gulf of Mexico between sets,” several dozen t-shirts and trucker hats I spy on attendees throughout the weekend proudly proclaim “GULF OF AMERICA SINCE 2025.” Though I'm a fan of country music, both old-school and new, I also happen to be a Midwestern woman whose wardrobe is mostly black. This means that not only did I stick out like a sore thumb among the sea of body glitter, mesh cover-ups, star-spangled bikinis, ruffled mini-skirts, Hawaiian shirts, baseball jerseys, abundant camouflage, and yes, cowboy boots, I also cultivated the worst sunburn of my life within roughly 40 minutes of my arrival on day one. (“The sun reflects off the sand and makes it even worse!” explained a shirtless man in a mustache and a trucker hat that read “COUNTRY MUSIC TITTIES & BEER,” wincing at the two-tone paint job of my tan lines.) It's free!” (It's more of a photo opp than a legally binding matter, he explained when I asked further: “Hell, we don't even ask for their last names!”) All the festival grounds' offerings are loosely Morgan Wallen-themed, from the 7 Summers Sandbar to the Up Down Cap n' Gown (where you can collect a gift, should you have chosen Sand in My Boots over your graduation ceremony) to the booths hawking a zero sugar ice tea brand “crafted by Morgan Wallen,” to the “Field & Stream 1871 Club” pop-up, where you can subscribe to the magazine Wallen bought with Eric Church last year. Just after twilight on night one, a throng of girls in t-shirts printed “MORGY HARDY POSTY” were buzzing around the sandy margins of the main stage, where Hardy was preparing to perform. You either know the Mississippi native from his solo material, which often draws from rock and nu-metal despite its outlaw themes, or from the endless stream of hits he's co-written for other artists under his full name, Michael Hardy. Emerging onstage barefoot in camo shorts and a Death Row Records t-shirt, Hardy's set epitomized the omnivorous sound of country today: thrashed out with a full rock band, songs like “Truck Bed” and “Psycho” felt more like mosh-pit fodder. Thematically, there was less ambiguity: “I believe America is the greatest country in the world,” he bellowed as an introduction to 2019's “God's Country.” “And if you don't agree, go get a f–kin' beer!” But having seen his set extensively, I re-upped my cocktail (a vodka/lemonade/iced tea concoction named after the golfer John Daly) and settled in for the headlining set from Post Malone, who made his official jump to country with last year's F-1 Trillion, fulfilling the promise of a 2015 tweet: “WHEN I TURN 30 IM BECOMING A COUNTRY/FOLK SINGER.” A cynic might read the pivot as opportunistic, but so far, I've been charmed by Posty's country crossover: he's got the voice, demeanor and goodwill to fit seamlessly into the Nashville scene, where face tattoos are no longer frowned upon, thanks to Jelly Roll. I might add that Post didn't look half-bad in his boot-cut jeans and cut-off Cowboys jersey, strutting and shimmying down the runway through the crowd as he performed slightly rootsier versions of old hits (“White Iverson,” “Circles”) and twangier album cuts like “Wrong Ones” and “M-E-X-I-C-O.” “I came here tonight to play some sh-tty music and party a little bit while we do it!” he crowed, sitting down at one point to pull off his cowboy boots and pace the stage barefoot. Beside me in the sand along stage left, a sunburnt six-year-old girl mouthed every word of “Losers” from her perch on her dad's shoulders: “Last callers, last chancers, 9-to-5ers, truckers, dancers…” My day-old sunburn was feeling borderline psychedelic on Saturday afternoon, but the idea of putting a shirt over my bikini just seemed wrong, particularly on a perfectly balmy 80 degree day. So I slathered on some sunscreen, chugged some water (plus a mysterious blue cocktail billed as “Electric Lemonade”) and made my way past rows of booths selling “Cowboy Nachos,” “Boot-Scootin' Smoothies,” and discounted cans of Zyn (Sand in My Boots' preferred nicotine delivery unit) towards the Dangerous Stage, where all of the day's rappers were performing. I was initially unsure how songs like “Mmhmm” and “Levels” would go over with an early afternoon crowd rocking t-shirts that read “SLAMMIN' BUSCH & POUNDIN' TUSH” and “EVERYTHING I LOVE IS ILLEGAL, OFFENSIVE, OR BRUNETTE” (plus one fellow who'd fashioned the box of a Twisted Tea 12-pack into a hat). But far more people than I expected rapped along to every word, not to mention lost their minds as X stripped off his shirt to the sounds of “All The Way (Don't Let Me Down Easy),” his collab with Bailey Zimmerman that debuted at No. “Ooohh, I wanna see Three 6 Mafia!” shrieked a woman in stars-and-stripes booty shorts and a MAGA trucker hat to her husband, who was costumed in Hulk Hogan wrestling attire. It is almost unthinkable the extent to which the Memphis rap group have parlayed their hellish beats and eldritch lyrics into a wildly influential 35-year career, which has brought 48-year-old DJ Paul and 50-year-old Juicy J here to incite a beachfront riot. !” coaxed Juicy J to the stabs of 1997's “Hit A Mothaf-cka.” “I ain't never seen a mosh pit in the sand before,” noted DJ Paul above the fray, beginning a chant: “When I say ‘WEAK ASS,' y'all say ‘BITCH! DUI last night, straight from jail?” he continued with a grin. (“SAVE A HORSE, RIDE RILEY GREEN” read one passing tank top.) The GCB listens to country and a little bit of rap, wears a thin gold chain and often a mustache, possibly played minor league baseball; but his defining feature is the half-mullet my friend described as “that salad in the back.” (I tried to keep a tally of the festival's GCB count, but the task was too exhaustive, and I quit after an hour.) Soon Green is joined by Ella Langley—another Alabama local who tore up the stage earlier that afternoon with nostalgic songs like “Weren't for the Wind” and “Better Be Tough”—for their pair of duets, “You Look Like You Love Me” and “Don't Mind If I Do.” But I had an appointment with “Super VIP” catering that I was not going to miss. Saturday night, the dinner buffet included a dozen salads, charcuterie, beef short ribs, porchetta, blackened cod and a tower of crab legs piled higher than me—and that's before you hit the oyster bar. “Life on the Redneck Riviera ain't too bad,” I thought, washing down another oyster with a tequila soda. I'd answered my own question as to whether the crowd would be too young to appreciate the evening's headliner, Brooks & Dunn—what did kids these days know about “Boot Scootin' Boogie”? But Sand in My Boots' crowd skewed a bit older than your average music festival, and though a few youngsters streamed towards the exit as the Nashville duo (formed in 1988) took the stage, most of the crowd knew every word to 20-something-year-old songs like “Ain't Nothing ‘bout You” and “Red Dirt Road.” On the shuttle back to my hotel (there's no parking on the premises, but a steady stream of buses ran from the grounds all day), a pair of sun-dazed women arrive at an inspired idea: “Girl, should we get Waffle House?” “Ohhhh, f–k me up!” “You guys like country music in Canada?” I asked them, to which they replied, “Oh, yah!” After another absurdly lavish dinner (peel-and-eat shrimp, crab legs, oysters, Lyonnaise salad, chicken piccata) I post up at the main stage, where 25-year-old Bailey Zimmerman is bouncing around in jean shorts before a band whose members all looked vaguely like Skrillex, reminding the crowd: “God is good all the time!” Until 2019, the Southern Illinois native had never sung outside of drunk karaoke; he worked on a gas pipeline, then gained some fame on TikTok for his videos tricking out his GMC truck. Now, between hits like “Fall in Love” and “Religiously,” he coaxed the crowd to scream “I love you!” to his mom backstage. But like most everybody else, I'm here for Morgan Wallen, whose set tonight will close the festival. So far he had refrained from popping out for duets with collaborators on the lineup (Post Malone, Hardy, Ernest), and I was curious how much his setlist would reflect the brand-new album, whose mood was decidedly more introspective and subdued than previous blockbusters like Dangerous and One Thing at a Time. Then the lights went down, the beach erupted with screams, and video showed Wallen in white shorts and a white long-sleeve, jogging out from backstage to the sounds of “Broadway Girls,” his 2022 collaboration with Lil Durk. As stage presence goes, I've certainly seen more dynamic performers; occasionally he'd pick up an acoustic guitar, more as a shield than anything. But his raspy Tennessee drawl sounded surprisingly great live, particularly on “Cover Me Up,” a Jason Isbell song he's been covering for years, and on the festival's namesake track, a ballad about a one-night stand on the beach: “Somethin' bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee/But all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots.” I didn't have boots to speak of, so all I brought back with me was a raging sunburn and a couple packs of Zyn.

Producers include Gardner, Simpson, Harrison Rothman, Scott Foley and Bradley Sloan. “I wrote Slay about that moment in adolescence where you realize your friends know how to hurt you better than anyone else,” Simpson told Deadline. “Slay lives right there— but with sick music, jokes and stabbings.” Said Gardner: “I think horror, at its best, reveals what we can't say out loud to each other. This movie let me explore that, not with cruelty but with character— through girls trying to be women and boys trying not to be afraid. And it's always fun for me when fake blood is involved.” Previously seen in the films Dear Evan Hansen and The Craft: Legacy, as well as FX's Pose, Luna is repped by Park Noack Agency. Just recently signing on to star in the coming-of-age dramedy Adult Children, Cash's other upcoming projects include Rachel Israel's comedy The Floaters, Michael Russell Gunn's Cold War drama Reykjavik, and Prime Video's Vought Rising, where she reprises her role as Stormfront from hit comic book series The Boys. Best known for starring on FX's You're the Worst, she's also recently been seen starring in Max's The Franchise and Fox's Welcome to Flatch. She is repped by UTA, Industry Entertainment and Paul Hastings. Currently, Simpson can be seen reprising his role in the USS Callister sequel episode of Black Mirror for Netflix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>El Salvador's National Civil Police have arrested Ruth Eleonora López, a renowned human rights and anti-corruption attorney who has become one of the nation's most prominent critics of President Nayib Bukele's regime. “We also urge U.S. policymakers and the diplomatic community at large to urge President Bukele to cease all attacks against human rights defenders,” the group wrote. Bullock says police told López' “that they had a complaint about her car having been in an accident, and that they wanted to verify the owner and things like that, and then Ruth needed to come out.” Police “tricked” her into coming out of the house, Bullock says, “and then once she was there they took out a pretty simple order from the attorney general to arrest her.” Lopez, who was in pajama shorts, then requested to be allowed to change. “She asked if she could put her pants on at least, and they wouldn't let her go back into the house and forced her to put pants on on the street in front of all of her neighbors.” According to a video of the arrest obtained by El Diario de Hoy, López told officers to “have decency,” because one day the sort of impunity they enjoyed “will end.” Upon learning of the arrest, Cristosal dispatched “a lawyer, a criminal lawyer, to go and present himself as her representative, verify where she is and that she's in good condition,” Bullock says. It didn't look like anybody was really there, and the police were really hostile with him.” Bullock adds that the attorney waited a while, before returning to the precinct, announcing himself as López's representative and asking to see her, only to be told she was not there.

Bullock tells Rolling Stone that while Cristosal has become used to police presence at their events and harassment by law enforcement, López's arrest comes during an acute increase in the government's repressive attitude towards non profits and human rights organizations. “They haven't been able to control the narrative, and now they're cracking down,” Bullock says, noting that last week Bukele announced he would be implementing a hefty tax on foreign donations to nonprofits operating in El Salvador, many of whom are critical of the government's autocratic policies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Ruffalo (Poor Things) and Tucker Pillsbury (aka Role Model) are set to star alongside Natalie Portman in Good Sex, writer-director Lena Dunham's new romantic comedy for Netflix. The film centers on pragmatic couples' therapist Ally, who after spending a decade in a failed relationship, is turning 40 and reluctantly dipping her toe back into the New York dating scene. But she gets more than she bargained for when she meets two men — one in his twenties and one in his fifties — who show her there is no set formula for good sex. Tim Bevan and Michael Sledd are exec producing, along with Michaela Celella for MountainA. Good Sex is one of two rom-com projects Dunham has coming to Netflix, the other being series Too Much, starring Will Sharpe and Megan Stalter, which is slated to premiere on the service on July 10. Coming off of Bong Joon Ho's Mickey 17 and an Oscar nomination for his work in Yorgos Lanthimos' Poor Things, Ruffalo stars opposite Cooper Raiff and Lili Reinhart in Raff's independently produced TV series Hal & Harper, which premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival. His new HBO miniseries Task, a crime drama from Mare of Easttown‘s Brad Ingelsby, is set to premiere in September. He is repped by UTA, Lighthouse Management & Media, and attorney Keith A. Klevan. Pillsbury is a singer-songwriter better known by stage name Role Model, who has put out the albums Rx and Kansas Anymore. He is repped by Paradigm, Wasserman Music, and Myman Greenspan Fox.

He is, after all, a man of words — poor Oscar's a poet, and woe unto all those who know him. But good news for all those that take in “A Poet” (“Un Poeta”), director Simón Mesa Soto's immensely appealing and often caustic character study-turned-social-satire premiering out of Cannes' Un Certain Regard sidebar. Put together with impressive efficiency — the film only started shooting in January — this art-world send-up explores the many fears and frustrations the acclaimed director felt in the decade since making the 2014 short film Palme d'Or winner “Leidi,” channeling them into a darkly-funny burlesque that speaks of verse while playing like a Dan Clowes comic brought to manic life. Related Stories Tom Cruise Will ‘Never Stop' Making Movies: I'm Going to Be Acting ‘Into My 100s' How Low Can You Go: Even at Cannes, Longevity Means Living Lean | In Development Vol. He isn't much of a father to the high-schooler Daniela (Allison Correa), who obviously lives under a different roof; he isn't much of a caregiver to his own aging mama (Margarita Soto), who still supports her failure-to-launch with an allowance and a pair of car-keys; and he isn't even much of an author. And when he gets in the cups, what else can he shout about but “poeeeeesíííííaa,” stumbling along the back-allies of Medellín and slurring his words, but leaving no doubt as to the passion that animates him. Director Simón Mesa Soto shares in that fervor, mining his main character for pathos, not ridicule, framing Oscar as a true-blue romantic — a kind of holy fool susceptible to even the most obvious of scams but only because this staunch aesthete has devoted all of his attention to verse. And if Oscar's perhaps more guilelessly dogmatic about art-above-all, he's hardly alone in a country that puts writers like José Asunción Silva and Gabriel García Márquez on its currency. Problem is, Oscar doesn't have too many of those pesos. Recognizing that more prosaic reality — while looking to at least buy his way towards his daughter's good graces — our poet soon accepts a teaching gig at a local high-school. Any number of discrete films could build from that premise, and “A Poet” tries quite a few on for size, playing with elements from the inspirational teacher school and the late-coming-age redemption drama before setting into a more sardonic register once the teacher tries to make his student a star. The duo are both aesthetes in a world of opportunists, including but not limited to the 14-year-old's family, who can recognize a meal-ticket when they see one, and to Medellín's literary elite, who see the very same but for much greater sums. If the 39-year-old Soto — who works as a teacher in between films — sees in Oscar a version of his own path that didn't run through Cannes, the director pours just as much of his own experience into Yurlady — a promising talent from a background that lends itself to easy clichés. I wonder where Soto came up with that idea. Split into four chapters and filmed on grainy, 16mm stock that leaves a mask of schmutz around the corners of the frame, “A Poet” loops around questions of art and commerce in an endearingly loopy tone. The film's bawdy sense of humor plays off a non-professional star — himself a full-time teacher from a nearby school — that looks like he was drawn by Robert Crumb and acts the part just as well. While outcast valentines like Owen Kline's “Funny Pages” and acrid satires like Radu Jude's “Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn” might serve as stylistic and thematic comparisons, Simón Mesa Soto really owns his own voice, mixing high-art with bad taste to piece apart the mechanisms of a mess-up. Few leave unscathed as the handheld camera whip-pans and fast-zooms between cringe-comedy and genuine pathos and back again — especially once the hapless prof paves his own road to hell with his good intentions. Well, more like self-serving intentions; Oscar might only want to see his young mentee celebrated for her work, though at no point does Yurlady indicate a similar ambition. That we do really feel for Oscar when he inevitably screws himself up and out of a feel-good movie reflects Soto's tonal dexterity. “A Poet” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.

Meanwhile, “Anxiety” leads Radio Songs in just its eighth week on the chart. It wraps the fastest run to No. 1 since Post Malone's “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, led in its eighth frame last July.

Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” repeats at No. 3, following five nonconsecutive weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in January. Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is steady at No. 4 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart; it's second only to Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line's “Meant To Be,” which ruled for 50 weeks in 2017-18. 2, while Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club” falls 6-9, after peaking at No. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

While well wishes, speculation, and clamor for more details abound, some of the MAGA right's most prominent voices are chomping at the bit to turn Biden's diagnoses into a political side show. “What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup?? His post on Sunday was met with a wave of comments explaining to him that Jill Biden is not a medical doctor. “So for the confused libs out there, I'm well aware that Jill Biden is a fake doctor, not a real one.” Johnson — who is not a doctor — claimed that “advanced prostate cancer takes +10 years to develop to the stage where Biden's diagnosis is,” and that “simple blood test or prostate exam will give you near 100% accurate results.” Right-wing commentator Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire called for an investigation. “We need congress to actually do something finally,” he wrote on X. Pull every Biden staffer and official into a hearing. End Wokeness, a prominent MAGA X account with 3.6 million followers, joined Trump Jr. in mocking the diagnosis: “‘We just found stage 4 cancer' is the new ‘he just has a stutter. It wasn't just MAGA influencers who responded with speculation and conspiracy theory. “I blame the people around him,” Vance said, wondering: “Why didn't the American people have a better sense of his health picture?” The book — Original Sin, by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson — paints a damning picture of Biden's mental decline and the measures his team took to cover it up. Barack Obama Sends Well Wishes to Joe Biden After Cancer Diagnosis Biden's Decline Was ‘Much Worse Behind the Scenes,' Per New Book Biden Aides Discussed Putting Him in a Wheelchair for Potential Second Term: Book MAGA commentators are now alleging the cancer diagnosis was also kept under wraps, but even Fox News acknowledged that the sudden detection of late stage and aggressive cancers was common even in patients who had regular screenings. Dr. Nicole Saphier, a contributor at the network, told the hosts of America's Newsroom that “it is not uncommon” that patients present with metastatic cancer even when we're screening for that, and that “some prostate cancers aren't associated with a rise in [Prostate-specific antigen levels] and he “could have had a false negative.” Trump Preps for Putin Call With Another Meltdown Over Bruce Springsteen The Who Part Ways With Drummer Zak Starkey (Again) Ahead of Farewell Tour Sean Combs Trial: Cassie Testifies, Baby Oil, Imprisoned Male Escorts That Doc on Shia LaBeouf's Acting School Is Even Crazier Than You've Heard Still, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist Biden put on his Covid-19 advisory board, told MSNBC that Biden has likely had the cancer “for many years” and that he's “surprised” it wasn't diagnosed earlier. “I looked back at the records and there's no evidence that when he got his health status and the medical records were released, that he had a prostate specific antigen,” Emanuel said. President Donald Trump, at least, was able to restrain himself. “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis,” he wrote on Truth Social.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diiv are back with a new song, “Return of Youth.” The track's accompanying music video was filmed after the fires in Altadena, California, that destroyed hundreds of businesses and homes, including one belonging to Diiv frontman Zachary Cole Smith. Smith, his pregnant wife, and two-year-old son safely evacuated their Altadena house before it was lost in January's deadly wildfires, but Smith's friend launched a GoFundMe on the artist's behalf to help recoup the loss of their house, musical instruments, car, and more belongings. With all that's happened since then, including what's captured in this new video, Smith shared a long statement tied to “Return of Youth”: diiv has a new song out today, “return of youth”. ‘frog' was an album that focused our gaze outward at the world around us. the writing period for this album was part of a beautiful time in my life, as we prepared and waited for our first child to be born. that beauty was cut with a profound existential dilemma: how can we bring a child into this world? “return of youth” was written before our son was born, a projection, zooming in until the larger existential dilemmas were out of frame. where “fender on the freeway” found peace in the patterns of a gigantic macro, this one finds it in a mundane and simple micro. i imagined seeing myself through the eyes of my child, a rebirth of sorts, laced with fear and insecurity, discovering beauty and serenity together in the simplest places. we had been preparing for the birth of our second son. we were living in the beautiful world at home that i had imagined in this song, and at once that world was gone. when we re-approached this song to finally release it, i couldn't help but hear the song differently in the aftermath. is anyone actually prepared to be a parent? how CAN you bring a child into this world? i found again the big questions were irrelevant. anyway, make of the song and the video whatever you want, it's just a snapshot, albeit a more personal one this time. “Return of Youth” arrives almost one year to the day since Diiv released Frog in Boiling Water. They recently shared a remix of the Frog in Boiling Water song “Everyone Out” by Mount Kimbie, too. The shoegaze band will head out on a European tour this summer in support of the LP, with shows in Los Angeles and Australia also slated to take place beforehand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president called for an "investigation" into their endorsements of Kamala Harris in 2024. President Donald Trump has accused Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen and more stars of participating in an “illegal election scam” run by Kamala Harris‘ campaign during the 2024 election, with the billionaire calling for a “major investigation” into their allegedly “corrupt” endorsements of the former VP. In two Truth Social posts from the early hours of Monday (May 19), Trump first accused the Boss — whom the POTUS also called “highly overrated” and “dumb as a rock” just a few days prior — of illegally accepting an undisclosed payment to appear at one of Harris' rallies last year before lumping the “Texas Hold ‘Em” singer, as well as Oprah Winfrey and U2's Bono, into the alleged scheme. “ISN'T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? “I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter. Candidates aren't allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment. In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds.” In a follow-up post about seven hours later, Trump doubled down on his claims. “Remember, the Democrats and Kamala illegally paid her millions of Dollars for doing nothing other than giving Kamala a full throated ENDORSEMENT. THIS IS AN ILLEGAL ELECTION SCAM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL! BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, OPRAH, BONO AND, PERHAPS, MANY OTHERS, HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO!! When that 11-million figure first surfaced last year and made the rounds on social media, fact check organizations found no evidence to support the claim. Trump called the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer a “pushy, obnoxious JERK” who “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT” on Friday (May 16). That same day, Trump also wrote that Taylor Swift is “no longer ‘HOT'” following her September endorsement of Harris and his subsequent “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” post. The E Street band leader and Destiny's Child alum were just two of many stars who backed Harris during the 2024 election, with Megan Thee Stallion, Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Cardi B, Eminem and more throwing their support behind the former prosecutor's campaign. Finance records do not show that any of them were paid for their endorsements — something Harris would have needed to disclose if that were the case — and Harris' campaign has denied in the past that it ever paid artists to perform at events. “We have never paid any artist and performer,” senior spokesperson Adrienne Elrod stated to Deadline when rumors to the contrary first surfaced last year. “We have never paid a fee to that person.” Beyoncé's camp has also denied that she accepted payment for her endorsement of Harris, as has the 35-time Grammy winner's mother, Tina Knowles. “The lie is that Beyonce was paid 10 million dollars to speak at a rally in Houston for Vice President Kamala Harris,” Knowles wrote on Instagram in November. “When In Fact : Beyonce did not receive a penny for speaking at a Presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harrris's Rally in Houston. They are not only lying and disrespecting Beyonce's name but they are trying to further discredit the power of our vice president! There is record of Harris paying Bey's production company, Parkwood Production Media LLC, $165,000 after the Texas event; that payment would be in accordance with federal law, which prohibits corporations from giving directly to a candidate's campaign and mandates that campaigns reimburse the costs of large event production, according to The Hill.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dawn Richard testified she “frequently” saw Sean Combs beat his longtime ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, while on the stand for her second day of testimony at Combs' sex trafficking trial. “We didn't even know where it came from,” Richard said. Richard entered Combs' orbit as a breakout talent from his MTV reality series Making the Band. She later joined the Bad Boy girl group Danity Kane, and was also part of the R&B trio Diddy-Dirty Money with Combs and Kalenna Harper. Richard said Combs “punched [Ventura] in the face” during an argument, leaving Ventura's face so swollen she had to wear sunglasses and make-up to hide the injury. The jury was then shown a photo of Ventura, Richard, and Harper in public, with all three women wearing sunglasses. Another alleged attack occurred at a restaurant where several record label personnel were also present. But when Combs heard about these conversations, Richard continued, the mogul told her to stop “or else we would pay for it.” Richard added: “I made a decision that it would be best for the safety of myself to not interfere, because I don't think that she was really ready to do anything.” During her testimony last week, Richard alleged that she saw Combs attack Ventura with the same skillet Ventura was using to cook him eggs. “She went into the fetal position … I was scared for her.” They mentioned two interviews Richard gave to prosecutors, one in which Richard claimed Combs struck Ventura with the pan, and another in which she said Combs threw the eggs at Ventura.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neil Druckmann breaks down that devastating porch scene in season two's sixth episode. Starting with a look at Joel's abused childhood, a series of sequences followed, set during Ellie's birthdays — since the duo settled in Jackson — and showing what went down on the porch the night before Joel's murder. Alexander Skarsgard Kisses Pedro Pascal on Cheek During Ravenous Standing Ovation for 'Pillion' Inside The Hollywood Reporter's Star-Studded 'Die, My Love' Cannes Premiere Party With Jennifer Lawrence, Robert Pattinson and Surprise Guests This might be one of those rare episodes of TV where people cry repeatedly through the hour, not just in one key moment. And it was such a joy to explore all those nuances along the way. But specifically, when I was working on this episode, I had two people on the front of my mind, which were Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, who originally played these characters in the game. I just re-watched the game version of scene (watch it below). For this, I was particularly caught by Ellie asking Joel those questions that had been on her mind for so long, and the choice to just have Joel just be silent and nod. In the game, Ellie asked those questions at a different point. So Ellie has to understand what Joel has done, get angry at him, and then move towards forgiveness — all within one scene. Specifically, “This is your last conversation with each other. You've been withholding all this stuff, all these questions, so hold nothing back.” If you watch Bella's Ellie this season, she wears more of a mask than Ashley's Ellie in the game. And now Joel knows that she knows, and the last gift he can give her is to give her the truth. And since they were “yes or no” questions, it felt like he wouldn't even need to say it, he could just nod or shake his head. One thing that fascinates to me about this season is the structure, which is obviously taken from the game, as well, where you lose Joel, and then have these flashbacks and each one changes how you view their relationship and his death, though they're much more spaced out. Yeah, let me talk to you about our thought process. You're right that in the game, these scenes are spaced out, sometimes hours apart. If we spaced out these scenes and planted them throughout the season, I believe they wouldn't land as powerfully because they're short moments and work better when they're next to each other and you can just see the comparison — it's like their relationship is slowly deteriorating. If we put one in an episode, and then you have to wait a week to see the next, you have to remember what the last one was, and then wait another week again. It felt appropriate to land after Ellie has just committed the darkest, most violent act she's ever committed in her life — torturing an unarmed woman to try to get information about where Joel's killer is hiding. There's a contrast of “look how far this character has come.” They're almost unrecognizable in that scene. I did wonder if there was a part of you that would have been tempted to hold the porch moment to the series finale, and also wondered if the pragmatic issue of not having Pascal signed beyond season two might have factored into that. Craig brought this up to me and I bought into it immediately: He [pointed out] that when you buy the game, you have the entire story. You could play for the whole thing in two days. We have to take into account that the story is being delivered week by week, season by season, with more story coming potentially years later. There would be a high risk of the porch scene not landing if he held onto it. When I was looking at the porch scene, one of the comments read: “Ellie's vengeance wasn't just about killing the people who took Joel from her, but about taking revenge on them for taking away her chance at forgiving him.” Is that true, do you think? Ellie's so angry, and she means it when she says, “I don't know if I could ever forgive you for that, but I would like to try.” She wanted to move towards that forgiveness, because I think she understood that — as much as Joel hurt her — his motivation was unconditional love, and she shares that unconditional love for him. Oddly enough, the simplistic reaction I had to watching the scene was relief — “Oh, they weren't in quite as bad of a place, relationship wise, when he died as we thought.” There is something oddly reassuring about that. It's bittersweet because he was finally honest with her and they confessed their love to each other on in that scene, but they never moved back to when we saw them at their happiest at that Space Museum. And by the way, that quality of Ellie came from Ashley Johnson. She loved the idea of wanting to be an astronaut. So I wrote that to make Ellie more like her and now it has remained all the way through for  another actor to reinterpret it. Ellie wants something that she could never have in this world, and Joel kind of gives it to her. Joel is so amazing in this episode as the World's Greatest Apocalypse Dad that it also caused me to feel some annoyance at Ellie — like, “How can you not appreciate this man more than you do?” Though I also understand that she's at an age where you naturally pull away from your parents and if there aren't things to be correctly mad about, you'll find reasons anyway. There are several big lies my parents have told to me that only now, in my forties, I'm able to forgive and move past because I see their motivations were in the right place. And now, as a dad myself, I had this feeling of like, “I know how to raise my kids better than my parents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sony Pictures Television has greenlit a spinoff of the crime procedural titled SWAT Exiles. Like the recently ended CBS series, Exiles will star Shemar Moore, reprising his role as Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson as he works with a team of young recruits. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II Signs First-Look Deal With Sony Pictures TV “We are thrilled to usher this beloved franchise into a new era with SWAT Exiles,” said Sony Pictures TV chairman Keith Le Goy said in a statement. “We believe in championing powerful storytelling and in our teams' exceptional ability to create and deliver these stories to audiences around the world. This belief is embedded in our DNA and central to every decision we make.” Ning will executive produce SWAT Exiles with SWAT EPs Shemar Moore, Neal H. Moritz and Pavun Shetty of Original Film, and James Scura. Sony has ordered 10 episodes of Exiles, with development going on now. “My eight seasons on SWAT have been epic and memorable. “I am excited for this next generation and iteration of SWAT with Sony. [Sony Pictures TV Studios president] Katherine Pope, Neal H. Moritz, Jason Ning and I will keep the franchise, thrill ride action, heartfelt drama and storytelling of SWAT alive.” “We're grateful to our incredible partners Neal H. Moritz, Pavun Shetty, Jason Ning and Shemar Moore for embarking on this journey with us. The network initially canceled the series after its sixth season in 2023, then reversed course and renewed SWAT for what was billed as a seventh and final season. CBS then changed its mind again and ordered an eighth season before canceling the show for a second time in March. Here is Sony's description of SWAT Exiles: “After a high-profile mission goes sideways, Daniel ‘Hondo' Harrelson is pulled out of forced retirement to lead a last-chance, experimental SWAT unit made up of untested, unpredictable young recruits. After CBS announced SWAT's cancellation in March, Moore said in an Instagram video that he wasn't ready to say goodbye to the show — and called out potential new homes for the series: “Hey, Netflix, how you doing?” Moore said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actress says her biological dad is Italian singer Nelson Sardelli, not Mickey Hargitay — something she discovered when she was in her 20s. Mariska Hargitay has revealed a long-held family secret: the truth about her biological father. The actress, whose mother was Jayne Mansfield, had believed for years that her father was Mickey Hargitay, the Hungarian bodybuilding champion who became an actor. When Mariska was only 3, she and her mother were involved in a tragic car accident that killed Mansfield instantly. Mickey raised their three children after Mansfield died. He loved me so much, and I knew it,” she told Vanity Fair. During a brief time in 1963-64, Mansfield filed for divorce from Mickey and began dating Italian entertainer Nelson Sardelli. However, Mickey and Mansfield reconciled months before Mariska's birth. “I went full Olivia Benson on him,” she said of her reaction. Mariska ultimately became close with Sardelli and his daughters. She also realized that her mom went back to Mickey because she felt that being with him would be better for her daughter. “I'm Mickey Hargitay's daughter — that is not a lie.” The Law & Order: SVU star also opens up about this revelation in her new documentary My Mom Jayne, which premiered Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival and debuts June 27 on HBO/HBO Max.
