                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arnold Schwarzenegger, on top of a giant dinosaur, massive gun in hand, shooting Nazis. It was footage that launched a thousand blog posts across the internet. Leaked footage, in fact, from a movie called Kung Fury 2 which, despite being filmed in 2019 and also featuring Michael Fassbender as a cocky, over-the-top supercop, has never been released. In a new interview with Variety, Kung Fury 2 star, writer, and director David Sandberg details multiple lawsuits that continue to plague the film, now over five years later. In 2019, Creasun signed on to help finance two-thirds of Kung Fury 2, including about $10 million in visual effects work from the company Double Negative. Production went fine, but then something changed. “Once we started getting to VFX, things started to really slow down, and things became a bit weird,” Sandberg said. “And then it turned out that our Chinese financier had basically stopped all payments.” So Creasun was sued again, but it didn't stop there. Creasun filed countersuits accusing producers of stealing money from the production. Sandberg says that isn't true, and Variety reports some of the other producers on the film tried to buy Creasun out. “They just kind of stonewalled every single attempt to solve the issue,” he said. And there are so many people who have poured their hearts into this, and I feel super terrible for them.” And so the slow legal process continues, ensuring that despite principal photography being complete, as well as an edit of the movie, between $5 and $10 million of visual effects remain unfinished. In fact, the footage that leaked earlier this month had temporary effects, which were never supposed to be seen by the public. “But I haven't given up on it. One day, for sure, it will get released. But we just have to power through it. We had such a wonderful experience on set and everyone felt the love behind it. Read more from Sandberg, including some teases of the movie he's been making as the Kung Fury 2 legal battle continues to play out, over at Variety.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Genetic testing company 23andMe isn't going away, despite declaring bankruptcy. The company and nearly all of its assets, including its biobank of customer genetic samples, have been purchased by American biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for a cool $256 million, the highest bid submitted in the once-hot startup's bankruptcy auction. The purchase, announced Monday, will place 23andMe's brand as well as its Personal Genome Service (PGS), Total Health, and Research Services under the control of New York-based Regeneron. It'll also continue to operate the company's consumer-facing genome services without interruption, meaning you can still buy those DNA-testing kits off the shelves of big-box retailers to learn about your family history and health. There was legitimate concern that the company's biobank could have been scooped up by unscrupulous actors. Your mileage may vary on just how much you trust Regeneron, a company that sequences exomes to find novel drug targets, with consumer data, but it's (probably) better than having 23andMe land in the hands of some private equity ghouls. The company went public in 2021 and was at one point valued at $6 billion before a series of high-profile failures dragged its value almost to $0. It tried to launch a subscription service with personalized health reports and lifestyle advice but failed to hit even half of its goal for sign-ups, per the Wall Street Journal. In 2023, the company experienced a breach that it initially said affected about 14,000 people. The real figure turned out to be closer to 6.9 million, who had their names, birth years, relationship labels, family names, and locations exposed. People who opted into the DNA Relatives feature, which allows people to identify and connect with genetic relatives, had their Family Tree profiles accessed. The situation did serious damage to the company's reputation, which isn't great when your business is reliant on people trusting you with their most personal data Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. There's only so much you can learn from a consumer DNA test, and most people simply don't need one. “Our foundation was the trust and respect of our customers, and they were always the guiding light on how we made decisions,” the company's former CEO said after years of eroding public trust. New research suggests humans and labradors might be predisposed to gaining weight for similar reasons. $948 million has been spent so far as lawyers try to unravel the scheme.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The courts have decided against DOGE and the US government in their legal battle to take full control of the United States Institute of Peace, including a headquarters building with an estimated value of $500 million. In a memorandum opinion, US district court judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of the former institute board and staff who had sued to be reinstalled at the agency after DOGE affiliates forcibly removed them in March. She also gave a strong rebuke to the defendants in the case, who include the US DOGE Service, President Donald Trump, secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, and several other government representatives and agencies. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. That same day, according to court filings, DOGE representatives—accompanied by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation—tried to enter USIP headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the USIP detail a rapid escalation of attempts to access the agency's property. On Sunday, March 16, two FBI agents visited a senior USIP security employee at home, demanding information on how to get into the headquarters building. That same day, DOGE allegedly coordinated with Inter-Con, USIP's contract security firm, to enter the building; USIP officials found out and immediately suspended Inter-Con's contract. The following day, according to court documents, four Inter-Con employees showed up at USIP headquarters. When their badges didn't work at the front door, one of their colleagues showed up with a physical key and gained access. USIP personnel then called the DC Metropolitan Police, claiming unlawful entry. MPD officers eventually arrived—and helped DOGE and other Trump administration officials take control of the building. That Friday, March 21, six USIP staffers received termination notices. On Friday, March 28, “virtually all” of the remaining USIP employees were terminated as well. The next day, Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought signed off on the asset transfer—before the courts had a chance to rule on a motion from USIP attorneys to stop it. While USIP operates independently, it was established and funded by Congress. Lawyers for the fired USIP board and staff members have repeatedly argued that the agency “does not perform any executive functions,” which they claim exempts it from executive branch authority. On March 19, she denied the USIP's motion for a temporary restraining order that would have kept the original USIP board in place, saying it was “too difficult to determine” if USIP was likely to win the case on the merits, given its unique structure. The summary judgement order leaves no such room for interpretation. “The president's efforts here to take over an organization … contrary to statute established by Congress and by acts of force and threat using local and federal law enforcement officers,” Howell wrote, "represented a gross usurpation of power.” The defendants have 30 days to file a notice of appeal; George Foote, longtime outside counsel for USIP, says he expects them to. The plaintiffs have no idea where that money went.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you finish watching season two of Andor, the natural next move is to dive right into Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the movie that introduced Diego Luna's Cassian Andor to the galaxy far, far away. But he's not actually the lead character in the 2016 film—that distinction goes to Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso, daughter of reluctant Death Star architect Galen Erso. And while Andor leads right into Rogue One, and the two stories share many of the same characters, Andor creator Tony Gilroy made the call that Jyn wouldn't be among them. In fact, he never even considered that Jyn would show up in the Andor finale, according to a new interview with Entertainment Weekly. “I tried to sketch some versions along the way of what we would do,” Gilroy explained. “Episode 12 is very unique … we are not trying to hype anything in 12. Gilroy did briefly consider bringing more Rogue One characters in—Danny Mays' Tivic the informant, for instance, who's killed by Andor early in Rogue One, and maybe even Mads Mikkelsen's Galen Erso—before thinking better of it. “And it would've been lame to bring Jyn back as a cameo. That would've been really disrespectful in a way. I'd rather honor Rogue and keep it straight.” He's also well aware that Rogue One fans are now re-evaluating their view of Jyn and Cassian's relationship. “People who thought that was the love of his life are going to have to reorient their thinking,” Gilroy joked.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is expected to sign the Take It Down Act today, a bipartisan law that enacts stricter penalties for distributing nonconsensual explicit images, including deepfakes and revenge porn. Whoever publishes the photos or videos can face criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and restitution. Many states have already banned sexually explicit deepfakes and revenge porn, but this will be the first time federal regulators step in to impose restrictions on internet companies. First Lady Melania Trump lobbied for the bill, which was sponsored by Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Free speech advocates and digital rights groups have raised concerns, saying the law is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, like legal pornography, as well as government critics.

Asus has brought the joy of wood grain to its graphics card lineup. The PC and components giant has just taken the wraps off its first RTX 50 graphics cards to swell the ranks of the ProArt family, and they all feature “a classy brown wood grain design.” Moreover, this first quartet of RTX 50 ProArt cards is the firm's “first to offer USB Type-C support for enhanced versatility for creative workflows.” Two of the models also sport an M.2 slot, which will please some users, as long as Asus's price premium isn't too ambitious. We'd probably rank the non-overclocked M.2 slot packing card next, followed by the ProArt GeForce RTX 5080 OC, and then the ‘vanilla' but still wood effect finished and USB Type-C port packing model. Asus has two new ProArt cards, which will offer ‘reference' specs, and two with an overclock applied to the GPU. Like you've installed a log in your GPU slot. Asus says the cooler features a MaxContact design with vapor chamber, and there's a phase-change GPU pad between the cooler and the GPU to help keep this card cool, calm, and collected. Moving along to the other special features here, all four new ProArt RTX 5080 models also feature USB Type-C support, which is great for a growing number of monitors and devices. If you choose one of the models with an M.2 slot, you can benefit from up to PCIe Gen5 speeds. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Whether it comes in the form of actual wood construction or parts, wood veneers, or even just wood-effect plastics – the look and feel can bring back fond memories of old tech and gadgetry like TV, Hi-Fi, and even games console systems. With Asus introducing these ProArt designs, and knowing there are already numerous wood-finish cases around, the dreams of an all-wood finished PC are getting nearer. Wood finish keyboards and mice have been a thing for quite some time, and we also know there are wood finish CPU air coolers from DeepCool at Computex. A wood completist might still long for wood-finish motherboards, RAM, and storage. Finally, a wood-bezel monitor shouldn't be a big challenge to DIY-frame, if no firm steps forward with some lignin-lover options. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pharmaceutical maker Regeneron announced Monday it will buy genetic testing company 23andMe for $256 million following a bankruptcy auction. Regeneron said it will acquire 23andMe's genomics service and its bank of 15 million customers' personal and genetic data as part of the deal. 23andMe's founder and chief executive Anne Wojcicki resigned following the company's collapse. After its filing, a federal bankruptcy court was appointed to oversee the sale of 23andMe's assets, sparking concerns that the stores of customer data could be sold to adversarial nations or unethical buyers. Regeneron said in its statement that as the named buyer in the bankruptcy auction, it “intends to ensure compliance” with 23andMe's privacy policies and laws regarding customer data. The bankruptcy court is set to consider Regeneron's acquisition on June 17.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says that there is no evidence of AI chip diversion to countries where the sale of said chips is prohibited, in response to questions at Computex 2025. Huang told Bloomberg that there is no evidence of diversions when it comes to its Grace Blackwell chips. “Governments understand that diversion is not allowed, and there's no evidence of any AI chip diversion — recognize our data center GPUs are massive; these are massive systems,” Huang said during the surprise questioning. “The Grace Blackwell system is nearly two tons, and so you're not going to be shipping — you're not going to be putting that in your pocket or your backpack anytime soon. We've even seen one businessman showing off his smuggled H200 GPUs on X. Even as late as March 2025, there have been reports of Chinese entities using corporations registered in neighboring countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan to order these advanced chips and then reroute them to China. Singapore has already started cracking down on this practice, and the U.S. has also asked Malaysian authorities to keep an eye on this black market and shut it down. However, Malaysian imports of advanced GPUs still surged by over 3,400% in early this year, raising alarm bells. Huang also said that these servers are massive, weighing several tons, so tracking them shouldn't be difficult. But the company has also said that these AI chips are impossible to find after they're sold. Furthermore, weight and size are no issues when it comes to smuggling. After all, if stolen cars and SUVs can be smuggled across borders, then GPU servers are fair game as well, especially with the amount of money involved.

Intel has announced its Arc Pro B-series of graphics cards at Computex 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan, with a heavy focus on AI workstation inference performance boosted by segment-leading amounts of VRAM. The Intel Arc Pro B50, a compact card that's designed for graphics workstations, has 16GB of VRAM and will retail for $299, while the larger Intel Arc Pro B60 for AI inference workstations slots in with a copious 24GB of VRAM. While the B60 is designed for powerful 'Project Battlematrix' AI workstations sold as full systems ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, it will carry a roughly $500 per-unit price tag. That includes partners like Maxsun, which has developed a dual-GPU card based on the B60 GPU. Other partners include ASRock, Sparkle, GUNNR, Senao, Lanner, and Onix. Both the B50 and B60 GPUs are now being sampled to Intel partners, as evidenced by a robust display of partner cards and full systems on display, and will arrive on the market in the third quarter of 2025. The Intel Arc Pro B50 has a compact dual-slot design for slim and small-form-factor graphics workstations. The GPU wields 16 Xe cores and 128 XMX engines that deliver up to 170 peak TOPS, all fed by 16GB of VRAM that delivers 224 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The card also sports a PCIe 5.0 x8 interface, which Intel credits with speeding transfers from system memory, ultimately delivering 10 to 20% more performance in some scenarios. In graphics workloads, Intel claims up to a 3.4X advantage over its previous-gen A50, and solid gains across the board against the RTX A1000. It sports similar advantages in a spate of AI inference benchmarks. The card delivers 197 peak TOPS and fits into a 120 to 200W TBP envelope. This card also comes with a PCIe 5.0 x8 interface. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Intel supports multiple B60 GPUs on a single board, as evidenced by Maxsun's GPU,  with software support in Linux for splitting workloads across both GPUs (each GPU interfaces with the host on its own bifurcated PCIe 5.0 x8 connection). Intel also highlighted the advantages of higher memory capacity in model size, context, and concurrency scaling. The Intel Arc Pro B60 will primarily come in pre-built inference workstations ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, dubbed Project Battlematrix. Project Battlematrix workstations, powered by Xeon processors, will come with up to eight GPUs, 192GB of total VRAM, and support up to 70B+ parameter models. Intel is working to deliver a validated full-stack containerized Linux solution that includes everything needed to deploy a system, including drivers, libraries, tools, and frameworks, that's all performance optimized, allowing customers to hit the ground running with a simple install process. Intel will roll out the new containers in phases as its initiative matures. Intel also shared a roadmap of the coming major milestones. Intel's partners had multiple Project Battlematrix systems up and running live workloads in the showroom, highlighting that development is already well underway. Other demos included running and finding bugs in code, an open enterprise platform for building RAGs quickly, and a RAG orchestration demo, among others.

Intel demoed working Panther Lake Core Ultra 300 silicon for laptops, its first chips based on its crucial 18A process node, here at Computex 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan. Unlike the first public demoes at CES 2025 that merely showed the chips powered on, Intel put Panther Lake its paces in real-time rendering and AI applications, showing that the silicon is healthy and on-track for retail availability in early 2026. Intel also shared more information about its performance and power consumtpion expectations for the new chips. These chips are thought to come with Cougar Cove P-cores and Darkmont E-cores (you can see the unconfirmed leaked specifications of some of the chip models here). These iGPUs are thought to be based on the Xe3 architecture. Intel ran its Panther Lake benchmarks on two Reference Validation Platforms (RVP) that you can see in the above album. These platforms are used to validate the design and emulate real-world conditions. Intel demoed one system running the newly-resurrected Clippy as a large language model to demonstrate that the chips are running AI workloads. Intel didn't share performance metrics from the benchmark. Intel also demoed a system running Da Vinci to edit and manipulate video using local AI processing to process the video, enabling fast manipulation of the video clip, such as changing backgrounds, clothing colors, and adding flying text to the clip. Intel also displayed a running developer kit that 300+ developers with ISVs are using to enable software support for the coming chips. Intel demoed the system being used for image editing with auto-coloring and upscaling features, powered, of course, by AI. Intel also had a host of laptops on display from its OEM partners.

Does "simulation" unequivocally follow "computational"?


reply



As a sniff test: if a simulation is good enough, then from inside it you can't determine real or simulated. If not, then maybe 'glitches' could be detected, or a kind of jailbreak is possible.But even if: why would the fundamental mechanics of our universe not look/behave like a computation? And "behaves like" != "is".
