                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Juventus are expecting to regain the services of four players who will return from their respective loan spells to take part in the FIFA Club World Cup. But on the back of an exhausting campaign plagued by a plethora of injuries, the club will be desperate for additional depth. While an early transfer window will allow the clubs the opportunity to sign new players, it's hard to imagine Juventus pulling off too many operations in the first ten days of June. The second name on the list is Daniele Rugani who is on a dry loan at Ajax. The Turin-based newspaper also mentions Tiago Djalo and Facundo Gonzalez, two defenders who couldn't carve out starting roles at Porto and Feyenoord, respectively. In addition to these four returnees, the source expects Tudor to bolster his World Cup squad by adding Juventus Next Gen players. Riccardo Turicchia, Javier Gil, Nicolò Cudrig, Luca Amaradio and Alessandro Pietrelli are the favourites to earn call-ups. Notify me of new posts by email. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Concacaf released the preliminary rosters for each nation participating in this summer's Gold Cup. Teams were allowed to list up to 60 players who would become eligible for the final 26-man squads, which must be finalized by no later than June 4. Here are the notables regarding who could participate in this summer's regional championship — as well as a few who are already deemed unavailable. FIFA has given priority to clubs over countries for those participating in the Club World Cup. Weston McKennie and Tim Weah retained first-choice status as the U.S. transitioned from Gregg Berhalter to Pochettino, but both are omitted given Juventus' participation in the CWC. Borussia Dortmund's involvement also rules out Giovanni Reyna, although it's unclear if the 22-year-old midfielder will still be part of the German club's plans come this summer. The Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami guarantee that MLS will have at least two participating clubs. This also keeps a handful of regular members of the USMNT pool unavailable, including a few 2022 World Cup veterans (Jordan Morris, Cristian Roldan and Jesus Ferreira) as well as a few more recent additions (Benjamin Cremaschi, Drake Callender and Jackson Ragen). Tillman (the elder brother of PSV star Malik Tillman) is already a longshot with so many central midfielders in contention, but Zendejas' club form may tempt Pochettino and his backroom as they survey options in attack. Some, like striker and central midfield, offer numerous players who could start at the international level. In goal, Matt Turner may yet remain first-choice despite seldom featuring on a loan spell with FA Cup-winning Crystal Palace. Zack Steffen, Patrick Schulte, Matt Freese and Chris Brady all start regularly for their MLS clubs. Steffen and Schulte issued mixed performances in their recent international starts, while Freese's cross-claiming is below league average for goalkeepers and Brady is often overworked by a porous Chicago Fire defense. If Pochettino wants to kick the tires on an untested up-and-comer, he could select Diego Kochen. The 21-year-old joined Chelsea in 2022 and his commitment to the USMNT over Poland came to great fanfare, but he struggled during a loan spell with League One side Barnsley this season and must rebuild his stock. Pochettino selected just nine center backs, a relatively small number considering the bloated nature of this longlist. Many have already been vetted at this level, including all five regulars in Qatar: Tim Ream, Mark McKenzie, Chris Richards, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Walker Zimmerman — though it's worth noting that Zimmerman hasn't played for Nashville SC since suffering a concussion on April 5. Blackmon and Campbell are two of several players in MLS who have played their way into the pool with regular club involvement. All three remain in contention to crack the Gold Cup roster. Sebastian Berhalter and Jack McGlynn are two young midfielders who are vital parts of their MLS teams' engine rooms, and could be viable box-to-box options in McKennie's absence. Berhalter's inclusion, given he's the son of Pochettino's predecessor, carries some added significance. Other notables from the domestic league include Luca De La Torre, restored amidst his loan to San Diego FC, versatile Emeka Eneli of Real Salt Lake, and dynamic attacking midfielder Quinn Sullivan of the East-leading Philadelphia Union. As expected, Tillman and Dest are up for selection, as Tillman tries to carve out an attacking midfield starting role under Pochettino while Dest returns from injury. Concacaf lists Ledezma as a midfielder on this list, and his selection comes after some speculation if he'd make a one-time switch to represent Mexico. His omission opens the door for other strikers to make their cases, as Pepi was arguably the pool's most in-form forward up until his season's premature end. The full 60-man preliminary list, assigned to position groups as listed by Concacaf: Goalkeepers: Chris Brady (Chicago Fire); Matt Freese (New York City FC); Diego Kochen (FC Barcelona); Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew); Zack Steffen (Colorado Rapids); Matt Turner (Nottingham Forest) Defenders: Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps); George Campbell (CF Montréal); Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic); Sergiño Dest (PSV); Marlon Fossey (Standard Liege); Alex Freeman (Orlando City); Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union); DeJuan Jones (San Jose Earthquakes); Kristoffer Lund (Palermo); Mark McKenzie (Toulouse); Shaq Moore (Nashville SC); Tim Ream (Charlotte FC); Chris Richards (Crystal Palace); Antonee Robinson (Fulham); Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati); Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach); John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel); Auston Trusty (Celtic); Caleb Wiley (Chelsea); Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC) Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United); Paxten Aaronsen (Eintracht Frankfurt); Tyler Adams (AFC Bournemouth); Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew); Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps); Gianluca Busio (Venezia); Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis); Caden Clark (CF Montréal), Luca De La Torre (San Diego FC); Maximilian Dietz (Greuther Fürth); Emeka Eneli (Real Salt Lake); Brian Gutierrez (Chicago Fire); Richy Ledezma (PSV); Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake); Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo); Djordje Mihailovic (Colorado Rapids); Matko Miljevic (Huracan); Aidan Morris (Middlesbrough); Yunus Musah (AC Milan); Tanner Tessmann (Lyon); Timothy Tillman (Los Angeles FC); Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew) Forwards: Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC); Folarin Balogun (AS Monaco); Damion Downs (FC Köln); Christian Pulisic (AC Milan); Josh Sargent (Norwich City); Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union); Malik Tillman (PSV); Brandon Vazquez (Austin FC); Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps); Haji Wright (Coventry City); Griffin Yow (Westerlo); Alex Zendejas (Club América)</p>

From UEFA Champions League heavyweights Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich to South American giants Boca Juniors and Palmeiras, and the return of Lionel Messi with Inter Miami, there are plenty of big names to follow along with.

But just how will you be able to watch it all unfold? Who will show the tournament in full? And which cable, satellite and streaming providers will be your best bet to see some of the greatest players in the world?

Here, GOAL offers you the answers on how to watch and stream the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic, Sergino Dest, and Malik Tillman headlined Mauricio Pochettino's roster, which was released by CONCACAF on Monday. Haji Wright, Josh Sargent, and Antonee Robinson were also named to the roster while Ricardo Pepi and Ethan Horvath were not named for respective reasons. Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, and Gio Reyna were not named to the squad due to their upcoming involvement at the FIFA Club World Cup. Dual-national forward Damion Downs, who earned promotion at club level with Cologne, was also included. Two current MLS standouts; Alex Freeman and Sebastian Berhalter, were named to the senior roster for the first time. Gold Cup group stage play begins for the Americans on June 15 against Trinidad & Tobago. Here is a closer look at the full 60-player provisional roster: Defenders: Tristian Blackmon, George Campbell, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Sergino Dest, Marlon Fossey, Alex Freeman, Nathan Harriel, DeJuan Jones, Kristoffer Hansen, Mark McKenzie, Shaq Moore, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Antonee Robinson, Miles Robinson, Joe Scally, John Tolkin, Auston Trusty, Caleb Wiley, Walker Zimmerman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Youngster Paz for his part departed the Santiago Bernabéu on a permanent basis last summer, linking up with Cesc Fàbregas' Como in Italy. All told, across the season to date, Paz has racked up 34 appearances in Italy's top-flight, chipping in with six goals and a head-turning nine assists along the way. And such exploits, it would appear, have not gone at all unnoticed amongst those in a position of power at his former club. Real Madrid, for their part, boast a buyback clause on Paz this summer. ‘Nico Paz's arrival could come ahead of the Club World Cup. The player was supposed to be recalled by Real Madrid for 2026/27, but it seems plans for the midfielder's return have been brought forward.' Uncertainty looms over the Celtics, which means fantasy hoops managers need to pay close attention this offseason. On this episode of Good Word with Goodwill, Vince and David Dennis Jr. give their final thoughts on the Denver Nuggets season, preview Thunder vs. Timberwolves and Knicks vs. Pacers, and discuss  how the Celtics should handle next season. Wong announced that he was hanging up the cleats this weekend during a ceremony at University of Hawaii, his alma mater. Strider underwent elbow surgery last year and made one start in April before returning to the IL with a hamstring strain. And he has a lot to be happy about. Sallis is a poised, efficient scorer with body control, defensive tenacity, and the passing feel to hint at more upside. Collectively, Cubs third basemen are hitting .184 with a .493 OPS and no home runs. Nikola Jokić didn't mince words when asked if his Denver Nuggets could still win a title with the core from its 2023 championship team. David Adelman impressed the Nuggets' stars in a short period. Veteran players can still make a major impact, so let's examine the top-ranked option at each of the four key fantasy positions in their 30s. Team Penske swept the front row in 2024 as Josef Newgarden won his second straight 500. Tommy Fleetwood gets the lucky bounce of the tournament, which is saying something because there have been a few this week at Quail Hollow. Alvarado tested positive for exogenous testosterone and will not be allowed to pitch in the MLB postseason.</p>

Ronaldo has been linked with various destinations after his contract expires, but has also said he is happy in Saudi Arabia, with his family settled since moving in 2023. However, the lack of trophies could be frustrating, as his goal is always to win. Al-Nassr are said to have an offer on the table for the forward, who still feels he has more playing years ahead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lineker will bring an early end to his BBC tenure via mutual agreement, days after he apologised for sharing a post which led to accusations of anti-semitism. The broadcaster has now confirmed his exit date in a statement on Monday. It has also been reported that the former England striker, who is paid around £1.35m, will not receive a payoff from the BBC. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.” Lineker came under fire for re-sharing a pro-Gaza video which likened supporters of Israel to rats. The image of rats has historically been used as part of anti-semitic propaganda, including in Nazi Germany during the 1930s. The post was soon deleted but not before it was widely viewed and sparked calls for the BBC to part ways with Lineker. The 64-year-old issued an apology the following day and said: “On Instagram I re-posted material which I have since learned contained offensive references. I would never knowingly share anything anti-semitic. It goes against everything I believe in. “Whilst I strongly believe in the importance of speaking out on humanitarian issues, including the tragedy unfolding in Gaza, I also know that how we do so matters. "I take full responsibility for this mistake. That image does not reflect my views.” He had agreed a contract extension to stay on and present next season's FA Cup coverage along with the 2026 World Cup. Tim Davie, BBC Director-General, said: “Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made. Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.” Lineker had previously come under fire for his social media usage. In March last year, Lineker was briefly suspended from hosting Match of the Day after a Twitter post about the British government's asylum policy prompted a row about BBC presenters expressing political views on social media. Lineker's fellow presenters and pundits, including Alan Shearer and Ian Wright, refused to appear on the show in solidarity with Lineker and it was reduced to a 20-minute highlights package, which contained no hosts, pundits or commentary. The ex-Everton, Leicester, Barcelona and Tottenham star was reinstated to the programme just over a week later. The 64-year-old replaced Des Lynam in the MOTD role in 1999 after moving into punditry and presenting following his playing career. He headed up the BBC's coverage of the FA Cup final on Saturday, which saw Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 1-0.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Blighted buildings will be torn down, shuttles will take visitors nonstop from the airport to the Galleria and the airport will have a designated area added just to help process foreign guests in town for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. And while right now, Carlos Carrillo said his 4 a.m. drive to work on the North Freeway near Parker Road is practically pitch black at times, the city said he can expect to see some light soon. I think there's about 80 lights and at least 80 percent of them are out," Carrilo told 13 Investigates. 13 Investigates wanted to know more about the projects Houston Public Works is prioritizing ahead of the games, so we requested their emails. One resident reached out to the Mayor's office about "an abundance of the tall freeway light towers" that are "inoperative" on Interstate 610 and U.S. Highway 59. The major challenges we currently face are wire theft, aging infrastructure, difficulty hiring qualified personnel, unreported damage by unknown contractors and knocked down electrical services," a maintenance manager at Houston Public Works said in internal emails. "The freeway lighting is a major project we are working on, as we are trying to get them all repaired and burning by the 2026 World Cup games." When 13 Investigates asked the city about maintaining tower lighting on interstates, they sent us a similar response, citing the challenges with wire theft and aging infrastructure. "Houston Public Works is committed to maintaining the mast lighting along freeways and highways within Houston city limits," a Public Works spokesperson said in a statement. "Repair work includes coordinating with TxDOT on when they can assist with closing down traffic lanes for our crews to make these repairs while working around their construction schedule. SEE ALSO: '2024 is a critical year': Houston World Cup committee begins plans ahead of hosting in 2026 The city is also working to tear down what it calls "blighted" and "dangerous" buildings ahead of the World Cup, including the old Greyhound station at 2121 Main Street and an old hotel at 801 St. Joseph's Parkway. "The administration wants to take action against two properties in advance of the World Cup in 2026," an attorney with the City of Houston's Legal Department said in a Nov. 27, 2024, email to the Department of Neighborhoods and Houston Permitting Center. 13 Investigates: Fixing Houston's dangerous buildings is a 'long and drawn-out process' It's catching bats, gnats, rats, roaches, insects and diseases," David Valdez said as he waited at a bus stop near the St. Joseph's Parkway property. "You look at the graffiti and then you look at all the woodwork over here boarded up on the windows and you can tell it's abandoned." The city is also working to clean up graffiti, perform landscaping, restripe roads and fix sidewalks ahead of the World Cup games. They're also planning to build a park on the east side of downtown near where a month-long fan fest party will be hosted next summer. A recent study from the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs found that bad road conditions are actually residents' top concern for the city. In a Jan. 24, 2025, email to the Houston Public Works Director, the department's communications director asks "Can you shed light on what HPW is doing '500 days to the World Cup' for potholes? The Mayor's Office is asking for talking points and this is the first I'm hearing of this." "Our message really ought to be the fact that we're getting Houston ready to be Houston every day. The World Cup is a special event, but our emphasis needs to be on fixing our problems today for everyone to enjoy all the time," the Public Works director said. Houston Mayor John Whitmire only took office in January 2024, and Houston was announced as a host city in 2022, but we wanted to why these city infrastructure projects can be deemed "high priority and aggressive" for the World Cup but not always year-round. But, during a city council meeting in January, Whitmire doubled down on the need to make changes for residents. "I go to meetings on a regular basis about how we have to improve 'this' or 'that' for the World Cup, and I interrupt them to say, 'No, we need to get it ready for Houstonians and if we get it ready for Houstonians and Harris County residents on a daily basis, we will be ready for FIFA,'" Whitmire said. Chase Murphy, who has lived in Houston the last eight years, said the city needs to make sure it cares more about its local community. "We shouldn't have to wait for large events like the World Cup coming. Hundreds of people move here every day and so we want to make sure that our city has a good reputation outside of all the external people coming from Europe and all other countries coming to our town," Murphy said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HARRIS COUNTY, Texas — After years of fear and uncertainty, members of the Afghan women's soccer team made history Sunday night by returning to the pitch in Houston for their first team practice on American soil. Under the Taliban's authoritarian rule, Afghan women and girls have suffered tremendously. The government took away their right to education, employment and participation in sports. According to FIFA, Sodaba Khinjani was part of a group of more than 150 Afghan refugees connected to women's sport in Afghanistan who FIFA helped evacuate from Kabul. Khinjani was a member of the women's soccer team. It was the most difficult decision that I ever made in my life, because imagine you just leave your everything and you want to go to another country and you want to start from zero, so it's a big risk,” Khinjani said. But Khinjani said the idea of staying in Afghanistan, especially as a female athlete, was terrifying, because the Taliban were persecuting women involved in sports. “When we were in Afghanistan, they just killed two women from sports. They just cut their head, and it was like a big shock for us,” Khinjani said. “The only thing our crime was, first to be a woman in Afghanistan, and the second thing, second crime, was to be in a sport,” Khinjani said. Nearly two years later, they held their first team practice at Bayland Park in southwest Houston Sunday night. But for those women, it was not just a soccer practice. She added that seeing her teammates run, dribble and kick – after enduring the hardships they have – is a true testament to their tenacity and resilience. “All of them are superwomen in my eyes,” Khinjani said. Brand-new soccer cleats and the practice field at Bayland Park are thanks to Harris County Precinct 4. “This soccer field will be their new home here in the U.S., and then we also, through our Precinct4Forward, our nonprofit arm, made a donation so they could get their cleats,” Briones said. “We're going to not only welcome them and support them and make sure they're safe, but make sure they're celebrated, and as we prepare to host the World Cup in 2026 and part of FIFA's platform is to make sure we're advocating for human rights across the globe, here is an example of what we're doing locally to support that critical mission.”</p>
