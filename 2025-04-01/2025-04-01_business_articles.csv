Kahoot claims AI will end the ‘bored room’

Corporate training has long suffered from a fatal flaw: disengagement.

The rigidity of traditional, monotone presentations, and the passive nature of slide-heavy training sessions, have turned workplace education into a mundane obligation, rather than an opportunity for professional growth.

And in today’s hybrid work landscape, where distractions are just a browser tab away, the traditional boardroom presentation faces increasing scrutiny.

Kahoot!, the Norwegian tech firm, proposes a solution aimed at revitalising corporate learning.

By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification, Kahoot! seeks to transform knowledge-sharing into an interactive experience that improves information retention.

Their goal is to align training methods with the evolving preferences of modern employees.

But can AI and gamification address the issue of corporate disengagement? Or is this merely a technological tweak to an outdated model?

The decline of traditional corporate learning

Studies have highlighted the shortcomings of traditional corporate learning.

Research from Gallup revealed that nearly 87 per cent of employees feel disengaged at work, often citing ineffective training and uninspiring presentations.

Eilert Hanoa, chief executive of Kahoot!, spoke to City AM about this lack of interaction.

“The biggest challenge is the lack of two-way communication”, he said. “Especially these days, where everyone is used to interacting with their device on social media and getting feedback, we must learn to engage with our audience.”

The promises of gamification and AI

AI and gamification are increasingly being recognised as potential tools set to fundamentally reshape the corporate learning experience.

Kahoot!, for example, implements AI-generated quizzes, live polls and interactive Q&A sessions to encourage engagement.

Hanoa explains: “We are trying to create solutions that make it very easy for the presenter to engage the audience and have seamless feedback, whether that’s on a slide level – having interactivity with questions or feedback – open text answers, or collaboration.”

The impact of gamification on knowledge retention is notable. A study by TalentLMS found that 89 per cent of employees felt more productive when training was gamified, while 83 per cent reported feeling more motivated.

Challenges and considerations

Despite the potential benefits, integrating AI and gamification into corporate training doesn’t come without its challenges.

Gamification elements may lose their appeal over time, as continuous updates and innovations will become necessary to maintain interest.

What’s more, while leader boards can motivate, excessive competition might also lead to conflict between employees.

A one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective, so tailoring gamified elements to align with the organisation’s culture would be crucial to implementation.

There is also a major cost barrier. Developing and integrating AI-driven learning platforms require significant investment in technology and expertise, which could be prohibitive to some organisations, notably, smaller enterprises.

Steve George, head of learning at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), acknowledges the potential of AI in enhancing corporate training.

Yet, he cautions: “AI can be a powerful tool to support learning at work. However, human oversight remains essential – AI can suffer from hallucinations, algorithmic bias, and other limitations.”

PwC’s gamified learning initiatives

Some firms have begun exploring gamified learning experiences within their organisations.

For example, PWC has implemented interactive, app-based trivia games to support AI upskilling efforts.

These initiatives aim to blend casual gaming with educational content, transforming solitary learning activities into collaborative group experiences.

Leah Houde, chief learning officer at PwC, highlights the importance of engagement: “Gaming experiences are one way we can get our people to learn something new, while having fun in the process”.

The future of corporate training

In an era where skills development is essential to both individual career progression and organisational success, businesses must rethink their approach to corporate learning.

While passive information has become insufficient, as engagement drives productivity, successful implementation requires careful consideration.

Factors such as potential challenges, ongoing innovation, and a commitment to aligning new technologies within organisational culture pose the biggest challenges.

Yet, by thoughtfully integrating these tools, companies could create dynamic learning environments, that not only inform, but encourage their workforce.",cityam

The Premier League will finally introduce semi-automated offside technology this month after a number of delays.

The Premier League will finally introduce semi-automated offside technology this month after a number of delays.

The system, seen as an upgrade on the controversial VAR system currently used to judge offsides, has been tested in a non-live capacity across a number of Premier League and FA Cup games.

But it comes much later than originally anticipated, with a number of issues delaying its implementation.

“The Premier League will introduce semi-automated offside technology on Saturday 12 April (Match Round 32),” a Premier League statement read yesterday. “This follows non-live testing in the Premier League and live operation in the FA Cup this season.

“Semi-automated offside technology automates key elements of the offside decision-making process to support the video assistant referee (VAR). It provides more efficient placement of the virtual offside line, using optical player tracking, and generates virtual graphics to ensure an enhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for fans.

“The technology maintains the integrity of the process while enhancing the speed, efficiency, and consistency of offside decision-making.

“The Premier League has worked in collaboration with PGMOL [Professional Game Match Officials Limited] and sports data and technology company Genius Sports to develop the new semi-automated offside technology system.”

The first match that will use the new technology will involve the defending champions Manchester City and Londoners Crystal Palace, whose 12:30 kick-off kickstarts that Saturday’s Premier League action.

The systems are supposed to automate some elements of the offside decision-making process, tracking the ball and 10,000 data points across the bodies of players. This will then feed into the footage and data provided to the Video Assistant Referee before a decision is relayed back to the on-field official.

There have been a number of controversial VAR decisions across this season but this new technology will only have an impact on offside calls.",cityam
https://cityam.com,Five key business travel trends in 2025 and beyond,https://www.cityam.com/five-key-business-travel-trends-in-2025-and-beyond/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Five key business travel trends in 2025 and beyond

Just three years ago, the future of business travel hung in the balance. Office spaces were being relinquished, metaverse technologies promised a life of WFA (Work From Anywhere), and the threat of another Covid wave loitered on the horizon. But a new “Business Travel Trends 2025” report co-authored by the trend forecasting agency Globetrender and Amadeus Cytric, a software-as-a-service platform for expense management, reveals a far more optimistic and dynamic projection for the year ahead.

As RTO (Return to Office) mandates increase and workers settle firmly back into Business As Usual, travelling for work is increasingly big business. According to data from the Global Business Travel Association, the market is expected to reach $1.64 trillion by the end of 2025, far outstripping 2024’s $1.48 trillion valuation. But what are the forces underpinning this upward surge?

Globetrender’s research pinpoints seven key trends set to shape the business trips of tomorrow. As one might expect, AI is forecast to drive disruption; reducing travel time via the gradual rollout of “Biometric Gateways” and cutting down on administrative tasks as “Agentic AI”personal assistants become mainstream.

However, while technology advances elsewhere – in the form of New Distribution Capabilities (NDCs), for instance – will also impact business trips, the report highlights markedly more human approach emerging, too. This shift is being propelled not only by the ongoing wellness revolution but also by the growing influence of principled, uncompromising Gen Z workers.

“Business travel is evolving in response to shifting workforce expectations, new technologies and a greater emphasis on wellbeing and human connections,” says Globetrender CEO, Jenny Southan. “In 2025, companies that adapt – whether through AI‑driven automation, reimagined meeting spaces, or a more strategic approach to traveller health – will be best placed to maximise the value of corporate trips.”

As companies seek to meet the expectations of a rapidly changing workforce, the need to keep pace with broader cultural shifts and technologies is more necessary than ever. We’ve selected five trends from the report that should be on your radar, whether you’re an Executive Assistant looking to impress or flying high with the C-suite.

1. Agentic AI

In recent years, there has been much talk of AI’s transformative capabilities, but few concrete examples, leading many to question whether generative AI is just another passing hype like Bitcoin or the metaverse. Expect the conversation to shift drastically in the year ahead, with agentic AI assistants entering the fray.

Business travel trends in 2025 include meetings in the sky

These advanced platforms won’t simply respond to user input; they’ll proactively anticipate needs – no prompt necessary. The benefits to business travellers are manifold: from rebooking flights in real time to optimising itineraries based on shifting schedules. As these tools integrate into workers’ everyday software and devices, travellers will be freed from mundane logistics, allowing more time for focused, meaningful work.

2. Meetings in Motion

The traditional boardroom is evolving, with taxis, planes, and trains becoming increasingly attractive venues for business meetings. This shift isn’t being driven solely by ultra-fast wifi or Microsoft’s holographic Mesh technology (though those aren’t to be dismissed). Rather, it’s the growing adoption of a more informal approach to business, along with more adaptable transport options.

In the air, airlines are enhancing business class offerings by introducing communal seating arrangements. This development is mirrored on the ground, with driverless taxis reconfiguring car layouts from forward- to inward-facing seats. Meanwhile, environmental concerns continue to push train travel forward as a preferred option among corporate travellers, setting the stage for even more meetings in motion.

3. New-Gen Frequent Flyers

Prepare for the Gen Z effect to take hold as the young upstarts of tomorrow’s workforce (those born between 1997 and 2012) start heading on assignment. Unlike their elders, members of this generation are more likely to perceive work-related travel as having a positive impact on their mental health, with many embracing trips as an opportunity for both professional and personal growth.

Simply heading on the work trip isn’t enough, however. To maximise the value of their travel experiences and minimise their carbon footprint Gen Z are squeezing extra days abroad in and around their work obligations, often bringing friends and family along for the ride. Their desire for flexibility, sustainability, and meaningful experiences is reshaping what it means to be a “frequent flyer”.

Business travel trends in 2025 include meetings in the sky

4. Biometric Gateways

Tomorrow’s business travellers will no longer be tethered to lengthy queues and piles of travel documents. In October 2024, the International Air Transport Association announced that a “fully digital travel experience is closer to reality” following a successful test of digital passport technology between Hong Kong and Tokyo.

Skipping long border control queues is just the beginning. As digital wallets, company IDs, and frequent flyer credentials are consolidated digitally, expect personalised offers from airlines and airport retailers, faster visa processing, and more. The rollout will be gradual, with Europe planning to issue Digital Identity Wallets by 2027, but the effects will be transformative.

5. Jetset Hacking

One lasting legacy of the pandemic is a collective focus on health and wellbeing. While the business travel industry has been slow to catch up, change is underway. Brands like Equinox Hotels, a spinoff of the elite gym chain, are raising the bar by offering services like Jetlag Reset, cryotherapy chambers, and productivity-boosting IV infusions.

Airlines are also stepping up. Qantas’s Project Sunrise cabin, designed to regulate circadian rhythms, and Vistajet’s “360” wellness programme, which aims to enhance clarity, focus, and relaxation, are just two examples of how the travel sector is responding to the pursuit of self-optimisation across touchpoints.",cityam

Donald Trump’s tariffs are expected to “have an impact” on the UK’s economy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told cabinet ministers.

Donald Trump’s tariffs are expected to “have an impact” on the UK’s economy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told cabinet ministers, after business secretary Jonathan Reynolds warned the country faces “a very serious and significant moment”.

The US President is set to unveil sweeping – but as yet unknown – tariffs on goods from around the world on Wednesday, an event he has dubbed ‘liberation day’, just days after the official watchdog warned the Chancellor’s precarious fiscal headroom could be wiped out by the move.

It is unclear what exactly Trump will announce, but it’s believed his administration is critical of the application of the VAT rate, and could respond with a 20 per cent tariff on UK imports.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has admitted the UK is unlikely to avoid being hit by import taxes on goods going into the US, despite the two countries so-called ‘special relationship’, warning the “likelihood is there will be tariffs” and that “nobody welcomes that”.

The UK is continuing efforts to secure a trade deal with the US to ameliorate the impact of tariffs, amid reports – denied by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds – that an agreement is ready to sign.

Starmer updated cabinet ministers at their weekly meeting this morning on the government’s “latest position” on the “announced US plans on steel, aluminium and automotive tariffs, with further details of ‘reciprocal’ global tariffs expected this week”, an official readout stated.

UK headroom

While Reeves, who spoke to her US counterpart, Treasury secretary Scott Bessent yesterday, said that “global tariffs will have an impact on the UK as an open trading economy” and that “securing a deal could mitigate some of those effects”.

Addressing the Treasury select committee this morning, Professor David Miles, from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said if 20-25 per cent tariffs were imposed on the UK, it could “knock out all the headroom that the government currently has”.

The Prime Minister also said “the UK’s approach is to progress ongoing talks with the US on an economic deal, which are at an advanced stage, while keeping all options on the table” and he stressed that “a calm and pragmatic approach best served UK national interests”.

He added that: “Nobody wants to see global tariffs, but the UK would continue negotiations, continue engaging with British industries, prepare for all scenarios, and double down on delivering a modern industrial strategy that supports jobs and grows the economy.”

While business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said “the UK was well placed to agree an economic deal with the US” and “talks would continue beyond tomorrow’s announcement”.

Reynolds added that the “business community wants to see the government take a calm, cool-headed, and pragmatic approach to discussions with the US”.

‘Prepare for the worst’

Speaking in the House of Commons this afternoon, foreign secretary David Lammy warned the UK must “prepare for the worst” as “intense conversations” continue on a possible deal.

Lammy told MPs: “It’s hugely important at this time that we continue the intense conversations we’re having with the US administration on getting an economic agreement but of course we prepare for the worst – all options remain on the table.

“But it’s also right that the business secretary and I and others across Government continue to engage with business and industry so we can give them the best support at what will be a turbulent economic time, not just for our own country but of course much of the world.”

Former British ambassador to the US, Lord Kim Darroch, has told Times Radio the UK should be “careful” and “not a pushover” in its dealings with the US administration.

He warned that Trump “already thinks tariffs are a great idea” and added “if he starts getting concessions offered by the rest of the world, to keep them away, he’ll keep using them.

“And every time there is some grievance or some dispute in relations, he’ll come back and threaten tariffs or impose them and then say, do what I want you to do to get them lifted.”

He added: “There is still, it seems from what the government is saying, a glimmer of hope that a deal can be done somewhere down the line.

“But meanwhile, we’re going to take the hit of the tariffs that will be announced tomorrow… it could be a very big hit indeed. And it looks like it’s going to be global.

“I think, as has just been said, it will damage the American economy as much as it damages the rest of the world. So it’s a thoroughly destructive and self harming move. But it’s coming.”",cityam
https://cityam.com,Peel Hunt: London Stock Exchange requires ‘urgent’ support,https://www.cityam.com/peel-hunt-london-stock-exchange-requires-urgent-support/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:36:28 GMT","Peel Hunt: London Stock Exchange requires ‘urgent’ support

Peel Hunt called for a ‘reboot’ of junior stock exchange AIM.

The UK’s capital markets require “urgent” support from the government, Peel Hunt has said, as the London Stock Exchange continues to be raided by private takeovers.

While there have been 15 companies worth over £100m facing acquisition bids on the stock exchange since the start of 2025, not a single firm worth over £100m floated in that time, data from the investment bank revealed.

Overseas bidders have represented 47 per cent of the bids, which total around £9bn.

“The UK small and midcap market continues to be depleted at a concerning rate, particularly given the lack of IPO activity,” said Peel Hunt head of research Charles Hall.

Of all 15 takeover bids, six have been in the FTSE 250, while four have been in the FTSE Smallcap and four on the junior stock exchange AIM. There have been no bids for FTSE 100 firms so far.

As a result, Hall said it was “essential that the government urgently address” the problems facing the stock exchange, suggesting solutions such as pension reform, ISA reform, establishing a national wealth fund, and addressing stamp duty.

The steady shift from strong capital markets to a “happy hunting ground for both corporate and private equity bidders” has come thanks to low valuations and willing sellers, Hall explained.

Small stock exchanges are worst affected

The London Stock Exchange has been suffering for years from a drought of IPOs and frequent takeover attempts, but smaller companies on the market have been particularly affected.

The FTSE Smallcap, which includes companies that are worth below around £500m but are not listed on AIM, has seen the number of companies reduce from 160 in 2018 to just 108 today.

In addition, the market capitalisation of these companies has halved, from £50bn seven years ago to £26bn today.

“The impact on the FTSE Smallcap is much greater than suggested by the data above, as a number of constituents are set to be promoted to the FTSE 250 to replace the companies being acquired,” added Hall.

Meanwhile, AIM has faced a long-documented history of decline, reducing its number of listed companies by 36 per cent in 2018, and the stock exchange’s market capitalisation falling 60 per cent since its peak in 2021.

“The rate of departure has accelerated in the current year, with 44 companies already considering leaving,” Hall noted.

The research head called for a “proper reboot” of the junior market, especially as almost half of the companies set to leave AIM have come from delisting, frequently citing the high cost and volatility of the exchange.

Meanwhile, Hall noted that 70 per cent of the takeover bids this year had been from other firms, compared to just 30 per cent from financial buyers.

“It has been surprising to see relatively low activity from private equity, given the scale of dry powder currently available,” he said.

“We expect this to change as financing conditions improve, meaning that private equity is likely to be a more active acquiror going forwards,”",cityam

The Cabinet Office has commissioned a probe into the survey troubles of the ONS (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)

The government has launched an independent investigation into the UK’s beleaguered statistics watchdog to ascertain how its official data and surveys have become so unreliable.

The remit of the probe – commissioned by the Cabinet Office and UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) – will span the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) culture, leadership and structure, and will be led by ex-senior mandarin Sir Robert Devereux.

Devereux was permanent secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Transport before he retired in 2018.

He will be responsible for addressing the root of the well-documented issues at the ONS that date back to the pandemic.

The statistics agency has been castigated by the Chancellor, Governor of the Bank of England, and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in recent months.

The body’s unreliable labour survey has been the most high-profile failure.

Falling response rates made it so unreliable that it became difficult to tell whether UK unemployment was rising or falling.

During an evidence session in November, Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, branded the unreliable labour data a “formidable” challenge, and attributed it to the fact “people don’t answer their phones in the way they used to”.

In a Treasury committee hearing shortly before the investigation was announced, the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) David Miles weighed into the problems beset by the ONS’s Labour Force Survey, telling MPs: “People should have much less confidence in the employment statistics than they used to.”

Other issues have also emerged, including the data the ONS compiles on the producer price index—a metric used to help calculate gross domestic product (GDP).

Read more ONS reliability questioned after survey ‘collapsed’ to five respondents

In its recent wage growth assessment, the body highlighted that one large employer had supplied its earnings data late, meaning it may need to revise its overall forecast.

The Cabinet Office said in a statement that the Devereux-led review will kick off this week and is expected to end in the summer.

During this time, it will seek to root out these failings.

Cat Little, the civil service’s chief operating officer, who has been charged with devising a policy response to the review, said accurate statistics were “integral to decision making and the delivery of public services.”

And Sir Robert Chote, the UKSA chair overseeing the ONS, branded the probe an “opportunity to help ensure that the ONS can deliver its best in a challenging external environment”.

“The Authority Board looks forward to hearing his conclusions, drawing on the views of external stakeholders and ONS colleagues about what works well and what could be improved,” he added.

ONS data is relied upon by some of the UK’s most significant economic institutions, and is used by officials in Threadneedle Street and the Treasury to set fiscal and monetary policy.

In his Mansion House speech last year, the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey bemoaned what he called the “travails” of the Labour Force Survey, telling attendees: “I do struggle to explain, when my fellow governors ask me, why the British are particularly bad at this.”

A spokesperson for the ONS: “We look forward to engaging with Sir Robert Devereux on his review.

Later this week we will publish a new strategic business plan for the ONS, setting out how key statistics and services will be prioritised over the year ahead.”

Sweeping price hikes coming into effect from today are set to push up inflation, a leading economics consultancy has said.

Sweeping price hikes coming into effect from Tuesday are set to push up inflation, a leading economics consultancy has said, as what many have called ‘Awful April’ is set to put an extra burden on businesses’ costs.

Higher costs in everything from water to energy will contribute to a rise in inflation that peaks at twice as high as the Bank of England’s target rate of 2 per cent, according to analysts at Oxford Economics.

Households and companies operating on variable tariffs will see their energy bills rise by £111 while water bills are increasing by 26 per cent.

A surge in European wholesale gas prices in previous months could also have an effect on inflation in the spring, Oxford Economics said.

“Large regulated price increases, higher oil prices, weaker sterling, and the impact of policy measures from October’s Budget will combine to cause an inflationary surge this year,” economist Edward Allenby said.

Other price increases coming into effect from Tuesday include changes to council tax, stamp prices, TV licences, broadband prices and car taxes.

The national minimum wage will also rise to £12.21 from Tuesday, taking a toll on costs for thousands of businesses.

Later this week, the beginning of the tax year will also see the onset of Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ £18bn national insurance raid on employers’ contributions.

Oxford Economics predicted that the tax rise will lead to firms passing labour costs onto consumers.

Read more The four factors set to raise inflation this year

“The upward pressures on inflation largely come from external sources and appear transitory. We think they are unlikely to result in significant indirect or second-round effects,” Allenby added.

Oxford Economics said it expects consumer price inflation (CPI) to average at 3.2 per cent in 2025.

It matches the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)’s latest estimate. The Bank said that inflation could peak at 3.75 per cent shortly after the summer.

Economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics see inflation rising to 3.5 per cent in April before a rise to 3.7 per cent in the autumn.

In a separate report, the think tank Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that this week’s “dramatic increase” in employers’ national insurance contributions and the minimum wage would make it harder for young adults to enter the workforce.

“We know that spells of unemployment early on in people’s careers can have long-lasting effects on their career trajectories,” Sam Ray-Chaudhuri, a researcher at the IFS, said.

“Given existing worries about how young people have fared over recent years, it will be important to proceed cautiously and closely monitor the effects of these policies on this group, to avoid young people being left behind.”",cityam

House prices continued to rise in March as easing affordability pressures – alongside the end of the stamp duty holiday – boosted demand.

UK house price growth remained stable in March at 3.9 per cent, the same as in February, according to Nationwide’s house price index.

“These price trends are unsurprising, given the end of the stamp duty holiday at the end of March,” Nationwide’s chief economist Robert Gardner said.

The stamp duty holiday has now officially ended, with first-time buyers no longer able to get a discount on the tax paid on their purchase.

“The market is likely to remain a little soft in the coming months since activity will have been brought forward to avoid the additional tax obligations – a pattern typically observed in the wake of the end of stamp duty holidays”, Gardner added.

Houses in Northern Ireland increased by 13.5 per cent in the year to March, the fastest rate in the UK, Nationwide said.

The increase in London property was just 1.9 per cent, making it the slowest-growing region.

London’s huge rise in house prices over the last two decades mean the affordability pressures in the capital are much higher than elsewhere, putting a ceiling on house price growth.

But with mortgage rates still high and the cost-of-living crisis not quite in the rearview mirror, affordability is an “ongoing concern” across the entire country, president of Onthemarket Jason Tebb said.

“With the markets expecting further rate reductions this year, this should give buyers who require mortgages increased confidence about taking the plunge,” he added.

Gardner agreed that activity is likely to pick up as the summer progresses.

“The unemployment rate is low, earnings are rising at a healthy pace in real terms, household balance sheets are strong and borrowing costs are likely to moderate a little if Bank Rate is lowered further in the coming quarters as we and most other analysts expect,” he said.

Estate agents Savills have predicted that transactions will “steadily improve” during the year, but “recovery will not be uniform”.

The company said activity in the first half of the year is likely to be driven by needs-based buyers, while “second steppers will gradually return as rates drop further”.",cityam

UK manufacturers’ woes have deepened as S&P Global’s UK Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the sector showed a further decline.

The latest S&P Global’s UK Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) shows that UK manufacturing’s woes have deepened.

S&P Global’s latest PMI survey, which asks around 600 industrial companies about their performances, suggests that manufacturing is again in the downturn following a poor start to the year.

The latest figure showed that it decreased to 44.9, which was slightly better than the figure of 44.6 that economists had predicted.

This was the lowest reading in 17 months, compared to an average of 51.7 between 2008 and 2025.

Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the outlook was “darkening” as confidence was plunging across the sector.

“Companies are being hit on several fronts,” said Dobson.

“Costs are rising due to changes in the national minimum wage and national insurance contributions, geopolitical tensions are intensifying, and global trade faces potential disruptions from tariffs.

“Although the impact on production volumes was widespread across industry, it was again small manufacturers that took the hardest knock,” he said.

The manufacturing sector had already taken a turn for the worse in the new year.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said a fall in output in January suggested businesses were “conserving funds” as a result of Reeves’ tax raid, which includes hikes to national insurance contributions (NICs).

Those taxes, which see the threshold at which employers begin to pay the levy drop to £5,000, are set to come into effect this week.

The CBI’s survey said that only three out of 17 manufacturing sub-sectors saw an increase in output.

Meanwhile, the industry body Make UK said a fall in output during the first quarter of the year for the first time in a decade was an “ominous” sign.",cityam

A mere week after Rachel Reeves told the Commons she had restored her fiscal headroom, Trump’s planned ‘Liberation Day’ tariff deluge could send a wrecking ball through the Chancellor’s buffer.

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has downgraded Britain’s economic growth outlook ahead of the President launching a fresh set of tariffs that could smash Reeves’ “iron clad” rules.

The bank cut its growth forecasts for the British economy from 0.9pc to 0.8pc this year and from 1.3pc to 1.2pc for 2026.

Goldman said it expects “a larger total hit to UK GDP from trade tensions,” even if Downing Street is able to secure a deal.

The Chancellor said she had restored her £9.9bn headroom during the Spring Statement last Wednesday.

Following the speech, the Office for Budget Responsibility said: “We assess the probability of meeting the target, with that amount of headroom, is basically around 50 per cent.”

OBR committee member Tom Josephs said in a press conference on Wednesday: “It would not take much to eliminate that headroom again.”

Read more Rachel Reeves has already lost half of her £9.9bn headroom

“A 0.6 per cent increase in gilt and interest rates, 0.1 per cent lower productivity and the worst case tariff scenario could eliminate the headroom,” he added.

Following Goldman’s downgrade the Chancellor could be on course to watch her narrow headroom crumble.

Additionally, the economists anticipated any deal reached between the UK and US would not shield the British economy from the “greater spillovers” from larger expected US tariffs on the EU.

“There remains considerable uncertainty around whether the US will impose further tariffs on the UK,” the authors added.

Trump has indicated he believes a deal with the UK “can be worked out” and that there is a “very good chance” of an agreement where “tariffs wouldn’t be necessary” but thus far, nothing has been set in stone.

(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)

The government has made many mistakes since coming to office, but the Chancellor deserves some credit for not breaking her fiscal rules at the first opportunity. The demands from various groups (and various wings of her own party) for more borrowing or exempting certain measures from the fiscal rules were ruthlessly ignored at the Spring Statement by Rachel Reeves, who likely has a perverse relationship with the framework she set herself just 8 months ago.

While she is undoubtedly frustrated with the OBR’s approach to evaluating her policies, and the constraints that their evaluation places on her, she has made clear the rules are “non-negotiable” and, to her credit, she stuck to them last week – albeit by the riskiest of margins.

Doing so meant slicing £5bn off the welfare budget, something that was presented as a major reform but which in fact appears to be little more than an accounting exercise. Indeed, once the OBR let it be known that they didn’t agree with the maths behind the cost-saving exercise, ministers scrambled around just hours before the Spring Statement to find another few hundred million quid in order to satisfy the watchdog.

Leaving aside the fact that this is no way to run a country (there is a serious argument to be made in favour of abolishing the OBR, or at least dampening its God-like authority) the unedifying spectacle of rushing out an announcement about another trim to the benefits bill – with the bond markets in mind, rather than welfare claimants – confirmed that the reforms are not serious.

Furthermore, ministers are about to discover that any effort they now make to encourage people back into work (or to find a job for the first time) will be undermined by their own policies. The government’s target is to get two million into work, but with only 800,000 current vacancies more than a million roles will have to be created.

Unfortunately, the government’s hike to business taxes and labour costs, to say nothing of the disastrous Employment Rights Act, means that many employers – particularly in the high-headcount sectors of retail and hospitality – are slashing any plans they had to hire more people. Industry surveys continue to show that businesses are planning to either reduce headcount or freeze hiring in the year ahead, meaning that Labour’s “generational” back-to-work agenda is already holed below the water line.",cityam

Lime and Forest bikes have been left strewn over the City, according to local councillors.

Discarded Lime bikes are littering London’s public realm and menacing wheelchair users, pram-pushers and the blind. There is a simple solution, says Phoebe Arslanagic-Little

Can there be any Londoner yet to be inconvenienced by an abandoned Lime bike? We want to get to work. We need to go to the shops. But improperly parked Lime bikes turn ordinary activities into an urban obstacle course.

I say ‘parked’, but often these big-boned e-bikes lie discarded on their sides in the middle of the pavement, like wounded animals. They are an irritation to us all. They are a serious menace to wheelchair users, pram pushers and the blind. One friend, struggling to open his front door one morning, found that a Lime bike had actually been parked directly against it.

A typical road bike weighs about 8kg. A Lime bike weighs 35kg. And in addition to making the bikes devilishly difficult to shift, the weight is responsible for what the Londoncentric newsletter reports orthopaedic surgeons are calling ‘Lime bike-leg’. This term describes what can sometimes happen when a Lime bike falls onto its rider in a crash and shatters bones.

Social norms don’t maintain themselves

London’s Lime bike-strewn spaces remind me of a line written by my friend Ellen Pasternack in an article defending ‘Karens’. Describing her heroic battle to restore order by asking people playing music out loud on the tube to use headphones, she wrote “social norms don’t maintain themselves”. ‘Karen’ is a pejorative term usually levelled at middle-class women perceived as not minding their own business. But like many others, I am now convinced that it is incumbent upon all of us to uphold the norms that keep public spaces, from parks and buses to libraries and trains, agreeable and useable.

During pregnancy, imagining the London I want my daughter to grow up in, I was full of righteous zealotry and Karen-ed as I never had before. I particularly enjoyed telling off cyclists for going through red lights and prodding young men into helping women carry prams upstairs.

Male friends, perhaps sometimes a little embarrassed by my interventions, tell me that it is easier for a woman than a man to tell a stranger off in public without starting a fight. I am sympathetic to that. But badly parked Lime bikes present the perfect opportunities for all our would-be brother Karens to join the fight for a better public realm at absolutely no risk to their personal safety.

Using the Lime app, you can very easily report an improperly parked bike. Repeat offenders are fined by Lime, though you will be disappointed to learn that the charge maxes out at a mere £20.

You can make everyone’s experience of our city, be they guest or resident, a little bit better

In Postman’s Park in the City of London, a short walk from St Paul’s, is the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice. Sparely but movingly, this late-Victorian monument commemorates ordinary people who died saving the lives of others. PC Robert Wright died in 1893 Croydon when he entered a burning house to save a woman. Elizabeth Boxall was killed in 1888 aged just 17 trying to save a child from a runaway horse. A young clergyman, known only to us as G Garnish, drowned in the Thames in his attempt to save the life of a stranger.

The Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice is a reminder that some of us are capable of extraordinary acts of heroism. Perhaps uncomfortably, it moves each of us to wonder if we ourselves would be counted among their number if the circumstances arose. But for most of us, the moment to prove ourselves is unlikely to ever arrive.

What you can do, what all of us can do, is to be civic-minded. You can make everyone’s experience of our city, be they guest or resident, a little bit better. You can pick up a discarded coffee cup and put it in the bin. You can help a young mother carry her pram up the stairs. You can report a Lime bike.",cityam

Smart interfaces and AI agents are the next frontier in digital evolution, so what happens when you no longer need a screen to use your tech? Asks Paul Armstrong

We swipe. We tap. We double-click and long-press. For over 20 years, the smartphone has been the interface through which we interact with everything – our friends, our work, our news, our sense of self. But cracks are starting to show. Screens are saturated. Apps are bloated. Notifications are noise. The smartphone isn’t going away overnight, but its cultural and technological dominance is already being challenged and that’s going to mean interesting shifts for every business under the sun.

The shift won’t be to one device. It’ll be to a system; a network of interfaces, sensors and AI agents embedded across our environments, our bodies – and sooner than we’d all probably like, our thoughts. The future is unlikely to be one gadget to replace the phone, we’ve had wearables for years, and while many are popular, none are as ubiquitous as the smartphone. The real shift is how digital life will evolve once we stop needing to hold it in our hands.

We’re moving toward an interface-light world. Smart assistants are no longer just in your phone – they’re in your car, your kitchen, your workplace. Add to that the rise of multimodal AI: models that can see, speak, listen, remember and act across platforms. These systems are increasingly agentic – able to make decisions, complete tasks and anticipate needs without human prompting. We’re in the early days, but already you can see the disruptive elements swirling.

Augmented reality (AR) glasses are inching closer to mainstream viability. Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, Apple’s Vision Pro, and Google’s persistent AR projects are all early attempts at collapsing the screen into your surroundings. No more checking a map on your phone – your route is hovering in front of your face. Need to understand a foreign language? Subtitles appear in real time as someone speaks. Visual overlays, contextual cues and interactive holograms are now part of the design language. We’re getting there, but none have gone mass market because of design mainly, but expect that to change now Meta has a strangle hold on Luxotica. Meta’s forthcoming ‘Orion’ glasses are likely years away, but they’re a good example of how we’ll experience a lot in the future. Sounds Black Mirror-esque? You’re not wrong, people have already demonstrated dangerous privacy issues. Perhaps even contact lenses – after all, they can continually test blood sugar already.

Hands are being slowly phased out as the primary mode of interaction. Apple’s smartwatch already lets you control actions with a double finger-pinch gesture – no taps, no buttons. Airpods allow users to nod to accept a call or shake their head to decline it. Apps can skip Spotify tracks by waving your hand over your phone. These aren’t gimmicks. They’re signals that interaction is decoupling from the device entirely. Of course, accessibility issues still exist, but when the tech is perfected years down the line, we’ll think about things and they will happen.

Can we trust big tech?

Holographic projection wearables like you see in sci-fi? Still sci-fi, but we’re getting closer. Although it doesn’t stop folks like Samsung trying for new wearable wrist-worn bracelet displays, projecting touch interfaces directly onto your arm or any surface. These remain difficult for a number of reasons from physics, to battery life to lighting issues. Neural interfaces are accelerating in parallel. Elon Musk’s Neuralink has already received FDA approval for human trials, aiming for direct brain-computer links or as Musk wants ‘telepathy’. Other players like Synchron and Nextmind (now owned by Snap) are racing to build non-invasive brain input devices that translate intention into digital action – no tapping required. Thank god we can trust all these big tech folks…

Startups are already building headbands that detect neural signals and allow users to control cursors or issue commands with thought alone. Current applications focus on accessibility and medical use, but the direction is clear. Once the input lag between thought and action vanishes, screens stop being necessary. Navigation, communication, and interaction collapse into intention. Again, thank god we can trust these big tech giants with our simple data…

The post-smartphone world won’t rely on opening apps. The app ecosystem, with its locked-in silos and gatekeeping fees, starts to unravel in a world powered by voice, gesture and thought. Instead of launching an app to order a taxi, you say – or think – what you need, and your AI agent handles it. No interface, no friction. Just intent, executed. Oh, and on subscription. Or an agentic AI will order one for you, the idea is it’s all seamless, organised, nothing goes wrong and everyone respects your privacy. Did anyone else just see that flying pig?

Utopia or dystopia

While this utopia or dystopia, depending on how you see it, will take years to come into any semblance of fruition, the seeds are clearly being laid out and entire industries are vulnerable. App design may go the way of web banners – replaced by interaction models that are ephemeral, contextual and fluid. What replaces the homepage? A query. What replaces the button? A glance. Brand visibility won’t rely on icons; it’ll rely on integration into invisible systems. Services will compete not for downloads, but for presence within the AI ecosystems that act on your behalf. How brands compete in this new world is going to be interesting.

Control of the post-smartphone landscape won’t go to whoever builds the best-looking device – it’ll go to whoever owns the decision layer. Apple is building a closed spatial computing stack. Meta wants its AR layers to host your identity, commerce and entertainment. Amazon is embedding Alexa deeper into ambient environments. Google is packaging its generative models into everything from search to wearables. Whoever shapes the interface for your intent ends up shaping the outcome, and there will be many masters.

Delaying adaptation isn’t really an option. Businesses should be preparing now for what interaction looks like without a screen. Optimise for voice, gesture, spatial computing and agentic AI – not in five years, but now. Start by ensuring your services are machine-readable, accessible by AI agents (or protected against them), and interoperable with emerging platforms (or not). Think about what your product looks like when it’s part of an experience, not an app. Rethink how users engage when the trigger is no longer a tap, but a whisper or a blink. Your strategists and UX folks are about to earn their money so keep them close.

The age of screens defined how we communicated, worked and consumed. That phase is ending. Wearables, holographic displays, neural interfaces and ambient AI are dissolving the edges of interaction, shifting the power from physical devices to digital context. What comes after the touchscreen isn’t another rectangle – it’s the end of the rectangle entirely. And for businesses still thinking in pixels and app stores, it’s time to start thinking much bigger.

Capitalism is “unbelievably tedious” and needs to be rebranded in order for people to fight for its survival by the end of Donald Trump’s second US administration, marketing veteran Rory Sutherland has said.

Speaking on the latest episode of City AM‘s Boardroom Uncovered podcast, Sutherland said that free market capitalism has been made “so boring that I’m not sure people really feel the urge to defend it anymore”.

He added that another name for capitalism is needed – one which recognises that “markets do not mean financial markets, but fundamentally wealth is created through innovation, marketing, behavioural change”.

Also as part of the episode, Sutherland said the billionaire founder of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson, should be recognised more for his achievements in business and made a national hero.

The vice chairman of Ogilvy added that it’s “tragic” that the UK doesn’t “make more heroes of our really innovative business successes” in the way the USA does.

‘We’ve managed to make free market capitalism so boring’

Speaking on the Boardroom Uncovered episode, Sutherland, who is the vice chairman of Ogilvy, said: “I’d argue that when Trump and JD Vance go, we have to fight harder for Western values.

“I grew up in the era when you had a communist threat from the Soviet Union, and there was a kind of universal belief that capitalism was free market capitalism was worth fighting for.

“Somehow we ourselves managed to make free market capitalism so boring that I’m not sure people really feel the urge to defend it anymore.

“No one ever goes, what do we want? ‘We’d like McKinsey to come in and slim our workforce and perform operation efficiency improvements. When do we want it? Now’.

“No one’s ever going to go out on the streets in support of what you might call early 21st century capitalism.

“It’s just unbelievably tedious. It shouldn’t be called capitalism at all. It should be called consumer tested market innovation.

“We need a better word for it, which recognises that markets do not mean financial markets, but fundamentally wealth is created through innovation, marketing, behavioural change.”

‘We’ve created a nonsensical economy’

Asked what he would do if he was Prime Minister for the day, Rory Sutherland said he would tax property and wealth “far more” and income “far less”.

He argued that a “nonsensical economy” has been created where “we have a very active mechanism for redistributing wealth from people who earn more to people who earn less”.

Sutherland added this is the case “despite the fact that actually income inequality isn’t the big problem. It’s wealth inequality”.

He said: “We don’t have any mechanism for generational wealth redistribution. And given what’s happened with the property market and the fact that we’ve had a stupid asset price inflation, this is going to lead to massive fractious society.”",cityam

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will tomorrow appear in court accused of tax fraud of more than €1m.

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will tomorrow appear in court accused of tax fraud of more than €1m.

The 65-year-old former Premier League manager will stand trial in Madrid on charges of defrauding the Spanish tax office to the tune of £836,857 in undeclared earnings from image rights a decade ago. The trial is expected to conclude on Thursday.

The period of investigation relates to the years 2014 and 2015, with prosecutors seeking a jail term of nearly five years for the Italian.

Prosecutors allege that Ancelotti, who has won the Champions League five times with three clubs, employed the use of shell companies outside of Spanish tax remits to create “opacity vis-a-vis the Spanish treasury … concealing the real beneficiary of the income from the exploitation of his image rights”.

Mbappe Law

They add that he omitted personal income from image rights despite being a Spanish resident for tax purposes – the so-called Mbappe Law was not introduced until 2024 – and failed to pay over £800,000 in tax owed.

The former Chelsea, Everton, AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Napoli boss has denied the charges, however, and preceded the trial by saying he has “total confidence in the law and in justice”.

“I’m not worried but I am obviously annoyed if they say that I’ve committed fraud, but, once again, I have total confidence in justice,” he added. “I’m really looking forward to testifying on Wednesday.”

The Mbappe Law – relating to Read Madrid star Kylian – is a tax incentive that provides a 20 per cent tax owed deduction for investments made that are not real estate.

It covers the five years after an individual moves their tax residence to Madrid, beginning in 2024.

Ancelotti is not the first high profile individual to be hauled in front of the Spanish authorities, with the likes of Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Jose Mourinho and Diego Costa among those to see their day in court.

Messi was sentenced to 21 months in prison but was spared jail time, Ronaldo was forced to pay £16.5m, Mourinho was given a one-year suspended sentence and Costa paid a fine in excess of £500,000.",cityam

Ineos and New Zealand Rugby have reached a settlement over the sponsorship deal

Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos has formally ended its partnership with New Zealand Rugby after reaching a settlement over a £27m sponsorship deal due to run until 2027.

NZR, which is responsible for the All Blacks and Black Ferns, sued Ineos in February after the chemicals giant had stopped making payments in order to “exit our six-year agreement”.

Ratcliffe’s company said it was looking to adjust the terms of the deal as part of a wider cost-cutting strategy that also saw it end a partnership with Tottenham Hotspur, announce hundreds of redundancies at Manchester United, where it is a co-owner, and pull its funding of Sir Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup team.

“New Zealand Rugby and Ineos can confirm that a settlement has been reached between the two parties,” they said in a joint statement.

“Whilst the details remain confidential, both organisations are satisfied with the outcome and acknowledge a desire to now move forward.”

Ineos declined to comment on whether the relationship had now ended, but it is understood to have ceased and the company is no longer listed on New Zealand Rugby’s portfolio of partners.

The company’s arrangement with New Zealand Rugby was one of several sporting tie-ups Ratcliffe embarked on as he sought to amass a collection of teams.

Ineos row a big problem for New Zealand Rugby

It still sponsors the Ineos Grenadiers road cycling team, is a one-third shareholder in Mercedes F1 and owns stakes in football clubs Nice and Lausanne.

In February, Ineos blamed its retreat from sponsorship deals on “the deindustrialisation of Europe”.

“Trading conditions for our European businesses have been severely impacted by high energy costs and extreme carbon taxes, along with much of the chemicals industry in Europe, which is struggling or shutting down,” it said.

“As a result, we have had to implement cost-saving measures across the business. We sought to reach a sensible agreement with the All Blacks to adjust our sponsorship in light of these challenges.

“Unfortunately, rather than working towards a managed solution, New Zealand Rugby have chosen to pursue legal action against their sponsor.”

Ineos appeared on All Blacks training shirts as part of its deal, although French construction group Altrad remains the team’s main sponsor.

A premature end to the Ineos partnership would leave New Zealand Rugby with “a major problem” Steve Martin of MSQ Sport + Entertainment told City AM. “They’d need to go to market while rugby is struggling.”",cityam

Moses Swaibu now has his own sports integrity advisory, GameChanger360

Crystal Palace protege Moses Swaibu went from big time to a life of crime, match-fixing for betting syndicates, but – via a spell in prison – is making amends with his sport integrity advisory GameChanger360.

Moses Swaibu knew he had hit rock bottom on his first night in prison. Beginning a custodial sentence for bribery offences in relation to match-fixing, he and fellow footballer Delroy Facey couldn’t have been further from the glamour of the game.

“The cell was really, like, grimly broken, the windows cracked. I sat down and had this flashback of playing in the FA Cup. I’m like, ‘Damn man, how have I gone from that to now?’,” Swaibu tells City AM.

“We’ve ripped a bed sheet, and I give him half that goes around his ankles, and I’m just sitting there cold. That was the moment that made me think I have to own it.

“The judge’s summary of our case was in my mind for a whole month. And I was like, ‘when I come out, what do I want to be remembered for?’. And that was the real change.”

Swaibu had been a highly promising defender at Crystal Palace but dropped down the divisions after being released, aged 19. He was introduced to match-fixing opportunities while at Lincoln City but got sucked in when he joined sixth-tier Bromley in 2012.

He went from fixing games to tapping up players at other clubs and ultimately becoming a middleman between Asian betting syndicates looking to manipulate games. On one occasion, Swaibu took home half a million pounds in cash.

“In hindsight, my life was so dangerous at that time,” he says. Swaibu’s fate twisted again in 2014 when he was arrested as part of a sting by the National Crime Agency and the Daily Telegraph while discussing match-fixing with a bogus gang.

He and Facey were sent down the following year, Swaibu for 16 months. Separated from his young daughter, he reflected on his path and resolved to mend his ways. A decade on, he is, he says, attempting to do that with his own integrity consultancy.

Podcast, book and GameChanger 360

Through GameChanger360, Swaibu has collaborated with Fifa, the Premier League, the International Olympic Committee and UFC. Drawing on his own experiences, he hopes to help organisations in sport and beyond become wiser to an underworld of corruption.

“It wasn’t until I came out of prison and sat down with the FA, I was like, if England is the No1 football country in the world, what does that mean for everybody else?” he says.

“I think it’s accelerated at quite a significant rate. I think my case was rare, because I was dealing with them [fixers] direct. Now you have the internet, you have digital wallets.

“It’s gone into the women’s game, young players and athletes are more vulnerable. Anywhere in the world where there’s a live betting market, there’ll also be a market to manipulate.”

Swaibu is developing tech solutions for expanding the business and to that end has been looking to raise over £600,000. He has high hopes for GameChanger360 and, beyond that, ambitions to go into sports politics governance.

He has also written a book, which builds on an award-winning BBC podcast series that told his story. Published next month, it is also an attempt to draw a line in the sand.

“As much as I’ve written a book, I’m just Nemo in this big ocean,” he says. “I did the book to bury the story, so that I don’t have to speak about it again. What I can’t allow is another version of me to even exist. So Moses Swaibu needs to be buried.”",cityam

Firstly, I promise this isn’t an April Fool. Welsh wine is a real thing.

Historically of course, they have always liked a drink. Welsh bards, poets and wordsmiths have dedicated their talent to the power and beauty of wine. As far back at the 6th century there are references to mead being drunk by warriors before battle, then in the 9th century a “bright wine” becomes the drink of choice for a fancy host. By the 15th century wine is being generously served to everyone at court according to Llywelyn Glyn Cothi, who enjoyed “mature wine, full of flame, in the court for all who came”.

Despite centuries of love for the beverage it has not, however, been traditionally home grown in the valleys of Wales itself. The wine-loving Romans did try planting some vines when they invaded but the Welsh climate was different to that of Italy and it failed to take hold. Until now.

Suddenly Wales is one of the fastest growing wine regions in the world with a 74 per cent increase in Welsh and English vineyards between 2017 and 2022. There are currently just shy of 40 vineyards across the country.

The oldest modern vineyard is Glyndwr, established in 1979 in the romantic Vale of Glamorgan their wines are available at Waitrose, including a particularly lovely sparkling rosé (£25). Just down the road is the UK’s first ever vineyard hotel, the Llanerch, with its award-winning restaurant serving local wines beside vineyard views.

White Castle are among the Welsh pioneers, having won multiple awards including gold medals for their red wines at the Decanter and Welsh Wine Awards. I was intrigued and headed to 67 Pall Mall for a Welsh Wine Tasting a couple of weeks ago to discover more for myself.

The first thing I noticed was the emphasis on organic, biodynamic and regenerative farming. Winemakers were eager to tell me about their work to limit pollution and pesticides, from incorporating animals into their vineyards to eradicate pests and spread immediate ‘fertiliser’, to putting nettles and dandelion heads in compost instead of using chemical sprays. Fiona Mounsey, owner of Velfrey Vineyard, told me how most vineyards in Wales are small and family run.

“Families have lived here for years and we’re all passionate about our little corner of Wales”. Velfrey is run by Fiona and her husband Andy with their son Ryan managing the vines and his wife Sophie heading on-site catering and social media.

They were also some of the most impressive wines I tried at the tasting, despite only releasing their first cuvées for sale a few years ago. Their sparkling wines were traditional method, like Champagne and crémant, but less customarily the main grape was Seyval Blanc.

This was another point of difference. Not a hugely known variety here, it seems Seyval Blanc is becoming the favoured grape of Wales. “It likes a nice long ripening period,” said Mounsey, “and in Pembrokeshire we get beautiful late summer weather, so we don’t harvest until late October or early November. This long ripening makes the wine lovely and complex.”

The Dell, who just won a Welsh Vineyard Award for their sparkling rosé of Seyval Blanc and Pinot Noir, agree: “It’s fruit forward and fresh and it suits our land well as it likes a cooler climate and is naturally disease resistant. It’s been known as ‘save-all’ as it’s so often a guaranteed harvest”.

“We could have planted Chardonnay,” said a representative for Montgomery Vineyard, “but France already does that well. We need to make our own stamp on wine. Not copy another region”.

For fans of a fresh, fruity sparkling and environmentally aware winemakers who prioritise the planet, Wales is right on our doorstep and its worth trying. As the Welsh saying goes “wine and ale and song and laughter, in every tavern I was never old’ – let’s drink to that.

Home By The Lee runs in the Liverpool Hurdle for Joseph O’Brien.

THERE weren’t many tougher beats at Cheltenham for me than HOME BY THE LEE, and I think he can have his day in the sun in the Liverpool Hurdle on Saturday (3.05pm).

I’d been all over Joseph O’Brien’s charge for the Stayers’ Hurdle and he was cruelly brought down in the race at an early stage.

He was none the worse for that mishap and is likely to arrive to this fresher than most of his rivals after barely having a race.

My other reasons for fancying him rather mirror those for Cheltenham – he’s been an improved horse this season, wears blinkers that work well for him and will have his preferred strong pace to run at.

He reopposes stout stayers Teahupoo and The Wallpark, but I think he might just have a touch of class to beat them on the day, and he’s a rocking each-way bet at 6/1.

It’s always nice to back the winner of the opening race on Grand National Day (1.20pm), and my eye is drawn MR HOPE STREET who I hope can get us off to a flyer.

He has been very consistent for Harry and Dan Skelton, finishing first or second in all of his starts this season, and he looks to have been kept for this race, having not run since the end of December.

That freshness angle is worth its weight in gold at the Grand National meeting, especially if you’re racing against those who had hard races at Cheltenham like Pertemps second Jeriko Du Reponet.

It pays to take heed when the Skeltons line one up for a big spring handicap, and while he’s not a wild price, the 6/1 available in places is a very fair offering.

Vanillier has run in the last two Grand Nationals.

FOR 10 minutes on Saturday afternoon millions across the nation will stop to tune into the world’s most famous race, the Grand National (4.00pm).

This is the time that nearly 20 percent of the British public have a flutter, and it is one of the increasingly few opportunities for racing to elevate itself from the back pages to the front.

Last year the most recent raft of changes to the race saw the field reduced to 34 runners from 40, but it still remains a unique and stirring spectacle.

Defending champion I Am Maximus returns and is bidding to emulate recent two-time winner Tiger Roll.

That was a challenge that proved too much for 2023 winner Corach Rambler, who unseated at the first fence last year, underlining that the National is still a race where a healthy slice of good fortune is needed.

I Am Maximus lines up this year eight pounds above the mark he won off and his two runs this season have been uninspiring, so I’ve a feeling this could be a bridge too far.

Momentum in the betting has gathered behind several horses in the last week.

Shark Hanlon’s bullish comments about his runner Hewick has seen his price crash, while recent Cheltenham Cross Country winner Stumptown has shortened into favourite with official Grand National meeting betting partners William Hill.

Hewick in particular has plenty of class and the drying ground conditions should suit him, so it could be another great chapter in the story of a horse that was bought for just €850 if he could land the £1million race.

He looks too short for me to be a bet though, and similar comments apply to Gavin Cromwell’s Stumptown.

In fact, it’s another of Cromwell’s contenders that I like in VANILLIER, who I put up in my ante-post column a few weeks ago at 16/1.

This 10-year-old is already a National veteran having had two spins over the big fences previously, when finishing second behind Corach Rambler in 2023 and then getting round in 14th last year.

He arrives here in good form after a win over the banks at Punchestown and then when third behind Stumptown at Cheltenham.

He’s also four pounds lower than last season off a mark of 147 and everything looks set up for another fine round in the National.

Read more Sweet on Vanillier and Beauport in open Grand National

In the current dry spell, ground staff are sure to be applying plenty of water to the track, so while the going should be good come Saturday, it’s unlikely to be really quick.

That bit of extra juice in the ground will help BEAUPORT, another of my ante-post picks.

The Nigel Twiston-Davies yard know how to train a National winner, having won the race twice, with Earth Summit in 1998 and then with Bindaree four years later.

Beauport was a good winner of the Midlands National last year, so we know he has the stamina for this, and while he’s much higher in the handicap here, I can see him running a good race.

Now we have more of an idea of the likely National field, I’m keen to add Willie Mullins’ MINELLA COCOONER as a third selection in the race.

This nine-year-old is a Grade One winner over hurdles, so has plenty of back-class, and won last season’s bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown over a marathon trip over fences.

He’s been mainly campaigned in Grade One company this season, running behind the likes of Fact To File and Galopin Des Champs before producing an eye-catching effort when third in the Bobbyjo behind Nick Rockett and long-term National fancy Intense Raffles.

Considering that rival is a good bit shorter, the 16/1 available about Minella Cocooner looks worth taking.

This would mean that countries that buy oil from these countries can expect higher import duties from the US for their own products.

Prices have risen on Monday and Tuesday at the Oliemmarkt due to this risk.

Also read: In 2025, a large surplus of oil threatens: that can push the oil price down

US President Donald Trump has shaken the oil market considerably by threatening with so -called secondary rates for Russia and Iran. This means that countries that buy Russian and Iranian oil would be subject to American import duties if they also trade with the US.

""If this becomes reality, this creates a high risk for the market, given the considerable oil export volumes of both countries,"" wrote Raw Materials Strategists from ING in a report published Tuesday. Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter, while Iran is a member of the organization of oil exporting countries (OPEC).

China and India are the greatest customers of Russian crude oil. Trump's ""secondary rates"" could be ""very effective to convince other countries to avoid the intended oil, whereby the impact of taxes on the economy of the buying country may be much greater than the benefits of buying discounted crude oil,"" wrote the strategists of ING.

The role of China is important here, because this country, for example, decreases both Iranian and Russian oil, and can therefore have to deal with extra import duties of Chinese products in the US, and the mechanism of the ""secondary levies"" comes into effect.

On Monday and Tuesday, oil prices rose, with Brent oil reaching a level of almost $ 75 per barrel.

Import duties Trump entertain the risk of higher inflation

The price increases followed Trump statements, who said last weekend at NBC News that he was ""very angry"" about the criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the leadership of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The American president also said he would meet Iran with taxes - and bombing - if Tehran does not close a deal with Washington about his nuclear program.

There is a risk with Trump's approach: inflation. Since energy prices are an important cost item for almost all industries, ""secondary rates"" would make it more difficult for Trump to slow down price increases in the US. ""Instead, prices would be much higher,"" wrote the strategists of ING.

The OPEC+ countries have promised to increase production from April. Financial markets also take economic growth retardation into account, which can slow down the demand for energy. Because of this dynamic, most analysts still expect lower oil prices. A poll by Reuters among 49 economists and analysts in March showed that they expect the oil prices to remain under pressure this year.",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,High expectations of customers? This way you get a grip on the customer experience,https://www.businessinsider.nl/hoge-klantverwachtingen-zo-krijg-je-grip-op-de-customer-experience-vodafone/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:49:00 GMT","Customers are increasingly expecting companies: they want 24/7 support, through every channel, with a consistent experience. Many organizations struggle to meet those expectations, notes Stephan Kuurstra, Modern Workplace Consultant at Vodafone Business. ""The top experience at one organization sets De Standaard for all others. But not every company can live up to those expectations.""

According to Stephan, this is mainly because many companies still work in silos. Customer service and sales are not coordinated, systems do not share data, while the number of communication channels continues to grow. ""Telephony, email, chat, apps ... Everything must be connected to be able to offer customers a consistent experience in which they feel recognized and recognized.""

Research by Accenture shows that three out of four consumers expect organizations to respond more quickly to their changing needs. According to Salesforce, 90% of consumers find the experience with a company just as important as the product or service itself. Moreover, digital customer contact is increasing: almost 60% of consumers prefer online communication. ""Customers want speed, convenience and a personal approach through the channel of their choice,"" says Stephan. ""The question is how companies can meet this.""

Telephone and mail no longer enough

Omnichannel has been a buzzword for years: the pursuit of a consistent customer experience, regardless of the specific contact point. In practice, however, many organizations remain in the phase before: Multichannel. Customers can contact us via multiple digital channels, but those channels do not share information. Customers notice this directly in the quality of the service. ""Taking up the phone and answering emails is not enough if you want to meet today's customer expectations,"" says Stephan. ""As an organization you not only have to connect the underlying technologies, but also make someone really responsible for the customer experience.""

""Fish where the fish are""

An effective customer contact strategy starts with the target group: which channel would they like to be helped? ""For a progressive brand with a young target group, the customer contact can go completely through an app,"" Stephan outlines. ""But a municipality must be accessible to everyone, regardless of age, background or digital skills. That means that more different channels are needed. We call this principle fish where the fish are: ensuring that you are present where your customers expect you.""



The next step is to map customer contact moments and the customer journey. In practice this is not happening enough, Stephan notes. ""If you do not record why customers contact, you miss essential insights. You can then ask critical questions: Do we want customers to call this? Can we prevent this or spread better? Through which channel can we answer these questions more efficiently?"" The answers to this not only offer opportunities to improve processes, but also to optimize customer experience. ""That requires cooperation,"" says Stephan. ""You bring people from different departments together and determine where you as an organization want to go for the next three years.""

The proliferation of communication channels

Many organizations have difficulty getting a grip on the proliferation of communication channels and the fragmentation in customer contact. How do you ensure that customer service does not get stuck under the pressure of multiple channels? According to Stephan, it is all about three factors: tooling, processes and people: ""They work like a triangle within the organization,"" he explains. ""A platform such as Vodafone Storm connects and integrates all channels at one central point. As a result, employees have a complete overview of the customer contact, regardless of the channel. If you want to test a new channel as an organization, such as Signal? Then you can easily add and assess whether it fits within your customer contact strategy.""



That is precisely the desired situation that the municipality of Nieuwegein was looking for. The municipal organization worked with an outdated and restrictive IT landscape and urgently needed modern, flexible solutions. ""We were increasingly risks of security incidents, and the functionalities really no longer met, especially with regard to the customer contact center,"" says Sander Kars, Purchasing ICT advisor. In one ""Big Bang"", the municipality made the switch to Microsoft Teams and Vodafone Storm, with a training in advance for all employees of the customer contact center. In addition to easier management and continuity, the future -proofing is a big profit: ""We are no longer locked up in an outdated situation. We now have all the tools to organize the customer contact smarter and more effectively.""

Investing in customer experience pays off

Yet the switch to omnichannel remains a challenge for many companies. The costs are clear, but the direct ROI less. That is why the subject is often pushed forward, Stephan notes. ""It must be a strategic spearhead at management level. As a Vodafone, for example, we have the ambitious goal of getting our NPS considerably higher. As a strategic goal, we give us the space to invest, not because of a direct ROI, but because customer satisfaction, loyalty and turnover are ultimately related.""

Continuous looking the balance

The ultimate goal of Omnichannel is a consistent customer experience, regardless of the contact point, says Michael van den Brink, country manager of Content Guru, supplier of Vodafone Storm. ""Whether customers are contacting us via a specific channel or changing in the meantime, experience must remain seamless, consistent and connected. That is the essence of modern customer contact: creating one smooth customer journey across all channels.""



And that is a continuous process, Stephan emphasizes. ""Customer expectations are constantly changing, new channels arise and old disappear. AI provides a revolution in customer service at the same time. People remain social beings and prefer to communicate with people, but AI can perform more and more tasks, in a fast and efficient way."" He expects technology to become even more proactive in the future: ""Your car will soon report that a service will be needed in three months, has already looked into the agenda of the garage and immediately proposes two possible days."" The underlying issue is how much automation is desirable. ""In it, every organization must find the right balance, in keeping with the needs and wishes of the customers. Organizations that want to distinguish themselves positively build on a unique customer relationship.""

History teaches that peacemakes often fail to keep warring parties apart.

Peace forces usually have more symbolic power than real firepower.

Read also: Russia wants to end in 2026 with Ukraine to be strong against China and US, says Ukrainian intelligence service

Analysis - While Europe is considering sending peacetoups to Ukraine, the history of peace missions shows that they are not always successful. Peace forces often do not succeed in preventing wars and sometimes a peace force itself becomes the target of attacks.

Maintaining peace is often associated with the UN, because in 1948 that organization sent military observers to the Middle East for the first time to supervise the truce after the Arab-Israeli war. Currently on behalf of the UN, a total of 72,000 peacekeepers are active in 11 conflict zones.

The idea of ​​using European troops to maintain a possible file between Ukraine and Russia leads directly to a definition problem. Are they going there to maintain peace or to protect Ukraine? Peaceemissions are expected to be neutral and primarily act as a supervisor. The UN assumes three basic principles when maintaining peace: impartiality, permission from the warring parties, and not using violence except for self -defense.

Peace forces often have to deal with accusations of bias. For example, Israel accused the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), for example, of ignoring the activities of Hezbollah along the Israeli-Lebanese border. That eventually led to Israeli troops entering Lebanon last October.

A European peace mission is problematic in this regard. Even though the proposed peace force in Ukraine will be led by Europe instead of NATO troops, it is about troops of NATO countries or of allies. The Kremlin will not be able to see that as a permanent expedition force that has to defend Ukraine against Russia.

Peace mission without effective firepower becomes problematic in Ukraine

In the core there are two different concepts for peace missions. One is the performance as an armed regulator who monitors or violates a party. The other concerns mobilizing enough combat power to protect an attacked party. The latter applies to UN troops led by the US that has been protecting South Korea against an invasion of North Korea for more than seventy years.

There is a risk anyway: what happens if the peace groups are attacked themselves? Either deliberately, or because they accidentally come under fire.

Peace forces usually have more symbolic power than firepower. The well-known white VN-Pantser cars do scare unarmed rioters and looters and perhaps also insurgents with light weapons and improvised bombs. But in Congo, UN troops had a lot of trouble with rebels that were equipped with anti-tank missiles and drones.

A possible peace force in Ukraine will be stuck between two countries that are armed to the teeth with artillery, tanks, rockets and drones. Fully equipped European mechanical brigades, which are supported by the Air Force, may have the combat power to repel attacks. Ukrainian administrators have already said that a European peace force only makes sense if the peacemakes are willing to fight.

But Russia has just invaded Ukraine to dominate it and get it out of the sphere of influence of the EU and NATO. A strong fighting power with British and French troops on the Russian border can be seen as a provocation by the Kremlin.

Russia doesn't even need tanks or guns to make peace enforcement impossible. There are many ways to make peace enforcement officers miserable, from Ied's (improvised bombs) of mysterious pro-Russian troops to artillery shoots that ""accidentally"" affect a barracks. Although that entails the risk of escalation of conflict with European countries or even NATO, Moscow can also hope for the pressure from the European population to bring the troops home if there are victims.

Ultimately, the success of peace missions is determined by the question of whether peace is effectively maintained or at least that the violence decreases. A results from the past are varying at this point.

Israel still remembers vision how the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) - who was stationed in Sinai to serve as a buffer between Israel and Egypt - suddenly left in 1967 at the request of Egypt. The result was that Israel carried out a preventive attack on Egypt in the six -day war.

Since 1978, unifil troops have been stationed along the border between Israel and Lebanon, but they have not been able to prevent the wars from 1982, 2006 and 2024. The same applies to a whole series of border incidents.

The UN nevertheless claims that peace missions work and thereby points to successful missions in Cambodia and Namibia, among others. The stationing of troops in friendly countries has also proved to be successful in maintaining peace: for example, the presence of American troops in South Korea has probably prevented a North Korean invasion and the troops that were stationed in Germany during the Cold War have helped prevent a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.

Peace missions have the greatest chance of succeeding if they have an overwhelming power, or if the warring party has decided to stop fighting. Neither of them probably applies to a European peace force in Ukraine.",businessinsider

In March, the sales of new Tesla’s in the Netherlands, France and Sweden have fallen again.

The political activities of Musk for the government of Donald Trump seem to influence this.

Elon Musk still seems to have a problem with the sales of Tesla. In March, the American manufacturer of electric cars sold much fewer cars sold in the Netherlands, France and Sweden.

The American manufacturer of electric cars is struggling with outdated models and increased competition from cheaper Chinese cars. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also receives a lot of criticism of his work for US President Donald Trump.

Figures published on Tuesday from branch organization BOVAG shows that Tesla sold 1,536 cars in the Netherlands in March, against 3,947 pieces in the same month a year earlier. That amounts to a decrease of 61 percent.

For the first three months of this year, the counter at Tesla in the Netherlands is 3,443 cars sold, against 6,842 in the first quarter of 2024. This is why it is about a halving. The best -selling models from Tesla in the Netherlands are the Model Y and the Model 3.

Tesla registered 3,157 cars in France and 911 in Sweden in March. That is a decrease of almost 37 percent in France and of almost 64 percent in Sweden compared to the same period last year, according to official sales data. Sales thus decreased for the third month in a row. The quarterly sales fell to 6,693 in France and to 1,929 in Sweden.

The market share of Tesla in France fell to around 1.6 percent in the first quarter. The market share of BYD and other Chinese electric car manufacturers rose to more than 3 percent. Tesla is expected to announce worldwide sales for the first quarter on Wednesday.

Drivers in the European Union again bought a Tesla in February much less than a year earlier. With just under 12,000 pieces, the number was almost half of the sales in February 2024, the European car industry organization ACEA reported last month.

As a result, sales at the American manufacturer, just like in January, clearly deviated from the overall trend within the EU market for electric cars, which shows a rising line.

Protests against Tesla

Lately there have been many protests against Musk. This is partly because the DOGE advisory body is implementing enormous cuts under his leadership with the US federal government. Musk also got involved in the German elections, expressing his support for the radical-right Afd.

Last Saturday there were demonstrations worldwide against the car brand through the Tesla Takedown protest movement. According to that action group, Musk breaks down democracy with the fortune he has earned at Tesla. The action group, which emphasizes to protest peacefully, calls on people to sell Tesla shares.

In a fire at a Tesla dealer in Rome, seventeen Tesla's were damaged on Monday. Musk labeled that fire as ""terrorism"". In earlier protests in the United States, Tesla's were set on fire and daubed. The Trump government called this domestic terrorism.

In the US, the range of second -hand Tesla's rises

The number of second -hand Tesla's offered in the US has risen by 33 percent since the beginning of this year, according to data from the Marktplaats Autotrader, which have been analyzed by the American Cox Automotive.

According to Cox, the increase in the number of second -hand Tesla's offered can be partly explained by the impact that the behavior of CEO Elon Musk has on the brand.

On March 16, 11,515 Tesla's were offered on the American version of Autotrader, an increase of 33 percent compared to the beginning of the year, when 8,500 Tesla's were for sale, a report on the first quarter of 2025 showed that Cox Automotive presented on Wednesday.

The increase is largely coincidental with the overall increase of 27 percent in second -hand electric cars on the American occasion market. In relation, the number of second -hand Tesla's is quite low, because in total there were around 2.18 million used cars for sale in America in February, according to figures from Cox Automotive.

Yet there is a connection between the behavior of Elon Musk and the brand perception of consumers on Tesla, says chief analyst Stephanie Valdeze Streaty of Cox Automotive.

""It cannot be denied that Elon Musk is an influential factor, whose actions influence the image and sale of the brand. Only time will learn whether Tesla can successfully navigate through this critical period and find a new engine for growth.""",businessinsider

Business Insider gives an overview of the taxes that Trump has already introduced and what is still on the role.

Read also: Trump: Revenue import tariffs will apply to all countries that lay on American goods

US President Donald Trump has named ""Liberation Day"" next Wednesday 2 April and will then introduce a large -scale package of import duties.



""We have been scammed for decades and abused by every country in the world, both friend and enemy,"" wrote Trump on social media in March. ""It is finally time for the good ol USA to get some of that money and respect back. God bless America !!!""



According to Trump, the tariff plan that he will announce on Wednesday on ""Liberation Day"" will no longer be limited to a group of ten to fifteen countries "". This means that the trade war enters a new phase.



But what is after all the threat against Canada, Mexico, the EU and China, the postponement and nevertheless introducing import duties at surprising moments in the run -up to ""Liberation Day""?



Business Insider gives an overview of taxes that Trump has introduced and plans that are still in the making.

In the table below of the American Tax Foundation, a concise overview of all measures provides up to and including 25 March. We will elaborate on this by country and region below.

Mexico and Canada: American import duties up to 25%

On 1 February, Trump announced import duties of 25 percent on Mexican and Canadian goods that would enter on 4 February. But he postponed it almost immediately after a month. But on March 4 they went into a part a few days later.



Trump believes that his neighboring countries still do too little to prevent drug smuggling. ""There are still drugs from Canada and Mexico in very high and unacceptable quantities in our country,"" he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.

It concerns 25 percent levies on Mexican and Canadian goods (and 10 percent for Canadian oil), but for goods that fall between the US, Canada and Mexico, there is still an exemption for the time being. And also for cars and car parts. It is expected that those levies on 'Liberation Day' will still take effect on 2 April.

The value of the goods that are affected can amount to $ 253 billion for Canada and up to $ 236 billion for Mexico.

The new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has warned Trump to come up with counter -taxes on 2 April if the US still makes the full package of taxes in force. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum opts for a strategy of pragmatism and patience and will first analyze what Trump comes with.

European Union: Levents on steel, aluminum and cars

On 26 February, Trump announced import duties of 25 percent on steel and aluminum from the European Union and on a number of specific products made of it, such as fitness equipment, stainless steel washbasins and air conditioners.

In addition, an American tax on cars and car parts is being made for the EU, which must start on 2 April.



Trump has taken a lot of time to Europe. ""The European Union was established to sew the United States. That was the goal,"" he said at a press conference. ""They did their job well, but now I am president.""



The EU subsequently announced a package of targeted relatives on, among other things, engines, jeans and whiskey that will take effect on 1 April. ""We greatly regret this measure,"" said Ursula von der Leyen, chairman of the European Commission. ""They are bad for business, but even worse for the consumer."" Yet she thinks that a reaction to the American taxes could not be kept.



In the course of April, another package of additional taxes worth $ 18 billion will come into effect. Depending on where Trump comes on 'Liberation Day', the EU is planning to take even more measures.

China: American import duties of 20%

On 1 February, Trump also announced import duties for China with the import duties for Mexico and Canada. But unlike his neighboring countries, the 10 percent taxes on Chinese goods did enter directly on the announced date of 4 February. And they were later raised to 20 percent.

China then said ""to play with it"" if the US wants to wage a trade or rate war and announced counter-duties. This concerns import duties of 15 percent on, among other things, chicken, wheat, corn and cotton from the US and 10 percent for beef and pork, fruit and vegetables, dairy products and soybeans.



Trump hinted last week to relieve the economic sanctions against China if Beijing would agree to the sale of the American activities of Tiktok, but China rejected that offer.

Cars on cars

Last week Trump chose to increase the trade war considerably further by announcing import duties on all cars made outside the United States. Those taxes must go on on 'Liberation Day' and will then actually be charged from 2 April. The White House expects to collect around 100 billion dollars in extra income annually.



Large car brands such as the German Volkswagen, the Japanese Toyota and the South Korean Hyundai will be struck considerably. The European Commission, Japan and South Korea are therefore trying to convince Trump to withdraw his plans or at least mitigate.



""Global uncertainties grow and South Korean car companies are not only in their struggle,"" said the South Korean minister Ahn Duk-Geun of Industry last week.

What more to expect on Liberation Day?

Trump has already announced that the exceptions that are still in force for certain Mexican and Canadian products will no longer apply from 2 April and that the import duties on cars made outside the US will then go into. There will also be probably taxes on medicines, computer chips and wood.



Trump has said earlier that he wants to tackle the whole world in one go by imposing taxes on all countries that on balance have a tax on American products and thereby speaks of ""reciprocal import duties"".



What exactly that package will look like and how high the rates will be is still unclear, but Trump hinted last week that they will be lower than expected. ""I think people will be pleasantly surprised,"" he said. ""In many cases it will be lower than the rate that they have been imposing for us for decades. We have not been treated fairly by other countries, but we will show our best side.""



White house spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Monday to the question whether there will be exceptions to farmers that there are ""no exceptions at the moment"". ""Every country that the American people have treated unfairly can expect a counter rate on Wednesday,"" she said without giving further details.



But regardless of what Trump comes with, the consensus among economists is that no one benefits from a worldwide trade war. ""This game only knows losers,"" President Klaas Knot of De Nederlandsche Bank told Buitenhof in February. ""The global economy has brought us a lot of prosperity, but the consumer will pay for this"".",businessinsider

With this, inflation is still considerably above the target of an inflation of approximately 2 percent, which is used for the eurozone.

Inflation remains at a relatively high level in the Netherlands, from slightly below 4 percent. That is almost double the 2 percent inflation that the European Central Bank strives for the eurozone.

The prices rose slightly less rapidly in March than in the previous month, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) announced on Tuesday based on a first estimate. Inflation was 3.7 percent, compared to 3.8 percent in February.

Gas, electricity and gasoline became cheaper. Prices for food, alcoholic beverages and tobacco also rose less than a month earlier. But services, for example a visit to the hairdresser, the café or the theater, rose a little faster in price than in February.

Inflation in the Netherlands has been considerably higher in recent months than the average of the eurozone.

Inflation in the eurozone fell to 2.2 percent on an annual basis in March, of 2.3 percent in February, the European statistics agency Eurostat reported on Tuesday based on a quick estimate. This brings inflation closer and closer to the objective of 2 percent that the European Central Bank (ECB) has.

The figure corresponds to the expectations of economists. The core inflation in the euro area, in which the fluctuating prices for energy, food, alcohol and tobacco are not included, decreased to 2.4 percent, from 2.6 percent in February.

Dutch inflation remains high due to rise wages and higher excise duties

Dutch inflation based on the European calculation method was 3.4 percent last month. In February that was 3.5 percent.

The European Central Bank aims to keep inflation in the eurozone at 2 percent. Viewed over the entire euro area, that goal is in sight, but in the Netherlands inflation will probably remain higher than the average in the coming years, the Nederlandsche Bank warned at the end of last year.

The light weakening is mainly due to pressure on new export orders.

It seems that the geopolitical tensions concerning the trade policy of US President Trump play a role in this.

The international trade tensions surrounding the policy of US President Donald Trump seem to get some influence on Dutch industry.

The activity in Dutch industry was shrunk again in March, after stabilization was still on display in February after months of shrinkage. The production went up, but the new orders decreased slightly.

The Dutch Purchasing Management Association (NEVI) reports this.

According to the Nevi, the so -called purchasing managers index, the indicator for industrial activity, fell to a position of 49.6 last month. That was exactly 50 in February. A score of 50 or more indicates growth and a lower level indicates contraction of the activity.

Export weakened by geopolitical tensions and uncertainty

The researchers state that the decrease in new orders is partly due to a weak international sale that fell further and to a greater extent in March. These poorer export conditions are attributed to market uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. With his trade policy and import duties, US President Donald Trump, for example, ensures uncertainty in the financial markets.

The partial index for new orders was 49.8 points in March, while the sub -index for new export orders was slightly lower at 48 points.

The Nevi also reports that there were also signs of overcapacity and too large stocks. As a result, companies pruned into the workforce and the amount of material purchased to cut back. The outlook for the production range for the next twelve months remained positive, but fell to a level below the long -term average, according to the Zeist association.

""After a small increase in the previous month, the number of new orders fell again, but only to a very small extent.

The market share thus increased to 35.3 percent.

This means that the electric car does not yet come close to the hybrid cars, because it continues to perform unprecedentedly strong with almost half of the market share.

Mixed image at Selling Tesla

Yet this time Tesla stands out in the list. Despite all the negative reports about the decline in the sale of the electric cars due to the behavior of Elon Musk, the image is mixed. The sale increased in March compared to a month earlier, although it must be considered that it was not corrected for the difference in sales days between February and March. Where barely 1,000 Tesla's were put in name in February, the total in March amounted to 1,536 pieces.

If you look on an annual basis, the sales of Tesla were approximately 60 percent lower in March this year than in March 2024.

For the first three months of this year, the sales of Tesla were limited to 3,443 pieces. In the first quarter of 2024, 6,852 Musk mobiles went to new owners. On an annual basis, therefore, there is roughly halving.

In the United States, people opposed to Elon Musk's political advancement has gathered at Tesla showrooms everywhere to raise public protests.

Musk is a senior adviser to the Trump administration and is making major changes to the federal government.

Those who speak out in the protest say they fear that Musk's influence will threaten democracy and will hit the middle class and minorities.

On the morning of March 29th, I saw nearly 400 people gather outside a Tesla showroom in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and speak out in protest. They each carry flags and placards, and said they felt that American democracy was under siege.

""Elon Musk, leave,"" the protesters repeated, moving back and forth down the sidewalk outside the showroom. And the placards were held high — including handwritten caricatures, digital graphics, and slogans aimed at Elon Musk and the Trump administration.

Afterwards, I went to see the protests taking place outside a shopping mall in Troy, Michigan, which also houses a Tesla showroom. There were around 150 participants, which was smaller than the Ann Arbor demonstrations, but the liveliness was far higher.

I realized. Both Ann Arbor and Troy were white people over the age of 65, and retired from publicly funded jobs, including teachers, local university professors and social workers.

Politically, they are left-leaning people. Some called themselves ""anti-Trump,"" ""anti-Republican,"" and ""pro-democracy.""

Some people said they changed from Republican support to Democrats when they were younger. However, it turns out that they are as disillusioned with the Democrats as they are as stunned by the Trump administration.

""I'm not satisfied with the Democrats either,"" said James Morse, 77, an Indivisible member who attended the Ann Arbor demonstration. Indivisible is a grassroots organization with progressive goals and also contributed to attracting participants for the demonstration on the 29th.

""It's an extraordinary situation. We need to put more pressure on us. It's not normal. We have to resist in every way,"" Morse said.

It's not just the ""left side"" that is concerned about the Trump administration. ""The Republican Party has always made sense, but now it just seems unreasonable,"" said centrist Margaret Bielekki, 68.

U.S. Space Force photo by Airman 1st Class Olga Houtsma

The Golden Dome missile defense initiative proposed by US President Trump, but it is still a mystery as to what the project will be.

Both traditional and new defense companies are aiming for opportunities within the ""Golden Dome"" concept.

There is a debate that the project should focus on a variety of threats besides missiles.

While US President Trump is visioning the Golden Dome as a next-generation missile defense, defense-related companies are seeing another opportunity as attention is focused on repelling threats to the country.

It remains to be seen what specific project the Golden Dome concept will be, but industrial partners are interested in whether it will include unconventional systems such as drone capabilities and electronic warfare. The Golden Dome concept is focused not only on traditional defense-related companies, but also on startups and small and medium-sized enterprises.

Lockheed Martin, a well-known for its integrated missile defense, said he is ""ready to respond to the call."" Other major defense companies, such as RTX and Northrop Grumman, have also expressed interest in the project. However, these large companies are not the only ones looking for opportunities.

Virginia-based defense company BlueHalo has ultimately said that the project, which has already been set to become a massive business as the Trump administration seeks to effectively revive the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), will ultimately say that ""the defense industry foundation needs to do its best to succeed.""

Speaking to Business Insider, BlueHalo CEO Jonathan Moneymaker said the comprehensive Goldendome will be able to respond to any threat with support from all sectors of the defense technology and AI industry.

BlueHalo is developing a cost-effective anti-drone system among a variety of defense technologies. The company has developed a pallet-type high-power laser (P-HEL) system for the Army that uses directional energy and AI to eliminate drones, working on the next-generation anti-drone missiles they have recently tested.

""A wide range of threat vectors""

Moneymaker said the defense industry needs more clear information to embark on the ""Golden Dome."" At this point there are still many questions about how large and scope the White House would want to make this.

This is not the only factor that is uncertain. Organizations such as the US Northern Army (NORTHCOM), Space Force (SPACECOM), and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) may all have different requirements and levels of ownership, which will pose a question of where they are responsible. Other major institutions must also have a thorough discussion of how the inclusion of electronic warfare and signal intelligence (SIGINT) works in the US and how it balances citizens' rights to privacy.",businessinsider

トランプ米大統領は3月26日、日本を含む全ての国から輸入する自動車に25％の関税を課すことを命じる大統領令に署名した。

従来の関税2.5％（トラックは25％）に上乗せして合計27.5％（同50％）の輸入関税がかかることになる。

エンジンやトランスミッションなど基幹部品も50％の課税対象とされた。

自動車関税の発動は4月3日から。その影響が経済指標などを通じて確認され、評価が固まってくるまでに少なくとも数カ月から半年はかかるだろう。

トランプ大統領は今回の措置について、恒久的なもので「例外措置について交渉することに興味はない」と断言している。ディールのためのカードではないとの宣言だ。

就任演説における「今後4年間でアメリカを製造業の超大国にする」との発言が本心ならば、アメリカ国内における生産や雇用を数量的に押し上げるために今後もこのような方策が連続的に打ち出されてくるだろう。

一方、日本を含む世界の自動車メーカーは、今回の追加関税が生産コストの増加や販売価格の上昇につながり、最終的には販売台数の減少に至るとの懸念を抱いており、おそらくその認識は（程度はともかく）正しいのではないか。

とは言え、アメリカにおいて輸入車が支持を得ている理由は価格ではなく、単に製品自体の競争力の問題というのが一般的理解であり、真っ当に考えれば今回の措置は「勝者なき関税」に終わる可能性が高い。

OECD試算はもはや穏当すぎる状況

第二次トランプ政権による一連の関税政策の影響は、経済協力開発機構（OECD）が3月17日に発表した経済見通しに端的に盛り込まれている。

トランプ政権の関税政策を織り込んだ2025年の世界経済の成長率見通しは、前回発表（2024年12月）の3.3％から3.1％へと0.2％ポイント下方修正された。

自動車関税に先んじて25％の追加関税発動（3月4日）に至ったメキシコおよびカナダの見通しは、それぞれ2.5％ポイント（前回1.2％から今回-1.3％）、1.3％ポイント（同2.0％から0.7％）と引き下げられた。

なお、鉄鋼とアルミニウムを対象に25％の関税を課された日本も0.4％ポイント（同1.5％から1.1％）下方修正された。

OECDは今回の経済見通しで、今後関税10％のかけ合いに至った場合、各国の国内総生産（GDP）およびインフレ率にどれほどの影響があるのかも試算している。その結果が下の【図表1】だ。

【図表1】関税10％のかけ合いが発生した場合のシミュレーション。各国の実質GDPおよびインフレ率への影響（3年間の累積効果）を基本シナリオからのかい離（％ポイント）で示した。 出所：経済開発協力機構（OECD）資料より筆者作成

一目瞭然のように「インフレは上振れ、成長率は下振れ」し、スタグフレーション（景気低迷の中での物価高）の様相が強まる可能性をOECD試算は示唆している。

ただし、この試算には注意すべき点がある。

本稿執筆時点で判明している状況を整理すると、中国に対して一律関税20％、メキシコとカナダに対して一律関税25％、全ての国に対して鉄鋼・アルミニウムおよび自動車を対象に関税25％がすでに発動されている。

つまり、10％の関税かけ合いというOECD試算の前提はもはや穏当とさえ言えるもので、今となってはそれよりはるかに大きな下押し圧力を想定して、先の展開を見通すべき状況ということだ。

特に日本にとって、自動車に対する関税25％の除外対象とならなかったことは深刻な問題だ。

自動車は対米輸出の3割を占める。従来の11倍という関税により収益性が低下する中で、採算が合わない車種などは対米輸出の抑制や停止が検討される可能性は十分あり、そうなれば生産や雇用などの面で日本経済を圧迫することになるだろう。

インフレとデフレの狭間で日銀は…

アメリカの自動車関税発動にはもう交渉の余地がないのだろうか。

現在入手可能な情報に基づく限りでは再交渉は難しそうだ。しかし、朝令暮改が珍しくないトランプ政権だけに、事態は流動的と見ておくのが賢明そうだ。

現時点で確実に言えるのは、日銀の政策運営が一段と窮屈になったということだろう。

自動車関税が本当に恒久的な措置になるとすれば、日本経済にとってはこの上ない下押し圧力であり、（景気の下押し効果を伴う）追加利上げを踏みとどまらせる材料として十分だ。

長い目で見れば、米国のみならず日本経済にとってもデフレ（物価下落）誘発的な材料と言える。

ところが、前節のOECD試算でも確認したように、トランプ政権の関税政策とそれに対する各国の報復関税は数年単位でインフレを上振れさせる材料と理解されている。

すなわち、ここで見逃してはならないのは、関税には「短期ではインフレ誘発的、長期ではデフレ誘発的」という二面性があることだ。

日本は今や、欧米諸国の消費者物価指数（CPI）の伸びをしのぐインフレに直面しており、半年に一度程度のペースで利上げを継続（して物価上昇をコントロール）するのが基本路線だろう【図表2】。

【図表2】日米欧の消費者物価指数（CPI、前年比％）の推移。 出所：Bloomberg資料より筆者作成

そうは言っても、2025年後半から2026年にかけて自動車関税の影響が日米の経済指標を圧迫する展開が可視化されてきた場合、日銀は上述の二面性を踏まえた上で利上げを続けられるだろうか。筆者の目には難しく映る。

日本の自動車産業への影響

もちろん、いかに剛腕で予測不能なトランプ政権とて、国民からの不満が大きい政策をいつまでも持続できるかどうかは分からない。

発表済みの関税政策を一部撤収する可能性も十分あるため、現時点で2026年以降の見通しや対策を突き詰めることは労多くして功少なしと思われる。

2025年に限って言えば、関税のもたらすインフレ効果に対して、日銀の利上げ路線は（物価上昇を抑制する文脈で）整合的なので、金利やその円相場への影響について見通しを大きく修正する必要はなさそうだ。

一方、OECD試算が示す通り、輸入製品に転嫁された関税を支払う（すなわち消費者が支払う）当事国であるアメリカは大きなインフレ圧力に見舞われるため、米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は景気を刺激して物価上昇を促す利下げには動きにくくなるだろう。

結果として米金利は高止まりを続け、円安局面が温存される公算は大きくなる。追加関税のネガティブ効果が（円安による輸出促進効果で）ある程度相殺されるため、日本の自動車産業にとっては不幸中の幸いと言える。

欧州、特にドイツは苦境

逆に最も苦しい状況に陥りそうなのがユーロ圏、とりわけドイツだ。

国防やインフラへの巨額投資をまとめた欧州再軍備計画の発表を受け、ユーロ圏の経済・金融情勢についてはややポジティブな受け止めが広がり、米国と欧州の金利差は縮小、ユーロ／ドル相場は3月に入ってから急伸して（つまりユーロ高が進んで）いる【図表3】。

【図表3】米独2年金利差（橙）とユーロ／ドル相場（青）の推移。点線（黒）はユーロとドルの両替レートが同一になるパリティ（等価）。 出所：Bloomberg資料より筆者作成

ドイツにとっては、折からのエネルギーコストの高騰、トランプ政権による追加関税、さらにユーロ高と「三重苦」とも言える現状がある。

ロシア・ウクライナ戦争を背景とする天然ガス価格高騰の影響などで苦境が続いたユーロ圏経済にもようやく復調が確認され始めたところだが、そこに自動車関税がどれほど響いてくるのか、現時点で言えることは多くない。

アメリカにとっても、ドイツ車を追加関税によって競争上不利に追い込んだところで、国産車の代替需要がストレートに増えるとはあまり考えられず、むしろ消費者が自動車購入を控えるようになることで業界全体の沈没に至る展開の方が容易く想像できる。

現在50代のある人物は、リモート勤務のフルタイム職をひそかに6つ掛け持ちし、2025年に80万ドル（約1億1990万円）を稼ぐことを目標にしている。

彼は、ほかの人を雇って、自分の仕事の大部分を代わりにしてもらっている。2023年には32万ドル（約4800万円）の利益をあげたという。

ハリソン（Harrison）は、リモート勤務の6つの仕事を掛け持ちしているが、ときどきミーティングの時間がぶつかってしまうことがある。どうやって解決しているのかと言うと、誰かに金を払って、自分のふりをしてもらうのだ。

「その人は最新の情報を知っていて、声もどことなく私と似ています」とハリソンは話す。そして、自分が出るミーティングでは、たいていカメラをオンにする必要はない、とつけ加えた。Business Insiderはハリソンの身元を確認しているが、仕事に影響が出るおそれを理由に、偽名を使うよう求められた。

IT分野の品質保証を専門とするハリソンは、7人の働き手からなるチームを組織している。ひそかに掛け持ちしている複数のフルタイム職を維持するのを助けてくれるチームだ。

ハリソンは2025年、雇用条件が変わらなければ、80万ドルを稼ぎ、そのうちおよそ25万ドル（約3750万円）をチームに支払う見込みだ。ハリソンの稼ぎは、時給にして25～30ドル（約3750～4500円）くらいになる。

自分が雇うチームに報酬を払ったあとの利益は32万ドルほどだった、とハリソンは見積もっている。2024年には、9つもの職を掛け持ちし、チームへの報酬を支払ったあとの利益は推定50万ドル（約7495万円）を超えたという。申告が終われば、もっとはっきりわかるはずだ。

「以前は、上司とか、株式市場での損失とか、請求書とか、子どもの学費とかにぴりぴりしていました」とハリソンは話す。

「仕事を掛け持ちするようになって大きく変わったのは、あまりぴりぴりしなくなったことです。何かがうまくいかなくても、それでおしまいということにはなりませんからね」

Business Insiderは過去3年にわたり、20人超の「過剰就業者」を取材してきた。過剰就業者とは、収入を増やして職の安定を高めるために、複数の職を掛け持ちする人たちのことだ。

ハリソンは、職を掛け持ちする人のなかでも、自分の仕事の一部、もしくはほとんどをしてもらうために他の人を雇うという、さらに少数のグループに属する。そうした傾向は、リモートワーク革命、世界規模のソーシャルネットワーク、仕事の外注を可能にするソフトウェアツールの利用増加に後押しされている。

雇用主の承認を得ずに複数の職を掛け持ちすると、職業上の悪影響が出かねないし、バーンアウト（燃え尽き症候群）につながるおそれもあることは確かだ。また、ホワイトカラー業界のオフィス回帰命令や雇用の減速により、リモートの職を得るのが難しくなっている。

4人が仕事をこなし、2人が新しい仕事を探す

ハリソンは2018年ごろ、リモート勤務の仕事を2つ始めた。パンデミックが襲来し、リモート職が豊富になると、3つ目と4つ目の仕事もこっそり掛け持ちするようになった。

すぐに仕事量が手に負えなくなったので、フリーランスのプラットフォーム「Upwork（アップワーク）」を使って、自分の仕事を代わりにしてもらう、信頼できそうな適任者を探した。

大勢の候補者の面接を経て、少しずつチーム（ハリソンが従業員と呼ぶメンバー）を築き、さらに多くの仕事を引き受けた。ハリソンの下で働く人たちは、アメリカ、カナダ、インド、パキスタンに在住している。

UpworkはBusiness Insiderに対し、雇用契約に違反することは同社のポリシーに反していると話した。Upworkプラットフォームに掲載された求人情報のなかで、違反にあたる内容が明示的に書かれている場合にはしかるべき措置をとるという。

ハリソンは、1日のほとんどの時間を、仕事上のミーティングと、チームの仕事のレビューに費やしている。労働時間を合計すると、だいたい週に40時間くらいになるという。

「従業員」のうち4人は、ハリソンの職務を履行する。ハリソンの義理のきょうだいである別のひとりが、業務管理を手伝ったり、ミーティングに代わりに出たりする。

Gold Prices and the Trump Administration: What is the Necessity of a New Investment Strategy?,https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2503-gold-record-rally-trump-tariffs-trade-war-uncertainty-investing-strategy/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:40:00 GMT","



「今後4年間、つまり、この政権が続く間は、ポートフォリオに多様性を持たせることは利益を生み続けるだろう」とUBSグローバル・ウェルス・マネジメント（UBS Global Wealth Management）の投資責任者、ウェイン・ゴードン（Wayne Gordon）氏は直近のインタビューで語っている。

だが、トランプ大統領が世界貿易政策の再構築を臨んでいることだけが、金価格を押し上げているわけではない。事実、金の上昇は2024年の米大統領選の前から起きている。金価格はトランプ氏の勝利が明らかになると一旦落ち着き、その後、関税の議論が再燃したことで再び上昇に転じた。

「2重構造になっている。直近の上昇はリスクヘッジやテールリスク（極端な事態）に備えた金融資金の流入によるものだろう。一方、最初の上昇は2024年の取り引きの継続だった」とステート・ストリート・グローバル・アドバイザーズ（State Street Global Advisors）の金戦略責任者、アーカシュ・ドシ（Aakash Doshi）氏は述べた。同氏は金は上昇を続けると考えている。

さらに複数の専門家は、米国の財政赤字が国の巨額な債務を増大させているという長年の問題への関心の高まりが、金の魅力を一段と高めていると指摘した。現在、米国政府の債務は36.6兆ドル（5490兆円）という途方もない額に達しており、実質的なドル価値を下げ、債務負担を軽くするために、意図的にインフレを容認する動きが生まれやすくなっている。

金価格（青）は過去30年、米国の債務の増加と相関関係にある。 abrdn (Aberdeen Investments)

「理論的には、債務が増えるほど、ドルの価値は下がる」とアバディーン・インベストメンツ（Aberdeen Investments）のETF投資戦略ディレクター、ロバート・ミンター（Robert Minter）氏は述べた。

「つまり、金が上昇しているというより、ドルが下落している」

さらにウクライナ侵攻後にロシアなどの敵対国に制裁を課していることを考えると、敵対国の政府が（アメリカが）コントロールできない通貨を求めることは納得できる。

「中央銀行の人たち誰も、米国が彼らの国の利益のことを考えてくれているなどと思っていない」と、カタリスト・ファンド（Catalyst Funds）の最高投資責任者、デビッド・ミラー（David Miller）氏は述べた。

「非同盟国の中央銀行にとって、金はドルよりも優れた準備資産となるのはきわめて理にかなっている。こうした国々は、以前からドルを準備資産として欲していたわけではない」

ミンター氏は、特に国のリーダーが貿易交渉で公然と米国に敵対的な態度を取っている場合、そうした国は米国に依存することを望まないだろうとの意見に同意した。だから同氏は、中央銀行は金を購入し続け、個人投資家も一部はETFを通じて、そうした動きに続くと予想している。

金ブームに乗るには

金はすでに大幅に上昇しているが、地政学的・経済的な不確実性によって供給が抑えられ、需要が急増するなか、関係者は金はまださらに上昇すると考えている。

その予想が正しければ、投資家は金を直接購入したり、金EFTなどで間接的に投資したり、金鉱山会社の株を狙ったり、あるいはそれらを組み合わせることで、金に投資できる。

これらの選択肢のうち、金鉱山会社の株は最も不安定な投資先と考えられている。ニューモント（Newmont）やバリック・ゴールド（Barrick Gold）といった大手企業は、金価格の上昇に大きく遅れを取っており、過去最高値にはほど遠い。ミンター氏は金鉱山会社は30年で最高の利益をあげる可能性があると述べているが、ドシ氏は金鉱山会社の好調さは、通常、長続きしないと指摘している。

金を直接購入するか、金ETFなどを購入する方が良いとゴードン氏は述べた。同氏は、資産の少なくとも5％を金で保有することを勧めているが、もちろん、投資家の目標やリスク許容度、市場の状況によって異なる。ゴードン氏は戦略的なアプローチを取り、ポジションを必要に応じて売買する。

金は景気後退局面では、S&P500をシステム的に上回ることが証明されているとゴードン氏は述べた。しかし、5年前のパンデミックのときに見られたように、下落した株を買い増すために、当初は金が売られることもある。

「もし金を保有しているなら、そのメリットを最大限に享受してほしい。つまり、分散投資の効果だけでなく、必要なときにいつでも、流動性の高い市場で金を売却し、現金化できるメリットも享受してほしい」

それでもまだ、誰もが金に楽観的なわけではない。

ブラックストーン・コミュニティ・グループのマジュード氏は、昨年は金に対してきわめて強気だったが、ここまでの大幅な上昇を考慮すると、短期的には懐疑的だと述べた。

マジュード氏は、地政学的リスクに対して、金は優れたヘッジ手段であるとの強気派の見解に同意しているが、急激な上昇を警戒して、2600〜2700ドルの水準で保有を減らし始めたと語った。高値づかみを避けるために、多少の上昇余地を逃しても構わないと考えている。

""There is a sense of concern that while overseas countries continue to create new industries and grow through both research and social implementation, Japan is falling a little behind in this regard.""

At a press conference held at Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo on March 28th, Mitsubishi Corporation President Nakanishi Katsuya spoke of Japan's sense of crisis:

On the same day, Mitsubishi Corporation announced a donation of 600 million yen to the University of Tokyo. It not only contributes funds, but also provides human resources resources and industrial knowledge and networks that it has cultivated globally as a general trading company, supporting Tokyo University's startup creation, discovering technical seeds, and implementing socially.

The background to this is the expectation for universities to create new industries, which could be a future business for Mitsubishi Corporation.

The technology that lies at Tokyo University is digging up

Through a donation of 600 million yen, Mitsubishi Corporation will support the establishment of the Tech Incubation Palette, a program that will in-depth support the exploration and commercialization of technology seeds for research and development-based (deeptech) startups at the University of Tokyo. The period is 2025-2028 (scheduled).

The University of Tokyo boasts the highest track record in creating university-based startups in Japan. The cumulative number of startups is 577 (at the end of March 2024), and 27 of these have reached IPOs. M&A has achieved certain results with 66 companies (see the diagram below).

The total number of Tokyo University-related ventures is 577. The University of Tokyo is working to create more startups. Photo: Mitsumura Takashi

The university has also established an ecosystem that supports startups and business promotion from a fairly early stage. In fact, there are systems such as practice of entrepreneurship education for students and researchers, the establishment of incubation facilities, specialized organizations that support intellectual property strategies, and external collaboration such as related VCs.

However, President Fujii Teruo of the University of Tokyo pointed out that the University of Tokyo's startup ecosystem is still ""developing"" compared to the world. In particular, in order to realize the University of Tokyo's goal of ""creating 300 startups per year over the next 10 years,"" the company is said to lack experience in terms of knowledge about entrepreneurship and identifying market needs.

This new programme will be established at the University of Tokyo to support the exploration of pre-enterprise technical seeds that lie within the university. In addition, we will provide comprehensive and comprehensive support across the university, including matching technical seeds with entrepreneurs, starting up support, support for PoC and intellectual property strategies, collaboration with previously distributed support programs, and support for applications for VCs and gap funds.

This is the first initiative at the University of Tokyo to provide a cross-university technology discovery and entrepreneurial support program in collaboration with private companies.

The programme will be headed by Vice President of Tokyo University Someya Takao, and will build support teams for each field, such as space and semiconductors. The support team is expected to be around 10, and it is also expected to utilize private human resources with industry knowledge.

All operating expenses will be covered by donations from Mitsubishi Corporation. In addition to funding, Mitsubishi Corporation will also provide global industrial knowledge and networks that it has accumulated as a general trading company through its Corporate Planning Department, as needed.",businessinsider

「M&Aでスタートアップが買われた場合には、比較的短期間で社長を辞めてしまうケースが多い。 ただ私にとっても『多くの社長はここで折れるんだな』と痛感するような、苦しい期間だった」（YOUR MEAL・須藤大輔CEO）

国内最大手の精製糖メーカー・DM三井製糖は2025年3月、ボディメイクなどに特化した冷凍宅配サービスを展開する「マッスルデリ」を手掛けるスタートアップ、YOUR MEAL（ユアミール）の全株式を取得し、100％子会社化した。

約1年半前の2023年8月、DM三井製糖はユアミールの株式の過半数を購入し、すでに子会社化していたが、さらに買い足し100％の株を保有した形だ。株式取得額は公開していない。

なぜ、大企業とスタートアップは「100％子会社」という道を選んだのか？ ユアミール、そしてDM三井製糖、それぞれの思惑を取材した。

「大企業のシナジー」に期待したものの……

ユアミールCEOの須藤大輔氏（左）。 撮影：横山耕太郎

約1年半前、DM三井製糖に株を売却し子会社になったユアミール。それまで渋谷区のマンションの1室だったユアミールのオフィスは、JR田町駅から徒歩数分、11階建てのDM三井製糖の自社ビルに移転した。

一等地の自社ビルに入居し、2024年度の売上高は1700億円を超える企業の傘下入りを果たしたユアミール。スタートアップの出口戦略として一つの「成功」に見えたM&Aだった。

しかし、ユアミールCEOの須藤大輔氏の目に写ったDM三井製糖は、典型的な大企業だったという。

DM三井製糖 YOUR MEAL 売上高 1707億円（2024年3月期） 非公開 社員数 1462人（2024年3月） 12人（2025年3月） 設立 1947年（湘南糖化工業設立） 2016年 主な事業 ・精製糖の製造、販売 ・栄養療法食品やスポーツ領域で 新規事業展開を目指す ・冷凍宅配弁当 ・高タンパクなコーヒーや パンも開発

「新規参入の少ない業界で、かつ財閥系の企業。組織は縦割りで保守的。現状で利益が出ている状況が続き、新しいチャレンジが起きにくい風土があった」（須藤氏）

須藤氏率いるユアミールにとっては、「大企業とのシナジー」を期待しての傘下入りだったが、現実は甘くなかった。

これまでは迅速に意思決定できていた、マーケティングや商品開発などへの投資も、子会社化された後は、多くのケースでDM三井製糖側の了解を得る必要があった。ユアミールとして新たにM＆Aも検討していたが「スタートアップなら1カ月で決められることが1年かかった」ことで、結局実現できずに終わった。

「親会社であるDM三井製糖から事業投資のための資金を得るのが難しい状況が続いた。これまでの1年半、ユアミールとしての成長は明らかに鈍化し、苦しい時期だった」（須藤氏）

こうした状況を打開するため、須藤さん側が熱望したのが「100％の子会社化」だった。

完全にDM三井製糖の指揮命令下に入ることで、より早い意思決定が可能になり、決定権も得られるようになると考え、傘下入りしてから数カ月後には、須藤氏はDM三井製糖側に対し100％子会社化を提案していたという。

DM三井製糖の傘下に入り苦戦が続いていた須藤氏を支えたのが、DM三井製糖のライフ・エナジー事業開発本部の奥野雅浩氏だった。

奥野氏はM＆Aを含めた新規事業開発の責任者であり、買収後のPMI（買収後の統合）を進める役割も担っている。

ユアミールの100％子会社化に時間がかかった理由について奥野氏は、「まずはユアミールを買収したことによる成果を明確に説明する必要があったからだ」と話す。

子会社化による「成果」として奥野氏が目を付けたのが、「出向社員の成長」と「マーケティングによるシナジー」だった。

2023年8月にユアミールの株を取得して以降、DM三井製糖から25歳〜39歳の5人の社員を出向させていた。出向した前後で、彼らの働き方は劇的に変わったという。

「同年代のユアミールの社員が、営業や事業開発でリーダー的な役割を担う姿に衝撃を受けたはず。出向前は『私に務まるでしょうか』と自信のない様子だった社員でも、誰の目にみても生き生きと働くようになった」（奥野氏）

もう一つの成果は、DM三井製糖の既存商品の販売において、ユアミールのマーケティング手法を取り入れた結果、売り上げが急増したことだった。

2024年4月から持続性エネルギー源「ピュアパラ」シリーズをDM三井製糖からユアミールに販売を移管した。ユアミールがブランドコンセプトの再設定や顧客とのコミュニケーション戦略、Amazonや楽天などの販売ページの改修などに取り組んだところ、移管直後の5月の売り上げは昨年同月比162%に伸び、単月として過去最高の売り上げになった。その後、2024年12月の売り上げも同361%に伸ばし、最高売上をさらに更新している。

「経営陣とは、こうした成果に加え、リスク管理も含めたガバナンス体制の状況を報告した。私も会社もスタートアップを扱うのは初めてで、必要な手続きの確認に時間がかかったが、やっと話がまとまった」（奥野氏）

Switzer Memorial Building, after it was reported that the Trump administration fired staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at the Food and Drug Administration, as it embarked on its plan to cut 10,000 jobs at HHS, in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 1, 2025.

Employees across the massive U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began receiving notices of dismissal on Tuesday in a major overhaul expected to ultimately lay off up to 10,000 people. The notices come just days after President Donald Trump moved to strip workers of their collective bargaining rights at HHS and other agencies throughout the government.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s announced a plan last week to remake HHS, which, through its agencies, is responsible for tracking health trends and disease outbreaks, conducting and funding medical research, monitoring the safety of food and medicine, and administering health insurance programs for nearly half of the country.

The plan would consolidate agencies that oversee billions of dollars for addiction services and community health centers across the country under a new office called the Administration for a Healthy America.

The layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff — 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington predicted the cuts will have ramifications when natural disasters strike or infectious diseases, like the ongoing measles outbreak, spread.

""They may as well be renaming it the Department of Disease because their plan is putting lives in serious jeopardy,"" Murray said Friday during a call with reporters.

Beyond layoffs at federal health agencies, cuts are beginning to happen at state and local health departments as a result of an HHS move last week to pull back more than $11 billion in COVID-19-related funds. Local and state health officials are still assessing the impact, but some health departments have already identified hundreds of jobs that stand to be eliminated because of lost funding, ""some of them overnight, some of them are already gone,"" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",cnbc

Newsmax shares have risen more than 1,500% since its Monday debut, when it opened at $14 per share. It closed at $233 per share on Tuesday.

The skyrocketing stock not only brought the company's market capitalization to nearly $30 billion — surpassing the market cap of legacy media companies like Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corp — it also propped up the returns of its investors.

Traditional media IPOs are hard to come by, especially given the significant changes to companies' business models in recent years, and Newsmax's meteoric debut was unexpected. The highly anticipated stock debut of CoreWeave on Friday — the biggest tech IPO since 2021 and first pure-play artificial intelligence offering — saw a tempered start in comparison.

Founder and CEO Christopher Ruddy, who owns roughly 39.2 million Class A shares of the company and 81.4% of voting stock, joined the billionaire ranks after the initial public offering. As of the market close, Ruddy's stake was worth more than $9 billion.

Interactive Brokers founder and billionaire Thomas Peterffy is Newsmax's second-largest shareholder with 23 million shares — worth more than $5 billion as of Tuesday — owned through a limited-liability company, Conyers Investments.

Peterffy invested $50 million in Newsmax in 2019, according to an individual familiar with the deal. He declined to comment on his investment to CNBC. Peterffy has appeared on Newsmax before and is a prominent GOP donor.

On Tuesday, Newsmax sent out an email to investors highlighting its stock rise on the opening day of trading.

""Americans for a long time have been voting with their remote controls, downloads, apps to say they want Newsmax. Now investors powerfully are buying Newsmax shares because they like us, they value us and they want us to keep growing,"" Ruddy said in a statement to CNBC.",cnbc

President Donald Trump is set Wednesday to begin the biggest gamble of his nascent second term, wagering that broad-based tariffs on imports will jumpstart a new era for the U.S. economy.

The stakes couldn't be higher.

As the president prepares his ""liberation day"" announcement, household sentiment is at multi-year lows. Consumers worry that the duties will spark another round of painful inflation, and investors are fretting that higher prices will mean lower profits and a tougher slog for the battered stock market.

What Trump is promising is a new economy not dependent on deficit spending, where Canada, Mexico, China and Europe no longer take advantage of the U.S. consumer's desire for ever-cheaper products.

The big problem right now is no one outside the administration knows quite how those goals will be achieved, and what will be the price to pay.

""People always want everything to be done immediately and have to know exactly what's going on,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, who served as a senior economic advisor during Trump's first term in office. ""Negotiations themselves don't work that way. Good things take time.""

For his part, LaVorgna, who is now chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, is optimistic Trump can pull it off, but understands why markets are rattled by the uncertainty of it all.

""This is a negotiation, and it needs to be judged in the fullness of time,"" he said. ""Eventually we're going to get some details and some clarity, and to me, everything will fit together. But right now, we're at that point where it's just too soon to know exactly what the implementation is likely to look like.""

Here's what we do know: The White House intends to implement ""reciprocal"" tariffs against its trading partners. In other words, the U.S. is going to match what other countries charge to import American goods into their countries. Most recently, a figure of 20% blanket tariffs has been bandied around, though LaVorgna said he expects the number to be around 10%, but something like 60% for China.

What is likely to emerge, though, will be far more nuanced as Trump seeks to reduce a record $131.4 billion U.S. trade deficit. Trump professes his ability to make deals, and the saber-rattling of draconian levies on other countries is all part of the strategy to get the best arrangement possible where more goods are manufactured domestically, boosting American jobs and providing a fairer landscape for trade.

The consequences, though, could be rough in the near term.",cnbc

Trump is expected to make major announcements related to trade policy on Wednesday. While the policy has not been officially unveiled as of Tuesday afternoon, the Washington Post reported that the president is considering a roughly 20% tariff on most imports. Uncertainty around the levies has sent markets into a tailspin. The S & P 500 dropped 4.6% in the first three months of 2025, marking its worst quarterly performance since 2022. Given this environment, Morgan Stanley screened for names that can mitigate the impact of tariffs through strategies like pricing power, foreign exchange hedging, stockpiling inventory or altering supply chains. Here's 10 names the firm found can handle the shift in policy: McDonald's is one name that made the list. The company is one of the internationally diverse and mainly franchised quick service chains that will be less impacted, given that they have global revenue and local suppliers. Shares of the Chicago-based company have jumped more than 8% in 2025, reversing course after falling in the prior year. The average analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and price target implying shares can rise more than 5% over the next year. While Yeti has manufacturing exposure to Mexico, it was still able to make the cut due to its ability to employ pricing power. The outdoor products maker has hit a rough patch, with shares dropping around 13% this year after tumbling more than 25% in 2025. While most Wall Street analysts have a hold, the typical analyst expects a rebound ahead, per LSEG. The average price target suggests more than 31% in upside. Martin Marietta is one industrial name that got a spot on the list. That's because the firm said it has pricing power, which it called the ""easiest and cheapest"" way to alleviate tariff pressures. The stock has slid nearly 7% in 2025. Despite that slide, most analysts polled by LSEG have a buy rating and price target projecting more than 28% in upside.

However, many remain skeptical that any real clarity is coming anytime soon. Stocks have been in turmoil this year, as investors struggle to price in the full breadth and depth of President Donald Trump's policies that are shifting the lines of global trade. The S & P 500 was last more than 8% off its all-time high, after falling into correction territory earlier this year. The Nasdaq Composite is more than 13% off its recent peak. A clear-enough blueprint from Trump when he takes to the Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon to announce his plan for reciprocal tariffs could give investors some much-needed certainty. But few expect that will be the end of it. ""Personally, I don't believe that if you just get a framework announced, no matter what it is, that's enough for a relief rally,"" said Gabriela Santos, chief market strategist for the Americas at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""I think you need a detailed framework, and you need there to be a certain amount of tariffs on a certain amount of countries for a certain amount of time for it to be able to be digested by the economy — and ultimately by the markets, which I think have only started to price this in,"" Santos said. There is hope of an April rebound for the stock market. The S & P 500 has done well in April when it's started the month below its 200-day moving average, according to Oppenheimer technical strategist Ari Wald. Typically, it averages a 2.5% advance for the month, and it's positive 73% of the time going back to 1950. The worst-case scenario But investors will need some key questions answered around trade policy, in addition to some reassurance that the economic picture is not as bad as feared, for the market to truly rebound from here. Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, worries that a ""maximalist"" approach to tariff policy from the Trump administration — meaning a tariff on all 15 countries the U.S. has a persistent trade deficit with — would bring the average tariff rate to over 16%, from 10.5%, where he said it's currently projected to go to. In 2024, the tariff money collected as a share of total imports equaled 2.5%, according to the Tax Foundation. For investors, that would further ding the outlook for economic growth and inflation, and raise fears of a stagflation scenario taking hold. In that maximalist scenario, Ryan expects real GDP growth will take a 1 to 1.5 percentage point hit. Fears of slower economic growth — sparked in part by tariffs — already have market observers cutting their year-end forecasts for the S & P 500. David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, lowered his 2025 target for a second time this year , to 5,700 from 6,200. What's clear, at least, is that Wednesday could be the start, not the end, of a long road ahead. Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said he remains constructive on equities. However, he worries the risks around what the White House calls ""liberation day"" are ""not small"" and could lead to a recession. ""We have no inside beat on how long these new tariffs will last. We simply believe that the depth and the breadth of tariffs, and the number of stakeholders involved, creates a significant number of permutations and combinations,"" Harvey wrote in a note. ""Governments, which are generally not fast moving entities, may first determine whether they want to retaliate; even if they do not, we see a long road to the negotiation table."" ""We believe the process (even under the most optimistic scenario) will require weeks/months of discussions before official changes can even be considered,"" Harvey wrote. ""The bottom line is we think investors and investors' portfolios need to get comfortable with uncertainty."" Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

https://cnbc.com,"Tariffs will likely raise much less money than White House projects, economists say",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/01/tariffs-may-raise-much-less-than-white-house-projects-economists-say.html,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","President Donald Trump speaks before signing executive orders in the Oval Office on March 6, 2025. Alex Wong | Getty Images

President Donald Trump says that tariffs will make the U.S. ""rich."" But those riches will likely be far less than the White House expects, economists said. The ultimate sum could have big ramifications for the U.S. economy, the nation's debt and legislative negotiations over a tax-cut package, economists said. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Sunday estimated tariffs would raise about $600 billion a year and $6 trillion over a decade. Auto tariffs would add another $100 billion a year, he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Navarro made the projection as the U.S. plans to announce more tariffs against U.S. trading partners on Wednesday. Economists expect the Trump administration's tariff policy would generate a much lower amount of revenue than Navarro claims. Some project the total revenue would be less than half. Roughly $600 billion to $700 billion a year ""is not even in the realm of possibility,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. ""If you get to $100 billion to $200 billion, you'll be pretty lucky."" The White House declined to respond to a request for comment from CNBC about tariff revenue.

The 'mental math' behind tariff revenue

There are big question marks over the scope of the tariffs, including details like amount, duration, and products and countries affected — all of which have a significant bearing on the revenue total. The White House is considering a 20% tariff on most imports, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday. President Trump floated this idea on the campaign trail. The Trump administration may ultimately opt for a different policy, like country-by-country tariffs based on each nation's respective trade and non-trade barriers. But a 20% tariff rate seems to align with Navarro's revenue projections, economists said. The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion of goods in 2024. Applying a 20% tariff rate to all these imports would yield about $660 billion of annual revenue. ""That is almost certainly the mental math Peter Navarro is doing — and that mental math skips some crucial steps,"" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration.

That's because an accurate revenue estimate must account for the many economic impacts of tariffs in the U.S. and around the world, economists said. Those effects combine to reduce revenue, they said. A 20% broad tariff would raise about $250 billion a year (or $2.5 trillion over a decade) when taking those effects into account, according to Tedeschi, citing a Yale Budget Lab analysis published Monday. There are ways to raise larger sums — but they would involve higher tariff rates, economists said. For example, a 50% across-the-board tariff would raise about $780 billion per year, according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Even that is an optimistic assessment: It doesn't account for lower U.S. economic growth due to retaliation or the negative growth effects from the tariffs themselves, they wrote.

Why revenue would be lower than expected

Tariffs generally raise prices for consumers. A 20% broad tariff would cost the average consumer $3,400 to $4,200 a year, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Consumers would naturally buy fewer imported goods if they cost more, economists said. Lower demand means fewer imports and less tariff revenue from those imports, they said. Tariffs are also expected to trigger ""reduced economic activity,"" said Robert McClelland, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. More from Personal Finance:

Economists say 'value-added taxes' aren't a trade barrier

Tariffs are 'lose-lose' for U.S. jobs and industry

Why uncertainty makes the stock market go haywire For example, U.S. companies that don't pass tariff costs on to consumers via higher prices would likely see profits suffer (and their income taxes fall), economists said. Consumers might pull back on spending, further denting company profits and tax revenues, economists said. Companies that take a financial hit might lay off workers, they said. Foreign nations are also expected to retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. products, which would hurt companies that export products abroad. Other nations may experience an economic downturn, further reducing demand for U.S. products.

""If you get a 20% tariff rate, you're going to get a rip-roaring recession, and that will undermine your fiscal situation,"" Zandi said. There's also likely to be a certain level of non-compliance with tariff policy, and carve-outs for certain countries, industries or products, economists said. For instance, when the White House levied tariffs on China in February, it indefinitely exempted ""de minimis"" imports valued at $800 or less. The Trump administration might also funnel some tariff revenue to paying certain parties aggrieved by a trade war, economists said. President Trump did that in his first term: The government sent $61 billion in ""relief"" payments to American farmers who faced retaliatory tariffs, which was nearly all (92%) of the tariff revenue on Chinese goods from 2018 to 2020, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

The tariffs will also likely have a short life span, diluting their potential revenue impact, economists said. They're being issued by executive order and could be undone easily, whether by President Trump or a future president, they said. ""There's zero probability these tariffs will last for 10 years,"" Zandi said. ""If they last until next year I'd be very surprised.""

Uncertainty around the Trump administration's approach to tariffs resulted in a rocky first quarter for the major market averages. The S & P 500 dropped 4.6% in the period, while the Nasdaq Composite t umbled 10.4% — in both cases, the worst quarterly performances since 2022. Dividend-paying stocks can stand out in rocky times, particularly a period of stagflation – when economic growth slows and inflation remains high – according to Desh Peramunetilleke, head of quantitative strategy at Jefferies. His team sees U.S. dividend payers outperforming this year, led by high-quality yield stocks and bond proxies or defensive yield names. ""A study of past stagflation-like period shows that it is a headwind for equities, but dividend strategies tend to be more resilient,"" the strategist said in a March 27 report. ""Since 2001, [bond proxies] and [high-quality yield] have outperformed the most during such periods in [the] U.S."" Jefferies identified a few stocks that could be poised to outperform in a stagflation environment. High quality names include those that are in the top two quintiles for quality, while bond proxies or defensive yield plays include real estate investment trusts, railroad and transport infrastructure. Here are some stocks that made the Jefferies cut. Beverage and snacks giant Coca-Cola got the nod from Jefferies as a high-quality yield stock. Shares are up 15% in 2025, and the stock pays a dividend yield of about 2.9%. Consumers are feeling less confident about where the economy is headed , but Coca-Cola is well-positioned to navigate any tough times, according to Wells Fargo analyst Chris Carey. He and his team met with management at the Sprite- and Fanta-maker and came away reassured, according to a March 19 report. ""We couldn't help but hear a message even if unstated: storm clouds come and go… all weather strategy does not,"" he wrote, sticking with his overweight rating on Coca-Cola. ""KO is showing a renewed ability to deliver $ EPS growth even despite macro headwinds, with sustainable organic sales growth drivers (both volume and price/mix) and steady investment levels,"" Carey added. He is in good company, with 22 of 28 analysts rating Coca-Cola a buy or strong buy, according to LSEG. Average price targets call for more than 4% upside from current levels. Adding to the allure, Coca-Cola announced a 63rd consecutive annual dividend increase in February, hiking the payment more than 5% to 51 cents per share. Computing giant and high-quality pick International Business Machines also made Jefferies' list. In what's been a difficult 2025 for the technology sector – which is down 13% year to date – IBM is up more than 12%. The stock offers a dividend yield of 2.7%. Last week, Wedbush added IBM to its ""best ideas"" list, noting that the company is ""well positioned"" to capitalize on the demand shift for hybrid and artificial intelligence applications. ""While the company remains committed to investing into further driving growth, IBM looks to balance growth with operating leverage into its business model to drive its free cash flow profile, which is expected to be ~2-3 points above revenue growth,"" Wedbush analysts said. The firm rates the original tech stock outperform. About half of the analysts covering IBM rate the equivalent of a buy, LSEG says, and consensus price targets call for nearly 2% more upside. Jefferies called out JPMorgan Chase as a defensive yield play. Shares are up just 1% in 2025, and the country's largest bank pays a dividend yield of 2.3%. Analysts are largely upbeat on the New York-based stock, with 14 of 24 giving it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. The average price target suggests shares could rise nearly 10% from current levels. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo last week reiterated his buy rating on JPMorgan and hiked estimates ""to above consensus"" for the first quarter. ""Short term, JPM should benefit from volatility given its role as market facilitator, likely helping trading —our EPS ests. are above consensus,"" he wrote in a report. In the medium term, he sees JPMorgan benefiting from deregulation, while technology spending 50% above the next largest bank should spur market share gains longer term. JPMorgan, like Coke, also recently bumped its quarterly dividend , this time to $1.40 per share, up from $1.25. ""The off-cycle 12% dividend increase… is positive,"" Mayo wrote.

It's a reflection that businesses — and, in our opinion, investors — cannot do without the services that cybersecurity companies provide, making these stocks a relative bright spot in a shaky market for tech. Through Monday's close, a popular exchanged-traded fund tracking the broader software industry — iShares Expanded Tech Software Sector ETF (IGV) — is down 11.1% year to date. Meanwhile, the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR) is down just 0.6%. Another cyber-focused fund, the Amplify Cybersecurity ETF (HACK), has dropped 3.6% this year. Both cyber ETFs have pulled back from their February highs, but to a smaller degree than the IGV. What we're seeing with cyber stocks is their ""mission criticality,"" said Shaul Eyal, analyst at TD Cowen in an interview with CNBC. Given the increasing threat of cyber attacks, cybersecurity is the No. 1 spending item for companies. ""You cannot cut that right now"" Eyal said. That is providing top cybersecurity companies with a ""higher degree of isolation"" in an uncertain economy and therefore puts them in a ""safer zone"" to be insulated from a potential downturn, the analyst said. CrowdStrike , known for its Falcon cloud security offering, is one of the Club's best-performing stocks in 2025, up 3% through Monday. Cyber peer Palo Alto Networks is lower year to date, losing 6%, but that's far better than a non-cyber software firm levered to the artificial intelligence trade such as Salesforce , which has lost almost 20%. The point is not that cyber stocks are as defensive as, say, drugmakers — rather, our view is that within technology, these companies remain well-positioned to navigate macroeconomic pressures because businesses can't afford to cut back on protecting sensitive data or automating security operations amid rising cyber treats. IGV PANW,CRWD YTD mountain The IGV software ETF versus CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks so far this year. To be sure, there are negative considerations, at least in the short run, that investors need to monitor. That includes the broader economic environment and what that may do to deal cycles, according to analysts at Jefferies. The Wall Street firm on Sunday cut its price targets on software stocks including Palo Alto Networks ($215 from $240) and CrowdStrike ($410 from $425), despite keeping buy ratings on both names. The firm's latest checks in the sector ""have not shown any concrete pauses/cancellations or material change in behavior,"" but analysts cautioned that ""if macro uncertainties persist, they could affect deal cycles, especially for large enterprise contracts."" Get Your Ticket for the Annual Meeting! Secure your ticket today for the CNBC Investing Club's upcoming 3rd Annual Meeting on May 2nd in Orlando, Florida! Federal spending cuts are another overhang on the group and could be behind at least some of the declines since February. The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has aggressively canceled contracts, terminated leases and reduced agency workforces in an attempt to lower federal spending. These actions have raised concerns about potential impacts to IT spending and software companies with government contracts. ServiceNow , a provider of workflow automation software whose public-sector business grew nearly 40% last year, is among the firms potentially affected. The company has said the administration change could lead to more federal revenues coming in the latter part of its fiscal year than normal. However, in early March, CEO Bill McDermott said he hadn't seen ""any evidence of the headwind"" at that time. Nevertheless, federal spending changes has been cited in two recent price target cuts for ServiceNow, which is down more than 24% year to date. Palo Alto said on its mid-February earnings call that its federal business remained stable in its November-to-January quarter. The company emphasized that much of its government revenue comes from long-standing contracts and renewals, which are less vulnerable to sudden budget shifts. More recently, Jim Cramer pressed Palo Alto CEO Nikesh Arora on what DOGE's efforts will mean for the company. While Arora described the current moment as an ""unsettling period,"" the chief executive said the government's efficiency efforts over time should be fruitful for all technology companies. ""One of the biggest opportunities as we get through the phase of cost cutting is automation and efficiency driven by technology,"" Arora told Jim in an interview on CNBC . ""I expect DOGE will be able to get where it wants to get – to a much more efficient, lower cost operation – is to automate a lot of stuff."" CrowdStrike, for its part, also has struck an upbeat tune. ""A new administration, a new wave of technology, and a new threat landscape necessitate all businesses to evolve their cybersecurity programs,"" CEO George Kurtz said on its early March earnings call. ""Consolidation, cost reduction and automation are now the accepted enterprise and federal priorities."" As the general threat landscape gets more active, Palo Alto and CrowdStrike have both positioned themselves to benefit from that consolidation trend. Palo Alto refers to it as ""platformization"" and has oriented itself around that strategy. ""Platformization, without a doubt, is a massive trend benefitting Palo Alto that's helping companies operate more efficiently today"" said TD Cowen's Eyal, who has a $230 price target and buy rating on Palo Alto shares. Large companies interacting with dozens of providers see it as ""a headache to manage all these disparate small solutions,"" Eyal explained, adding to the appeal of a ""one-stop shop"" approach to cyber. ""Companies want a solution that can consolidate all these categories into one cohesive end-to-end platform."" This is what Palo Alto is doing, and Eyal projects that this trend is set to accelerate in the near to mid-term. CrowdStrike's consolidation strategy, meanwhile, revolves around its Falcon platform, which combines multiple cybersecurity tools in a single cloud-based system. Bottom line The market volatility hasn't dimmed Jim Cramer's enthusiasm for cybersecurity's growth trajectory. We continue to believe cybersecurity is multi-year theme that has legs in the years ahead and expect Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike to be ahead of the pack. The proliferation of data in the world — thanks to the growing number of smart devices, through remote work and other areas — is ripe for hackers to exploit. The adoption of artificial intelligence by bad actors only compounds the issue. That omnipresent threat is what makes Palo Alto and CrowdStrike's tools so necessary. Of course, though, we don't expect that these stocks will go up every single week. Stocks don't work that way. But when there is volatility, we try to use it to our advantage because we believe the long-term cybersecurity trend is still intact. We used the March pullback in CrowdStrike to add to our position twice , and the stock ultimately bounced nicely not long after those purchases. We have a buy-equivalent 1 rating and price target of $400 a share on CrowdStrike. For Palo Alto, we're sticking with our 2 rating , which means wait for a pullback before buying more, and a price target of $225. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long PANW, CRWD.

Hims & Hers Health shares closed up 5% on Tuesday after the company announced patients can access Eli Lilly 's weight loss medication Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro, as well as the generic injection liraglutide, through its platform.

Zepbound, Mounjaro and liraglutide are part of the class of weight loss medications called GLP-1s, which have exploded in popularity in recent years. Hims & Hers launched a weight loss program in late 2023, but its GLP-1 offerings have evolved as the company has contended with a volatile supply and regulatory environment.

Lilly's weekly injections Zepbound and Mounjaro will cost patients $1,899 a month, according to the Hims & Hers website. The generic liraglutide will cost $299 a month, but it requires a daily injection and can be less effective than other GLP-1 medications.

""As we look ahead, we plan to continue to expand our weight loss offering to deliver an even more holistic, personalized experience,"" Dr. Craig Primack, senior vice president of weight loss at Hims & Hers, wrote in a blog post.

In May, Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 weight loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy. The offering was immensely popular and helped generate more than $225 million in revenue for the company in 2024.

But compounded drugs can traditionally only be mass produced when the branded medications treatments are in shortage. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced in February that the shortage of semaglutide injections products had been resolved.

That meant Hims & Hers had to largely stop offering the compounded medications, though some consumers may still be able to access personalized doses if it's clinically applicable.

During the company's quarterly call with investors in February, Hims & Hers said its weight loss offerings will primarily consist of its oral medications and liraglutide. The company said it expects its weight loss offerings to generate at least $725 million in annual revenue, excluding contributions from compounded semaglutide.

But the company is still lobbying for compounded medications. A pop up on Hims & Hers' website, which was viewed by CNBC, encourages users to ""use your voice"" and urge Congress and the FDA to preserve access to compounded treatments.

With Tuesday's rally, Hims and Hers shares are up about 27% in 2025 after soaring 172% last year.

The Trump administration is poised to impose steep tariffs starting Wednesday on countries that import oil from Venezuela, in a move analysts said is unprecedented and will significantly increase global trade uncertainty.

Any country that buys oil from Venezuela will face 25% ""secondary tariffs"" on all of its trade with the United States, President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post March 24. The levies go into effect April 2, Trump said in the post, though his executive order leaves the implementation to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's discretion.

""If they buy their oil from Venezuela, they have to pay a 25% tariff to do business with the United States —that's on top of existing tariffs,"" Trump said during a March 24 press conference at the White House.

Trump's secondary tariffs are ""unprecedented and legally questionable, but that won't prevent the administration from moving forward with them,"" according to the consulting firm Rapidan Energy. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act has never been invoked to justify across-the-board tariffs against a country, according to Rapidan.

The tariffs will primarily affect China, the largest importer of Venezuela oil. India and Spain would also face levies unless the U.S. decides to grant exemptions for some countries. Rapidan expects importers to stop purchasing Venezuelan oil as they work to secure exemptions from the White House.

While the Europeans and Indians might get a reprieve, the U.S. has not exempted Chinese companies from sanctions in the past, according to Rapidan. Beijing will likely ditch Venezuelan barrels as a consequence, leading to a supply disruption of around 300,000 barrels per day.

Indeed, early signs suggest this could be happening. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Venezuela's exports of crude oil and fuel fell 11.5% in March, according to ship tracking data and documents.

Trump's secondary tariffs have introduced a new wild card, Evercore ISI analyst Sarah Bianchi told clients in March 26 note.

The U.S. has imposed secondary sanctions in some cases on organizations doing business with blacklisted entities but it has not used trade tariffs in this way before, according to Bianchi.

Trump's secondary tariffs could signal that he plans to significantly expand the use of tariffs beyond issues involving trade, the analyst wrote. In the case of Venezuela, the president is wielding them to pressure the Nicolas Maduro regime, which he alleges has sent Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S.

""Adapting the idea of secondary sanctions to tariffs — and again using tariffs to achieve goals unrelated to trade — in our view further reduces the likelihood that April 2 is the peak of trade uncertainty,"" Bianchi told clients.

She warned that Trump could be emboldened to use tariffs ""to bolster the United States' global leverage in advancing any number of other foreign policy objectives"" if his crackdown on Venezuela is successful.

You can't control price swings or market volatility, but you do have some control over where your money goes, says Catherine Irby Arnold, senior vice president and Washington market leader for U.S. Bank. ""Sometimes we feel like we're not in control and things are just coming at us, but it is really important to try to pick things that you can control and that you can make an impact and difference on at the moment,"" she says. Look at your monthly spending and ask yourself whether there are expenses you can cut, she suggests. Is it still worth it to pick up a $6 coffee several times a week, for example? ""For most people, the best response is simply to stay thoughtful,"" says Jason Gilbert, founder and managing partner of RGA Investment Advisors. Start by building flexibility into your existing spending plan, if you can. Whether you create a comprehensive budget or not, it's smart to take stock of your monthly fixed costs and ""see if there's room to create a cushion,"" Gilbert says. Sprung agrees. ""Flexibility is key right now,"" he says.

""Keep your emergency fund healthy, avoid unnecessary debt and don't let headlines drive your decisions,"" Gilbert says. ""Staying grounded financially is what creates peace of mind, no matter what the news cycle brings."" Experts generally recommend having three to six months' worth of expenses put away for emergencies. But they suggest it may be wise to add a little extra to that fund in case of major price changes that can make unanticipated costs — like getting your car repaired, or having to replace a computer or a phone — more expensive. If you're just starting to create this kind of fund, know that three to six months' of expenses is a goal, and anything you can put toward a crisis can help. Only able to sock away $20 to $30 a month right now? That's still worth saving, Irby Arnold says. You can make the process easier by automating it. To do so, divert some of your salary straight to your emergency fund, if possible, Irby Arnold suggests. Setting that up ""really serves two purposes,"" she says. ""It gets you into the habit of spending [only] what would you bring home and it forces you a to put that savings plan to work.""

What to buy right now, and what not to buy

In the face of uncertainty around tariffs or other price fluctuations, Sprung suggests thinking carefully about large purchases, such as cars, home appliances and repairs. It might be better to wait until you have a better understanding of how costs change, he says. ""The tariff [enactments] have proven to be very fluid and consumers need to make an educated decision on whether they are willing to wait or not, if they can, and see if the tariffs do or do not get implemented and at what levels,"" he says.

Bhargava's Ayurveda-inspired turmeric and chai blends — made with spices sourced from Vietnam, Thailand, Africa, and South America; tea and peppercorn from India; safran from Afghanistan; and special retail tin packaging made in China — are sold through retailers including Whole Foods, and there is little room for major price changes. ""My margins are thin,"" Bhargava said. ""The people I'm working with, independent foreign farmers securing their 2024 spice harvest, these are spices not grown at the scale I need here in the United States."" The threat of the global tariffs already have the small business owner rethinking plans for core marketing efforts. In June, the Specialty Food Association's big event takes place, the SFA Summer Fancy Food Show, but Bhargava said she may not attend because the packaging she needs for products may no longer be available at a price that can be absorbed. ""I have bootstrapped with pivots, but this is so challenging, I am at a point with my business where I can finally put my foot on the gas but now I don't know if it's going to be feasible to keep the business going,"" said Bhargava.

Four years ago, she moved manufacturing of her spice tins to China because of the cost and quality as she aimed for more market share from national retailers like Whole Foods, in addition to her online business. But tariffs that force her to create new domestic supply chains threaten growth. ""I will have to reconsider my entire retail strategy because the packing cost is unsustainable,"" Bhargava said. ""Trying to compete on the retail shelf I have beautiful retail tins, and to order tins in the U.S., the cost would be double and at astronomical quantities."" Bhargava said like countless other small business owners balancing quality and affordability on a knife's edge, the proposed tariffs threaten not just her livelihood but the very essence of what makes the U.S. marketplace diverse, authentic, and innovative. Bhargava said she has been trying to stock up on ingredients that go into the tins, within limits, but the impact of tariffs on her business affect many other companies at the same time. ""I supply to coffee companies and other smaller companies. I have warehouses and trucking services that move my product. There are many parts within the world of food,"" she said. ""I have been lucky to get this far, but my business future feels so unpredictable because of the tariffs."" Bruce Kaminstein, former owner and CEO of cleaning products company Casabella, and now an angel investor in consumer product companies, said tariffs can price companies like Bhargava's out of business, which ultimately lowers consumer choice. ""We will lose innovation and essentially the American Dream,"" said Kaminstein. ""I saw this firsthand when I sold Casabella in other countries with a high tariff. There was less product choice for consumers."" He said while he is in favor of a ""level paying field"" where U.S. brands can sell overseas ""without tariff prejudice, there needs to be a scalpel approach in executing."" ""For some industries, you cannot source everything in the United States,"" he said. Supply chains already 'tapped out' say big food companies Anjali's Cup is just one example of many companies both large and small facing the new trade war at an economic moment when the ability to take more price is getting harder. In a letter to the White House, the Consumer Brands Association, which represents approximately 90 iconic brands like Coca-Cola , McCormick Spices , and Clorox , wrote the ""current one-size-fits-all approach for protecting domestic manufacturers"" needs to be adjusted to reflect supply chain constraints, and the reality in commodity and import markets. Tom Madrecki, vice president of campaigns and special projects for the Consumer Brands Association, said its member companies are the largest employer in the domestic manufacturing sector, but they can't frontload products ahead of tariffs due to spoiling and seasonal demand trends in food. Members include General Mills , Colgate-Palmolive , and Mondelez , and Madrecki said many are in favor of ""America First"" policy and manufacture products in rural parts of the country. ""No one is contesting that,"" Madrecki said of the goal to have more domestic manufacturing. ""The issue is supply chains are incredibly tapped out, costs are high, ingredient costs are high, there is continued grocery inflation, and consumers are concerned. There is no margin on these products,"" he said. And he added that unlike the trade war during Trump's first term, at a time in the economy when inflation was much lower and costs could be absorbed, ""This time there is nowhere to absorb it. Prices will have to increase or U.S. manufacturers will bear the brunt.""

Canadian oats are a good example of a commodity market where tariffs will have a big impact on food staples. The grain is used in many cereals because there are not enough domestic oats to meet demand. Canada is the world's largest producer and exporter of oats, and over 90% of the oats milled for food in the U.S. are sourced from Canada. Growing conditions are better in Canada, Madrecki said, and due to a decline in oat acreage in the U.S. that dates all the way back to the 1940s, there is no longer a viable system for growing, storing and transporting U.S. oats from farms to mills at the scale needed for the food industry. Iowa's economy will face a big hit from tariffs on Canadian oats. ""Two of the largest oat purchasers in the world are U.S. consumer product group companies that employ thousands of workers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,"" Madrecki said. ""Both are dependent on oats from Canada to make their food products here."" Trade and transportation costs will pile up Nick Rakovsky, CEO of DataDocks, a global supply chain scheduling system scheduling system, said the economics of trade war and the cost impacts require analysis that goes beyond the importing of products from foreign countries. ""I don't see just the topline number of the tariff,"" said Rakovsky. ""I am looking at the whole operation, the supply chain, and how everything can be affected. There is so much to consider when pivoting to a new supplier."" Companies looking to change suppliers need to review the location of the new sourcing material and where the new suppliers are located, if they are near the same ports currently being used, any new local laws and regulations, business costs associated with special licenses, quality control, and even how the freight is packed. ""If labor opens the doors of the container and it is not packed the usual way because the supplier does it different than the previous supplier, it could take a longer time to unload,"" Rakovsky said. ""This costs more money. So even the way freight is unpacked needs to be considered. In the end, a company has to ask, does pivoting to mitigate the cost of tariffs save money?"" Consumer goods such as knives are now facing a double whammy of tariffs on foreign manufacturing and foreign steel. Eunice Byun, who cofounded kitchen product company Material Kitchen seven years ago after a career at Goldman Sachs, sells her products online, and in retailers such as the Container Store, Bloomingdales and Saks. Material Kitchen's knives are made in China, Korea, and India. ""With the Trump tariffs we have had to increase prices for our steak knives (set of 3) from $90 to $110,"" said Byun. ""We also have a new product out of Finland that could now be tariffed. This is something we had never planned for. We will now have to see how that impacts pricing."" To mitigate the China tariffs, Byun was looking to move some production to Canada, but with the Trump trade war now brewing there has stopped that planning. Byun said the biggest cloud of uncertainty for her business is inventory management. ""As a growing company, you are one viral video away from your inventory being sold out. It's the hardest thing to control. We are riding this wave and we need more clarification on what the tariffs are and when regions will be impacted."" Over the short term, frontloading products is an option if the product has a shelf life. Over the long term, however, the duration of a tariff needs to be factored into every business. Any tariffs implemented by Trump could be reversed by a subsequent administration. For example, President Biden lifted tariffs on steel and aluminum in October 2021. But the question of tariff duration is another issue that is leading industries to weigh the pros and cons of changing supply chains. ""It's not like you just go get a new supplier and start working with them,"" said Brian Farley, vice president at business intelligence firm Dun & Bradstreet. ""Unless you have already nurtured an appropriate replacement relationship. Those things take time.""",cnbc

Markets: It is another volatile, choppy day on Wall Street. For the second day in a row, the S & P 500 reversed early losses and fought into the green — but unlike a day ago, the index slipped back into the red and was down about 0.4% as of 2:30 p.m. ET. We're one day away from President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement — set for a 4 p.m. ET event in the Rose Garden — and the White House confirmed the levies will be effective immediately. However, what remains unclear is the size and scope of the tariffs. Among our questions: Will the tariffs be roughly 20% across the board, reciprocal, or targeted? What, if any, exemptions will be made? Having some clarity on these points could help the markets recover, but the long-term impact of tariffs will be an overhang. Tracking GDP : The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for the first quarter was negatively revised to a 3.7% contraction from its last update of a 2.8% decline on March 28. The model – which provides a running estimate of annualized quarter gross domestic product growth – was updated to include recent major economic releases like ISM Manufacturing Index and the Census Bureau's construction spending report, both of which were released Tuesday. The ISM report came in lighter than expectations, while the construction spending data rose more than expected, helped by homebuilding activity. Get Your Ticket for the Annual Meeting! Secure your ticket today for the CNBC Investing Club's upcoming 3rd Annual Meeting on May 2nd in Orlando, Florida! The Atlanta Fed also produces an alternative model that adjusts for imports and exports of gold. That is tracking at a 1.4% contraction, so it is a little better from that perspective. Full disclaimer: This is only one model of GDP. Others are estimating vastly different figures. For example, the latest tracking estimate by Goldman Sachs' economists of 0.2% growth paints a more resilient picture of the economy. For 2025, Goldman estimates GDP growth of 1.5% on an annual average basis. In any case, the GDP models have taken on greater salience lately as concerns about the health of the U.S. economy have grown and proven to be a headwind for certain parts of the market such as travel-related names. Up next: There are no major earnings reports after the closing bell on Tuesday and before the opening bell on Wednesday. On the data side, on Wednesday we'll see weekly mortgage applications, the ADP private payrolls report, factory orders, and durable goods orders.

Meta's head of artificial intelligence research announced Tuesday that she will be leaving the company.

Joelle Pineau, the company's vice president of AI research, announced her departure in a LinkedIn post, saying her last day at the social media company will be May 30.

Her departure comes at a challenging time for Meta. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made AI a top priority, investing billions of dollars in an effort to become the market leader ahead of rivals like OpenAI and Google .

Zuckerberg has said that it is his goal for Meta to build an AI assistant with more than 1 billion users and artificial general intelligence, which is a term used to describe computers that can think and take actions comparable to humans.

""As the world undergoes significant change, as the race for AI accelerates, and as Meta prepares for its next chapter, it is time to create space for others to pursue the work,"" Pineau wrote.

https://cnbc.com,The federal government is phasing out paper checks. Here's who will be affected,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/01/the-us-government-is-phasing-out-paper-checks-what-that-means-for-you.html,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Checks are printed at the U.S. Treasury Philadelphia Finance Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Paper checks were already dying a slow death.

President Donald Trump on March 25 signed an executive order mandating that all federal departments and agencies end their use of paper checks and switch to electronic payments by Sept. 30.

The U.S. Treasury now has about six months to phase out the paper checks it uses for various purposes, including tax refunds and the roughly 456,000 Social Security checks that are mailed monthly.

The executive order will ""modernize how the government handles money, switching from old-fashioned paper-based payments to fast, secure electronic payments,"" the administration said in a fact sheet on the order.

""Paper-based payments, such as checks and money orders, impose unnecessary costs, delays, and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies,"" the White House said.

Under the order, all government departments and agencies will have to issue disbursements via electronic transfer methods, like direct deposit, debit or credit card payments, digital wallets and real-time transfers.

Consumers will have until then to set up an online bank account or some form of digital payment option, with limited exceptions for those who do not have access to banking services or electronic payment systems.

""We welcome President Trump's executive order mandating that the federal government cease issuing paper checks for all disbursements, including government benefits and tax refunds,"" Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association said in a statement. ""Despite a continued decline in business and consumer use of checks, check fraud has continued to rise.""

Check fraud, mail theft and identity scams have exploded in recent years, according to Haywood Talcove, CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions' government group. A 2024 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated that the federal government could lose between $233 billion and $521 billion a year to fraud.

""Checks aren't safe anymore,"" Talcove said. ""It's where the criminal groups are feasting.""

As part of the executive order, payments made to the federal government — such as fees, fines, loans and tax refunds — must also be made electronically.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Trump's tariffs are a new challenge for Big Pharma. Here are the best-positioned stocks,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/01/trumps-tariffs-will-challenge-big-pharma-here-are-well-positioned-stocks.html,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Long-standing trade agreements have largely sheltered the pharmaceutical industry from tariffs but President Donald Trump's goal of bringing manufacturing back to the United States has put the industry in the administration's crosshairs. Trump first floated the idea of imposing tariffs of as much as 25% on imported pharmaceuticals in mid-February. Since then, he has repeated the idea and hinted that details would arrive in early April. Now, however, it's unclear whether an update will be forthcoming on Wednesday, when many expect reciprocal tariffs to be unveiled, or if a drug announcement lies further out. If tariffs are put in place, it will be a big change for the industry. A 1994 World Trade Organization agreement eliminated levies on a whole swath of pharmaceutical products and the substances used to make them. This gave rise to companies pursuing a host of business strategies aimed at lowering tax rates. ""This is largely due to low tax rates in these countries,"" Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal said. ""These companies pay lower overall taxes due to these manufacturing operations and oftentimes [intellectual property] is also domiciled in these countries, lowering taxes even further."" Ireland has been a huge beneficiary of this practice, and that hasn't been lost on Trump. Meeting with Michéal Martin, the Irish premier, at a St. Patrick's Day event at the White House in mid-March, Trump said the Irish were ""smart people."" ""You took our pharmaceutical companies and other companies. ... This beautiful island of 5 million people has got the entire U.S. pharmaceutical industry in its grasps,"" Trump said . 'Underappreciated' risks Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger warned his clients on Sunday that tariff risks to the industry are ""underappreciated."" ""Although corporations can make adjustments to mitigate the negative impact of tariffs, it could take some time given the complexities of global tax strategies and supply chains and uncertainty related to the durability of tariffs (since President Trump can change his mind),"" Risinger wrote. Analysts warn that it is difficult to fully assess the tariff risks based on the available information. However, Bernstein analysts led by Courtney Breen did try to connect the dots based on manufacturing locations, revenue, cost of goods sold, ocean shipping data, tax rate guidance and other data, and expects that Merck , AbbVie , Amgen and Pfizer are among the companies facing the highest risks. Eli Lilly , Gilead , Bristol Myers Squibb and Moderna have ""more moderate risk,"" she said. MRK YTD mountain Merck shares year to date Breen expects Merck and AbbVie have more at stake due to their import volume and the likelihood that tariffs will result in a higher cost base. Bernstein rates both stocks market perform, the equivalent of a hold or neutral opinion. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee called out Amgen and Biogen as having the greatest exposure in his coverage universe. ""AMGN has manufacturing operations in Ireland and Singapore, which results in a benefit to their effective tax rate of -6%,"" Yee said. ""BIIB also has a benefit to their effective tax rate of -8% due to taxes on foreign earnings."" AMGN YTD mountain Amgen shares year to date Vertex and Gilead would have less exposure to higher tariffs, he said. The two companies have the bulk of their intellectual property, or IP, domiciled in the U.S., at a higher tax rate, according to analysts. Both stocks have enjoyed a strong run. The pair are each up more than 20% year to date. While the majority of analysts rate Vertex a buy, the average price target suggests upside of only around 3%, according to LSEG. Gilead shares also may be fully valued, according to analyst price targets. The average target suggests shares could fall maybe 1%, as of Monday's close. Investors aren't necessarily shying away from the stocks that appear most at risk from policy shifts. Amgen shares have outperformed the market, with a gain of just under 20% so far this year, while AbbVie is up about 18% through Monday's close. But both Biogen and Merck are down 10% each over the same period. 'Prevalent cross-border movement' Geoff Meacham, an analyst at Citigroup who covers the large-cap pharma industry, doesn't expect to see an outsized impact on any one company. His analysis showed eight of the 12 companies he covers have manufacturing in Ireland. ""Cleverly, the global manufacturing supply chain is highly leveraged with prevalent cross-border movement,"" Meacham said. He created a table that shows the amount of revenue companies generate in different geographies, but warned it's ""unlikely to accurately portray the net impact"" of changes in trade policy. That's because other details will factor into the calculations, analysts say. ""Key questions are what exactly the tariffs would apply to; assuming these would be on the low-cost drug substance being imported, the effects would likely be minimal given generally very high gross margins across the space, though tariffs pegged closer to drugs' list prices and/or designed to offset offshore IP tax advantages could be more impactful,"" said RBC Capital Markets analysts, led by Brian Abrahams. ""Generally speaking, companies with more ex-U.S. IP and manufacturing would be more exposed."" The JPMorgan U.S. BioPharma research team echoed this. ""On a simplistic level, the sector's [cost of goods sold] average ~20% of sales and ~65% of sales are generated in the U.S — if tariffs are somewhat tied to actual manufacturing expenses, these should inherently be manageable for the sector,"" analysts led by Chris Schott wrote in a research note. A phased-in approach On Tuesday, Reuters said that the pharmaceutical industry is pushing for any tariffs to be applied gradually . The report cited people who are familiar with the industry's talks with the Trump administration. Industry trade group PhRMA told the news service that it can take five to 10 years and $2 billion to open a new manufacturing plant in the U.S. Drug manufacturing has to meet various regulatory requirements, which can take time to clear, the report said. Some companies are ahead of the game, having recently announced plans to boost manufacturing capacity in the U.S., including Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson , AstraZeneca and GSK . But Morningstar analyst Vikas Munjal said bringing production back to the U.S., in a process known as ""reshoring,"" may not be economical for all companies and products, especially low-margin generic drugs. ""Given the critical nature of these products and inelastic demand, we expect drug manufacturers to pass on most of these additional costs to end-users, which would mean patients, medical insurers, and healthcare providers,"" Munjal said.

""That is the common trait, whether it's out of my co-founders [or] it's somebody that walks in the door just out of school,"" says Ramlet, the co-founder and CEO of global data intelligence firm Morning Consult.

Insatiable curiosity is perhaps obviously important for the data intelligence industry, Ramlet notes — but it'll become more crucial for nearly every other type of job as the artificial intelligence industry grows, he says.

""You think about [generative AI] chat prompts and ... [humans] still have to ask the question,"" says Ramlet. ""So that intellectual curiosity is, I think, going to be a distinguishing trait, not just for those of us at Morning Consult, but across the board.""

Multiple CEOs and high-powered businesspeople attribute their success to their intellectual curiosity. Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, for example, says it's the one trait that sets him apart from most people.

Gates is known for his voracious reading habit, and has said that he regretted dropping out of Harvard University simply because of how much he loved intensively studying a wide variety of subjects.

""I enjoyed the classes, including some that I just sat in on: psychology, economics, history courses,"" Gates told CNBC Make It in February. ""I loved having smart people around. We could sit and talk late into the night about very interesting things.""

DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has a similar outlook, he told LinkedIn's ""The Path"" podcast in May 2024. Jassy, 57, was a paralegal, sports production assistant, product manager and investment banker before joining Amazon in 1997. He learned more about himself and the work he was doing with each career change, he said.

Everyone has personal interests, of course. Successful people often use what they know and learn — about any passion topic, work-related or not — to provide insight that's otherwise missing in their workplace, former DoorDash and Google recruiter Nolan Church said in August.

""What continuous learners do is: They connect old ideas in new ways,"" said Church, citing Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' decision to combine cell phones and iPods into an iPhone. ""And that is, in my mind, the definition of innovation.""

Indeed CEO Chris Hyams' advice: Show off your inquisitiveness during job interviews or conversations with your boss. Try to paint a picture of your ability to adapt and solve problems, which are both highly desirable qualities in employees, he said in February.

One of his favorite job interview questions, he said, is, ""What are you insanely curious about?"" Or, alternatively, ""What do you care deeply about?""

""I'm actually more interested if it's not a work-related thing,"" said Hyams. ""If you can spend 45 minutes talking about baking sourdough, and the 57 different recipes that you've tried, the experimentation with temperature and hydration ... When people have that intense curiosity ... it's just a question of, what else can you fall in love with?""

https://cnbc.com,"Chip stocks are poised to fall further, according to the charts",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/01/chip-stocks-poised-to-fall-further-according-to-the-charts.html,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Fear and uncertainty seem to be the driving forces in these markets leaving many investors unsure of how to move forward. As I write this, we're looking at a hefty amount of incoming information that could cause even more uncertainty with April 2's tariff announcements, state elections that could be an early referendum on Trump's approval ahead of midterms, and numerous reports of increased inflation expectations and increased probability of a recession. Market volatility is elevated, driven no doubt by investor emotion resulting from uncertainty. We must remind ourselves that emotional investing is not a strategy that we should let anywhere near our decision making processes when it comes to portfolio management. Our job is to not stress out and waste energy trying to predict the future based on what we think 'should happen' or what we think we know about the political landscape, but to thoroughly assess the current environment in front of us and expend energy on what we know and can control. We do know the market rotated into defensive areas including healthcare, staples, utilities, gold and gold mining stocks, and out of the growth areas, specifically the AI-related names. Could the growth trade move lower? Absolutely. Or has the value trade topped out and the growth trade secured a low on March 31st, the last day of Q1, with that high volume reversal day? Very possibly. I can't know for sure. Personally, I place better odds that we secured a short-to-medium term low in the growth trade on March 31. I have a shopping list of stocks ready to go. If I'm wrong, that's where asymmetric reward-to-risk option hedges can play a valuable role in hedging against what we can't know. In our shorter-term model at Inside Edge Capital called Active Opps we deploy these kinds of shorter-term ""fast money"" trades to hedge against our longer-term holdings. Chip stocks look shaky The weekly chart of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) shows a triple bottom support level right around $200 that first formed almost one year ago in April '24. In that time you'll notice the SMH/S & P 500 ratio moving lower, showing the underperformance of the semi group to the broader stock market. If the growth trade has yet to secure a bottom, there is little doubt that the $200 level in SMH will break support and we should be able to move down into the yellow highlighted zone of $191-$177 support calculated from wave and ratio analysis. To take advantage of this possible move lower and to hedge our longer-term holdings, I'm looking to buy a put spread in the May monthly expiration. I am looking to buy the $190 put trading for $3.25 and then sell the $180 put for a credit of $1.80. The total cost of the transaction is $1.45 or $145.00 of total risk per spread. The max possible reward is the $10.00 spread - $1.45 cost, or $8.55. Put simply, the total maximum risk is $145 per spread to potentially make a maximum reward of $855 should SMH close at $180 on May 16th. With that kind of asymmetric reward-to-risk ratio I can maintain our long positions and reduce the uncertainty that is so plentiful in this emotional and volatile market. -Todd Gordon, Founder of Inside Edge Capital, LLC Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!
