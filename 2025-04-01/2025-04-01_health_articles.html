                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In many regions of the world, including developed nations, drinking water is contaminated with invisible chemicals linked to cancer, immune disorders, and developmental delays. PFAS are synthetic chemicals that have been widely used since the mid-20th century. These chemicals were valued for their resistance to heat, water, and oil. However, their persistence in the environment and bioaccumulation in living organisms have raised serious health concerns, with a growing body of research linking PFAS exposure to serious health concerns, including thyroid dysfunction, developmental issues, immunotoxicity, and cancer.1–4 This article explores pathways of human exposure to PFAS, current epidemiological findings, regulatory developments in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US), industrial accountability, ongoing lawsuits, remediation technologies, and emerging PFAS detection tools. Furthermore, PFAS come in thousands of distinct types, further complicating regulatory efforts and scientific research.1,2 Humans are exposed to PFAS through contaminated drinking water, diet, household pollutants, consumer products, and occupational settings. Drinking water contamination is a significant concern, particularly in communities near industrial sites, military bases, and areas where PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been used.1 Studies have shown that even low-level PFAS exposure through drinking water can lead to significant health effects over time. Epidemiological studies have found that PFAS exposure can increase the risk of kidney and testicular cancer. Studies have shown that PFAS can cross the placenta and get transferred through breast milk, resulting in early-life exposure. Research has also linked PFAS to decreased fertility, with evidence suggesting that they may disrupt hormone regulation critical for reproductive health.1–3 However, short-chain PFAS still pose environmental and health concerns, as they may have similar toxic effects. A proposed PFAS restriction under the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals or REACH regulation is aimed at achieving one of the most comprehensive PFAS bans globally.1 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also issued health advisories and is moving toward enforceable limits for PFAS in drinking water. Moreover, litigation against PFAS manufacturers has resulted in multi-million-dollar settlements, with companies such as Dupont/Chemours and 3M being held accountable for environmental contamination.1,4,6 However, despite regulatory progress, enforcement remains challenging due to industry resistance, economic considerations, and scientific uncertainties. Moreover, industrial stakeholders continue to challenge regulations, arguing that alternative materials may be costly and lack the same functional properties as PFAS.1,7 Remediation technologies for the removal of PFAS from contaminated water have evolved significantly in recent times. Traditional methods such as activated carbon filtration and ion exchange resins, which function on the principles of membrane filtration and adsorption, have been commonly used but have limitations in capturing smaller PFAS molecules.2 However, new analytical advancements are also improving PFAS monitoring and risk assessment. Meanwhile, high-resolution mass spectrometry allows for suspect screening of PFAS precursors and previously unidentified organofluorine compounds, aiding regulatory efforts. Addressing PFAS contamination requires a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach that incorporates scientific research, policy changes, and public engagement. Stronger regulations are also needed to establish enforceable limits on PFAS in water, soil, and air while promoting safer industrial alternatives. At the same time, investment in advanced remediation technologies is crucial to mitigate contamination and prevent further environmental damage.1</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The study also found that some types of heart disease are more sensitive to heatwaves than others and that different types of heatwaves may impact heart health in distinct, nonlinear ways. It finds that previous studies using traditional binary definitions-without accounting for different types of heatwaves and their cumulative heat load-may have underestimated this risk by as much as 54%. The findings could help improve clinical guidelines for cardiovascular patients and could also be used to improve public health adaptations to climate change, researchers said. Traditional heatwave definitions fail to capture the full scope of these risks." Previous research has found a link between short-term exposure to heatwaves and an increase in heart disease mortality using conventional binary definitions, but the shape of the risk curve and the role of different heatwave patterns were not well understood. They compared deaths across daytime-only, nighttime-only, and day-night compound heatwaves and introduced a new metric for measuring heatwave impact called Excess Cumulative Temperatures in Heatwaves, or ECT-HW. This provides more precise risk assessment, especially for high-intensity, high-duration and compound heatwaves. They also found that risk was not equal across different heart disease subtypes. Sudden cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction and heart failure were especially sensitive to compound heatwaves, while pulmonary heart disease only showed elevated risk under high-intensity exposures. The findings have several clinical and public health implications, Chen said. Since different types of heatwaves affect cardiac conditions differently, prevention measures should consider heatwave type and intensity. The findings also highlight the importance of urban heat mitigation strategies, such as cooling shelters and improved housing infrastructure to protect vulnerable populations. "Given the increasing frequency and intensity of compound heatwaves due to climate change, our findings highlight the need for disease-specific prevention strategies and revised public health guidelines to better protect at-risk populations." Next, the team is planning follow-up research, including studies to project the future burden of heatwave-related cardiac mortality under different climate change scenarios.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The number of successful pregnancies through IVF treatment currently stands at 30 to 50 per cent globally. There are many factors that can influence a successful IVF treatment. Not only the biological and medical conditions, but also factors in the actual lab environment, so-called external factors. These can include temperature, air pressure, humidity, microparticles. Through collaboration with industry, the research team has developed advanced sensors for data collection. In addition, high-resolution images captured during embryo development provide valuable data for AI-driven analysis, enhancing the potential for improved IVF success rates. "What we hope AI can do is find a link, a repeating pattern, between variations in environmental conditions and what happens in the sample. "Through AI, and in this case through machine learning, we can use the data collected to predict a future outcome; simply put, which circumstances will produce a qualitative outcome." In addition to the clinic in Malmö, Khoshkangini and his research team hope to initiate collaborations with clinics outside Europe to see how much the local climate and environment affect the outcome. Improving IVF outcomes offers a significant opportunity to address critical global issues related to fertility, family planning, mental health, and socio-economic equality.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pregnancy may offer some protection from developing Long COVID, found a new study led by Weill Cornell Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Utah Health and Louisiana Public Health Institute. Previous research has mostly focused on non-pregnant adults affected by Long COVID- a condition lasting for months after a person recovers from SARS-CoV-2 infection. "This population is so important and vulnerable, but we had no evidence about their Long COVID risk to guide their care," said Dr. Chengxi Zang, an instructor in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, who co-led the research. "We hope this new data will help clinicians develop better Long COVID prevention and treatment strategies for pregnant women and help those most at risk." They looked for signs of Long COVID 180 days after the women recovered from infections. The team found that the rates of long-term complications related to COVID-19 are lower among pregnant women than comparably matched women who were not pregnant during their infection. In the PCORnet cohort, Dr. Zang and his colleagues found that about 16 out of 100 pregnant women developed Long COVID compared with about 19 out of 100 non-pregnant women. Long COVID is defined as having any of the following symptoms: cognitive problems, encephalopathy, sleep disorders, acute pharyngitis, shortness of breath, pulmonary fibrosis, chest pain, diabetes, edema, malnutrition, joint pain, fever, malaise and fatigue. Though we observed that pregnant women have a significant risk of Long COVID, it was surprisingly lower than those who were not pregnant when they had SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, this risk was still lower than their matched non-pregnant controls. "Further research on factors such as inequitable healthcare access, socioeconomic factors and structural racism may help us understand the elevated Long COVID risk in these groups and find ways to protect them," said Dr. Zang. "We hypothesize that the altered immune and inflammatory environment lasting about six weeks after giving birth might contribute to lowering the risk of Long COVID," Dr. Zang said, "The observed risk differences in this analysis suggest future dedicated studies of Long COVID in pregnant individuals are needed." Dr. Zang and his colleagues at Weill Cornell Medicine are also using electronic health records to study how existing medications may be repurposed to protect pregnant women from Long COVID. This study was co-led by Dr. Elaine Hill and Dr. Daniel Guth, at the University of Rochester Medical Center; Dr. Torri D. Metz and Dr. Ann Bruno at the University of Utah Health; and Thomas Carton at Louisiana Public Health Institute.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A New York City-based physician scientist who explores ways to improve health by looking at the ways in which cells and molecules impact disease and an epidemiologist from Baltimore who has devoted her career to identifying ways to improve screening, diagnosis and patient care for people with diabetes are the most recent American Heart Association Merit Award recipients. The Merit Award supports scientists who have consistently performed highly promising, novel research with the potential to move cardiovascular science forward quickly, with high impact. Their scientific exploration has the potential to produce unusually high impact toward the Association's mission to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives. Diabetes is one of the major controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and as prevalence of both conditions rise, it's become imperative that we learn all we can about the ways they're connected. This year's recipients are already renowned for their work in identifying the important connections between cardiovascular disease and diabetes and I'm excited to see where their future exploration will take us in learning how to better manage these chronic conditions that take the lives of too many people each year." Schmidt's research will focus on the large white blood cells that are part of the body's immune system and are known to contribute to diabetic complications. "Diabetes damages the body head-to-toe and this happens slowly over many years. We know people with diabetes have more strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, blindness and kidney problems, yet the reasons for this connection are not fully known," Schmidt said. "We surmise that learning how large white blood cells in diabetes cause damage will show us new ways to stop their bad actions and decrease harm to the body. As diabetes robs people of good health and years of life, our work may help to fulfill the American Heart Association mission to improve health, especially for people with diabetes." Selvin's research will focus on improving cardiovascular health in people with diabetes. Her seminal studies on the association between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes complications helped establish the scientific foundation and clinical criteria for using HbA1c to diagnose diabetes. This Merit Award will support new research focusing on wearable continuous glucose monitors and their association with cardiometabolic risk in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. "An important part of our work will be providing opportunities for trainees to engage in research with direct implications for policy and clinical practice," Selvin said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a letter published in Nature Medicine, researchers highlight how mpox – traditionally spread from animals to humans – is now showing clear signs of sustained human-to-human transmission. Mpox usually spreads through close contact with an infected person or animal. That shift in how it's transmitted is leading to longer transmission chains and lasting outbreaks." Carlos Maluquer de Motes, Reader in Molecular Virology, University of Surrey The article notes that this change coincided with the rapid spread of clade IIb (a clade is a group of viruses that share a common ancestor) mpox viruses, but different clade I variants are now on the rise too. While it currently affects adults the most, the researchers stress that it has the potential to spread among other groups, including children, a group at greater risk of serious illness – although sustained transmission in children has not yet been reported. "Mpox control has to climb up the global health agenda. We have limited diagnostic tools and even fewer antiviral treatments. Unlike smallpox, mpox has an animal reservoir, meaning it can't be fully eradicated. The authors warn that unless international action is taken now – including investment in point-of-care testing and new treatments – mpox will continue to re-emerge and threaten global health.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by the "la Caixa" Foundation, has found that children exposed to higher levels of air pollution in early and mid childhood have weaker connections between key brain regions. These networks are systems of interconnected brain structures that work together to perform different cognitive functions, such as thinking, perceiving and controlling movement. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that air pollution may be associated with changes in the functional connectivity of brain networks, particularly in children. However, it is not yet fully understood how air pollution affects the development and maturation of these brain networks. Exposure to air pollution at the participants' residence, including particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ), was estimated using statistical models that combine actual measurements with environmental characteristics. The children were evaluated using resting state neuroimaging, meaning their brains were scanned while not performing any active task, at two time points: around the age of 10 and again at an average age of 14. Exposure to air pollution was analysed over two periods: from birth to three years of age and in the year before the neuroimaging assessment. This is one of the first studies to explore how air pollution affects brain connections at rest, using brain scans taken multiple times in a large group of children from birth." Michelle Kusters, ISGlobal researcher and first author of the study The results show that greater exposure to air pollution from birth to three years old is associated with lower connectivity between the amygdala and the cortical networks involved in attention, somatomotor function - which coordinates body movements - and auditory function. "These associations persist throughout adolescence, which may indicate persistent disruptions in the normal development of brain networks due to pollution exposure. Another recent study by the same team examined the relationship between exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and childhood, and changes in brain volume through adolescence. The results revealed that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy, particularly to fine particles (PM2.5) and copper, was associated with a smaller volume of the hippocampus, a crucial brain structure for memory function, at age 8. Despite the early effects on hippocampal volume, no significant associations were found between air pollution and other brain volumes, such as white matter, cortical grey matter, or the cerebellum. Given the widespread exposure to air pollution, these results reinforce the importance of policies aimed at reducing pollution levels, particularly in urban environments, to safeguard children's brain development," says Michelle Kusters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Industrial, environmental, and medical devices rely on pumps for a wide range of applications. Among the many pump types available, piston pumps and peristaltic pumps are frequently compared due to their distinct operating mechanisms and suitability for different tasks. In this article, we’ll highlight the advantages of Fluid Metering’s valveless piston pumps over peristaltic pumps, focusing on their low maintenance requirements and exceptional repeatability—key factors that make them a preferred choice. Known for their capacity to distribute fluids with great accuracy and consistency, their precision is especially critical in applications where even minor deviations in fluid administration can have serious repercussions, such as medical dosage or chemical processing. Unlike piston pumps, which can handle these demanding jobs without compromising performance, peristaltic pump designs have a maximum flow rate limit. Fluid Metering piston pumps are often made of materials that can withstand harsh conditions and abrasive fluids, making them a dependable choice for long-term use in medical settings. Due to the pressures and wear on peristaltic pump tubes, they often require replacement anywhere from a few hundred hours to several thousand hours of operation. Fluid Metering piston pumps can handle a variety of fluids, such as those with varying viscosities and abrasive particles. However, peristaltic pumps tend to struggle with highly viscous fluids or those containing solid particles, which limits their applicability. Another strong reason to use piston pumps is their efficiency. These pumps are designed to reduce energy loss while increasing fluid delivery efficiency. This not only reduces costs over time but also provides consistent performance even under changing operational conditions. Peristaltic pumps, while helpful in some situations, consume more energy and have lower efficiency due to friction between the tube and rollers. In contrast, the repeated compression of tubing in peristaltic pumps (image below) can cause them to degrade with time, necessitating regular replacement and increasing maintenance requirements. For more than 60 years, Fluid Metering engineers have designed and manufactured dependable, high-precision pumps. Their precision, high-pressure capabilities, durability, versatility, efficiency, and low maintenance requirements make them the ideal solution for industries that require dependable and consistent fluid delivery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The right pump for your application depends on factors like speed and pressure requirements—not all pumps are designed to handle both. Choosing a pump that falls short of these demands can lead to costly unplanned downtime, lost productivity, and even premature failure. Fluid Metering’s experts can help you select a pump that meets your specific speed and pressure needs, ensuring reliable performance. High speeds are also key to dispensing volumes at the microliter scale. However, higher speeds frequently cause pressure buildups within a system. A pump’s motor, and therefore the pump itself, will stall out if it is unable to accommodate high speeds and pressure. A stalled-out pump will be unable to dispense any more fluid, resulting in lost productivity, unplanned downtime, and excessive maintenance costs. Too much pressure may also result in fluid pumping backward within the pump, creating backflow. Too much pressure can also lead to incorrect dispensing volumes, which is an issue especially prevalent with viscous fluids. There are a number of key considerations when choosing the right pump for an application. It is important to consider any restrictions that could impact pump performance; for example, elbow bends, tubing connectors and other system features can create extra pressure. Motor type selection is also critical, and it is important to select a motor with enough torque to overcome any potential pressure restrictions in the system makeup. Fluid Metering offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions designed to ensure pump performance in line with end users’ expectations. If you're unsure which pump best fits your needs, reach out to the experts at Fluid Metering for a professional consultation. They can help you select the right pump to ensure optimal device performance and reliability. Beyond speed and pressure, several other factors should be considered when selecting the right pump for your application. Chemical compatibility is a key concern, especially with high-speed pump heads. As mentioned earlier, users handling small fluid volumes often require high-speed pumps to ensure precise dispensing and prevent fluid from adhering to the dispense tip. Understanding this before making a purchase is essential to ensuring optimal performance and efficiency. Fluid Metering, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It typically begins as noncancerous growths called polyps in the colon or rectum, which can become cancerous over time. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving survival rates. At this earliest stage, abnormal cells are found only in the innermost lining of the colon or rectum and have not spread to surrounding tissues. This stage is also referred to as carcinoma in situ. At this stage, cancer has spread into the deeper layers of the colon or rectum but has not reached the lymph nodes.1 Around 34.8 % of CRCs are identified at this localized stage, with a 5-year relative survival rate of 91.1 %.2 Approximately 75 % of individuals with stage II A colon cancer will be cancer-free five years post-treatment without additional chemotherapy. At this advanced stage, CRC has spread to distant organs, most commonly the lungs or liver. The five-year relative survival rate is around 13 %, although advances in treatment are improving outcomes for some patients.5 For individuals whose cancer has spread only to the lungs or liver, surgery may offer a potential cure. More patients with stage IV cancer are now living longer than two years. Polypectomy : Removal of polyps during a colonoscopy Surgery is most beneficial when the cancer is still in its early stages and has not spread to other parts of the body. Powerful chemicals are used to kill cancer cells. This is a systemic treatment that targets cells throughout the body. High-energy rays are used to target and destroy cancer cells, especially in cases of rectal cancer. Targeted therapies are designed to attack specific characteristics of cancer cells, preventing their growth while causing minimal damage to healthy cells. Examples include drugs that target epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), such as Panitumumab; drugs that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), such as Bevacizumab; and drugs like Encorafenib, which target cancer cells with BRAF gene mutations. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are used to enhance the immune system’s ability to target and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy is effective only in a subset of patients whose tumors have specific genetic alterations, such as high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mutations in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Early detection of colon cancer can significantly reduce mortality rates and improve 5-year survival probabilities.6 In the United States, the 5-year relative survival rate for stage I colon cancer is approximately 92 %. For stage IIB CRC, the 5-year relative survival rate drops to 65 %.7 Individuals rarely experience symptoms in the early stages of CRC, making regular screening essential. Incidence and mortality rates of CRC have decreased significantly in the United States following the implementation of effective CRC screening technologies.8 Screening can remove pre-cancerous polyps and help prevent the development of CRC.9 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends that individuals aged 45 to 75 undergo regular CRC screening. Those with a higher risk of CRC due to family history, certain conditions, or genetic diseases should begin screening earlier.10 Colonoscopy, a direct visualization test, is currently the most commonly used CRC screening method in the United States.11 Other visualization tests include virtual colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. CRC stool tests are widely used around the world. Since polyps and CRC may bleed, tests such as the guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT or iFOBT) can detect even small amounts of blood in the stool.13 Multitarget stool DNA testing (Cologuard) is an FDA-approved, stool-based test that detects both hemoglobin and specific DNA biomarkers.14 Colorectal cancer research breakthroughs are revolutionizing CRC diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the FDA has approved two blood-based assays for CRC screening. Epi proColon 2.0 is approved for screening individuals aged 50 and older. This test detects methylated SEPT9, a biological biomarker released by CRC cells. Shield is approved for screening individuals aged 45 and older. It analyzes plasma DNA for the presence of harmful gene mutations and other alterations. Stool tests are a non-invasive, safe, cost-effective, and simple method for screening CRC. Increasing evidence supports the effectiveness of fecal indicators in CRC screening. Proteins, DNA mutations, epigenetic markers, microorganisms, and volatile chemical compounds have all been identified and studied as potential CRC biomarkers in stool. The image below is adapted from an article by Quan Ding et al.15 It highlights several stool biomarkers associated with CRC. Image Credit: Diagram adopted from an article written by Quan Ding et al (12) DNA mutations are among the most extensively studied and widely used indicators for CRC. For example, mutated KRAS genes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, eventually resulting in cancer. KRAS mutations are found in approximately 40 % of CRC cases. Mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway can also serve as CRC biomarkers. This pathway promotes the generation of new cells to replace those lost over time, which is essential for maintaining intestinal function. Mutations in the Wnt pathway cause dysregulated cell growth and division, which can lead to cancer. Such mutations are present in more than 90 % of CRC patients. Image Credit: Diagram adopted from an article written by meng et al. (2021) (32) Fecal microRNAs (miRNAs) show promise as non-invasive diagnostic and screening biomarkers. These miRNAs remain stable and detectable in stool samples because they are packaged in exosomes, which protect them from degradation. Notably, fecal miRNA detection typically requires only 1 gram of stool, making the method well-suited for clinical use. Recent studies have linked specific miRNAs to CRC. These findings support the effectiveness of fecal miRNAs as biomarkers for CRC detection and monitoring. Another intriguing discovery that has opened new possibilities for CRC screening is the ability to profile small RNA in addition to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT).18 Birkeland et al. published a study in the journal Molecular Cancer. Using Norgen Biotek's RNA stabilizing solution and Stool Total RNA Purification Kit, the researchers demonstrated that the human miRNome can be detected in residual FIT samples across populations, and that small RNA biomarker analysis can supplement FIT in large-scale screening settings. The researchers also found that miRNAs from residual FIT samples show varying abundances between CRC patients and healthy individuals.18 Associative studies using metagenomic approaches have identified bacterial species that are enriched in CRC. These microorganisms may serve as biomarkers for disease screening, prognosis, and response to therapy.19 Next-generation sequencing technology has enabled the analysis of microbiomes from sources such as the human gut, allowing researchers to explore taxonomic and metabolomic links between the microbiome and cancer. The relationship between colon cancer and the human gut microbiome has been studied extensively, with varying results. However, these studies consistently show that microbiota associated with a plant-based diet are linked to a reduced risk of colon cancer. A plant-based diet promotes the growth of microbiota that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These SCFAs have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inducing T-regulatory cells in colonic tissues.20 Norgen Biotek is a market leader in stool DNA/RNA preservation and isolation systems, specifically designed for biomarker research. Norgen’s advanced reagents effectively stabilize nucleic acids for extended periods, resulting in consistent and reliable cancer diagnostics and research outcomes. Independent studies have shown that Norgen Biotek's stool preservative outperforms competitors in maintaining gut flora from stool samples.21,22 Additionally, the preservative supports metabolomic studies, such as SCFA analysis.23 Norgen Biotek's cutting-edge technology for stool DNA, RNA, and nucleotide isolation addresses two of the most common challenges in working with stool samples: the presence of humic acid and DNA fragmentation. As a result, these kits efficiently isolate high-quality DNA or RNA from fecal samples. Beyond preservation, Norgen Biotek also offers comprehensive next-generation sequencing services for small RNA, miRNA, and metagenomics applications. Each service includes a detailed, project-specific bioinformatics report, providing researchers with actionable insights tailored to their study’s objectives. Colorectal cancer is a serious but preventable disease if detected early. Advances in diagnostics, such as biomarker analysis and innovative solutions from Norgen Biotek, are paving the way for improved outcomes. Prioritizing screenings, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and staying informed can help reduce your risk of developing colorectal cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thought Leaders Dr. Yifan Jian Associate Professor Oregon Health and Science University That’s when I was first introduced to OCT, its applications in eye imaging, and adaptive optics. After completing my PhD in 2014, I stayed in Vancouver for a few years before being recruited by Dr. David Huang—one of the co-inventors of OCT—at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). I joined the faculty to continue developing OCT and other eye imaging systems there. How have these fields evolved since you began your research? Today, OCT is one of the most important diagnostic tools in ophthalmology, particularly for retinal diseases. Its rise coincided with the development of new treatments for retinal conditions, such as anti-VEGF therapy. Researchers have also worked on enhancing resolution axially and transversely using techniques such as adaptive optics. Beyond structural imaging, new contrast mechanisms have emerged, such as OCT angiography for visualizing blood vessels and optoretinography to study how photoreceptors respond to light. When I moved to OHSU, my focus shifted towards expanding the field of view. Instead of zooming in to capture tiny cellular details, I worked on imaging the entire retina, providing a comprehensive view of the retinal health which is critical for clinical applications. What were some key challenges in developing ultrawide-field OCT systems, and how do they advance imaging for complex retinal conditions? This prolongs imaging sessions, increasing the likelihood of motion artifacts and patient discomfort. The solution is higher-speed OCT systems, which we achieve using advanced laser technology. Swept-source OCT systems require high-speed digitizers and sophisticated data processing tools. We address this using GPUs to process data in real-time. We needed a high-quality optical system with custom-designed lenses to effectively direct light across the entire retina. Initially, we tried adapting ophthalmic lenses used in other imaging modalities, but they were not optimized for OCT, so they lacked the necessary optical quality and performance for our ultra-wide-field imaging goals. This required a deep dive into optical design and simulation software to develop high-performance lens systems. Compared to other companies, Avantier offered a reasonable and affordable approach, which was crucial for us as we ventured into custom lens design for the first time. The results have been outstanding—our systems now provide high-quality, ultrawide-field images that are being used in clinics for conditions like diabetic retinopathy and in neonatal intensive care units to screen premature infants for retinopathy of prematurity. This collaboration has enabled us to push the boundaries of ultrawide-field OCT, ensuring our systems achieve the highest possible performance for both research and clinical applications. Our ultrawide-field OCT systems have significantly expanded the scope of retinal imaging. Handheld and desktop configurations allow comprehensive analysis of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, which has important applications in conditions like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration. This technology is particularly valuable for myopia management, allowing us to track how eye shape changes. We are also using ultrawide-field OCT in ocular oncology to precisely measure tumors inside the eye. Traditional imaging methods like MRI or ultrasound lack the resolution necessary, whereas OCT provides highly detailed structural information. This allows us to acquire images in parallel, significantly speeding up the process. One promising application is using AI to analyze OCT scans for signs of systemic health conditions like cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s, and other neurological disorders. The retina provides a unique window into overall health - AI algorithms can extract subtle biomarkers from OCT images that are difficult for human observers to detect, which could massively enhance diagnostic capabilities. If low-cost devices became available in places like pharmacies or optical retail stores, AI-powered OCT screening could become a routine part of healthcare, making early disease detection far more accessible. Among your numerous publications, are there any particular studies or findings that have significantly impacted your field or hold personal significance to you? One of my earliest and most impactful works was on GPU-accelerated OCT image processing. OCT generates massive amounts of data, and processing it in real time is crucial, especially for applications like neonatal imaging, where infants won’t stay still for long. Traditional CPUs weren’t fast enough, so we developed a system that uses GPUs—specifically NVIDIA video cards—to dramatically speed up the process. This real-time image processing capability changed how we use OCT. It allows clinicians to see cross-sectional and 3D retina views instantly while scanning, providing immediate feedback for diagnosis. The software we developed over a decade ago is still widely used in research labs worldwide today. My research on adaptive optics for high-resolution imaging was another significant contribution. We developed a system that does not rely on wavefront sensors but instead iteratively optimizes image quality. My work on retinopathy of prematurity has been particularly meaningful more recently. Using ultrawide-field handheld OCT, we have redefined the disease’s diagnostic criteria, identifying new biomarkers that were previously undetectable with conventional imaging—this could improve early diagnosis and treatment. Higher-speed OCT will allow for larger field-of-view imaging and functional assessments such as optoretinography, which can evaluate photoreceptor function in real time. In research, we will continue pushing for higher resolution and better contrast mechanisms, such as oxygen saturation mapping. Thoughtful optical design will be critical to push the limits of what OCT can reveal. What advice would you give students or early-career researchers interested in biomedical imaging? I encourage young researchers to focus on projects with strong translational potential. In a clinical setting, you see real-world challenges in diagnosis and treatment—our role as researchers is to develop solutions that can make a real impact. Working on technologies that can be applied within a 5–10-year timeframe is incredibly rewarding. Dr. Yifan Jian is an Associate Professor at Casey Eye Institute specializing in optical imaging. Currently, his main research focus is advancing ultrawide-field OCT systems.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>insights from industry Mohammad Akhlaq Head of Automation LabGenius Therapeutics In this interview, News Medical speaks with Mohammad Aklaq at LabGenius Therapeutics about how automation and machine learning are pioneering the discovery of complex antibodies following the company’s recent expansion of its EVA™ platform. To start, can you tell us a little about your role at LabGenius Therapeutics and what excites you most about working on automation in antibody discovery? At LabGenius Therapeutics, I’m focused on applying my expertise and experience in automation and assay development to increase our experimental throughput while maintaining data quality. LabGenius has recently expanded its platform with a high-throughput workcell. I’ll start by giving a brief overview of the platform. The EVA™ platform works by combining active learning with automated functional screening in a closed loop. This approach, which is largely free from human bias, allows us to explore large areas of antibody design space and ultimately discover high-performing molecules, often with non-intuitive designs. What specific technical improvements or automation advancements made that possible? Working with Beckman Coulter as our preferred integration partner has been instrumental — bringing together a considered selection of over 33 devices onto a single platform is no trivial task. The partnership has enabled us to build a highly complex molecular biology workflow that delivers purified and sequence-verified DNA, ready for mammalian cell transfection. Increasing experimental throughput directly strengthens your machine learning-driven discovery process. Can you explain how this additional data improves the predictive power of your models? This is important because many high-performing molecules have non-intuitive designs. In other words, there often isn’t an obvious relationship between a molecular design and its function, so many of our high-performing molecules wouldn’t have been discovered by a human protein engineer. Scaling up data generation is one part of the equation, but how do you ensure that the data remains high-quality and disease-relevant as throughput increases? For instance, all experimental data are automatically uploaded to the cloud and processed using purpose-built data pipelines that address processes like QC, normalization, and curve fitting. This reduces the chances of introducing human error and frees up our scientists’ time to focus on more fruitful experimental work. With this increased capacity, LabGenius can now run more antibody discovery programs in parallel. How does this impact the speed and efficiency of bringing potential therapeutics to development? This means we can collaborate with pharmaceutical partners on joint programs while also keeping the momentum behind our wholly-owned pipeline of assets. Putting together such a sophisticated platform inevitably has its challenges. As we anticipated, the biggest hurdle was ensuring its mechanical and biological robustness. Working collaboratively with the team at Beckman Coulter enabled rigorous testing to ensure reproducible results. Looking ahead, how do you see automation and machine learning continuing to shape the future of antibody discovery? Our high-throughput characterization data, when combined with ML, allows us to co-optimize these increasingly complex multispecific/multivalent antibody formats with sophisticated modes of action, ultimately setting a new standard for safety and efficacy. Are there any upcoming innovations or improvements you’re particularly excited about in LabGenius’ pipeline? We’re really excited by our molecules’ ability to overcome on-target, off-tumour toxicity, a drawback too often associated with approved anti-tumour therapies. By leveraging avidity-driven selectivity, the antibodies in our pipeline can differentiate between healthy and diseased cells based on differential TAA expression. This is exciting because, with conventional methods, we see only a marginal widening of the therapeutic window, whereas our approach achieves complete on/off killing selectivity. There are always new opportunities to enhance our platform and keep up with the latest scientific innovations. The next milestone we are working towards is the onboarding of increasingly more sophisticated antibody designs — for example, we’re currently onboarding tri- and tetra-specific antibodies with complex modes of action. Mohammed joined LabGenius from Charles River, where he specialized in the development and automation of complex assays. Prior to that, he spent 23 years at Novartis, refining high-throughput screening methods.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Excess weight in mid-life is a known risk factor for kidney cancer, but new research indicates that weight patterns throughout life may also affect an individual’s likelihood of developing this malignancy. To assess weight patterns and their associations with kidney cancer and its different subtypes, investigators analyzed information on 204,364 individuals from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, including body mass index (BMI) data when participants entered the study (an average age of 61.6 years), and prior BMI recordings at 18, 35, and 50 years of age. The team noted that there were 1,425 cases of kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), among the study’s participants, with 583 having aggressive RCC and 339 having fatal RCC. Higher BMI at any of the ages assessed was linked with higher risks of overall RCC and all subtypes (except chromophobe RCC), with a 10-40% higher risk for each 5-unit increase in BMI. Similar increased risks were linked to weight gain during adulthood that resulted in overweight or obesity, compared with maintaining normal BMI. Weight loss in which BMI was reduced by at least 10%, particularly later in life, was associated with a lower risk of RCC. Specifically, weight loss from age 18–35 years and after age 50 years was associated with 21% and 28% reductions in RCC incidence, respectively. These findings emphasize that maintaining a healthy weight across one’s lifetime is important for reducing RCC risk. More importantly, weight loss, even later in life, may offer protective benefits,” Zhengyi Deng, PhD, lead author, Stanford University School of Medicine Some of these include lifestyle interventions, weight-loss programs, and emerging medical treatments for obesity; however, individuals should consult with their healthcare providers prior to initiation of any plan.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The proliferation of progenitor cells in response to injury is a crucial step in the regeneration of sensory receptors, but this process is blocked in the mammalian inner ear and retina. By understanding the genes that enforce this block, we can advance efforts to restore hearing and vision in patients." Ksenia Gnedeva, PhD, Assistant Professor in the USC Tina and Rick Caruso Department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, and the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC In the study, first authors Eva Jahanshir and Juan Llamas from the Gnedeva lab focused on a group of interacting genes called the Hippo pathway, which serve as a "stop growing" signal that the lab has shown to inhibit cell proliferation in the ear during embryonic development. When exposed to this drug-like compound in a Petri dish, the progenitor cells known as supporting cells responded by proliferating in the utricle, which is a sensory organ in the inner ear that helps with balance. The scientists next identified what was blocking this important step towards sensory cell regeneration in the organ of Corti - a gene encoding a protein called p27Kip1 - and showed that this inhibitory protein was also high in the retina. They created a transgenic mouse in which the level of p27Kip1 could be reduced in the inner ear and the retina to see how that would impact the proliferation of progenitor cells in response in both organs. "There have been reports that p27Kip1 levels drop following injury, so that might offer a brief window of opportunity for using a drug-like compound to inhibit the Hippo pathway and encourage regeneration in the ear and the eye," said Gnedeva. So, our discoveries have identified potential new targets for stimulating the regeneration of both hearing and vision."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On average, only 10 % of the human population is left-handed. Interestingly, five out of the last nine American presidents have been left-handed: Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford (approximately 55 %). This macro-scale human motor asymmetry has intrigued researchers for centuries. Even in antiquity, these terms carried dual meanings of awkward and skillful, respectively. Today, "sinister" has taken on an even more negative connotation. During the Inquisition, mere left-handedness was sufficient to condemn a woman as a witch, leading to the execution of numerous innocent left-handed individuals.1 Researchers have long sought clues to this asymmetry, with some proposing that the greater mortality of left-handers in battles has contributed to the higher prevalence of right-handedness today. Beyond myths, understanding handedness is also pertinent to understanding brain lateralization, and recent research indicates that this macro-scale asymmetry can be traced down to the molecular level. Furthermore, different regions of the brain are responsible for distinct functions. However, more recent studies indicate that although each hemisphere has different specializations, there is extensive communication through the nerve fibers of the corpus callosum, allowing both halves to work collaboratively. For example, the left hemisphere has traditionally been linked to processing mathematical equations; however, research shows that the right hemisphere also contributes to spatial awareness during complex calculations, understanding numbers with zeros, and representing numbers in a nonverbal manner. Similarly, language processing has been attributed to the left brain, yet the right hemisphere plays a significant role in comprehending context and non-literal language, including metaphors and irony. The importance of the right hemisphere in the emotional and contextual aspects of language may explain why left-handed individuals often excel as orators and are frequently found in successful political roles. Understanding left-handedness is more significant than merely defining personality types; gross motor lateralization may be part of molecular-based cues within a larger developmental framework. Upon further examination, it becomes clear that most biomolecules are asymmetric or chiral. Chirality refers to the three-dimensional molecular asymmetry that prevents a molecule from being superimposed on its mirror image. Most DNA exists as right-handed double helices; imagine walking down a DNA staircase, where one would turn to the right. For instance, nearly all organisms exclusively produce and metabolize left-handed amino acids while utilizing right-handed sugars, highlighting the importance of chirality in biological processes. Current research is uncovering the mechanistic connections between genetics and asymmetry at the cellular, organ, and organism levels. Research indicates that genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and social factors all contribute to handedness. Notably, while the proportion of left-handed individuals among twins aligns with that of the general population, studies have shown a higher concordance rate of handedness among monozygotic (identical) twins compared to dizygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on handedness.2 Initial Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) faced challenges in identifying statistically significant genetic markers for left-handedness. However, advancements in biobanks have facilitated studies with larger population sizes, leading to statistically significant findings. Furthermore, a GWAS study analyzed brain imaging and genome sequencing data from over 32,000 UK Biobank participants and discovered 27 independent genetic variants significantly associated with structural brain asymmetry. Nearly half of these loci were associated with genes that code for tubulins or microtubule-associated proteins. However, the majority of the regions fell outside of protein-coding genes and were instead involved in regulating gene expression. A recent study based on exome data from over 350,000 individuals in the UK Biobank has also identified rare coding variants that may be linked to left-handedness.3 The primary population-wide genomic methodologies for assessing genetic variation related to specific diseases or conditions include genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and whole-exome sequencing (WES). GWAS typically involves targeted genotyping of pre-selected variants utilizing microarrays or selective sequencing. These studies can identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or structural variations within intronic or exonic regions of the genome. Exome-wide studies are particularly useful for detecting rare variants, as they allow for greater sequencing depth at a similar cost. Traditionally, whole-exome sequencing has been conducted on tissue samples; however, there is now a noticeable shift toward utilizing plasma and other bodily fluids. Analyzing plasma from a liquid biopsy is significantly less invasive than a tissue biopsy, and whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) from liquid biopsies has demonstrated the capability to uncover tumor-associated biomarkers and potential clues regarding the tissue of origin.5 Whole-exome sequencing reveals a rare protein-coding variant associated with left-handedness A recent study has also utilized the extensive resources of the UK Biobank to analyze exome data from 38,043 left-handed individuals and 313,271 right-handed individuals. Previous research has linked TUBB4B variants to sensorineural and ciliopathic disorders. Across the population studied, most TUBB4B variants were identified as heterozygous missense alterations. Notably, this study observed two frameshift mutations occurring exclusively in left-handed individuals, both predicted to induce degradation of the TUBB4B RNA transcript through nonsense-mediated decay. Consequently, these frameshift variants are anticipated to result in haploinsufficiency. These genes warrant further investigation, as they have been previously implicated in autism and schizophrenia through exome screening. While individuals carrying these rare coding variants are more likely to be left-handed, burden heritability analysis estimated the contribution of these variants to left-handed heritability at only 1 %. Although the precise mechanism by which microtubules influence human handedness remains unclear, evidence suggests that microtubules may play a role in cellular chirality during early brain development, subsequently affecting the formation of the brain’s left-right axis. One study has indicated that left-handed individuals may face a slightly elevated risk of accidental injuries and death, likely due to the predominance of tools and devices designed for right-handed usage.6 Others have suggested that while left-handed attackers may possess an advantage by striking from the left side, left-handed defenders may be at a disadvantage, leading to a higher risk of injury in self-defense situations. Although some research has proposed that left-handed individuals have shorter lifespans, more recent studies indicate that factors such as changing societal pressures, such as the historical coercion of left-handed individuals to switch to right-handedness, have influenced these findings.7 When models account for the increasing proportion of left-handed individuals over time, there is no significant difference in lifespan between left-handed and right-handed individuals. This increase in left-handedness over time also serves as a confounding factor in studies examining the effects of left-handedness on diseases that impact longevity. There appears to be a notable association between left-handedness and certain psychotic disorders. Among patients with mental disorders, approximately 40 % of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder are left-handed, a figure four times higher than the prevalence of left-handedness in the general population.8 Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have also revealed reduced expression levels of certain tubulin-associated genes (e.g., TUBA1B) and proteins in specific brain regions. However, individuals receiving treatment with antipsychotic medications did not exhibit lower levels of TUBA1B. These results contribute to the hypothesis that a disruption in cytoskeletal homeostasis may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. This notion is further supported by research on clozapine, one of the few effective medications for schizophrenia, which directly binds to α and β tubulin heterodimers, inhibiting their polymerization during microtubule formation and disrupting the microtubule network.9,10 Recent research indicates that left-handed individuals face a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Studies have demonstrated that left-handed individuals exhibit lower vascular endothelial function and an inverse relationship between artery dilation, specifically flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and mean arterial pressure. FMD refers to the widening of an artery in response to increased blood flow, and low FMD is a strong predictor of CVD. In left-handed individuals, as mean arterial pressure rises, FMD decreases; conversely, right-handed individuals show no correlation, with FMD remaining stable across a range of arterial pressures. While the overall impact of handedness on life expectancy remains a topic of debate, data suggests a higher prevalence of certain health conditions among left-handed individuals compared to their right-handed counterparts.11 Produced from material originally authored by Alison Waller.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interest in cell therapy has increased in recent years, with additional focus on leveraging this as a strategy to fight tumors by harnessing the immune system. Cell therapy technologies include reprogramming patients’ own T cells to produce personalized medicines. T-cell therapy capitalizes on the immune system’s capacity to recognize and kill tumor cells- an ability that may be overwhelmed or lost as cancer develops. Rapid, accurate assays to qualify engineered T-cells’ potency against the target tumor cell are critical. These assays are key to supporting the effective and efficient development of therapeutics. This article examines a new picodroplet approach specifically designed for the functional validation of CAR-T cells. This robust and user-friendly method combines the advantages of a granzyme B assay suitable for studying cell-mediated cytotoxicity with Sphere Bio’s advanced high-throughput picodroplet technology (Figure 1). This can be captured as it is released by the T cell, enabling determination of the level of potential anti-cancer activity. Picodroplet-based technology is a highly promising microfluidic-based technique designed for single-cell functional analysis. This technology offers a range of advantages over traditional tools. For example, picodroplets provide a distinct microenvironment suitable for high-throughput cell-cell interaction studies and cell secretion analysis at the single-cell level. The use of miniaturized picoliter volumes enables rapid mixing and minimal sample dilution, factors key to increasing detection sensitivity while reducing reaction time and sample requirements. Workflow depicting high throughput CAR-T cell function verification in microfluidic picodroplets. A commercially available granzyme B assay kit (SensoLyte® Granzyme B Activity Assay Kit, Anaspec, Fremont, CA) was adapted for use in picodroplets, allowing it to be used to detect the release of granzyme B in picodroplets. This is due to the nearby QXL®-520 molecule’s quenching effect (Figure 2A). Right: CAR-T cell interaction with target cell results in CAR-mediated signal, Granzyme B release, substrate peptide cleavage, release of the quencher, and fluorescence, which are then detected. Two populations of picodroplets at approximately 450 pL volume were initially generated using the Pico-Capture® instrument to demonstrate the assay’s general feasibility. Figure 3 features micrographs of both populations in brightfield (left) and green fluorescence (right) following 2 hours’ incubation at 37 ºC. It can be observed that only picodroplets containing both granzyme B and the substrate peptide (bottom) exhibit clearly detectable fluorescence after the 2-hour incubation period. In contrast, picodroplets with substrate peptide only (top) exhibit very low to no background fluorescence. Next, co-encapsulated polyclonal human donor T cells were genetically modified to express a CAR directed against Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA). This involved target cells expressing PSMA (PC3-LN3-PSMA) and the fluorogenic granzyme B substrate peptide. An in-house custom-made biochip was employed, featuring two separate aqueous inlets to ensure that CAR T and target cells were kept separate until immediately prior to encapsulation. This was done alongside the fluorogenic peptide substrate under otherwise identical conditions. Detection of Granzyme B activity in picodroplets using a fluorogenic 5-FAM/ QXL®-520 substrate peptide. An Eppendorf tube was used to collect picodropets, and these were imaged under a fluorescence microscope after 2, 4, and 24 hours of incubation to detect granzyme B activity. Figure 4 features fluorescent micrographs of picodroplets containing non-expressing control cells (top) and PC3-LN3-PSMA target cells (bottom), as these were imaged after 2, 4, and 24 hours (left to right). Picodroplets containing PC3-LN3 control cells were seen to demonstrate very little granzyme B activity after 2-4 hours. Multiple fluorescent picodroplets are indicative of granzyme B released by CAR-T cells in response to encountering one or more target cell(s) in the case of picodroplets with PC3-LN3-PSMA cells. Increased fluorescence was observed in the negative control following prolonged incubation (24 hours), potentially due to granzyme B leaking from dead or apoptotic CAR-T cells or from other unspecific stimulation. Fluorescence micrographs of picodroplets after 2, 4, and 24 h (left to right). This was done using Sphere Bio’s Cyto-Mine® Single Cell Analysis System. This was done using Sphere Bio’s Pico-Capture® instrument. Figure 5 features scatter plots of picodroplet size (y-axis) versus green fluorescence (x-axis) obtained at the specified time points. A clear fluorescent signal was detectable in around 1.25% of picodroplets at the earliest time point, with this positive population increasing over time to 2.95% of picodroplets after a 2-hour period. Because just 15% of picodroplets contain both a CAR-T cell and at least one target cell, this figure corresponds to an actual positive rate of around 20%. Figure 6 features both a brightfield (left) and fluorescent micrograph (right) of picodroplets in the Cyto-Cartridge®’s dispensing chamber. A clear enrichment of fluorescent picodroplets is apparent. Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software and a Hough Circle Transform algorithm, resulting in 1,112 picodroplets. It was determined that 170 of these picodroplets contained little to no fluorescence (for example, a false positive, or based on near background signal and a dark picodroplet border), while 942 picodroplets (around 85%) were deemed to be true positives. This result corresponds to a 28-fold enrichment versus the non-sorted population with 2.95% positives after 2 hours of incubation. Detection of Granzyme B activity in picodroplets with Cyto-Mine®.

Current strategies depend on screening in bulk cultures to establish CAR-T cell product profiles. Cytotoxicity readouts can be time-consuming and are not currently included in all cell products’ release criteria. This data is gathered after the fact or not at all. Cell therapy developers could also leverage this co-encapsulation approach to interrogate other readouts of cellular fitness and cytotoxicity. Bulk T cell cultures exhibit a range of phenotypic and metabolic subsets. Investigating cytotoxic efficacy at the single T cell level could provide useful data on each of these subsets individually, guiding T cell engineering towards more potent subsets. Co-encapsulation in picodroplets could also enable the rapid screening of candidate CAR/TCR gene-modified cells for drug development. Produced from materials originally authored by Sphere Bio Ltd.
