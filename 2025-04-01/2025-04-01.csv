Newsmax stock (NMAX) soared as high as 132% Tuesday, extending its massive 735% gain on Monday following the conservative cable news outlet's IPO.

Newsmax raised $75 million in its IPO Friday, with shares priced at $10. The outlet's rapid ascent in its first two days of trading pushed its market cap to $16.7 billion early Tuesday, with shares at one point reaching a high of roughly $194.

The stock pared gains midday, up around 78% to roughly $149, putting the company's market cap at just over $13 billion.

“This incredibly successful offering, combined with our previous Preferred Offering, provides us with the capital and financial freedom to accelerate our growth initiatives, expand our programming, and further enhance our digital presence,” said CEO Christopher Ruddy, a media mogul and friend of President Trump who founded the company in 1998.

Newsmax, which became a cable TV network in 2014, has faced an onslaught of critiques and legal battles for touting conspiracy theories. The company is facing an ongoing lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems seeking $1.6 billion in damages related to false claims it made in its coverage of the 2020 election, which Newsmax cited among risk factors to its business in its latest 10-K filing to the SEC.

Newsmax settled another lawsuit with another election tech company, Smartmatic, in 2024 for similar claims and has paid $20 million of the $40 million settlement thus far, according to the filing. The news outlet, seen as a Fox News alternative, also drew criticism when it reported false claims and conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol.

While Newsmax's revenue soared roughly 26% to roughly $171 million in 2024, the company lost $72 million that year. The company also said in its filing that it has identified ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting controls such that there may be ""a material misstatement"" in its financial statements that it may not detect ""on a timely basis.""

It could be time to kick the tires on Microsoft stock (MSFT) after a 12% first quarter beating.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria added the tech behemoth to his ""Top Picks"" list on Tuesday.

""We believe investors underappreciate the GenAI innovation Microsoft brings throughout the infrastructure and application layers, and view the recent underperformance of the shares as a buying opportunity,"" Jaluria wrote in a client note. ""We believe that Azure growth can reaccelerate, driven by AI momentum, capacity continuing to come online, and the Azure 'AI halo effect' coming into play.""

Reasons behind the bullish call include Microsoft being a market leader in enterprise software and public cloud through Azure. He expects Microsoft to maintain a low teens percentage compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2026.

Listen: What Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates thinks about Nvidia

He added that Microsoft is likely to enter new markets, such as hyperautomation, to drive its growth. Lastly, Microsoft's Office installed base will likely continue to expand.

Jaluria slapped Microsoft with a $500 price target (assumes 33% upside from current price levels) and an Outperform rating.

The $500 price target is about average among the sell-side analysts that cover Microsoft, according to Yahoo Finance data. Of the 58 analysts who publish research on Microsoft, 91% rate the stock a Strong Buy or Buy.

Microsoft's stock was the fourth-worst performer from the ""Magnificent Seven"" in the first quarter. Tesla (TSLA) led declines with a 38% drop, Nvidia (NVDA) fell 21%, Google (GOOG) declined 19%, and Amazon (AMZN) shed 14%.

The drivers behind the Microsoft sell-off in the first quarter are threefold.

First, investors have rotated out of large-cap tech names and into perceived safe-haven assets like gold and healthcare stocks with Trump tariff fears running rampant. Second, ever since DeepSeek's breakthrough development in January, investors have been concerned that AI investment will slow materially in 2025.

Microsoft has been an aggressive investor in AI infrastructure, most notably seen in its backing of OpenAI.

And lastly, Microsoft's fourth quarter left some things to be desired.

Microsoft's Commercial Cloud segment sales, which includes cloud services sales, saw revenue rise 21% year over year to $40 billion. It was shy of Wall Street expectations of $41.1 billion. Microsoft's intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, saw revenue of $25.5 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $25.8 billion.

Cloud gross margin came in light versus estimates.

Watch: The biggest investing mistakes you keep making

The company will have some proving to do to Wall Street when it reports earnings in late April.

But one of its main chip suppliers has offered a clue that the market's fears about slowing AI investment may be overdone.

""The need for compute continues to be immense,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su told me in a Yahoo Finance exclusive interview on Monday (video above). ""We see that throughout all of our customers globally, and we're going to continue to invest strongly in this area because I think this is the single most important technology. I like to say it's the single most important technology of the last 50 years.""

Economic data releases and earnings

If all goes according to plan on ""Liberation Day"" — President Trump's term for Wednesday's scheduled reciprocal tariffs — the trade war showdown will be the starting point of a new American era, of a nationalistic economy that boosts our self-sufficiency and prosperity.

But even if every aspect of the president's agenda falls into place, there's a laundry list of things that will have to go right for it to work out. Things that essentially seem impossible.

First off, the countries whose imports would be tariffed need to do nothing, instead of unleashing a wave of repercussions that would nullify or complicate the imagined progress of an America First platform.

The rollout itself has to be clean, without the expected messiness of retaliatory tariffs and chaos at US ports.

                            Terms

                            Privacy Policy
                        
 

The tariffs, any further tit-for-tat levies, and rollout need to be a historical economic exception that boosts growth and doesn't end up kickstarting a brutal disruption for businesses and consumers.

Businesses need to get creative as international trade continues to be reshaped by policy and torpedoed relationships with allies and trading partners.

Consumers need to be patient, forgiving, and team players willing to make sacrifices. While the White House contends that the price increases triggered by tariffs will be fleeting, consumers have made it plain they're fed up with inflation. Relying on a theory that tariff-inspired price increases will only be transitory — and that Americans will be willing to accept them — seems an economically and politically dangerous gamble. Consumers will improbably have to play along.

""Liberation Day"" also puts the Federal Reserve in a jam. If the Fed cuts rates to reverse flagging growth — yet another “best case” scenario for Trump that isn't ideal for the rest of us — the central bank risks driving up inflation. And those rate cuts will come in the form of a monetary rescue mission instead of a final, easing maneuver in a soft landing.

And then, all of this needs to crystalize into a sentiment, growth, and earnings boom.

That's an incredible string of green lights the Trump administration needs to hit. Or holes-in-one; pick your metaphor. Which is why, as many economists, strategists, and analysts — people incentivized by being correct, not politically correct — have noted, the upside may be limited, but the downside is a black pit.

If Trump's antagonistic negotiating leads to deals with our trading partners, there's still a lot that would need to happen for the market to return to glory and for businesses and consumers to shed their anxieties.

Even a narrower tariff rollout would arrive with an array of caveats and carveouts. Wall Street analysts and business leaders would still have to qualify their thinking of ""this isn't as bad as we thought"" with a ""for now"" clause. And in the meantime, the agonizing run-up has already done damage. A months-long protectionist realignment isn't just a mindset, it's now been baked into operations and expectations.

Just because the April 2 tariff guessing game has passed doesn't mean tariff uncertainty will end. If nothing is set in stone, the potential for future disruption continues to hang over markets.

Oops, something went wrong

Stagflation has become the latest buzzword in financial markets as President Trump promises more tariffs, with reciprocal levies set to come as soon as Wednesday. 

Concerns about stagflation, a bleak economic scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises, have risen following a string of disappointing data releases, the Trump administration's shifting trade narrative, and other policy unknowns, including recent efforts to cut government jobs from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

""It's really a shame that Trump is so willing to take a wrecking ball to the economy,"" Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""It has been very resilient over the past three years in the face of the tightening of monetary policy.""

Yardeni upped his probability of the US entering a stagflation period to 45% from the prior 35%, adding that the scenario includes the possibility of a shallow recession during the second half of this year.

The strategist pointed to several economic indicators, including faltering manufacturing activity and higher prices paid by purchasing managers, warning, ""The higher inflation part of stagflation is almost a certainty.""

On Friday, data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed consumers spent less than forecast in March while inflation rose more than anticipated — a sign that stagflation cracks are beginning to show up in hard economic data, or objective metrics. That coincided with weak survey and sentiment readings, often referred to as soft economic data, which highlighted increased pessimism on the outlook for inflation and the US labor market.

Notably, the Federal Reserve has maintained a base case that tariff-induced inflation will be ""transitory"" and, therefore, have a short-term impact on price growth. This was reflected in the central bank's latest projections, which forecast year-end PCE inflation rising to 2.7% before reaching its 2% target by 2027.

But economists have argued that ""transitory"" inflation remains an unrealistic expectation.

""We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation,"" Capital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown wrote in reaction to the decision.

Along with higher inflation, economists argue growth risks remain tilted to the downside, mostly due to the ripple effects of Trump's tariff unknowns. Currently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tracker, which analyzes incoming data points, signals negative growth of 2.8% in Q1.

At its most recent policy meeting, which concluded on March 19, the Fed lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast to 1.7% from the prior 2.1%, noting in the policy statement, ""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased.""

But as tariffs serve as the most immediate threat to growth and inflation, a resilient US labor market continues to assure Wall Street watchers the economy can avoid a recession — at least for now.

""I would get a lot more concerned if the labor market were to start to crack,"" Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, told Yahoo Finance on Monday. ""As long as we're generating job growth, we're generating income growth, and then there's room to spend.""

As a result, Bhave said he doesn't see recent data points as recession precursors.

""We see this as a soft patch,"" he said. ""Nominal spending still looks OK. Most importantly, the labor market is holding up, and I won't give up on the US consumer as long as the labor market holds up.""

The March jobs report, set for release on Friday, will serve as the latest test. Economists polled by Bloomberg expect the US labor market added 135,000 jobs in the month, down from the 151,000 seen in February. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.

Oops, something went wrong

After a brutal first quarter, the verdict is out on whether to dip one's toes into the ""Magnificent Seven"" carnage.

""Probably what's been happening is they feel heavy — in there's so much gains in them and not a lot of new buyers who don't understand the story and had already participated,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. ""Also a big concern right now is that tech is overspending.""

Those concerns led to an uncharacteristic start to 2025 for the once market-leading cohort.

The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index plunged 16% in the first quarter, erasing some $2.4 trillion in market cap. By comparison, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 8.5% in the quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial (^DJI) shed 6%.

Tesla (TSLA) was the worst-performing Magnificent Seven stock in the quarter, down 36%. Nvidia (NVDA) tanked 17%. Alphabet (GOOG) lost 18%. Amazon (AMZN) declined 14%. Microsoft (MSFT) clocked in with an 11% fall. Apple (AAPL) lost 9%.

Read more about today's Magnificent Seven stock moves and market action.

Only Meta (META) managed to outperform the S&P 500 for much of the first quarter. But after jumping 26% between January and February, its stock finished the quarter down 6%.

There are company-specific factors at play for the Magnificent Seven sell-off too.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been under fire for his work with the Trump administration. Sales have fallen off a cliff globally, prompting Wall Street to get more cautious about the company's 2025 financial prospects.

Nvidia failed to impress the super bulls at its closely watched annual GTC event in March. Analyst profit estimates for the first quarter and the year have stayed relatively unchanged since the event, according to Yahoo Finance data.

Trump tariff fears have weighed on Apple shares, as the company manufacturers the bulk of its products in China.

When Microsoft and Amazon reported fourth quarter earnings in February, each served investors slowing cloud growth stories. Profit margins also came in light versus some analyst estimates.

To reawaken the Magnificent Seven trade, Truist's Lerner says the market will need to see a few things happen.

""I think it can be just some time passing where earnings continue to rise, which they are today, while prices consolidate, and investors realize they [the stocks] are cheap again on a relative basis to growth prospects,"" Lerner explained.

And if AI demand is slowing, investors hearing spending cutbacks would help alleviate margin worries.

Others say that after the pullback, the stocks look as attractive as they have in years.

""NVDA, [AAPL], AMZN, MSFT — all names I own ... and I like them especially after the pullback. None of these companies are going anywhere,"" Kace Capital Advisors managing partner and Yahoo Finance Trader Talk podcast host Kenny Polcari said.

Another catalyst for the group may be evidence AI demand is not slowing after all.

""The need for compute continues to be immense,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su told me in a Yahoo Finance exclusive interview on Monday (video above). ""We see that throughout all of our customers globally, and we're going to continue to invest strongly in this area because I think this is the single most important technology. I like to say it's the single most important technology of the last 50 years.""

Oops, something went wrong

A staple of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign trail rhetoric returned this week with a version of 20% ""blanket"" tariffs now apparently being considered as the president struggles to fill in the details of his “Liberation Day” promises.

The potential move, applying to all or most goods imported to the United States, would represent a dramatic pivot of sorts for the president amid implementation worries and political complications that have dogged the White House's long-promised plan for more specific country-by-country duties.

But it would also mark a return to an approach to trade that Trump has long championed despite varied warnings from economists that it could have the deepest of consequences for the US economy.

The Yale Budget Lab Tuesday tabulated that a move toward true blanket tariffs would stoke inflation by more than 2% and — assuming no countermeasures from the Federal Reserve — create a loss of buying power of $3,400-$4,200 per household.

The researchers added that 20% duties, if added on top of existing tariffs, would make the average effective US tariff rate the highest since 1872 at 32.8%.

A previous estimate from the Tax Foundation has also put the cost in the thousands and found that 20% blanket duties would represent an average tax increase on US households of $2,045.

Even studies from Trump-friendly groups — such as one issued during the 2024 campaign by a group called the Coalition for a Prosperous America — acknowledge that tariffs would raise consumer prices.

Thus far, there are signs from media reports that 20% duties are being considered by the Trump team, including a report Tuesday from the Washington Post that detailed the latest machinations.

Some in the administration are openly pushing for aggressive revenue goals where the math would likely require some flavor of universal duties.

On Sunday, senior White House trade and manufacturing counselor Peter Navarro said the Trump 2.0 tariffs could add around $700 billion a year annually to US coffers — combining $100 billion from recently announced 25% auto tariffs to $600 billion more from other duties.

Such an ambitious top-line number can't be achieved without a wide array of duties. 20% blanket tariffs, one of the most aggressive options to raise revenue yet, are estimated to raise only about half the amount floated by Navarro, assuming that other countries retaliate.

A 20% blanket tariff rate would represent a dramatic turn for Trump back to outsized campaign trail promises of his stewardship of the US economy at a delicate time for markets.

It could also be seen as a recognition of sorts that his oft-repeated promises of actions where ""what they do to us, we do to them"" is more challenging in the face of already overtaxed ports and also political constituencies that have spent recent months clamoring for exceptions.

If nothing else, a blanket tariff would be simpler to implement and is likely not to add significantly to what is known as the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States — an already overstuffed 99-chapter-long guide that duty collectors and importers rely on at ports.

A move toward universal tariffs — if Trump follows through — could also lessen some political pressure with less opportunity for exceptions.

Garrett Watson, the director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, previously noted to Yahoo Finance that the move toward reciprocal country-by-country tariffs was one that presented political pitfalls that could be weighing on Trump's team today.

He said selective tariff considerations present ""the risk of creating a political bonanza ... that makes the situation complicated and uncertain and can create political winners and losers.""

Trump has declined to offer much in the way of specificity. When asked Wednesday about applying universal versus individual tariffs, he responded, “You're going to see in two days,” while declining to offer specifics.

The president nonetheless continued to up the stakes. In addition to his oft-repeated use of the moniker “Liberation Day” for this Wednesday, he said he is now considering the implementation of tariffs that he believes represents a ""rebirth of the country.""

It's a topic that Democrats are also likely to hammer the president on, especially if this week's rollout goes poorly and already shaky markets continue to sell off.

“Perhaps if they are blanket 20% across-the-board tariffs that are imposed tomorrow, markets may have some certainty going forward,” former Biden administration official Alex Jacquez said Tuesday morning.

But then he quickly added, ""It's hard to see that they'll like those either.""

Wall Street's bullishness on gold doesn't appear to be wavering as the precious metal hit yet another all-time high.

On Tuesday, futures (GC=F) made their 19th intraday record of the year, surging above $3,170 per ounce before paring gains ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariff plan announcement expected on April 2.

""Within the commodities complex, long Gold presents the obvious hedge for risky market exposure in our view, especially since the bullish medium-term trend dynamics remain firmly intact,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a note on Tuesday.

Most notable is the rapid pace at which gold has risen, notching its best quarterly performance in nearly 40 years.

JPMorgan's researchers note gold went from $2,500 to $3,000 per ounce in 210 days, much faster than previous $500 increments, which took an average of 1,700 days.

Year-to-date gold prices are up 19%, while over the past year the commodity is up more than 40%.

""A simple regression analysis shows that over the period since early 2024, gold has turned into a momentum trade, which appears to be backed less by fundamentals and driven more by momentum,"" wrote Societe Generale researchers and strategists in a note last month.

""Our view is that this momentum dynamic will remain broadly intact,"" they wrote. The firm expects gold to reach $3,300 by year-end.

Goldman Sachs analysts recently raised their year-end price target to $3,300 ""reflecting upside surprises in ETF inflows and in continued strong central bank gold demand."" The firm also identified potential events that could spark selling and create better entry points for investors.

""First, a Russia-Ukraine peace deal would likely trigger speculative selling,"" Goldman commodities strategist Lina Thomas said in a note last Wednesday.

""Second, while not the base case of our portfolio strategists, a potential sharp equity sell-off may trigger margin-driven gold liquidation,"" she added, noting that a sell-off would be ""short-lived.""

In the meantime, near-term price action may depend on the exact details of President Trump's highly anticipated announcement at the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. Trump is expected to announce reciprocal tariffs on imports from other countries.

""Tariff-related information has already been partly reflected in gold prices over the past week,"" said Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com. ""If President Trump delays the implementation of these policies, the market may witness a short-term correction in gold as investors take profits after a strong rally.""

Oops, something went wrong

Tesla (TSLA) registration data in key European regions fell again in March, another sign that sales are continuing to slide in one of its key markets. This comes after Tesla's stock tumbled in the first quarter, its worst quarter in more than two years.

In France, only 3,157 Tesla EVs were registered in the country, down 36.8% from a year ago, per official data cited by Reuters. Norway saw only 2,211 registrations, down 63.9%. Sweden's tally of 911 was only down 1%.

Tesla's registrations are a close proxy for sales, which the company only reports quarterly and does not break out by region.

Also in Scandinavia, usually a stronghold of EV sales, Denmark's Tesla registrations dropped to 593, down 65.6%, and the Netherlands saw 1,536, a drop of 61% compared to last year.

For the first quarter, registrations were down 41.1% in France, 55.3% in Sweden, 12.5% in Norway, 55.3% in Denmark, and 49.7% in the Netherlands, per Reuters.

While official Tesla first quarter sales data will be released perhaps as early as Wednesday, dropping sales in Europe, China, and the US portend a difficult Q1 for the EV maker. Tesla is expected to report Q1 deliveries of 390,342, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Even more of a concern is that the new updated Model Y, which went on sale in March in those regions, did not appear to move the needle for Tesla.

The new data comes after the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) reported Tesla's February registrations in the EU, UK, and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) fell 40.1% in February, to 16,888 EVs. Over the span of January and February, Tesla EV registrations are down 42.6% (26,619).

Meanwhile, the ACEA reports total EV registrations are up for those regions, hitting 164,646 units, an increase of 26.1% compared to a year ago and up 31.4% including January (330,584).

CEO Elon Musk's tumbling popularity in both the US and Europe, where his political endorsements of far-right movements have alienated a wide swath of EV-interested buyers, may be weighing on sales.

Even in China, its second-most-important region, Tesla's shipments fell to 30,688 in February, plunging 49% compared to a year ago, per Bloomberg News, and are down more than half compared to January (63,238). Meanwhile, wholesale sales of new energy vehicles in China for the month hit 840,000 units, up 82% compared to last year.

Weakness in sales across its main regions, as well as protests and vandalism both in the US and abroad in response to Musk's antics, are weighing heavily on shares.

Tesla stock fell 36% in the first quarter, its worst quarterly performance since the end of 2022 when the stock tumbled over 50%, per CNBC. At the time, Musk sold a huge portion of his Tesla stake to purchase Twitter, now known as X.com.

Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action.

Over the weekend, Musk acknowledged his political stances and leadership of DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency) had directly affected Tesla stock.

“My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone roughly in half,” Musk said at a Wisconsin rally for a Trump-backed judge running in Tuesday's state Supreme Court election. “This is a very expensive job, is what I'm saying, and you're welcome.”

Musk added that “long term,” he thinks Tesla stock will do just fine and that “maybe it's a buying opportunity.”

Oops, something went wrong

Data out Tuesday showed activity in the manufacturing sector slipped into contraction for the first time this year and costs continued to surge as suppliers weigh the impact of President Trump's tariff policy.

The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI registered a reading of 49.0 in March, down from February's 50.3 reading and below the 49.5 economists polled by Bloomberg had expected. Readings above 50 for this index indicate an expansion in activity, while readings below 50 indicate a contraction.

The prices paid index surged to 69.4, up from 62.4 the month prior and the highest reading since June 2022, reflecting companies' continued increase in costs. Economists had expected a reading of 64.6.

""Demand and production retreated and destaffing continued, as panelists' companies responded to demand confusion,"" Institute for Supply Management chair Timothy Fiore wrote in the release. ""Prices growth accelerated due to tariffs, causing new order placement backlogs, supplier delivery slowdowns and manufacturing inventory growth.""

Many survey respondents cited increased uncertainty due to tariffs as companies attempt to restock inventories ahead of future policy rollouts, with reciprocal levies set to come as soon as Wednesday. 

Notably, new orders fell to the lowest reading since May 2023.

""The slight dip in the ISM manufacturing index in March suggests that, rather than triggering a reshoring factory renaissance, the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff threats are depressing activity,"" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, wrote in reaction to the data.

""While the prices paid index is still some way below its pandemic [level], even after rising again in March, it seems likely to increase further next month once more tariffs come into effect,"" Chambers said. ""There's a whiff of stagflation in the air.""

Shortly following the data's release, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tracker, which analyzes incoming data points, signaled negative growth of 3.7% in Q1, an escalation of the prior negative 2.8% reading.

Another reading on manufacturing activity out Tuesday also raised concerns over Trump's tariff uncertainties. The final reading of S&P Global's manufacturing PMI hit 50.2 in March, down from a strong 52.7 in February.

Despite the slowdown, it was the third month the index registered a reading above 50 ""but only just.""

""The PMI signaled a marginal improvement in operating conditions that was the weakest of the year so far,"" S&P Global said in the release, noting a drop in production for the first time since December weighed heavily on the headline index while order books expanded only modestly.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in the release, ""The strong start to the year for US manufacturers has faltered in March.""

""While business confidence about the outlook remains relatively elevated by standards seen over the past three years, this is based on companies hoping that the near-term disruption caused by tariffs and other policies will be superseded as longer-term benefits from the policies of the new administration accrue,"" he continued. ""However, March has seen more producers question this belief.""

S&P said a ""key concern"" among manufacturers is the degree to which heightened uncertainty resulting from policy changes, notably tariffs, cause customers to cancel or delay spending, along with the ripple effect when it comes to rising costs and deteriorating supply chains.

""Tariffs were the most cited cause of factory input costs rising in March, and at a rate not seen since mid-2022 during the pandemic-related supply shock,"" Williamson said. ""Supply chains are also suffering to a degree not seen since October 2022 as delivery delays become more widespread.""

Economic data releases and earnings

If all goes according to plan on ""Liberation Day"" — President Trump's term for Wednesday's scheduled reciprocal tariffs — the trade war showdown will be the starting point of a new American era, of a nationalistic economy that boosts our self-sufficiency and prosperity.

But even if every aspect of the president's agenda falls into place, there's a laundry list of things that will have to go right for it to work out. Things that essentially seem impossible.

First off, the countries whose imports would be tariffed need to do nothing, instead of unleashing a wave of repercussions that would nullify or complicate the imagined progress of an America First platform.

The rollout itself has to be clean, without the expected messiness of retaliatory tariffs and chaos at US ports.

By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's 
                        
                            Terms
                        
                     and 
                        
                            Privacy Policy
                        
 

The tariffs, any further tit-for-tat levies, and rollout need to be a historical economic exception that boosts growth and doesn't end up kickstarting a brutal disruption for businesses and consumers.

Businesses need to get creative as international trade continues to be reshaped by policy and torpedoed relationships with allies and trading partners.

Consumers need to be patient, forgiving, and team players willing to make sacrifices. While the White House contends that the price increases triggered by tariffs will be fleeting, consumers have made it plain they're fed up with inflation. Relying on a theory that tariff-inspired price increases will only be transitory — and that Americans will be willing to accept them — seems an economically and politically dangerous gamble. Consumers will improbably have to play along.

""Liberation Day"" also puts the Federal Reserve in a jam. If the Fed cuts rates to reverse flagging growth — yet another “best case” scenario for Trump that isn't ideal for the rest of us — the central bank risks driving up inflation. And those rate cuts will come in the form of a monetary rescue mission instead of a final, easing maneuver in a soft landing.

And then, all of this needs to crystalize into a sentiment, growth, and earnings boom.

That's an incredible string of green lights the Trump administration needs to hit. Or holes-in-one; pick your metaphor. Which is why, as many economists, strategists, and analysts — people incentivized by being correct, not politically correct — have noted, the upside may be limited, but the downside is a black pit.

If Trump's antagonistic negotiating leads to deals with our trading partners, there's still a lot that would need to happen for the market to return to glory and for businesses and consumers to shed their anxieties.

Even a narrower tariff rollout would arrive with an array of caveats and carveouts. Wall Street analysts and business leaders would still have to qualify their thinking of ""this isn't as bad as we thought"" with a ""for now"" clause. And in the meantime, the agonizing run-up has already done damage. A months-long protectionist realignment isn't just a mindset, it's now been baked into operations and expectations.

Just because the April 2 tariff guessing game has passed doesn't mean tariff uncertainty will end. If nothing is set in stone, the potential for future disruption continues to hang over markets.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a fair, lasting, and binding peace agreement to end the Ukraine conflict, urging all parties to work toward a negotiated settlement. In an interview with RIA Novosti released on Tuesday, during a three-day visit to Moscow, Wang said that the root causes of the conflict need to be eliminated.

Kiev's NATO ambitions were among the main reasons for the conflict, and Moscow has insisted upon Ukrainian neutrality along with demilitarization and denazification as settlement keystones.

“We advocate the eradication of the causes of the crisis through dialogue and negotiations, and ultimately the achievement of a fair, long-term, binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties involved,” Wang said in the interview. “This would make it possible to achieve truly lasting peace and stability in Eurasia and throughout the world.”

On Monday US President Donald Trump echoed the position, dismissing Ukraine's NATO membership ambitions, saying Kiev “is never going to be a member” of the military bloc.

Wang acknowledged that the “causes of the crisis are extremely complex” and that Kiev and Moscow have so far failed to find common ground on a number of key issues, but noted that there is “a tendency towards peace negotiations,” which Beijing finds encouraging.

“The path to restoring peace is long [but] certain results have been achieved,” he said, referring to the recent Russia-US diplomatic rapprochement and the initial progress toward a political settlement with a partial ceasefire agreement.

“A step towards peace, although not that big, is constructive – it is worth taking. You can't get peace lying down, you have to achieve it by hard work,” he said, adding that the thaw in Russia-US relations “inspires optimism in the disappointing international situation.”

Wang arrived in Moscow on Sunday for a three-day official visit at the invitation of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also revealed that President Vladimir Putin is expected to met with Wang.

China has said the Russia-Ukraine conflict must be resolved through negotiations, and last year alongside Brazil, presented a six-point proposal for a diplomatic settlement. In his interview, Wang reiterated that China is ready to “play a constructive role in the settlement” of the conflict.

The incoming German government plans to play a larger role in EU decision-making, including by punishing nations that dissent against the bloc's foreign policy, Politico has reported. According to the outlet, a draft coalition agreement targets Hungary, which has defied EU decisions on issues such as the Ukraine conflict and sanctions against Russia.

Germany is set to have a new coalition government formed by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democrats (SPD), likely led by Friedrich Merz of the CDU. The parties are currently finalizing agreements on key policy areas, including migration, climate, and EU relations. Merz is reportedly aiming to form the new government before Easter on April 20.

One of the documents reviewed by Politico outlines Berlin's plans for a more assertive EU strategy. It proposes using the ‘Weimar Triangle' – a trilateral alliance of Germany, France, and Poland, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency – to influence the bloc's direction and strengthen Germany's use of its voting rights.

The draft also states that Berlin plans to “defend” the EU against “internal and external enemies” by calling for punitive action against member states that allegedly violate principles such as the rule of law. Proposed penalties include withholding EU funds and suspending voting rights.

“We will take even more consistent action against violations,” the document states. “Existing protective instruments, from infringement proceedings and the withholding of EU funds to the suspension [of] membership rights such as voting rights in the Council of the EU, must be applied much more consistently than before.”

The coalition has also proposed the creation of a “comprehensive sanction instrument” to rein in perceived dissenters, including replacing the EU's foreign policy unanimity requirement with majority voting to prevent countries from blocking decisions such as sanctions.

“The consensus principle in the European Council must not become a brake on decision-making,” the document states.

While Hungary is not mentioned by name, the draft agreement appears to be a clear reference to the country, which has long been at odds with EU policies, including over its approach to the Ukraine conflict and its sanctions policy towards Russia.

Budapest has argued that sanctions have been detrimental to the bloc's economy, and has exercised its veto right on several motions to delay or dilute measures. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly accused the EU of taking a “pro-war” stance and has pursued independent peace initiatives on the Ukraine conflict.

The EU has previously threatened to suspend Hungary's voting rights. It withheld around €22 billion in funds earmarked for Budapest in 2022, citing rights and judicial concerns, but ultimately released about half of that amount last year.

Russia has never been the first to damage relations with other countries and continues to seek good ties with its neighbors, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said. His remarks followed Finnish President Alexander Stubb's comments on Monday about the possibility of restoring political relations with Russia.

Despite previously beneficial cooperation, Finland's 2023 decision to join NATO and align its military with the US-led bloc has effectively “reduced the relations to zero,” Peskov said. The same applies to Sweden, he added, which joined NATO last year.

Quoting President Vladimir Putin, Peskov said Moscow “never had any problems” with either Finland or Sweden. He reiterated that “Russia remains open to restoring ties with those countries that want it.”

Speaking in London on Monday, Stubb said Finland must be ready for the eventual reopening of political relations with Moscow.

”In Finland, we must mentally prepare ourselves for the fact that relations will open up on a political level at some point. At this stage, we cannot say exactly when. Nothing removes the fact that Russia is, and will always be, Finland's neighbor — 1,350 kilometers of neighborly relations,” Stubb said, referring to the land border between the two nations.

He added that relations between the two states depend on the end of Ukraine conflict and negotiations on restoring relations.

Finland applied for NATO membership in 2022 following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict and formally joined the alliance in 2023. Since then, Helsinki has supported Kiev politically and militarily, with President Stubb backing Ukraine's bids to join both NATO and the EU.

Moscow has for decades condemned the US-led military bloc's expansion towards its borders, viewing it as a threat to its national security.

Finland closed all border crossings with Russia in 2023 and in November Helsinki's interior ministry ruled out lifting any travel restrictions.

Russia supplied Finland with raw materials, fuels, and electricity, while Finnish exports to Russia included machinery, vehicles, chemicals, and paper. Tourism also played a key role in the relationship. Russian visitors also contributed significantly to Finland's economy.

Germany will provide an extra €11.25 billion ($12 billion) in military aid for Ukraine, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced during a surprise visit to Kiev on Tuesday. Berlin will continue to back Ukraine “without any ifs or buts,” regardless of the upcoming change of German government, the diplomat said.

Germany is Ukraine's second-largest military donor after the US. It is expected to have a new coalition government of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU), and Social Democrats (SPD), with CDU leader Friedrich Merz as the likely chancellor. Merz, a proponent of further aid for Kiev, previously said he aims to have the new government in place by Easter on April 20.

In a statement on the Foreign Ministry's website, Baerbock announced “the decision of the current and future governing parties” to provide an additional €3 billion in short-term support for Ukraine and earmark €8.25 billion in military aid through 2029. Berlin will also immediately release €130 million in “humanitarian assistance and stabilization funds” for Ukraine, Baerbock added.

“It is absolutely pivotal for us Europeans to show that we stand alongside Ukraine… That is one reason why I have come to Ukraine today,” the minister stated. Germany has already provided roughly €11 billion in aid for Ukraine between January 2022 and October 2024, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

The US, which is Ukraine's biggest donor in the conflict with Russia, has meanwhile shifted its stance under President Donald Trump, who has demanded that Kiev pay back aid already provided.

Amid an apparent thaw in relations since Trump's return to office, Moscow and Washington have been working on a potential diplomatic settlement of the conflict. The two sides have made progress with a partial ceasefire agreement despite the Russian government's skepticism toward the authorities in Kiev.

Baerbock claimed that “Ukraine is ready and willing to observe an immediate ceasefire,” and accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of blocking the peace process. Russian officials, however, have reported numerous Ukrainian violations of the agreement by targeting oil infrastructure in several locations. Moscow has also consistently accused the West of prolonging the conflict by funding Kiev's war effort.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Online recruiting techniques and complicit local authorities have been among the details revealed by the renewed investigation of a ranch in western Mexico where authorities say the Jalisco New Generation Cartel trained its recruits.

Lured by fake job offers, those who resisted risked death.

One of Mexico's most powerful cartels, which the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says has some 19,000 in its ranks, developed rapidly into an extremely violent and capable force after it split from the Sinaloa cartel following the 2010 killing of Sinaloa cartel capo Ignacio “Nacho” Coronel Villarreal by the military.

The Jalisco cartel is led by Nemesio Rubén “el Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes, for whom the U.S. government has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture. Oseguera drew renewed attention this week after his image was projected as a band played at a music festival in Jalisco over the weekend.

The Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels have battled for control of various parts of Mexico, including Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. Both are among six Mexican organized crime groups recently designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. government.

One of authorities' recent advances against Jalisco was the arrest of José Gregorio Lastra, allegedly in charge of the cartel's recruitment.




The Jalisco cartel employs three recruiting methods: there are volunteers drawn by the pay and imagined lifestyle, which experts say make up the bulk of their number; there's targeted recruitment of ex-military and police forces, who because of their professional training enter the cartel as trainers and leaders of squads of gunmen. Finally, there's the kind of forced recruitment that investigators say happened at the Jalisco ranch.

For that last category, authorities say the cartel uses social platforms — they've identified at least 60 pages — to offer fake job opportunities, especially as security guards, with weekly salaries of $600, well above the average for such positions. Once they have the applicants, they force them to join the cartel.

One recruit who reportedly survived the ranch has said that the cartel picked up recruits at bus stations under false pretenses and took them to the ranch where they were trained for a month in the use of weapons in addition to fitness training, Mexico's Public Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch said. Those who refused or tried to escape were beaten, tortured and killed.

Security analyst David Saucedo said Jalisco's structure is vertical, with Oseguera at the top.

Last weekend, pictures of Oseguera were projected as a band started playing at a regional music festival in Jalisco. Some in the crowd cheered and on Monday President Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as Jalisco's governor, condemned the act. The Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office said it was opening an investigation. Such displays of respect for cartel leaders are not uncommon.

Below Oseguera are regional commands, as well as areas responsible for drug production and sales, Saucedo said.

The DEA says the cartel has a presence in 21 of Mexico's 32 states, exceeding the Sinaloa cartel's 19. Some analysts believe Jalisco is actually in as many as 25 states, including its home base in the state of the same name. It also maintains a presence in some 100 countries, according to the DEA.

In less than two decades, Jalisco became one of Mexico's most powerful criminal organizations and even managed to take control of some traditional strongholds of the Sinaloa cartel. Sinaloa has been weakened more recently by infighting among its factions following arrests of key leaders, including Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, who is serving a life sentence in the U.S., and Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who was arrested last July along with one of Guzmán's sons and is awaiting trial in the U.S.

Center for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology researcher Carlos Flores said Jalisco's “capacity for violent action” and style of “irregular warfare” aided its speedy rise, which coincided with the emergence of fentanyl as a highly profitable revenue stream.

Saucedo says that Jalisco has also successfully allied itself with other criminal groups, allowing it to penetrate some territories with a sort of “franchise” model as in the central state of Aguascalientes and the key border city of Tijuana.

The case of the ranch also serves as an example of how the Jalisco cartel is able to operate with impunity in territory it controls thanks to the complicity of local authorities, Flores said.

Despite being discovered in September 2024 and 10 people being arrested, the ranch's investigation stalled until family members searching for their relatives went there themselves in March and raised the alarm about hundreds of clothing items they found, as well as apparent bone fragments. Since then, authorities have detained three local police officers who were allegedly tied to disappearances at the ranch.

“There are signs that show publicly how those kinds of deals have allowed the Jalisco cartel to establish itself in certain states, while they go about eliminating their rivals, sometimes with the help of public safety forces,” Flores said.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The U.N. food agency is closing all of its bakeries in the Gaza Strip, officials said Tuesday, as supplies dwindle after Israel sealed off the territory from all imports nearly a month ago.

Israel, which later resumed its offensive to pressure the Hamas militant group into accepting changes to their ceasefire agreement, said enough food had entered Gaza during the six-week truce to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for a long time.

U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Israel's assertion was “ridiculous,” calling the food shortage very critical. The organization is “at the tail end of our supplies” and a lack of flour and cooking oil are forcing the bakeries to close, Dujarric said Tuesday.

Markets largely emptied weeks ago. U.N. agencies say the supplies they built up during the truce are running out. Gaza is heavily reliant on international aid because the war has destroyed almost all of its food production capability.

Mohammed al-Kurd, a father of 12, said his children go to bed without dinner.

“We tell them to be patient and that we will bring flour in the morning,” he said. “We lie to them and to ourselves.”

For the second consecutive day, Israel's military warned residents of Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah to immediately evacuate, a sign that it could soon launch a major ground operation. At least 140,000 people were under orders to leave, according to the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.

A World Food Program memo circulated to aid groups said it could no longer operate its remaining bakeries, which produce the bread on which many rely. The U.N. agency said it was prioritizing its remaining stocks to provide emergency food aid and expand hot meal distribution. WFP spokespeople didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said WFP was closing its remaining 19 bakeries after shuttering six last month. She said hundreds of thousands of people relied on them. 

The Israeli military body in charge of Palestinian affairs, known as COGAT, said more than 25,000 trucks entered Gaza during the ceasefire, carrying nearly 450,000 tons of aid. It said the amount represented around a third of what has entered during the war.

“There is enough food for a long period of time, if Hamas lets the civilians have it,” it said.

U.N. agencies and aid groups say they struggled to bring in and distribute aid before the ceasefire took hold in January. Their estimates for how much aid reached people in Gaza were consistently lower than COGAT's, which were based on how much entered through border crossings.

Gaza's Health Ministry reported that at least 42 bodies and more than 180 wounded arrived at hospitals over the past 24 hours. At least 1,042 Palestinians have been killed in the two weeks since Israel broke the ceasefire and resumed heavy bombardments.

The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Hamas is still holding 59 captives — 24 believed to be alive — after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's offensive has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, including hundreds killed in strikes since the ceasefire ended, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Israel sealed off Gaza from all aid at the start of the war but later relented under pressure from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has expressed full support for Israel's actions, including its decision to end the truce.

Israel has demanded that Hamas release several hostages before further talks on ending the war. Those negotiations were supposed to begin in early February. It has also insisted that Hamas disarm and leave Gaza, conditions that weren't part of the ceasefire agreement.

Hamas has called for implementing the agreement, in which the remaining hostages would be released in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.

Palestinians mourned Mohamed Salah Bardawil, a journalist with Hamas-affiliated Aqsa Radio who was killed along with his wife and three children by an Israeli strike early Tuesday at their home in southern Gaza.

Associated Press footage showed the building in Khan Younis collapsed, with dried blood splattered on the rubble. A child's school notebook, dust-covered dolls and clothing lay half-buried in the ruins. The Israeli military declined to comment.

The journalist is the nephew of Salah Bardawil, a well-known member of Hamas' political bureau who was killed in an Israeli strike that also killed his wife last month.

Israeli strikes have killed more than 170 journalists and media workers since the war began, the Committee to Protect Journalists has estimated.

A top European Union official warned the U.S. on Tuesday that the world's biggest trade bloc “holds a lot of cards” when it comes to dealing with the Trump administration's new tariffs and has a good plan to retaliate if forced to. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to roll out taxes on imports from other countries on Wednesday. He says they will free the U.S. from reliance on foreign goods.

BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union official warned the U.S. on Tuesday that the world's biggest trade bloc “holds a lot of cards” when it comes to dealing with the Trump administration's new tariffs and has a good plan to retaliate if forced to.

U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to roll out taxes on imports from other countries on Wednesday. He says they will free the U.S. from reliance on foreign goods.

He's vowed to impose “reciprocal” tariffs to match the duties that other countries charge on U.S. products, dubbing April 2 “Liberation Day.”

“Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate, but if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers.

The commission, the EU's executive branch, negotiates trade deals on behalf of the bloc's 27 member countries and manages trade disputes on their behalf.

“Europe holds a lot of cards, from trade to technology to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm counter measures if necessary. All instruments are on the table,” von der Leyen said, at a European Parliament session in Strasbourg, France.




The commission already intends to impose duties on U.S. goods worth some $28 billion in mid-April in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU duties will target steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and farm goods.




A lot remains unknown about how Trump's levies will actually be implemented, notably the “reciprocal” tariffs, and the EU wants to assess their impact before taking retaliatory action.

“So many Europeans feel utterly disheartened by the announcement from the United States,” von der Leyen said. “This is the largest and most prosperous trade relationship worldwide. We would all be better off if we could find a constructive solution.”

DNIPROPETROVSK REGION, Ukraine (AP) — Kateryna Koliadiuk was curious. The 19-year-old Ukrainian agronomy student spotted an ad seeking women to enroll in a tractor driving course and decided to try. But the industrial vehicle was huge and complex, and she wasn't sure she could operate it.

“In the beginning I was so scared. In the beginning I couldn't do this,” she said. She now drives with authority, her manicured fingers resting at the wheel.

From driving tractors to working in coal mines, Ukrainian women are taking jobs once reserved for men, who are being drafted to the front lines in the war with Russia. Women have also signed up to join the armed forces at a higher rate.

Koliadiuk said her family was shocked. “We were told that women should be in the kitchen, at home with children. That is why to go and study such equipment was so scary,” she said. “But then we took care of ourselves.”

It's part of a crucial government effort to grow an economy devastated by three years of war and address labor shortages created by the mobilization, according to the economy ministry, which leads training programs in construction, agriculture and transport geared toward women.

“Ukrainian women are under a lot of pressure because their men are on the front line,” Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in an interview with The Associated Press. “When the man is mobilized, the woman is mobilized with him as well.”




Businesses want to hire again after the initial economic shock of Russia's full-scale invasion, but the labor force has shrunk. About 5 million Ukrainians left the country and are abroad, the minister said, and another million are serving in the armed forces. That's a lot considering about 9 million Ukrainians are currently employed, she added.

Svyrydenko is Ukraine's first female economy minister and a symbol of the rise of women in the labor force because of the war.

Before, women were mostly employed in education and health care, social protection and government service, she said. Now there's demand in the industrial and military areas.

“It is the mindset of both women and employers that is changing,” she said. “Employers are ready to take women on the job more often, and women are ready to diversify their skills.”

In coal mines in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, women are now hired to operate machinery to keep production going. There and elsewhere, men still dominate jobs that require heavy physical labor.

Former accountant Iryna Ostanko, 37, was looking for a new job and decided to become an elevator operator at a mine in the Dnipropetrovsk region. She was inspired by her husband, who has worked at the mine for 15 years. He supported her decision.

“Before, in this place underground, there were no women at all,” she said. “Women appeared here after the start of the full-scale invasion when a lot of men left to defend our country.”

“War is making changes, always making changes,” said Viktor Kuznetsov, the mine's head engineer.

He said the lack of qualified personnel is the main challenge, as many male workers left to join the fight. He has hired over 100 women since Russia's full-scale invasion, a drastic change.

Without them, the mine could not function, he said.

In Kyiv region, Yulia Skitchko watched new female trainees operate excavators, her high-heeled black leather boots caked in mud.

She is the head of Alef Stroy, a construction machinery rental service. For years, she had dreamed of hiring more women. The war gave her that chance, and U.S. funding gave her the ability to train female hires. They have trained 45 women so far. 

“We were told that we are crazy people, this is not possible. Women? Excavator? They will never do this,” she said. “These days, our first women who graduated from this course already have jobs and started working on building construction sites.”

Modern building equipment is easier to operate, she said, and the idea that women can't do it is a gender stereotype.

“This war has changed our women mentally, and they want to contribute to Ukraine's rebuilding,” Skitchko said. “We need to give them an opportunity to learn.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Germany's chief diplomat on Tuesday described U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to secure a truce in the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine as deadlocked, while China's foreign minister said that it was encouraging that the talks between Washington and Moscow on finding a settlement are continuing.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, arriving in Kyiv for an unannounced visit, said that “due to the deadlock” between the U.S. and Russia on forging a ceasefire deal, European allies' continued support for Ukraine in the war is “absolutely crucial.”

Trump on Sunday scolded Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressing frustration at the continued fighting in a war that he had pledged to swiftly stop.

Trump insisted progress was being made in the negotiations, but said that he would consider imposing further sanctions to put pressure on Moscow and accused Zelenskyy of trying to back out of a deal with the U.S. on access to Ukraine's mineral resources.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Tuesday that the latest version of the mineral deal remained under discussion and that Ukraine had conducted its first round of consultations on that version. 

Putin has effectively refused a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting, despite Trump's prodding. Also, a partial ceasefire in the Black Sea that could allow safer shipments has fallen foul of conditions imposed by Kremlin negotiators.




“We consider the models and solutions proposed by the Americans quite seriously, but we can't just accept all of them as they are,” Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said.

Moscow is holding out on a deal to ease shipping in the Black Sea in order to “stall efforts toward a general ceasefire and extract additional concessions from the West,” according to an assessment Monday by the Institute for the Washington-based Study of War think tank.

Trump has signaled that he could consider new oil sanctions on Russia — a development Ukraine would view favorably.

“I believe we have reached the point where stronger sanctions are needed, because I believe the Russians are breaking the promises they made to America,” Zelenskyy said during a joint press conference with Baerbock in Kyiv on Tuesday. 

“For us, decisive action is crucial. Words are not enough,” Zelenskyy added. “We are the ones who suffer.”

Putin previously has ruled out a temporary break in hostilities, saying that it would only benefit Ukraine and its Western allies by letting them replenish their arsenals. He has insisted that Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement that would ensure a lasting settlement.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov indicated Tuesday that a breakthrough in negotiations isn't imminent.

“The issues that we are discussing in connection with the Ukrainian settlement are quite complex and they require a lot of additional efforts,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 

Meanwhile, deadly attacks by both Russia and Ukraine have continued, and they are gearing up for spring campaigns in their war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.

Overnight, Russia fired no Shahed drones at Ukraine for the first time in more than five months, according to authorities.

But Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation branch of Ukraine's Security Council, detected no change in Russian strategy.

“For now, this means nothing,” he said on Telegram.

Russia's Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of launching new drone attacks on energy facilities in Russia's Belgorod region and in the Russia-controlled part of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region. Zelenskyy accused Russia of failing to uphold its commitment to a ceasefire targeting the energy infrastructure.

“I've asked our side to pass information through various institutions about Russia's breaches of the agreement not to strike energy facilities,” he said, adding that the reports have been sent almost daily. “We're sharing this information with the United States, and we see that America is beginning to understand it.”

Ukraine's European backers say they will keep supporting Kyiv's efforts to defeat Russia's invasion. Zelenskyy said a closed-door meeting with military officials from several partner countries will take place Friday to further discuss the possible deployment of foreign troops to Ukraine as a part of future security guarantees. 

“It will be the first in-depth meeting... based on proposals prepared by the Ukrainian side,” he said.

Putin is getting military help from North Korea and Iran.

China, too, has given diplomatic support to Russia and has provided economic help through trade in energy and consumer goods.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, on a visit to Moscow, was quoted as saying Tuesday that “certain results have been achieved” in Washington's attempt to stop the war as U.S.-Russia relations have improved under Trump.

Beijing supports the goal of “a fair, long-term, binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties involved,” he said in an interview with Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. 

At the start of his meeting with Putin, Wang said they would discuss future relations. “The China-Russia relationship will not stand still, but will only become more and more extensive,” he said.

The death toll in last week's massive earthquake in Myanmar has passed 2,000, as rescuers continued to search for survivors and started clearing the debris.

Rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building in Myanmar's capital Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the violent earthquake that killed at least 2,000, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a bloody civil war.

A minute of silence was held across Myanmar on Monday for the victims of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that occurred at midday Friday.

People bathed and cooked next to a river in Myanmar's second largest city, finding shelter in flimsy tents on Tuesday as the city grappled with the aftermath of a deadly earthquake.

Footage captured in Sagaing, Myanmar showed buildings and other infrastructure severely damaged after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake rocked the country Friday. The head of Myanmar's military government said that 2,719 people have now been found dead, with 4,521 others injured and 441 missing.

BANGKOK (AP) — Rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building in Myanmar's capital on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the violent earthquake that killed more than 2,700 people, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a civil war. 

The fire department in Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit midday Friday. Experts say the likelihood of finding survivors drops dramatically after 72 hours. 

The head of Myanmar's military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, told a forum for relief donations in Naypyitaw that 2,719 people have now been found dead, with 4,521 others injured and 441 missing, Myanmar's state MRTV television reported.

He said Friday's earthquake was the second most powerful in the country's recorded history after a magnitude 8 quake east of Mandalay in May 1912.

The casualty figures are widely expected to rise. The earthquake hit a wide swath of the country, leaving many areas without power, telephone or cell connections and damaging roads and bridges, making the full extent of the devastation hard to assess.

Most of the reports so far have come from Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, which was near the epicenter of the earthquake, and Naypyitaw, the capital. 




“The needs are massive, and they are rising by the hour,” said Julia Rees, UNICEF's deputy representative for Myanmar.

Myanmar's fire department said 403 people have been rescued in Mandalay and 259 bodies have been found so far. In one incident, 50 Buddhist monks who were taking a religious exam in a monastery were killed when the building collapsed, and 150 more are thought to be buried in the rubble. 

The World Health Organization said more than 10,000 buildings overall are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged by the quake.

The earthquake also rocked neighboring Thailand, causing a high-rise building under construction to collapse and burying many workers. 

Two bodies were pulled from the rubble Monday and another was recovered Tuesday, but dozens were still missing. Overall, there were 21 people killed and 34 injured in Bangkok, primarily at the construction site. 

In Myanmar, search and rescue efforts across the affected area paused briefly at midday Tuesday as people stood for a minute in silent tribute to the dead. 

Foreign aid workers have been arriving slowly to help in the rescue efforts, but progress lagged due to a lack of heavy machinery in many places.

In one site in Naypyitaw on Tuesday, workers formed a human chain, passing chunks of brick and concrete out hand-by-hand from the ruins of a collapsed building. 

The state Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Tuesday that a team of Chinese rescuers saved four people the day before from the ruins of an apartment complex. They included a 5-year-old and a pregnant woman who had been trapped for more than 60 hours. 

It also reported that two teenagers were able to crawl out of the rubble of the same building using their cellphone flashlights to help guide them. Rescue workers were then able to use details from what they told them to locate their grandmother and sibling.

International rescue teams from several countries are on the scene, including from Russia, China, India, the United Arab Emirates and several Southeast Asian countries. 

A small U.S. Agency for International Development disaster assessment team arrived Tuesday to determine how best to respond given limited U.S. resources due to the slashing of the foreign aid budget and dismantling of the agency as an independent operation.

A U.S. official said the three-person team had waited for visas before making the trip from neighboring Thailand following a weekend decision to provide $2 million in emergency assistance to Myanmar. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the team's arrival has not yet been publicly announced.

Meantime, multiple countries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organizations with the monumental task ahead.

Even before the earthquake, more than 3 million people had been displaced from their homes by Myanmar's brutal civil war, and nearly 20 million were in need, according to the U.N. 

Many were already lacking in basic medical care and standard vaccinations, and the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure by the earthquake and the movement of people into overcrowded shelters raises the risk of disease outbreaks, warned the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

“Vulnerability to respiratory infections, skin diseases, vector-borne illnesses such as dengue fever, and vaccine-preventable diseases like measles is escalating,” OCHA said in its latest report.

Shelter is also a major problem, especially with the monsoon season looming. 

Since the earthquake, many people have been sleeping outside, either because homes were destroyed or out of fear of aftershocks.

Myanmar's military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into significant armed resistance and a brutal civil war.

Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places were dangerous or impossible for aid groups to reach even before the quake.

Military attacks and those from some anti-military groups have not stopped in the aftermath of the earthquake, though the shadow opposition National Unity Government has called a unilateral ceasefire for its forces.

The NUG, established by elected lawmakers who were ousted in 2021, called for the international community to ensure humanitarian aid is delivered directly to the earthquake victims, urging “vigilance against any attempts by the military junta to divert or obstruct humanitarian assistance,” saying that could have “devastating consequences.” 

The ceasefire plan for the armed wing of the NUG, called the People's Defense Force, would have little effect on the battlefield, but could draw more international condemnation of continuing operations by the military, including air attacks reported by independent media. 

A second armed opposition group, a coalition of three powerful ethnic minority guerrilla armies called the Three Brotherhood Alliance, announced Tuesday that it would also implement a monthlong unilateral ceasefire.

However, Min Aung Hlaing seemed to reject implementing a ceasefire, saying in his speech on Tuesday that the military will continue to take necessary defensive measures against some ethnic armed groups that were currently not carrying out combat operations, but were conducting military training, which he said amounted to hostile action.

It wasn't immediately clear whether the military has been impeding humanitarian aid. In the past, it initially refused to allow in foreign rescue teams or many emergency supplies after Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which resulted in well more than 100,000 deaths. Even once it did allow foreign assistance, it was with severe restrictions.

In this case, however, Min Aung Hlaing pointedly said on the day of the earthquake that the country would accept outside help. 

Tom Andrews, a monitor on rights in Myanmar commissioned by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, said on X that to facilitate aid, military attacks must stop.

“The focus in Myanmar must be on saving lives, not taking them,” he said.

Associated Press reporters Grant Peck and Jintamas Saksornchai in Bangkok, Matthew Lee in Washington and Jamey Keaten in Geneva, contributed to this story.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Rusting pipes in a barren field and unpaid workers are what remain after a U.S. company promised to turn a huge piece of land in Senegal — about twice the size of Paris — into an agricultural project and create thousands of jobs.

In interviews with company officials and residents, The Associated Press explored one of the growing number of foreign investment projects targeting Africa, home to about 60% of the world's remaining uncultivated arable land. Like this one, many fail, often far from public notice.

Internal company documents seen by the AP show how the plans, endorsed by the Senegalese government, for exporting animal feed to wealthy Gulf nations fell apart.

At first glance, the landscape of stark acacia trees on the edge of the Sahara Desert doesn't hold much agricultural promise. But in an age of climate change, foreign investors are looking at this and other African landscapes.

The continent has seen a third of the world's large-scale land acquisitions between 2000 and 2020, mostly for agriculture, according to researchers from the International Institute of Social Studies in the Netherlands.

But 23% of those deals have failed, after sometimes ambitious plans to feed the world.




In 2021, the Senegalese village of Niéti Yone welcomed investors Frank Timis and Gora Seck from a U.S.-registered company, African Agriculture. Over cups of sweet green tea, the visitors promised to employ hundreds of locals and, one day, thousands.

Timis, originally from Romania, was the majority stakeholder. His companies have mined for gold, minerals and fossil fuels across West Africa.

Seck, a Senegalese mining investor, chaired an Italian company whose biofuel plans for the land parcel had failed. It sold the 50-year lease for 20,000 hectares to Timis for $7.9 million. Seck came on as president of African Agriculture's Senegalese subsidiary and holds 4.8% of its shares.

Now the company wanted the community's approval.

The land was next to Senegal's largest freshwater lake, for which the company obtained water rights. African Agriculture planned to grow alfalfa and export it to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both traditionally buy alfalfa from the U.S., but the amount of land in alfalfa production there has dropped by 38% in the last 20 years, largely due to drought caused by climate change, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The proposal divided the community of subsistence farmers. Herders who had raised livestock on the land for generations opposed it. Others, like Doudou Ndiaye Mboup, thought it could help ease Senegal's unemployment crisis.

“I bought their dream. I saw thousands of young Africans with jobs and prosperity,” said Mboup, who was later employed as an electrician and now leads a union of employees. 

Despite the formation of an opposition group called the Ndiael Collective, African Agriculture moved ahead, hiring about 70 of the community's 10,000 residents.

After planting a 300-hectare (740-acre) pilot plot of alfalfa, the company announced in November 2022 it would go public to raise funds.

African Agriculture valued the company at $450 million. The Oakland Institute, an environmental think tank in the U.S., questioned that amount and called the deal bad for food security as well as greenhouse gas emissions.

The company went public in December 2023, with shares trading at $8 on the NASDAQ exchange. It raised $22.6 million during the offering but had to pay $19 million to the listed but inactive company it had merged with.

That payment signaled trouble to investors. It showed that the other company, 0X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. II, didn't want to hold its 98% of stock. And it highlighted the way African Agriculture had used the merger to bypass the vetting process needed for listing.

One year later, shares in African Agriculture were worth almost nothing.

Now, security guards patrol the land's barbed-wire perimeter, blocking herders and farmers from using it. The company has been delisted.

Mboup said he and others haven't been paid for six months. The workers took the company to employment court in Senegal to claim about $180,000 in unpaid wages. In February, they burned tires outside the company's office. Mboup later said an agreement was reached for back wages to be paid in June.

“I took out loans to build a house and now I can't pay it back,” said Mboup, who had been making $200 a month, just above average for Senegal. “I've sold my motorbike and sheep to feed my children and send them to school, but many are not so lucky.”

Timis didn't respond to questions. Seck told the AP he was no longer affiliated with African Agriculture. Current CEO Mike Rhodes said he had been advised to not comment.

Herders and farmers are furious and have urged Senegal's government to let them use the land. But that rarely happens. In a study of 63 such foreign deals, the International Institute of Social Studies found only 11% of land was returned to the community. In most cases, the land is offered to other investors.

“We want to work with the government to rectify this situation. If not, we will fight,” warned Bayal Sow, the area's deputy mayor.

The Senegalese minister of agriculture, food sovereignty and herding, Mabouba Diagne, did not respond to questions. The African Agriculture deal occurred under the previous administration.

The failed project has undermined community trust, said herder Adama Sow, 74: “Before, we lived in peace, but now there's conflict for those of us who supported them.”

Meanwhile, African Agriculture's former CEO has moved on to a bigger land deal elsewhere on the continent — with experts raising questions again.

In August, South African Alan Kessler announced his new company, African Food Security, partnering with a Cameroonian, Baba Danpullo. It has announced a project roughly 30 times the size of the one in Senegal, with 635,000 hectares in Congo and Cameroon.

The new company seeks $875 million in investment. The company's investor prospectus, obtained by the AP, says it plans to register in Abu Dhabi.

In an interview with the AP in January, Kessler blamed the failure of the Senegal project on the way African Agriculture's public offering was structured. He said there were no plans for a public offering this time.

He claimed his new company's project would double corn production in these countries, and described African Food Security as the “most incredibly important development company on the planet.” He said they have started to grow corn on 200 hectares in Cameroon.

Experts who looked over the prospectus raised concerns about its claims, including an unusually high projection for corn yields. Kessler rejected those concerns.

“When he was CEO of African Agriculture, Kessler also made lofty claims about food production, job creation, exports and investment returns that did not pan out,” said Renée Vellvé, co-founder of GRAIN, a Spain-based nonprofit for land rights.

Hype without proof was a key strategy for African Agriculture, said its former chief operating officer, Javier Orellana, who said he is owed 165,000 euros ($178,000) in unpaid salary after leaving the company in 2023.

He told the AP he had been suspicious of the company's $450 million valuation.

“I know the agriculture industry well and ($450 million) didn't add up,” Orellana said, adding he stayed on because the company gave him what he called a very attractive offer.

In the end, a share in African Agriculture is now worth less than a penny.

“We are looking forward to going back to Senegal,” Kessler said. “We were appreciated there. We've been welcomed back there.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed Tuesday that they shot down another American MQ-9 Reaper drone, as the U.S. kept up its intense airstrikes targeting the group.

The reported shootdown came as airstrikes hit around Sanaa, the country's rebel-held capital, and Saada, a Houthi stronghold.

The U.S. military acknowledged to The Associated Press it was aware of reports of the downing of a Reaper, but declined to comment further.

U.S. President Donald Trump issued a new warning to the Houthis and their main benefactor, Iran, describing the group as being “decimated” by the campaign of strikes that began March 15.

“Many of their Fighters and Leaders are no longer with us,” Trump asserted on his social media website Truth Social. “We hit them every day and night — Harder and harder. Their capabilities that threaten Shipping and the Region are rapidly being destroyed. Our attacks will continue until they are no longer a threat to Freedom of Navigation.”

He added: “The choice for the Houthis is clear: Stop shooting at U.S. ships, and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise, we have only just begun, and the real pain is yet to come, for both the Houthis and their sponsors in Iran.”




The rebels claimed the drone was shot down in Marib governorate, home to oil and gas fields still under the control of allies to Yemen's exiled central government.

Footage released on social media showed flames in the night, with a Yemeni man claiming a drone had been shot down. Footage broadcast later Tuesday showed wreckage that appeared to be of the drone.

Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, separately claimed downing the MQ-9 drone in a prerecorded video message.

Saree described the rebels targeting the drone with “a suitable locally manufactured missile.” The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles — such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 — capable of downing aircraft.

Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo.

General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and remain in the air for over 30 hours. They have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA for years over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Yemen.

The Houthis claim they've shot down 20 MQ-9s over the country over the years, with 16 downed during the rebels' campaign over the Israel-Hamas war.

The U.S. military hasn't acknowledged the total number of drones it has lost there.

An Associated Press review has found the new American operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs in cities.

The new campaign of airstrikes, which the Houthis say have killed at least 61 people, started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.

The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none has been hit.

The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war, which has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The Chinese military announced large-scale drills in the waters and airspace around Taiwan on Tuesday that include an aircraft carrier battle group, as it again warned the self-ruled island democracy against seeking formal independence.

The joint exercises involve navy, air ground and rocket forces and are meant to be a “severe warning and forceful containment against Taiwan independence,” according to Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command. No operational name for the drills was announced nor previous notice given.

China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, while most Taiwanese favor their de-facto independence and democratic status. Any conflict could bring in the U.S., which maintains a series of alliances in the region and is legally bound to treat threats to Taiwan as a matter of “grave concern.”

Taiwan's Presidential Office posted on X that “China's blatant military provocations not only threaten peace in the #Taiwan Strait but also undermine security in the entire region, as evidenced by drills near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines & the SCS. We strongly condemn China's escalatory behavior.”

The SCS refers to the South China Sea, the strategic waterway that China claims almost in its entirety. China's navy also recently held drills near Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no warning, forcing the last-minute rerouting of commercial flights.

Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said it had tracked 19 Chinese navy vessels in the waters surrounding the island in a 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday. It added that the Shandong aircraft carrier group had entered into Taiwan's air defense identification zone on Monday, a self-defined area tracked by the military. 

Beijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a daily basis, and recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of these exercises. Taiwanese officials have recently warned that China could launch a sneak attack under the guise of military exercises. 

“I want to say these actions amply reflect (China's) destruction of regional peace and stability,” said Taiwan's Defense Minister Wellington Koo.

Taiwan has set up a central response group to monitor the latest exercises, Koo said.

On the streets of Taipei, people said the atmosphere was tense but they were more concerned about the economy and developments surrounding the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

“The Chinese Communists spend so much time and effort on these things but most people don't pay much attention,” said Lin Hui-tsung, a noodle seller in the city's Tiananmu district. 

China's Xinhua News Agency said the Eastern Theater Command on Tuesday conducted “multi-subject drills in waters to the north, south and east of Taiwan Island.”

The theater command “organized its vessel and aircraft formations, in coordination with conventional missile troops and long-range rocket launching systems, to conduct drills of air interception, assault on maritime targets, strikes on ground objects, and joint blockade and control,” Xinhua quoted the command as saying.

The exercises were “aimed at testing the troops' capabilities of carrying out integrated operations, seizure of operational control and multi-directional precision strikes, the command said.

“The PLA organized naval and air forces to practice subjects such as sea and land strikes, focusing on testing the troops' ability to carry out precision strikes on some key targets of the Taiwan authorities from multiple directions,” said Zhang Chi, a professor at China's National Defense University in an interview with Chinese state television. 

China's Coast Guard also announced it was conducting a “law enforcement patrol” on Tuesday around Taiwan, its spokesperson Zhu Anqin said.

The drills come just two weeks after a large-scale exercise in mid-March, when Beijing sent a large number of drones and ships toward the island. 

China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the exercises were directed at Lai Ching-te, Taiwan's strongly pro-independence president.

“Lai Ching-te stubbornly insists on a ‘Taiwan independence' stance, brazenly labeling the mainland as a ‘foreign hostile force,' and has put forward a so-called ‘17-point strategy' ... stirring up anti-China sentiments,” said China's Taiwan Affairs Office in a statement on Tuesday. “We will not tolerate or condone this in any way and must resolutely counter and severely punish these actions.”

In mid-March, Taiwan's Lai put forward a 17-point strategy aimed at shoring up Taiwan's national security. The points include allowing espionage cases to be tried by military courts and making immigration rules stricter for Chinese citizens applying for permanent residency. 

Lai's words and actions appear to have especially angered Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose previous attempts at intimidation have had little effect on the Taiwanese public. Those have often been timed in response to expressions of Taiwanese independence, including a visit by then U.S. House leader Nancy Pelosi. 

China's PLA also released a series of videos to publicize their military exercise, including one in which they depict Lai as a green parasite “poisoning” the island by hatching smaller parasites. The video shows Lai's head on the body of a bulbous green worm, with a pair of chopsticks picking him up and roasting him over a flame set over Taiwan.

Taiwan and China split amid civil war 76 years ago, but tensions have risen since 2016, when China cut off almost all contacts with Taipei. 

Philippines' military chief says country should be ready to rescue its citizens if China invades

In the Philippines, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. asked Filipino forces to prepare to rescue Filipinos working and living in Taiwan if China invades the island, speaking during a ceremony marking the founding anniversary of the military command that secures the Philippine region closest to Taiwan.

“If something happens to Taiwan, inevitably we will be involved. There are 250,000 overseas Filipino workers in Taiwan and we will have to rescue them,” Brawner said.

Wu reported from Bangkok. Christopher Bodeen in Taipei, Taiwan and Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines contributed to this report.

NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A criminal court in Cyprus has acquitted and dropped all charges against five Israelis accused of gang-raping a British woman in a hotel room after ruling her testimony as not credible and replete with “fundamental contradictions.”

The acquittal means the all the defendants who were between 19 and 20 years of age during the Sept. 3, 2023 alleged rape cannot be brought to trial again on the same charges that included sexual assault and abduction. 

According to a Cyprus News Agency report issued late Monday that cited a criminal court announcement, the court found during closed-doors proceedings that most of the contradictions in the woman's testimony concerned the identification of the perpetrators.

The court said the woman's initial statement to investigators following the alleged rape presented a number of “weaknesses,” which under the circumstances weren't “out of the ordinary.”

But investigators' doubts regarding the woman's credibility grew when she offered “entirely incomprehensible and inconsistent” explanations regarding the contradictions in her testimony, specifically regarding the identification of the perpetrators which also included a line-up.

The announcement — segments of which were seen by The Associated Press — also noted contradictions in the woman's statements to police regarding who and how many of the five defendants had committed rape. According to the court, the woman initially accused three men of rape while in a subsequent statement she accused five, two of whom weren't in the room where the rape occurred.




The court also referred to witness testimony disproving the woman's claim that she had screamed for help and that someone had opened the door to the hotel room to let others inside. 

The court said the woman – who was 20 at the time of the alleged rape – was under the influence of a “significant” amount of alcohol and the hallucinogens MDA and MDMA. popularly known as “Sally” and “Molly.”

But it found the quantities in her system weren't enough to “remove her ability for consent” since she testified that she only felt “a little dizzy” after consuming the alcohol and drugs.

All five of the Israeli men had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.

Police had said the British woman picked the five Israelis out of a line-up as having raped her during a hotel pool party in the coastal resort town of Ayia Napa.

The woman told police that one of the five men had forcibly taken her to his room after grabbing her hand while she was partying with friends around the pool.

She said the man tried to remove her bathing suit while she pleaded with him to let her leave. The other suspects then entered the room and one had intercourse with her against her will and another forced her to perform oral sex, while two others held her down on the bed, she said.

She said one suspect also held her against a wall and had intercourse with her.

She said she managed to lock herself in the bathroom and began shouting for help. She was able to flee the room by pushing the suspects aside and rejoined her friends, who went with her to report the incident to police, she said.

The ruling came after the European Court of Human Rights ruled last month that Cyprus' law enforcement authorities failed to live up to their obligation to thoroughly and effectively investigate a British teenager's claims that she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis while on a 2019 vacation in Ayia Napa.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina's poverty rate dropped to 38.1% in libertarian President Javier Milei ‘s first year in office, the nation's official statistics agency reported on Monday, a closely watched measure reflecting the government's progress wrestling down what had been among the world's highest inflation rates.

The decline in poverty for the second half of 2024 — from July to December — marks an improvement from the 41.7% that Milei's left-wing populist predecessors delivered for the second half of 2023. Milei swept to office late that year with a mandate to reverse the country's economic decline brought about by years of reckless borrowing.

“These figures reflect the failure of past policies, which plunged millions of Argentines into precarious conditions,” Milei's office said as the government statistics agency, known as INDEC, released its report. “The path of economic freedom and fiscal responsibility is the way to reduce poverty in the long term.”

But economists warn that the figure fails to capture the reality of ordinary people struggling to cope with the most radical austerity program in Argentina's recent history. Milei's blizzard of brutal cuts have hit everything from soup kitchens and bus fares to apartment rent and healthcare, eroding people's purchasing power.

“There is a big gap between what the statistics say and what you feel on the streets,” said Tomás Raffo, an economist at Argentina's largest public sector workers union CTA. “We suffered a very strong blow where a lot more people went into poverty and now some of them have come out. ... But those who were poor before all this have gotten even poorer.”

In the first half of 2024 — the first six months of Milei's presidency — INDEC reported that Argentina's poverty rate had soared to 53%. On Monday, INDEC reported that the poverty rate for the preceding six months had slid by 14.8 percentage points to just over 38%, a knock-on effect of rapidly falling inflation.

Annual inflation plummeted to 66.9% last month compared to 276.2% a year earlier, according to INDEC.

“Politically, this is a very important achievement for the government, especially in this year of midterm elections,” said Camilo Tiscornia, director of C&T Asesores Económicos, a consultancy in Buenos Aires, noting this marked the lowest poverty rate since the first half of 2022. “It shows that what the government is doing is starting to work.” 

That bright picture can be difficult to make out on the streets of Buenos Aires, where a growing number of Argentines try to survive by mining dumpsters for sustenance and hawking their wares at traffic lights. This month the capital was shaken by violent clashes between police and protesters demanding higher pensions.

“I see a lot more people selling things and sleeping in the street,” said Lorena Jiménez, a 46-year-old selling stickers with two of her nine children on Monday. A former house cleaner who lost her job last year, she and her kids now sleep most nights on the street, using the $160 they receive each month — part of a recently increased government stipend to support impoverished children — to pay for occasional hotel stays.

Questions over the rosy statistics have mounted in a country where past administrations were caught doctoring official data for political means. After a major scandal, INDEC underwent a yearslong overhaul before regaining credibility in 2016. 

“To me, this low inflation and poverty, it's a lie,” said Viviana Suarez, a 48-year-old insurance agent in Buenos Aires. “How does it make sense when you go to the supermarket and see the prices and realize you can't buy any food that's not on sale?”

A growing number of experts have voiced concern that, while perfectly orthodox, INDEC's inflation measure has become misleading partly because its consumer price index is based on a basket of basic goods from 2004. The government applies the inflation numbers to calculate the poverty rate.

“It's very outdated and gives little weight to the things with prices that have recently risen the most,” said Raffo, the economist with CTA.

For instance, CTA researchers say, food accounts today for a smaller share of an average household's budget than it did two decades ago. The index does not take into account digital subscriptions and other key expenses that have changed over time.

It also misses how critical private services like health care and education have become more expensive since Milei took office, and how residents are paying more for rent in a recently deregulated housing market, Raffo said.

He added: “INDEC is capturing very little of what is really happening in the economy.”

The victims included eight members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), six from the Palestinian Civil Defense (PCD), and one from the United Nations. Their remains were discovered by their colleagues in the Tal Al-Sultan area of Rafah, where they had been buried alongside their wrecked emergency vehicles—clearly marked ambulances, a fire truck, and a UN car.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinians held funerals Monday for 15 medics and emergency responders killed by Israeli troops in southern Gaza, after their bodies and mangled ambulances were found buried in an impromptu mass grave, apparently plowed over by Israeli military bulldozers.



The Palestinian Red Crescent says the slain workers and their vehicles were clearly marked as medical and humanitarian personnel and accused Israeli troops of killing them “in cold blood.” The Israeli military says its troops opened fire on vehicles that approached them “suspiciously” without identification.

The dead included eight Red Crescent workers, six members of Gaza's Civil Defense emergency unit and a staffer from UNRWA, the U.N.'s agency for Palestinians. The International Red Cross/Red Crescent said it was the deadliest attack on its personnel in eight years.



Since the war in Gaza began 18 months ago, Israel has killed more than 100 Civil Defense workers and more than 1,000 health workers, according to the U.N.



Here is what we know about what happened.


















The emergency teams had been missing since March 23, when they went at around noon to retrieve casualties after Israeli forces launched an offensive into the Tel al-Sultan district of the southern city of Rafah.



The military had called for an evacuation of the area earlier that day, saying Hamas militants were operating there. Alerts by the Civil Defense at the time said displaced Palestinians sheltering in the area had been hit and a team that went to rescue them was “surrounded by Israeli troops.” 



“The available information indicates that the first team was killed by Israeli forces on 23 March,” the U.N. said in a statement Sunday night. 



Further emergency teams that went to rescue the first team were “struck one after another over several hours,” it said. All the teams went out during daylight hours, according to the Civil Defense.

The Israeli military said Sunday that on March 23, troops opened fire on vehicles that were “advancing suspiciously” toward them without emergency signals.



It said “an initial assessment” determined that the troops killed a Hamas operative named Mohammed Amin Shobaki and eight other militants. Israel has struck ambulances and other emergency vehicles in the past, accusing Hamas militants of using them for transportation.



However, none of the dead staffers from the Red Crescent and Civil Defense had that name, and no other bodies were reported found at the site, raising questions over the military's suggestion that alleged militants were among the rescue workers.



The military did not immediately respond to requests for the names of the other alleged militants killed or for comment on how the emergency workers came to be buried.



The United Nations on Monday demanded “justice and answers” for the Israeli killings of emergency responders.



U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher made the demands saying: “They were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives.”



After a ceasefire that lasted roughly two months, Israel relaunched its military campaign in Gaza on March 18. Since then, bombardment and new ground assaults that have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry's count does not distinguish between militants and civilians, but it says over half those killed are women and children.



Aid workers say ambulance teams and humanitarian staff have come under fire in the renewed assault. A worker with the charity World Central Kitchen was killed Friday by an Israeli strike that hit next to a kitchen distributing free meals. A March 19 Israeli tank strike on a U.N. compound killed a staffer, the U.N. said, though Israel denies being behind the blast.

For days, Israeli forces would not allow access to the site where the emergency teams disappeared, the U.N. said.



On Wednesday, a U.N. convoy tried to reach the site but encountered Israeli troops opening fire on people.



The convoy saw a woman who had been shot lying in the road. The dashboard video shows staff talking about retrieving the woman. Then two people are seen walking across the road. Gunfire rings out and they flee. One stumbles, apparently wounded, before he is shot and falls onto his face to the ground. The U.N. said the team retrieved the body of the woman and left. 



On Sunday, the U.N. said teams were able to reach the site after the Israeli military informed it where it had buried the bodies, in a barren area on the edges of Tel al-Sultan. Footage released by the U.N shows workers from PRCS and Civil Defense, wearing masks and bright orange vests, digging through hills of dirt that appeared to have been piled up by Israeli bulldozers.



The footage shows them digging out multiple bodies wearing orange emergency vests. Some of the bodies are found piled on top of each other. At one point, they pull out a body in a Civil Defense vest out of the dirt, and it is revealed to be a torso with no legs. Several ambulances and a U.N. vehicle, all heavily damaged or torn apart, are also buried in the dirt.



“Their bodies were gathered and buried in this mass grave,” said Jonathan Whittall, with the U.N. humanitarian office OCHA, speaking at the site in the video. “We're digging them out in their uniforms, with their gloves on. They were here to save lives.”



“It's absolute horror what has happened here,” he said.

A giant crowd gathered on Monday outside the morgue of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis as the bodies of the eight slain PRCS workers were brought out for funerals. Their bodies were laid out on stretchers wrapped in white cloth with the Red Crescent logo on it and their photos, as family and others held funeral prayers over them. Funerals for the seven others followed.



“They were killed in cold blood by the Israeli occupation, despite the clear nature of their humanitarian mission,” Raed al-Nimis, the Red Crescent spokesperson in Gaza, told the AP.



Israeli troops have killed at least 30 Red Crescent medics over the course of the war. Among them were two killed in February 2024 when they tried to rescue Hind Rajab, a 5-year-old girl who was killed along with six other relatives when they were trapped in their car under Israeli fire in northern Gaza. 



From Geneva, the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Jagan Chapagain, said the staffer killed last week “wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked.”



“All humanitarians must be protected,” he said.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A fireball that erupted from a burst gas pipeline soared into the sky outside Malaysia's largest city and injured 145 people as it burned for several hours before being put out, authorities said Tuesday.

National oil company Petronas said the fire started at one of its gas pipelines outside Kuala Lumpur. The inferno caused 20-story flames and a huge crater in an empty area near a residential neighborhood.

Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad was quoted by the New Straits Times daily as saying 145 people including three children were injured. He said 67 people were still being treated at public hospitals, mostly for second and third-degree burns, while 37 others sought treatment from clinics and private hospitals.

The fire department said the fire damaged 190 houses and 148 cars.

Investigations were underway into the cause of the fire. Authorities said homes within 290 meters (yards) of the site will remain off-limits for now.

“There is a lot of damage across housing areas,” said Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who visited affected residents and announced financial aid for victims. He told them the government and Petronas will be responsible for repairing affected homes, which could take months.

Some residents said they felt a strong tremor, and homes shook.

Lee Weng Ken, whose left leg was burned, said the ceiling of his house collapsed.




“I rushed out of my house but fell and suffered burns due to the heat from the blaze,” he told Bernama.

Another victim who only wanted to be known as Andy told Bernama he ran out of his home with his children when they felt tremors and saw the fire about 100 meters away.

“My 18-year-old daughter injured her foot when she fell while climbing the fence due to the heat,” he said.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A powerful storm lashed the Greek islands of Paros and Mykonos on Monday, triggering widespread flooding and prompting authorities to close schools and impose a ban on all traffic except emergency vehicles.

Heavy rainfall in Paros' main towns of Parikia and Naousa – both popular vacation spots – caused floodwaters that surged through streets, carrying cars and debris past whitewashed buildings.

Authorities on Paros said 13 people stranded in the storm were taken by firefighters to their homes, adding that no one was reported injured or missing. 

On Mykonos, where the flooding was less intense, excavators were used to clear a path for floodwater and it gushed past seafront cafes and restaurants.

Authorities ordered schools on Paros, Mykonos and two other Aegean Sea islands to remain closed on Tuesday, while the civil protection service sent cell phone alerts instructing residents to stay indoors. Municipal crews and private contractors worked to clear roads blocked by fallen rocks, while emergency services rescued stranded motorists.

Several islands near Paros, in the Cyclades group, which is southeast of the mainland in the Aegean Sea, remain under severe weather warnings though Tuesday.

BANGKOK (AP) — When the earthquake that hit Myanmar sent its tremors to Thailand, Naruemon Thonglek didn't immediately know it also had collapsed a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok.

Seeing images of the debris on television news later, Naruemon immediately recognized the building where her long-time Burmese partner, his son and four of her friends had worked for the past month.

“My legs gave up. I lost all strength in my hands,” she said. “After the quake stopped I called him, messaged him, but there was no response. I couldn't contact him. I sent him voice messages and he never read it. Then I knew for sure that he must have been inside.”

At least 18 people died in Bangkok, Thailand's capital, more than 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) from the center of the magnitude 7.7 quake in Myanmar on Friday, which killed more than 2,000 people there. According to Myanmar state television, the quake has so far killed 2,065 people, with more than 3,900 injured and about 270 missing.

Relief agencies expect those numbers to rise sharply, since access is slow to remote areas where communications are down.

In Bangkok, 78 people remain missing. Thai authorities are racing against time to find anyone left alive under the ruins as the crucial 72-hour mark passes. While the authorities have said they detected possible sounds of life, so far only one person was pulled alive from the rubble.




Tavida Kamolvej, Bangkok's deputy governor, told reporters at the site Monday that crews are speeding up the search.

“Every second really counts,” she said.

Among those missing are the mother and younger sister of Chanpen Kaewnoi, who had been working at the site for a couple of months.

Chanpen said she couldn't contact them after the quake, but later was told by a survivor that they had been on the fifth floor of the 30-story building.

“He told me that they ran from the fifth floor, and once he reached the ground, the building just collapsed,” she said. “He said he couldn't find my mom and my sister. He said it was just a split second and he lost them.”

Naruemon said her partner, Kyi Tan, and the other five were assigned to work much higher up on the 26th floor. While her partner had extensive construction experience, this was his first high-rise project. As he left home on the morning of the quake, he said he would stay late in the hope of finishing his work by the end of the month.

Naruemon and Chanpen said they never heard their family members raise safety concerns while working at the building.

The authorities said they are investigating the cause of the building collapse as criticisms and concerns grow over safety and quality standards of Bangkok buildings. Chadchart Sittipunt, the city governor, has ordered a blanket inspection of all high-rise buildings in the capital.

Videos of the collapse show the building, which was meant to be a new State Audit Office, shaking a little before tumbling to the ground, sending a huge plume of dust into the sky as people scream and run away.

When Naruemon arrived at the site the following day, the scene of the ruins broke her spirit.

“I had a meltdown. I could only pray. I kept calling for them,” she said. “I wanted them to come back. I was so devastated. I didn't know what to do.”

For two days, Naruemon walked around near the site with her family and friends, hoping to see any developments as heavy machines and rescue crews searched for survivors. She prayed and performed a religious rite asking the spirits to protect her loved ones.

“I want everyone trapped there to be found. In whatever conditions, I'm ok with it,” she said. “I've already made some peace with it. It's been a few days already. A part of me still hopes they will survive, for a miracle, if it exists.”

PARIS (AP) — For years, Marine Le Pen stood at the gates of power — poised, relentless and rising. She stripped the French far right of its old symbols, sanded down its roughest edges and built in its place a sleek, disciplined machine with the single goal of winning the country's presidency.

In 2022, she came closer than anyone thought possible, winning more than 40% of the vote in the runoff against Emmanuel Macron. The Élysée Palace seemed within reach.

Now her political future may lay in ruins. On Monday, a French court convicted Le Pen of embezzling European Union funds and barred her from holding office for five years. The sentence may have done more than just potentially remove her from the next presidential race. It may have ended the most sustained far-right bid for power in Western Europe since World War II — surpassed only, in outcome, by Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni.

But the political earthquake Le Pen set in motion will rumble for years to come.

(AP Photo/Claude Paris, File)



Le Pen was born in 1968 into a family already on the fringes of French politics. In 1972, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the National Front party rooted in racism, antisemitism and a yearning for France's lost empire.

She was just 8 years old when a bomb destroyed the family's apartment in Paris in what was widely seen as an assassination attempt on her father. No one was seriously hurt, but the blast marked her for life. She has said it gave her a lasting sense that her family was hated, and that they would never be treated like other people.




As a young woman, she studied law, became a defense attorney and learned how to argue her way through hostile rooms. In politics, she didn't wait her turn. In 2011, she wrested control of the party from her father. In 2015, she expelled him after one of his Holocaust-denying tirades.

She renamed the party the National Rally. She replaced leather-jacketed radicals with tailored blazers and talking points. She talked less about race, more about the French way of life. She warned of “civilizational threats,” called for bans on headscarves and promised to put French families first.

Her tone changed. Her message didn't.

In one of her sharpest political maneuvers, she sought out a group long despised by her father: the LGBTQ community. Le Pen filled her inner circle with openly gay aides, skipped public protests against same-sex marriage and framed herself as a protector of sexual minorities against “Islamist danger.”

Critics called it “pinkwashing” — a cosmetic tolerance masking deeper hostility. But it worked. A surprising number of gay voters, especially younger ones, started backing her. Many saw strength, clarity and the promise of order in a world spinning too fast.

She ran for president three times: 2012, 2017 and 2022. Each time, she climbed higher. In her final campaign, she was confident, calm and media savvy. She leaned into her role as a single mother, posed with her cats and repeated her calls for “national priority.” She no longer shocked. She convinced.

Behind her stood a constellation of far-right leaders cheering her on: Hungary's Viktor Orbán, Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni in Italy, the Netherlands' Geert Wilders. They saw in her not only an ally, but a leader. Her mix of cultural nationalism, social media fluency and calculated restraint became a blueprint.

“Marine Le Pen posts pictures of her cat, talks about being a mother. But when it comes to policy, there's no softening,” said Pierre Lefevre, a Paris-based consultant. “It makes extreme positions seem more palatable, even to people who might otherwise be put off.”

When Le Pen lost in 2022, she didn't vanish. She regrouped, stayed present in parliament and prepared for 2027. Polls had her leading. Macron cannot run again.

Then came Monday's verdict.

The court found that Le Pen had siphoned off millions of euros in public funds while serving in the European Parliament, paying party staff with money intended for EU assistants. Prosecutors described it as deliberate and organized. The court agreed.

She was sentenced to two years of house arrest, fined €100,000 ($108,200) and banned from holding public office for five years. She said she would appeal. The house arrest sentence will be suspended during the appeal, but the ban on holding office takes effect immediately.

Her allies erupted in outrage. Orbán declared, “Je suis Marine” — I am Marine. Salvini called the ruling “a declaration of war by Brussels.” Meloni lamented it was “depriving millions of citizens of their representation.” U.S. President Donald Trump decried it as “a very big deal... it sounds like this country.” In Paris, her supporters called it political persecution. Her opponents fist-pumped in the streets.

Even in disgrace, Le Pen remains one of the most consequential political figures of her time. She took a name that once evoked hatred and transformed it into a serious vehicle for national leadership. She made the far right electable. She blurred the line between fringe and power.

Her party, the National Rally, became the largest last year in France's lower house of parliament. Her handpicked successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, now leads it. He is polished and popular, but he lacks broad political experience and name recognition.

Whether Le Pen returns after her ban, fades into silence or reinvents herself again, her mark is permanent. She forced mainstream rivals to adapt to her language. She turned fear into votes and redefined what was politically possible in a republic once seen as immune to extremism.

She never became president, but she changed the race and the rules.

BEIRUT (AP) — The Israeli military struck a building in Beirut's southern suburbs early Tuesday, killing at least four people, as the military said it had targeted a member of the Hezbollah militant group.

The airstrike came without warning days after Israel launched an attack on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, on Friday for the first time since a ceasefire ended fighting between Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group in November. The Israeli military then had warned residents in the crowded suburbs before the attack after two projectiles were launched from southern Lebanon, which Hezbollah denied firing.

At least seven other people were wounded in Tuesday's airstrike, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

The Israeli military said in a statement the latest strike targeted a Hezbollah member who had been helping the Palestinian Hamas group in the Gaza Strip in planning an attack “against Israeli civilians.” It said the airstrike was “under the direction of the Shin Bet,” Israel's domestic intelligence agency.

At a news conference, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar says earlier today the Israeli military struck a building in Beirut's southern suburbs, targeting a member of the Hezbollah militant group.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the airstrike.

“We must prevent any violation of sovereignty from abroad, or from infiltrators within who provide an additional pretext for aggression,” Aoun wrote in a statement posted on X. The former military chief vowed after his election in January that all weapons would be at the hands of the Lebanese state, indirectly referring to Hezbollah's arms. 

Among those killed in the airstrike were Hezbollah official Hassan Bdeir and his son, Ali, according to a Hezbollah official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to speak publicly to the media. The official said that the two other people killed were their neighbors: two siblings, a young man and a woman.




Another Hezbollah official denied Israeli military statements that Bdeir was preparing an attack against Israel, adding that one of his jobs was to meet with Palestinian officials. Bdeir was not a senior official within Hezbollah and did not take any precautionary measures, the official said, adding that Bdeir was moving around and residing in his home normally before Tuesday's airstrike. 

Senior Hezbollah legislator Ali Ammar said the group does not want war.

“But at the same time, if war is imposed on Hezbollah … then Hezbollah is fully prepared to deter any assault,” Ammar said in a statement to the press at the site of the airstrike.

Photos and videos widely shared on local and social media showed the top three floors of an apartment building damaged following the strike. Piles of debris on cars below the building can be seen.

Jets were heard in parts of the Lebanese capital before the strike near the Hay Madi neighborhood. During Israel's last war with Hezbollah, Israeli drones and jets regularly pounded the southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has wide influence and support. Israel sees the area as a militant stronghold and accuses the group of storing weapons there.

“We were at home. It was Eid al-Fitr,” said Hussein Nour El-Din, a resident in the neighborhood, referring to the Islamic holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. “We didn't know where it happened, but once the smoke cleared we saw it was the building facing us.”

The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah group, Sheikh Naim Kassem, warned Saturday that if Israel's attacks on Lebanon continued and if Lebanon's government does not act to stop them, the group would eventually resort to other alternatives.

Under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that ended the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January, while Hezbollah had to end its armed presence south of the Litani River along the border with Israel.

Israel has launched daily strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect, saying it targets Hezbollah officials and infrastructure. The Lebanese military has gradually deployed in the country's southern region, and Beirut has urged the international community to pressure Israel to stop attacks and withdraw its forces still present on five hilltops in Lebanese territory.

Rescue workers at the U Hla Thein monastery said 270 monks were taking a religious exam when the quake hit, decimating the monastery. 70 were able to escape, but 50 have already been found dead and 150 are still unaccounted for.

With an ongoing civil war and poor infrastructure, Myanmar was already one of the most challenging places in the world for aid organizations to operate, and relief efforts have been further hampered by severe damage to roads, bridges and hospitals, power outages, fuel shortages and spotty communications.

Thai rescue workers who were coordinating efforts on Monday to find anyone left alive under a collapsed building in the capital Bangkok after the Myanmar earthquake said they had detected signs of possible life. The discovery curtailed a visit to the site of the building, felled by last week's earthquake, by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. Officials said they needed to consult experts so needed her to leave.

Thai authorities coordinating efforts to find anyone left alive under a collapsed building in the capital Bangkok after the Myanmar earthquake said Monday they had detected signs of possible life.

Work was still ongoing on Monday at the State Audit Office building in Bangkok, which collapsed during last week's earthquake. As of Sunday evening, 76 people were still unaccounted for at the site, according to local authorities. (AP Video by Jerry Harmer)

BANGKOK (AP) — The death toll in last week's massive earthquake in Myanmar has passed 2,000, state media said Monday, as accounts of some people's last moments emerged: Two hundred Buddhist monks crushed by a collapsing monastery. Fifty children killed when a preschool classroom crumbled. Seven hundred Muslims struck while praying at mosques for Ramadan.

The quake could exacerbate hunger and disease outbreaks in a country that was already one of the world's most challenging places for humanitarian organizations to operate because of civil war, aid groups and the United Nations warned.

The 7.7 magnitude quake hit Friday, with the epicenter near Myanmar's second-largest city of Mandalay. It damaged the city's airport, buckled roads and collapsed hundreds of buildings along a wide swath down the country's center.

Relief efforts are further hampered by power outages, fuel shortages and spotty communications. A lack of heavy machinery has slowed search-and-rescue operations, forcing many to search for survivors by hand in daily temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports aid groups are getting into gear after last week's devastating earthquake in Myanmar.

Rescue workers at Mandalay's collapsed U Hla Thein monastery said they were still searching for about 150 of the dead monks.

Some 700 Muslim worshipers attending Friday prayers were killed when mosques collapsed, said Tun Kyi, a member of the steering committee of the Spring Revolution Myanmar Muslim Network. He said some 60 mosques were damaged or destroyed. Videos posted on The Irrawaddy online news site showed several mosques toppling.




It was not clear whether those numbers were already included in the official toll.

Myanmar state MRTV reported that the leader of the military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, told Pakistan's prime minister during a call that 2,065 people were killed, with more than 3,900 injured and about 270 missing. 

Relief agencies expect those numbers to rise sharply, since access is slow to remote areas where communications are down.

The United Nations' Myanmar country team called for unimpeded access for aid teams.

“Even before this earthquake, nearly 20 million people in Myanmar were in need of humanitarian assistance,” said Marcoluigi Corsi, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator.

“We're really not clear on the scale of the destruction at this stage,” Lauren Ellery, deputy director of programs in Myanmar for the International Rescue Committee, told The Associated Press. “They were talking about a town near Mandalay where 80% of the buildings were reportedly collapsed, but it wasn't in the news because telecommunications have been slow.”

Groups the IRC works with have reported that some places are cut off by landslides, she said.

The World Health Organization said it has reports of three hospitals destroyed and 22 partially damaged in the region.

“There is an urgent need for trauma and surgical care, blood transfusion supplies, anesthetics, essential medicines and mental health support,” it said.

More than 10,000 buildings are collapsed or severely damaged in central and northwest Myanmar, the U.N. humanitarian agency said. One preschool classroom building collapsed in Mandalay district, killing 50 children and two teachers, it said.

An artificial intelligence analysis of satellite images of Mandalay by Microsoft's AI for Good Lab showed 515 buildings with 80% to 100% damage and another 1,524 with 20% to 80% damage. It was not clear what percentage of the city's buildings that represented.

Rescue efforts are also complicated by the civil war. In 2021, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into significant armed resistance.

While one group has declared a partial unilateral ceasefire, the government and other armed groups have not stopped fighting.

Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places were dangerous or impossible for aid groups to reach even before the quake. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting, according to the U.N.

Ellery with the International Rescue Committee noted that the area worst hit by the earthquake was seriously damaged by flooding last year, and many displaced people sought refuge there.

Since the earthquake, many people have been sleeping outside, either because homes were destroyed or out of fear of aftershocks.

Monsoon rains start in May and finding people shelter will be a major challenge, she said.

International rescue teams from several countries are on the scene, including from Russia, China, India and several Southeast Asian countries.

On Monday, an Indian team jackhammered through slabs of fallen concrete at one site in Mandalay. They could be seen bringing out one body.

The European Union, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and others have announced millions of dollars in aid.

Despite massive cuts and firings at the U.S. Agency for International Development — the body charged with delivering humanitarian assistance overseas — the U.S. Embassy said a team of experts was on its way to Myanmar. The embassy said it would provide up to $2 million through local organizations.

A small number of U.S. military personnel were sent to assist in Bangkok, where the earthquake killed at least 18 people, many at a construction site where a partially built high-rise collapsed. Another 33 have been reported injured and 78 missing, primarily at the construction site near the popular Chatuchak market.

On Monday, heavy equipment was temporarily shut down at the site and authorities urged onlookers to be silent as they used machines to try and detect signs of life.

Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt told reporters that signs had been detected Sunday night, though experts could not determine whether it had been machine error.

Watching the crews at work, Naruemon Thonglek said she had “made some peace” with the fact that her partner and five friends there were unlikely to be found alive.

“A part of me still hope they will survive,” she said.

This story has been updated to correct that 200 monks were reported killed.

Associated Press journalists Jerry Harmer and Jintamas Saksornchai in Bangkok, and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.

The Israeli military struck a building in Beirut's southern suburbs early Tuesday, killing at least four people in an attack it said targeted a member of the Hezbollah militant group. The airstrike came just days after Israel launched its first attack on the Lebanese capital since a ceasefire ended fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah in November.

Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, report finding it harder to find food as bakeries were closing due to lack of flour and fuel. Israel says enough food entered Gaza during a six-week ceasefire with Hamas to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for “a long period of time,” but the U.N. says its stockpiles are critically low. 

For the past month, Israel has not allowed food, fuel or humanitarian aid to enter Gaza to pressure Hamas — a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime.

Here's the latest:

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the United Nations is “at the tail end of our supplies,” forcing the U.N. World Food Program to close all 25 of its bakeries in Gaza because of a lack of flour and cooking fuel.

“WFP doesn't close its bakeries for fun,” Dujarric said.

He said the food situation remains “very critical” since Israel closed all crossings into Gaza a month ago, cutting off all humanitarian deliveries.

COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said Tuesday that nearly 450,000 tons of aid entered Gaza during the ceasefire. COGAT claimed at least some of the aid from the U.N. and its humanitarian partners was being diverted to Hamas.

Responding to that, Dujarric said, “The U.N. has kept a chain of custody, and a very good chain of custody, on all the aid.”

A teenager from the West Bank who was held in an Israeli prison for six months without being charged died after collapsing in unclear circumstances, becoming the first Palestinian under 18 to die in Israeli detention, officials said.

Walid Ahmad, 17, was a healthy high schooler before his arrest in September for allegedly throwing stones at soldiers, his family said. Rights groups have documented widespread abuse in Israeli detention facilities holding thousands of Palestinians who were rounded up after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in the Gaza Strip.

Israel's prison service did not respond to questions about the boy's cause of death. 

The family believes Walid contracted amoebic dysentery from the poor conditions in the prison, an infection that causes diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness — and can be fatal if left untreated.

Prison authorities deny any systematic abuse and say they investigate accusations of wrongdoing by prison staff. But the Israeli ministry overseeing prisons acknowledges conditions inside detention facilities have been reduced to the minimum level allowed under Israeli law.

The Western-backed Palestinian Authority says he is the 63rd Palestinian from the West Bank or Gaza to die in Israeli detention since the start of the war.

Accompanied by German diplomats, hundreds of Gaza residents were flown from southern Israel's Ramon Airport to the German city of Leipzig on Tuesday, the Israeli Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Interior Minister Moshe Arbel visited the airport “with the aim of examining the process of voluntary departure of Gazans to a third country,” the statement said.

German officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the flight.

Israel's Cabinet recently approved a new directorate tasked with advancing the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians from Gaza, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to depopulate Gaza and rebuild it for others. The Defense Ministry said the new body would coordinate “passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries.”

Tuesday's statement appeared to be the first official announcement by Israel that Palestinians were leaving as part of such a plan.

Trump's plan has been universally rejected by Palestinians, who view it as forcible expulsion from their homeland. Human rights experts say it would likely violate international law.

The Interior Ministry statement said hundreds more Palestinians from Gaza had been flown to a third country “since the beginning of the process,” mainly to Germany, Romania and United Arab Emirates.

Dozens or Palestinians lined up outside a United Nations warehouse in northern Gaza on Tuesday to receive food parcels from the agency's rapidly dwindling supplies, as Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza for the past month.

Nageya Gaballah, a displaced woman living in a tent with 10 family members, said she wouldn't be able to secure essentials if it weren't for aid and vouchers distributed by UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. She lost her job as a cleaning staffer at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza last month and her husband is unemployed.

At the warehouse in Jabaliya, UNRWA distributed flour bags and food parcels with cooking oil, canned tuna, beans, hummus, salt, sugar and yeast.

Mohamed Ghabn, who is also unemployed, said securing food has become extremely difficult, as he cannot afford to buy it from markets when it's available, and World Food Program-supported bakeries have shut down. He said a bag of pita bread costs 30 shekels ($8) and a kilogram of tomatoes is priced at 15 shekels ($4).

“We are unemployed and don't have jobs. We're just sitting there, and we don't have shelter or anything … simply speaking, I can't feed my children,” he said.

Mohamed Salah Bardawil was a journalist with the Hamas-affiliated Aqsa Radio. He was the nephew of Salah Bardawil, a well-known member of Hamas' political bureau who Israel killed last month in a strike that also killed his wife.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike, which hit the journalist's home early Tuesday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis and killed his wife, two daughters and son.

Associated Press footage showed the building completely collapsed, with dried blood splatted on the grey rubble. Nearby, a child's school notebook, dust-covered dolls and clothing lay half-buried in the ruins.

Fathi Nushasi, a Khan Younis resident who lives nearby, said the airstrike felt like an earthquake.

“I've witnessed many wars, but I have never seen anything like what happened to us. The rubble entered our bedroom,” he said.

Dozens of people gathered at Nasser Hospital for funeral prayers, with one man crying in anguish, “Those were children sleeping!” A press vest was placed over Bardawil's body bag.

Israel has killed over 170 journalists and media workers since the war with Hamas began in October 2023, the Committee to Protect Journalists estimated as of March 24. Most recently, prominent Al Jazeera journalist Hossam Shabat was killed by a strike on his car.

Israel says enough food entered the Gaza Strip during its six-week ceasefire with Hamas to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for “a long period of time.”

U.N. agencies have warned that food is running out, and Palestinians in Gaza say markets are largely empty after Israel cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to the territory at the beginning of March to pressure Hamas.

COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said Tuesday that more than 25,000 trucks entered Gaza during the ceasefire, carrying nearly 450,000 tons of aid. It said that amount represented around a third of what has entered during the entire war.

“There is enough food for a long period of time, if Hamas lets the civilians have it,” it said.

Palestinians in the Gaza Strip say it's even harder to find food as bakeries close due to a tightened Israeli blockade of the territory.

The World Food Program was forced to close another 19 bakeries that had served hundreds of thousands of people because its supplies are dwindling, according to an internal memo circulated among aid groups on Monday.

Mohammed al-Kurd, a father of 12, said his children go to bed without dinner.

“We tell them to be patient and that we will bring flour in the morning,” he said. “We lie to them and to ourselves.” Sulaiman Hasanat, a father of seven, said his family often spends an entire day searching for bread without any luck.

Israel cut off the supply of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians in early March to pressure Hamas into accepting changes to their ceasefire agreement. Israel resumed airstrikes and ground operations later that month.

The World Food Program says it's immediately closing all of its bakeries in Gaza following a monthlong blockade by Israel into the strip. 

In an internal memo circulated among aid groups Monday, the U.N. agency said that due to the lack of humanitarian aid, its supplies are running out and it doesn't have enough wheat flour needed to make bread. 

The agency said it's distributed all available food rations, and there are unfortunately no more stocks.

For four weeks, Israel has shut off all sources of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies for the Gaza Strip's population of more than 2 million Palestinians. It's the longest blockade yet of the 17-month war with Hamas, with no sign of it ending. 

Aid workers have stretched supplies, but warn of a catastrophic surge in severe hunger and malnutrition.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has withdrawn his nomination of a former navy commander to lead the country's internal security agency after a flurry of criticism.

Netanyahu's office said in a statement early Tuesday after meeting with Vice Adm. Eli Sharvit that he “intends to examine other candidates,” without elaborating.

The nomination announced on Monday had provoked widespread criticism from allies and opponents.

Critics of Netanyahu are already up in arms over his move to fire Ronen Bar, the current head of the Shin Bet domestic security agency, viewing it as part of a broader assault on state institutions at a time when Netanyahu is on trial for alleged corruption and his aides are being investigated over links to the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar.

Israel's Supreme Court froze Bar's dismissal pending further hearings but cleared the way for Netanyahu to interview candidates for the job.

The nomination of Sharvit angered some of Netanyahu's allies after Israeli media reported that he had taken part in protests against Netanyahu's plans to overhaul the judiciary in 2023.

The move also brought an unexpected rebuke from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, who tweeted an excerpt of an op-ed Sharvit had written for an Israeli technology news website in January 2024 criticizing Trump's climate policies.

Graham called the nomination “beyond problematic.”

The Israeli military says it intercepted a projectile fired from the Gaza Strip early Tuesday that set off sirens in nearby communities.

Palestinian militants have fired a small number of rockets, without causing any casualties or damage, since Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas last month.

Israel has launched waves of airstrikes and limited ground operations, killing hundreds of Palestinians.

Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251, most of whom have since been released in ceasefires or other deals. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.

Israel's offensive has killed over 50,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants or civilians.

A volcano began erupting in southwestern Iceland on Tuesday, just hours after authorities evacuated a nearby community and the Blue Lagoon spa. Flames and smoke shot through the air as the volcanic fissure opened near the town of Grindavik, where some 40 homes have been evacuated, national broadcaster RUV reported. The community, located on the Reykjanes Peninsula, was largely evacuated a year ago when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for 800 years.

GRINDAVIK, Iceland (AP) — A volcano in southwestern Iceland that has erupted repeatedly for more than a year again belched lava and smoke into the air on Tuesday, just hours after authorities evacuated the few remaining residents of a nearby fishing village.

The eruption began at 9:45 a.m. local time (0945 GMT), triggering warning sirens in the town of Grindavik where webcams showed molten rock spewing toward the community. It had subsided by late afternoon, though the volcano was still active, Iceland's Met Office said.

Police and civil defense officials evacuated Grindavik and the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, one of Iceland's biggest tourist attractions, after an early morning earthquake swarm suggested an eruption was imminent.

The community, located on the Reykjanes Peninsula, was largely evacuated in November 2023 when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for some 800 years.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Iceland's weather agency says a volcano is erupting in the southwestern part of the country.

About 40 homes were evacuated on Tuesday, though police reported that some residents refused to leave their homes. 

“Those individuals who choose to remain in the town don't seem to consider that I have 50 people involved in this operation, some of whom are volunteers,” Úlfar Lúðvíksson, police commissioner in South Iceland, told local broadcaster RUV. “I would ask that more consideration be shown towards civil defense.”

Iceland sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic. The most disruptive incident in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.

Flights were not affected by Tuesday's eruption.

        The upcoming summit in Samarkand will be truly historic as it will bring together for the first time the leaders of the five Central Asian countries and the EU in one place, Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said in a Euronews exclusive.
    

The Central Asia-EU summit in the historic Uzbekistan city of Samarkand marks a significant development in the relationship between Central Asia and the European Union. 

This meeting comes at a time of global geopolitical instability, economic risks and climate challenges, which in turn means there is a need for new forms of international cooperation.

The summit aims to strengthen economic partnerships: with trade between Central Asia and the EU quadrupling over the past seven years, the summit seeks to build on this momentum and look for greater interregional cooperation while addressing joint challenges.

Euronews spoke to Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev about the summit's goals and expectations, and the historical ties and shared interests between the two regions.

Euronews: In recent years, the world has been changing rapidly: geopolitical instability, growing economic risks, climate challenges - all this requires new formats of international cooperation.  

In this context, the Central Asia-EU summit in Samarkand looks like a turning point in the relations between the two. Why is it now that interaction is reaching a new level? 

Shavkat Mirziyoyev: Our regions are linked by deep historical roots, coinciding interests, and a common desire for close partnership. We have a clear vision of the agenda of interaction with the European Union, based on almost thirty years of cooperation. 

Our partnership with the European Union is a two-way relationship from which both sides should benefit. 

The Central Asia-European Union format of cooperation is a unique platform of interaction and is unparalleled in its scale and institutional scope. The European Union, which unites 27 states, including the three G7 countries (Germany, France and Italy), is the largest integration association building systemic interaction with Central Asia at the interregional level. 

Cooperation with the EU covers a wide range of areas - from the economy and investment to sustainable development, security and digital transformation - and is based on long-term strategic priorities. 

We regularly meet with our European colleagues. Visits to the region by leaders of the world's leading countries have become noticeably more frequent. Uzbekistan has established a strategic partnership with Italy, Hungary and France. Germany and the Central Asian countries have become regional strategic partners. 

Today, the EU is consistently developing trade and investment ties with the Central Asian states.  

Over the past seven years, the trade turnover between Central Asian countries and the EU has quadrupled, amounting to 54 billion euros. 

We are pleased to see the growing interest of European businesses in the opportunities for trade and investment interaction with Uzbekistan and other countries of the region. 

The positive processes observed in the region are increasing interest in Central Asia, turning the region into an important partner of world powers and leading states at the geopolitically important crossroads of the main routes between East and West, North and South. This is reflected in the “CA Plus” formats, which allow maintaining an open dialogue, creating favorable conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation of all stakeholders. 

Under these conditions, the establishment of a strategic partnership between the countries of our region and the European Union during the summit in Samarkand will open new areas in the development of interregional cooperation and interconnectivity. 

Euronews: Could you tell us more about the choice of Samarkand for holding the summit? What kind of symbolic value does it have in terms of dialogue and opportunities?

Mirziyoyev: Samarkand is a city that has been a centre of trade, science and diplomacy for centuries. Its glory was built on its ability to unite cultures, peoples and ideas. Today, it is once again becoming a platform where Europe and Central Asia can discuss the key challenges of our time.  

Samarkand occupies a special place in the centuries-old history of international relations of the peoples living in the vast area of Central and South Asia and the Middle East. It was from here that Amir Temur, the ruler of Maverannahr more than six centuries ago, was in active contact with European monarchs to ensure free and safe trade. 

At present, Samarkand is restoring its special role in international life, preserving and multiplying the historical political and diplomatic heritage of the country in a new, broader format.  

Historically, the world from Samarkand is seen as one and indivisible, not divided. This is the essence of a unique phenomenon - the “Samarkand spirit”, based on which a fundamentally new format of international interaction is being constructed. 

Euronews: How would you characterise the key changes that took place in the region in the past years, and what priorities do you set during the period of Uzbekistan's chairmanship in the Central Asian Five?  

Mirziyoyev: First of all, I would like to emphasise that Central Asia is the top priority in Uzbekistan's foreign policy due to a number of factors. First, if we look at the political map of the modern world, it will become obvious that the overwhelming majority of armed conflicts, confrontations and outbreaks of violence take place between neighboring states. This applies to the Middle East, the post-Soviet space, South Asia, Africa and other regions of the world. 

Unfortunately, Central Asia has not become an exception.  

In different periods there have been armed clashes, the situation has been complicated by unresolved territorial disputes, water and energy problems, transportation and communication issues, as well as security challenges.  

All this could not continue indefinitely. Contradictions were escalating, disagreements were deepening, and the emerging uneasy situation posed a serious threat to the security of the region. 

Realising this situation, we made a strategic decision to build constructive, good-neighbourly and mutually beneficial relations with neighbouring states step by step in Central Asia. This approach is based on mutual trust and respect, consideration and recognition of common interests. 

 Central Asia has undergone a profound transformation in recent years and has acquired a new identity as a space of constructive dialogue, trust and comprehensive cooperation. This has become possible due to the common political will of the leaders of our countries, and today we can confidently speak about the irreversibility of this process. 

When in 2017 at the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly Uzbekistan came up with the initiative to hold consultative meetings, we proceeded from a simple but important idea: no external partners would be able to help us build peace, stability and prosperity in the region if we ourselves do not start with a trusting and candid dialogue. 

This process has proven to be effective. Today we are resolving the most complex issues at the negotiating table, coordinating joint initiatives and moving forward confidently. 

This year, the 7th Consultative Meeting will be held in Tashkent. At such meetings we do not just discuss the agenda and “reconcile our clocks”, but make concrete decisions that change the face of the region. One of the brightest recent examples is the complete settlement of the issue of delimitation of the state border between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. This is a breakthrough that the parties have been working towards for many years. 

To stimulate trade, border trade zones are being created, joint investment funds are being launched, and major infrastructure and industrial projects are being implemented. 

Central Asia is becoming an important link in global transportation chains. We are actively developing the Trans-Caspian and Trans-Afghan transport corridors, which will allow our countries to expand access to key global markets. 

Thus, Central Asia is no longer on the margins of history, but is turning into a dynamically developing region that is shaping its own strategic agenda. Political consolidation, the achieved high level of trust and joint economic initiatives in the region have created new opportunities for sustainable development. 

During its chairmanship of the Central Asian Five, Uzbekistan will pay special attention to three key areas: strengthening regional security, deepening economic integration and environmental sustainability.  

We are facing a historic chance to make our region not only sustainable but also prosperous. I am convinced that by joint efforts we will be able to realise this potential. 

Euronews: What reforms carried out in Uzbekistan stimulate the strengthening of economic partnership with the European Union, and what measures on the EU side can bring the links with Central Asia to a new level?   

Mirziyoyev: In Uzbekistan, we are consistently creating a favourable business environment, developing market institutions, and improving the investment climate. Key steps in this direction include the introduction of a ""one-stop-shop"" system for foreign investors, the liberalisation of the foreign exchange market, and the reduction of the tax burden on businesses. 

As a result, our country's economic cooperation with the European Union has shown positive dynamics. In 2024, Uzbekistan's trade turnover with EU countries reached $6.4 billion, increasing by 5.2% compared to the previous year. 

More than 1,000 enterprises with European capital now operate in Uzbekistan, and the total volume of investment projects amounts to €30 billion. We anticipate that the signing of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) with the EU will open new opportunities for strengthening trade and investment ties. 

We are ready to supply the EU market with a greater volume of high-quality, environmentally friendly products that meet the highest European standards. In the modern world, the development of efficient transport and logistics corridors is becoming increasingly important, and Central Asia can serve not only as a “bridge” between Europe and Asia but also as an active participant in global economic processes. 

In this context, we propose aligning the EU's Global Gateway strategy with key transport projects in our region, as well as jointly developing an Action Plan to advance the Trans-Caspian Transport Corridor. This will drive investment growth, infrastructure development, and the introduction of innovative technologies. 

To elevate economic interconnectedness to a qualitatively new level, it is essential to further simplify trade procedures, improve access for Central Asian goods to European markets, and harmonise technical standards and certification processes. A crucial role is played by attracting European businesses to participate in infrastructure projects, developing the digital economy, and fostering innovation-driven cooperation. 

We also support the activation of financial assistance mechanisms, including through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, and other international financial institutions. Creating favourable conditions for the growth of small and medium-sized businesses in the region, with the participation of European partners, will help strengthen economic resilience and improve the standard of living for the population. 

Euronews: Central Asia is one of the few regions with significant reserves of energy resources and vast potential for the development of renewable energy. What role can your region play in ensuring Europe's energy stability, especially considering recent trends toward renewable energy sources? 

Mirziyoyev: Central Asia can become a reliable partner, capable not only of ensuring stable energy supply but also of making a significant contribution to global decarbonisation. 

A major area of cooperation lies in the ongoing project, involving Central Asian countries, to create a Green Strategic Corridor through the Caspian and Black Seas to Europe. The implementation of this initiative will lay a solid foundation for our mutually beneficial energy connectivity. 

An important institutional platform for cooperation in renewable energy could be the establishment of a Central Asia-EU Clean Energy Partnership. This initiative would facilitate collaboration on the production of green hydrogen, ammonia, and biofuels as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. 

Currently, Uzbekistan and other countries in the region are actively expanding their renewable energy capacity. The implementation of green energy and climate projects will also support the development of a carbon credit market in Central Asia. 

This mechanism will enable enterprises to attract investment in clean technologies while serving as a platform for international cooperation in carbon trading. 

In addition to the 14 newly commissioned solar and wind power plants, we plan to implement more than 50 similar projects with a total capacity of 24,000 megawatts.   

Over the next five years, we aim to increase the share of renewable energy sources to 54%. This will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 16 million tons and contribute to Uzbekistan's early fulfilment of its commitment to cut emissions by 35% under the Paris Agreement.   

Another important focus is the modernisation of energy systems, which will enhance efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint. 

Euronews: How do you assess the prospects of discussing security issues at the upcoming summit? What cooperation areas between Central Asia and the EU are of particular interest to you?  

Mirziyoyev: We are witnessing a profound transformation of the international relations system. The world is undergoing large-scale changes, the consequences of which remain difficult to predict.   

Ensuring regional security has always been and remains one of the highest priorities for the countries of Central Asia. That is why, in 2023, we set the goal of bringing a new agenda for Central Asia-EU cooperation in this field to expert discussions.   

We recognise that our region and the European Union face common security threats and challenges, including the fight against terrorism, extremism, and transnational crime, such as drug trafficking. In this regard, cooperation with the European Union in the field of security is one of the key areas of our partnership.   

Given current realities, we believe it is essential not only to continue collaboration within existing programs but also to develop new initiatives aimed at countering cyber threats and extremism. 

Euronews: Afghanistan remains a key focus of Uzbekistan's foreign policy. While many countries refrain from engaging with the interim government and integrating Afghanistan into regional and international cooperation, Uzbekistan actively interacts with its southern neighbour.   

What drives Uzbekistan's approach to Afghanistan, and what are the prospects for maintaining the high intensity of cooperation between our countries on this issue? 

Mirziyoyev: Uzbekistan's approach to Afghanistan has always been pragmatic and strategically oriented toward the long term. We have never isolated or turned away from our neighbour. 

We have always believed that Afghanistan's development is impossible without constructive engagement with neighbouring countries, including Uzbekistan as its closest and most important partner.   

It must be acknowledged that many who initially disagreed with our policy on Afghanistan are now compelled to recognise its correctness and inevitability. 

We were convinced that the previous regime in Afghanistan would not be able to maintain power due to several factors — its inability to establish full control over the country's territory, its unwillingness to engage in dialogue with the opposition, its lack of intent to form an inclusive government, and widespread corruption that permeated all levels of the former administration.   

The current leadership has managed to stabilise the situation in Afghanistan and redirect its resources toward infrastructure development, including airports, domestic railway networks, and water and energy facilities, as well as toward reducing opium cultivation. 

According to UN data, following the Taliban's 2023 ban on drug sales, opium cultivation in Afghanistan has decreased by 95%. Efforts are also being made to support rural communities and promote alternative agriculture to build a future for Afghanistan free from opium dependency.   

In today's context, Afghanistan should be viewed through the lens of emerging strategic opportunities. It is critically important to integrate Afghanistan into global economic processes, including through the implementation of infrastructure projects on its territory. 

In this context, we are ready to work together with the European Union and other international partners to jointly promote a positive agenda and initiatives that will help Afghanistan not only to overcome the current crises  but also to develop in the long term. The primary task at this stage, in our view, is to continue to provide assistance to Afghanistan in the field of education. 

I am convinced that stabilising the situation in Afghanistan and its reconstruction are in the common interests of the Central Asian countries and the European Union. 

Euronews: How can Central Asia and the EU jointly address climate threats and what are the opportunities for partnership? 

Mirziyoyev: Climate change is a challenge that can no longer be ignored. Central Asia faces droughts, glacier melt, and water shortages, while Europe is experiencing extreme heat, wildfires, and ecosystem changes. 

As one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change, Central Asia recognises its responsibility and is ready to work with Europe on long-term solutions.   

A key priority for us is advancing the green agenda in Central Asia. At the upcoming Samarkand Summit, we plan to present the Regional Green Development Concept, which aims to lay a solid foundation for effective regional partnerships in sustainable natural resource management and the adoption of green technologies.   

We propose developing a Green Partnership between the EU and Central Asia, where we can join efforts to finance projects on renewable energy, ecosystem restoration, and digital climate monitoring.   

Water conservation is another critical area where we see significant opportunities for partnership with the European Union, from modernising irrigation infrastructure to joint glacier monitoring and the introduction of advanced water-saving technologies. We also look forward to expanding cooperation with the EU, including through the adoption of European best practices in public-private partnerships.   

Ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation are also key priorities. We have already launched the Green Belt of Central Asia - a large-scale afforestation program aimed at restoring degraded lands, including in the Aral Sea region. We see great potential for collaboration with the EU in this field.   

Additionally, we are committed to improving environmental education and advancing scientific research. Last year, we established the region's first Green University, which can serve as an effective platform for joint research and the implementation of innovative solutions.  

Euronews: Could you please share your expectations of the upcoming meeting at the highest level? What results would you like to see at the summit's end? 

Mirziyoyev: The upcoming summit will be truly historic as it will bring together for the first time the leaders of the five Central Asian countries and the EU in one place.  

We expect that the upcoming summit will be an important milestone in the development of relations between Central Asia and the EU. In recent years, our interaction has reached a qualitatively new level. 

We are counting on the deepening of political dialogue and the development of new mechanisms of interaction, which will make our cooperation more systematic and oriented towards long-term goals. 

An important item on the agenda will be the discussion of interregional cooperation, especially in such areas as economy, trade, energy and transportation. 

One of the key results of the summit will be the signing of the Samarkand Declaration, which will reflect the common aspiration of the parties to establish a strategic partnership.  

This declaration will not only consolidate the agreements reached,  but will also lay the foundation for deepening ties between our regions. We hope to reach concrete agreements on expanding investment cooperation, implementing joint infrastructure projects, supporting innovation and digital solutions.  

Of course, many questions will be answered following the results of the summit. However, we can already say that this meeting will be a step towards creating a sustainable, mutually beneficial partnership between the European Union and Central Asia, based on common interests, trust and the desire for joint development. 

Euronews: If you had an opportunity to send one message to the European leaders and their citizens, what would it be?  

Mirziyoyev: I would like to take this opportunity to address our European partners. 

Central Asia is open for dialogue and increased interaction. We advocate constructive cooperation based on the principles of mutual benefit and trust in the interests of sustainable development and improving the well-being of our people. 

We highly appreciate the European Union's support for our aspirations for the region's openness, prosperity and strengthening of its subjectivity. It is particularly important that the EU shares our goal of transforming Central Asia into a united and dynamic region, ready for open and equal partnership with all stakeholders. 

The upcoming summit will be an important milestone in our relations. We are convinced that the outcomes of the meeting in Samarkand will open up new prospects for further cooperation.

        The new directive is aimed against “exploitative” ticketing scalping for concerts – an issue which is not exclusive to the US.
    

Donald Trump invited rocker and MAGA supporter Kid Rock into the Oval Office and signed an executive order that he says will help curb ticket scalping and bring “commonsense” changes to the way live events are priced.

Kid Rock campaigned for regulations and legislation to be implemented when it comes to online ticket purchases, citing the “unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct” in the ticket resale market. 

The president said rising fees for concerts and other events have “gotten worse and worse with time.”

Kid Rock, wearing a red bedazzled suit featuring an American flag motif and a straw fedora, agreed: “Anyone who's bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years — no matter what your politics are — knows that it's a conundrum.”

“You buy a ticket for $100, by the time you check out it's $170, you don't know what you're charged for.”

The order directs authorities to enforce the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act, a federal law designed to prevent scalpers from buying tickets in bulk using bots in 2016.

Additionally, it instructs US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi to ensure that ticket resellers are entirely compliant with IRS regulations and other laws, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) working with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce antitrust laws in the concert industry.

Kid Rock continued: “These bots come in and get all the good tickets to your favourite shows, and they're re-listed immediately for a 4-500 per cent markup. The artists don't see any of that money.”

“Ultimately, I think this is a great first step. I'd love down the road if there would be some legislation that we can actually put a cap on the resale of tickets. I'm a Capitalist and for deregulation, but they've tried this in some places in Europe and it seems to be the only thing that lets us as artists get the hands in artists at the price we set.” 

Attempts to curb scalping in Europe have had mixed results.

The most recent and headline-grabbing instance has been for the highly awaited Oasis reunion tour.

The band mentioned efforts to prevent touts from re-selling tickets at inflated prices, saying that tickets sold for profit on other sites would be cancelled. However, when tickets finally went on sale and rapidly sold out, it was reported that roughly 50,000 tickets ended up on resale sites.

It was then announced in February that thousands of tickets were cancelled by Ticketmaster in a crackdown on bots. However, many infuriated fans claimed they were targeted wrongfully and then faced with surging ticket prices.

Secondary ticket swap sites such as Viagogo, TicketSwap and the Oasis-approved Twickets have become a widespread part of the live event market in recent years. 

Ostensibly intended as a means for gig-goers to sell on tickets to other fans when they can't attend due to unforeseen circumstances, these secondary sites are regularly filled with tickets for popular events snapped up by touts being advertised for significantly above the original asking price. 

According to the BBC, some of the tickets listed on these secondary sites for the upcoming Oasis tour were being sold for as much as £119,000 (€143,000). A quick check through StubHub and Viagogo found multiple examples of tickets being sold for thousands of euros.

        Brussels has a ""strong plan to retaliate"" against Trump's reciprocal tariffs, Ursula von der Leyen has said while calling for a ""negotiated solution"".
    

The European Union holds ""a lot of cards"" that can be leveraged to negotiate, dissuade and, if needed, ""push back"" against Donald Trump's plan to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs on all America's trading partners, Ursula von der Leyen has said on the eve of what the US president has dubbed ""Liberation Day"".

Trump, whose unprecedented initiative has antagonised long-time allies, rattled stock markets and raised the spectre of recession, has said his tariffs would target ""all countries"" as a starting point and then ""let's see what happens"".

For the bloc, the reciprocal tariffs will come on the heels of 25% duties on steel, aluminium and car exports. The European Commission has presented countermeasures to retaliate against those but delayed their introduction until mid-April.

With a new, larger raft of Trump tariffs now imminent, the Commission is hardening its tone and warning its response will have no red lines.

""Let me be clear: Europe did not start this confrontation. We think it is wrong,"" von der Leyen said on Tuesday, speaking before the European Parliament.

""We have everything we need to protect our people and our prosperity. We have the largest Single Market in the world. We have the strength to negotiate. We have the power to push back. And the people of Europe should know: together we will always promote and defend our interests and values. And we will always stand up for Europe.""

The Commission president said tariffs would raise prices for everyday consumers, destroy jobs, create a ""bureaucratic monster"" at customs and be a ""nightmare"" for US companies that sell their goods to Europe. She also predicted the duties would run counter to Trump's much-touted agenda to re-industrialise America.

""This confrontation is in no one's interest,"" she said.

Throughout her speech, von der Leyen insisted the Commission's goal would be a ""negotiated solution"" to prevent what is rapidly shaping up to be an all-out trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic, which analysts expect to have disastrous economic consequences at a time of heightened global uncertainty.

""We will approach these negotiations from a position of strength. Europe holds a lot of cards: from trade to technology to the size of our market,"" von der Leyen said.

However, she pointedly added, if these talks fail to yield a compromise, Brussels will not hesitate to take ""firm countermeasures"", with all options on the table.

Commission officials have already signalled the potential response might go beyond the traditional tit-for-tat on goods and include services, which have so far remained untouched. In 2023, the EU recorded a surplus of goods with the US worth €156.6 billion but a deficit of services worth €108.6 billion.

""We would all be better off if we could find a constructive solution,"" von der Leyen told lawmakers in Strasbourg. 

""At the same time, it also has to be clear: Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate but we have a strong plan to retaliate if necessary.""

As trade tensions increase, von der Leyen has intensified her engagement with the leaders across the bloc to ensure a unified front against the White House.

While heads of state and government agree the Trump tariffs cannot go unanswered, they disagree on which products should be targeted in reaction, fearing the countermeasures could damage key industries of their domestic economies.

        A torrent of online abuse has been directed at Bénédicte de Perthuis, the judge who presided over the Paris court on Monday.
    

While far-right politician Marine Le Pen vowed to appeal the conviction she was handed on Monday, the judge who presided over her case has faced a torrent of intimidating online reactions. 

Bénédicte de Perthuis, the judge who sentenced Le Pen for embezzling EU funds and barred her from running in France's 2027 presidential election, was placed under police protection on Monday night over alleged death threats she received, domestic press reported.

The fiery fallout came her way as some took offence at what they claim is political revanchism — despite de Perthuis herself emphasising that the role of the court and her as a judge was to treat Le Pen's case like any other.

“Equality before the law is a pillar of democracy. Elected officials enjoy no impunity,"" said de Perthuis on Monday, before she issued a judgment, which she had worked on with two other high-profile judges. 

On Monday Le Pen left the courtroom before her sentence was handed down, writing on X, ""I'm told it's a judicial decision, but no, it's a political one.""

Along with 24 other National Rally (RN) members, Le Pen was found guilty of a scheme using money intended for European Parliament aides to pay staff who worked for the party at its head office in France. 

The parliamentary leader of the National Rally in France's National Assembly was handed a four-year prison sentence, with two of those years suspended and two to be served outside jail with an electronic bracelet. 

Back in January, the Paris Public Prosecutor's office launched a probe into death threats posted on the far-right website Riposte Laïque — which have since been deleted — under an article entitled  ""A Stalinist trial set up to ruin the RN.""

The threats followed the culmination of Le Pen's nine-week trial in November and were directed at de Perthuis, as well as prosecutors Louise Neyton and Nicolas Barret. 

One user posted a comment which called for “a 9 mm bullet in the back of the court president's head.”

Another user named ""Job"" wrote, “I don't like that judge's face. Another leftie, a sh*t who wants to dictate their ideology. To be eliminated as soon as possible.” 

After the verdict on Monday, users on social media again targeted de Perthuis.

""Benedicte de Perthuis, you dirty d*g, we got eyes on you,"" one menacing post on X said.

""Far-left fascist,"" ""red judge"" and ""the face of shame"" who ""vandalised democracy"" were some of the other claims X users made regarding the Paris judge.

A three-minute video narrated by a person wearing a black mask reminiscent of a Squid Game character, claimed de Perthuis was a ""symbol of judiciary power which doesn't deliver justice anymore, but rather the politics of the system"".

Another widely shared post contains a photo of De Perthuis and a caption claiming that the ""judiciary was at the service of (French President) Emmanuel Macron."" 

Following the verdict, this and similar claims were shared in Facebook groups, many of which have nothing to do with politics, and instead are used by people interested in topics from local car-sharing to walking. 

A number of accounts sharing claims about De Perthuis on X had AI-generated profile pictures, suggesting they could be bot accounts.

France's High Council of the Judiciary (Conseil Supérieur de la Magistrature) expressed its ""concern over the virulent reactions"" which came after Monday's judgement. 

In a post on X, France's Justice Minister Gérard Darmanin branded the threats ""unacceptable in a democracy"" and ""worrying for the independence of the judiciary"".

Other politicians like Mathilde Pannot, president of the far-left France Unbowed Party, also said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and that the online threats were part of ""far-right tactics"".

Meanwhile, members of Marine Le Pen's Patriots for Europe party were quick to rally their support, with right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán posting ""Je suis Marine"" on X shortly after the verdict was handed. 

Le Pen has vowed to appeal her case ""as soon as possible"" and said she would use ""whatever legal avenues"" she could.

        After a months-long diplomatic spat, the French president and his Algerian counterpart have reiterated their commitment to work together.
    

French President Emmanuel Macron and Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune said on Monday that they had had a promising phone conversation as they try to ease diplomatic tensions between their two countries.

“The two presidents had a long, frank and friendly exchange on the state of bilateral relations and the tensions that have built up in recent months"", read a joint statement issued after the call on Monday evening. 

Algeria has been refusing to readmit nationals whom French authorities have ordered to leave for their criminal activities or perceived threat to public order.

The diplomatic standoff has been inflamed by the imprisonment of dissident Franco-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal, who last week was sentenced to five years in prison and fined for allegedly undermining Algeria's territorial integrity. 

In Monday's statement, Macron reiterated ""his confidence in the farsightedness of President Tebboune"" while calling ""for a gesture of clemency and humanity towards Mr Boualem Sansal, in view of the writer's age and state of health"".

Although the diplomatic dispute has intensified this year, it began in earnest last July when France backed Morocco's longstanding claim to the disputed Western Sahara territory. 

The decision was met with outrage by the Algerian government, which supports the local Sahrawi people's claim to self-determination. Algiers proceeded to recall its Paris ambassador.

When Algiers last month refused to readmit around 60 of its nationals who had been ordered to leave France, Interior Minister Bruno Rétailleau accused Algeria of ""breaking international law"".

French ministers have begun to question some of the landmark political treaties France has signed with its former colony. In February, Prime Minister François Bayrou called on his government to ""reexamine"" a 1968 migration pact which has historically made it easier for Algerians to settle in France. 

Upon his reelection in September, Tebboune announced he would not travel to France, having already repeatedly postponed a state visit first planned for last May.

Since coming to power, he has repressed freedom of expression in Algeria, imprisoning journalists and pro-democracy activists.

        The French far-right leader, who was convicted on Monday of embezzling EU funds and barred from the 2027 presidential election, said she will appeal.
    

US President Donald Trump and close ally Elon Musk weighed in on Marine Le Pen's conviction after the far-right National Rally leader was found guilty of embezzlement and barred from running in the 2027 French presidential election. 

Trump called the court's decision a ""very big deal"" on Monday. “She was banned for five years and she was the leading candidate,” Trump said.

“That sounds like this country, that sounds very much like this country,” he added, in apparent reference to legal cases he faced before taking office for a second term.

“I know all about it, and a lot of people thought she wasn't going to be convicted of anything,” he said.

The South African-born tech billionaire Elon Musk blasted the court verdict, which will see Le Pen and 24 codefendants also face a four-year prison sentence and a €100,000 fine for siphoning European Parliament funds to pay for party employees back home. 

“When the radical left can't win via democratic vote, they abuse the legal system to jail their opponents,” Musk said Monday. “This is their standard playbook throughout the world.”

Musk, who has increasingly backed far-right movements across Europe, said the court verdict would ""backfire"" in a separate post. 

Speaking to French TV channel TF1 in her first reaction to the verdict, Le Pen called the ruling a “political decision”  and said that millions of French people “are outraged"".

She called the verdict a violation of the rule of law, said she would appeal and asked that the court proceedings take place before the 2027 campaign.

She would remain ineligible to be a candidate until the appeal is decided.

“I didn't think the magistrates would go so far against our democratic process”, she said in the TF1 interview.

""It's a fatal day for our democracy."" 

“There is no personal enrichment, so there is no corruption”, she said. “I'm going to pursue all possible avenues of appeal.”

She will have to resign as councillor for the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. She will continue to serve as an MP but will not be able to stand in legislative elections in the event of another dissolution of parliament in the near future.

A total of eight National Rally MEPs and their twelve assistants were also found guilty and barred from running for office. The party was also fined €2 million.

Le Pen and 24 other National Rally members were found guilty of embezzling money intended for European Parliament aides to pay staff who worked for the party over nearly 12 years.

Their full sentences were read out individually by the Paris court over several hours. Le Pen, who was sitting in the front row of the courtroom, visibly shook her head in disapproval as the verdict was read. She left without comment before sentencing ended.

The court estimated that the European Parliament's total loss was €2.9 million, with Le Pen personally embezzling around €474,000. 

""There was no personal enrichment … but there was the enrichment of a party,"" Judge Bénédicte de Perthuis said, claiming it went against party financing rules.

“Let's be clear: no one is on trial for doing politics, that's not the issue. The issue was whether or not the contracts had been executed"", the judge added.

Leaders from the European Parliament's right-wing Patriots for Europe bloc have rallied around Le Pen after the sentencing.

Patriots.eu, the group to which Le Pen's RN belongs, published a post on X expressing ""full support to Marine Le Pen"" against what it described as an ""alarming authoritarian drift within the European Union.""

Leaders of Patriot-affiliated parties have also expressed solidarity with the RN's founder.

“Je suis Marine,” (I am Marine), wrote Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on X.

“I back Marine,” was the message in French of Italy's League leader, Matteo Salvini, posted on a picture with the French politician.

The League's delegation in the European Parliament considered the ruling as ""political and disproportionate,"" and ""the greatest judicial scandal of the Fifth [French] Republic.""

""Today it is not Marine Le Pen or the Rassemblement National being hit, but democracy,"" read a note from the Italian party.

""I am shocked by the incredible tough verdict against Marine Le Pen,"" wrote the Dutch nationalist leader Geert Wilders, founder and president of PVV, adding that he is confident she ""will win the appeal and become President of France.""

Statements of solidarity and accusations towards the French judiciary also arrived from Belgium and Greece.

Meanwhile, the European Parliament resumed its business in Strasbourg on Monday afternoon, with some members also reacting to the sentencing. 

""Justice has done its job, we need to accept it, and I call on everyone to bear responsibility,"" Valérie Hayer, chair of the centrist Renew Europe group, told Euronews.

""All Republican forces must stand up against anti-judicial rhetoric, which is a slippery slope"", socialist MEP Chloé Ridel said.

        Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence said it had tracked 19 Chinese navy vessels in the waters surrounding the island in a 24-hour period from 6am Monday until 6am Tuesday.
    

The Chinese military said it had launched large-scale drills in the waters around Taiwan on Tuesday, as it warned the self-ruled island against seeking independence.

The joint exercises involve navy, air ground and rocket forces and are meant to be a “severe warning and forceful containment against Taiwan independence,” according to Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command.

It comes after Taiwan's president Lai Ching-Te called Beijing a ""foreign hostile force"" last month.

China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, while most Taiwanese favour their de facto independence and democratic status.

Following the drill announcement, the Chinese military also released a series of propaganda videos, depicting Chinese warships and fighter jets around Taiwan.

A video titled ""Shell"" showed Lai as a cartoon bug spawning parasites. ""Parasite poisoning Taiwan island. Parasite hollowing Island out. Parasite courting ultimate destruction,"" the animation said.

Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence said it had tracked 19 Chinese navy vessels in the waters surrounding the island in a 24-hour period from 6am Monday until 6am Tuesday.

It added that it had been tracking the movement of the Shandong aircraft carrier since Saturday and that the carrier group had entered into Taiwan's identification zone, a self-defined area tracked by the military.

“I want to say these actions amply reflect its destruction of regional peace and stability,” said Taiwan's Defence Minister Wellington Koo.

Taiwan has set up a central response group to monitor the latest exercises, Koo said.

China's Coast Guard also announced it was conducting a “law enforcement patrol” on Tuesday around Taiwan, its spokesperson Zhu Anqin said.

The drills come just two weeks after a large-scale exercise in mid-March, when Beijing sent a large number of drones and ships toward the island.

Beijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a daily basis, seeking to wear down Taiwanese defences and morale, although the vast majority of the island's 23 million people reject its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan.

Faced with the rising threat from China, Taiwan has ordered new missiles, aircraft and other armaments from the US, while revitalising its own defence industry.

Taiwan and China split amid civil war 76 years ago, but tensions have risen in recent years as communication between the two governments has stopped.

        Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia had legal protection from being deported to his home country of El Salvador, from which his lawyers say he fled aged 16.
    

The Trump administration has admitted to deporting a Maryland resident to a Salvadoran mega-prison due to an ""administrative error"" despite a court order barring him from being sent to the country.

While it appeared to acknowledge the mistake, the government then argued it could not return him to the US, where court records filed by his lawyers state he has lived since 2011, and has a family. 

Attorneys for the US government conceded in a court filing on Monday that they deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national living in Maryland with his wife and five-year-old son, despite him being legally protected from being returned to his country of origin.

Both his wife and child, who is disabled, are US citizens, lawyers told the court. 

“Although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the government stated in its filing.

The defendants said the US did not have jurisdiction to secure his return from the notorious CECOT prison. 

Abrego Garcia was granted protected legal status by an immigration judge in 2019 which prohibited the government from deporting him to El Salvador.

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia stated that he came to the US around the age of 16 after fleeing gang violence. ""Beginning around 2006, gang members had stalked, hit, and threatened to kidnap and kill him in order to coerce his parents to succumb to their increasing demands for extortion,"" they said in their filing. 

The Salvadoran national has no criminal record in the US or any other country, according to his legal team. It said he has no gang affiliation, despite claims by the US government, which Abrego Garcia's lawyers said ""has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded accusation"". 

In the government court filing, which was first reported by The Atlantic, the government downplayed concerns that Abrego Garcia was likely to be tortured or killed in CECOT.

The case appears to be a first: Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told the magazine that he had never seen a case in which the government knowingly deported someone who had already been granted protected status.

Lawyers for the plaintiff said that immigration authorities ""would have no legal impediment"" in deporting him to any other country except for El Salvador, claiming that the ""defendants found those legal procedures bothersome, so they merely ignored them and deported Plaintiff Abrego Garcia to El Salvador anyway"". 

When contacted by Euronews, the US Department of Homeland Security insisted that it possessed ""intelligence reports"" that Abrego Garcia was a gang member. 

""Whether he is in El Salvador or a detention facility in the US, he should be locked up,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Euronews.

Euronews also contacted ICE for comment.

The Trump administration on 16 March deported more than 250 Venezuelans without a hearing to a maximum security prison in El Salvador under a deal with the Central American country. 

The government accused them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang and deported them under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 – legislation which has been invoked just three times in US history.

After seeing a photo in a news article about CECOT, where prisoners' faces were not visible, Abrego Garcia's wife identified her husband based on his tattoos and two scars on his head.

US Attorney General Pamela Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of shooting and killing Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group's insurance division, in New York last year.Lawyers for Mangione did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Mangione, 26, has pleaded not guilty to New York state charges of murder as an act of terrorism and weapons offenses. He could face life in prison without parole if convicted in that case.

Iran remains the primary cause of global terrorism, both directly and through its proxies, the National Security Council said on Tuesday in its public assessment of threats against Israelis abroad, ahead of spring vacations.The NSC said the assessment is intended to raise awareness among Israeli travelers regarding the threats they may face in destinations worldwide. The assessment focuses on key trends in global terrorist activity that may constitute a risk to citizens abroad.  “Iran continues to use terrorist operations as a central policy tool and as retaliation for strikes against senior Iranian, Hezbollah, and Hamas officials in the context of war in Gaza,” it said.The assessment notes that myriad Iranian-in-origin terror plots have been thwarted around the world, including attempted attacks on Israel's embassies in Sweden and Belgium, as well as various cyber or online attacks. AdvertisementThe NSC also highlights Iran's terror recruitment efforts, involving reaching out to Israelis under false pretenses (business ventures or impersonations) both in Israel and abroad to “lure them into situations where they could be harmed or kidnapped.” Police officers stand outside the Israeli embassy after a suspected shooting near the embassy, in Stockholm, Sweden October 1, 2024.

The NSC stated that it expects an increase in attempted terror attacks by Hamas, given its weakened position in Gaza.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  It mentioned various foiled Hamas plots abroad since the beginning of the war on October 7, including in countries such as Denmark, Germany, Bulgaria, and Sweden.

The assessment also predicted an increase in terror activity from these groups, given the resumption of fighting in Gaza.“These threats may come from organized groups or lone-wolf attackers,” it added, while noting the recent surge in attacks by ISIS operatives in Europe and North America and the group's calls for supporters to attack Jewish and Israeli targets worldwide.  The NSC listed several ISIS-inspired or led attacks, including the terrorist who rammed into New Year's Eve revelers in New Orleans; multiple vehicular attacks in Germany; a stabbing incident in Austria; synagogue arson and planned bombing attacks on Jewish sites in Australia; and several firebombing and shooting incidents targeting synagogues and Jewish schools in Canada.According to the NSC, global jihadist activity remains highly concentrated in Africa (especially the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, and parts of Central Africa), the Middle East, and Asia (notably Afghanistan, the southern Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kashmir in India, and parts of Indonesia).Egypt and the Sinai PeninsulaThe NSC added that the Sinai Peninsula remains a “high-risk area for terrorist activity.”It acknowledged the area has received fewer Israeli tourists than previous years, but that, nevertheless, it is still a visitor attraction and one that is classified as a Level 4 travel warning (Severe Threat). All travel to Sinai should be avoided, the NSC stated.Rise in antisemitismSeparately from the terrorist threat abroad, the NSC noted the surge in antisemitic hate crimes and attacks on Jews and Israelis worldwide.These attacks have arisen through both coordinated efforts and lone-wolf assaults, with notable incidents including the attack on Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters in Amsterdam in November.The bottom line?The high motivation and activity of terrorist groups (Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and global jihadists) to carry out attacks against Israelis and Jews abroad remain unchanged, the NSC stated.“Additionally, the heightened atmosphere of hostility toward Israelis and Jews due to the war continues to drive threats from lone-wolf attackers and independent terror cells.”As a result, the NSC urges Israelis to exercise caution when traveling abroad and to check the latest travel warnings before booking flights. It asked travelers to adhere to the NSC's recommendations based on the risk level of their destination.

The Trump administration announced it will review almost $9 billion in grants and contracts at Harvard University, the latest school to be threatened with a federal financial penalty over campus antisemitism.The announcement of the review on Monday means that Harvard could face the same predicament as Columbia University, where the Trump administration froze $400 million in funding last month over similar claims.  Columbia later acquiesced to many of the government's demands, and its interim president resigned on Friday.“Harvard's failure to protect students on campus from antisemitic discrimination — all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry — has put its reputation in serious jeopardy,” said Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a statement. AdvertisementThe review will include over $255 million in contracts between the federal government and Harvard and its affiliates. It also includes more than $8.7 billion in “multi-year grant commitments,” according to the announcement.

The school settled two lawsuits with Jewish organizations in January over allegations that it had fostered an antisemitic atmosphere.Among the terms of the settlement were stipulations around the policing of anti-Zionist speech, more funding for the study of antisemitism, and a pledge to partner with an Israeli campus.

The school also dismissed faculty leaders of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, which the Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance accused of promoting anti-Israel narratives.

Garber wrote that the school would “fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry.”Garber, who is Jewish, also said he had personally faced antisemitism on campus while serving as president.“Urgent action and deep resolve are needed to address this serious problem that is growing across America and around the world. It is present on our campus,” he wrote.  “I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university,” he added.He also expressed concern over potential cuts to the school's research funding, writing that it could “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.”The recent announcement comes after the Trump administration sent letters to Harvard and 60 other universities earlier in March informing them of investigations into allegations of antisemitism on their campuses.“While Harvard's recent actions to curb institutionalized antisemitism – though long overdue – are welcome, there is much more that the university must do to retain the privilege of receiving federal taxpayer's hard-earned dollars,” said Josh Gruenbaum, the commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, in a statement.“This administration has proven that we will take swift action to hold institutions accountable if they allow antisemitism to fester. We will not hesitate to act if Harvard fails to do so,” said Gruenbaum.In recent weeks, students from other Ivy League universities, including Columbia and Tufts, have seen students detained by ICE over their involvement in pro-Palestinian protests in another sharp escalation of the administration's response.

Many professionals neglect their health in a rush to meet deadlines, chase career goals, and juggle responsibilities. For some, this always-on work culture can seriously compromise their health. Reminding people of the dangers, a CEO and founder posted a LinkedIn share describing how he learned the hard way that “work is important, but health is non-negotiable.”

Amit Mishra recalled how, while working on his laptop, he suddenly had unstoppable nose bleeds that landed him in the ICU. Once he reached the hospital, the doctors found that his blood pressure (BP) had increased to 230.

Misra wrote that he had “no headaches, no dizziness, no warnings, no history of BP” but still landed in this “unexpected crisis.” What happened next was even more puzzling; his BP dropped drastically the next day.

Though the CEO is still under treatment and doctors are trying to find out the reason behind the increase in his BP, he reminded people of what this scary incident taught him.

“Your body doesn't always give clear warnings. High BP, stress, and health risks can be silent killers. Regular checkups are a must,” he wrote, “Work is important, but health is non-negotiable. We often ignore small signs, thinking we're fine, until we're not,” he added.

He further added a piece of advice for working professionals, “Listen to your body. Don't wait for a wake-up call like mine.”

What did social media say?While people wished him a speedy recovery, some also joined in on the conversation about prioritising health over professional life. An individual posted, “I wish you a healthy recovery. This happened to me a few years back, though it was not this serious. Take care of yourself and prioritise health over everything. That would be my advice to everyone.” Another suggested, “Exercise is something that we in India neglect badly. We often see people over 50 just end up going for a normal walk as a start. In fact, sports is something that should be part of our daily routine right from youth/childhood.” Also Read: Texas man declares himself CEO of LinkedIn: ‘You can just say you worked anywhere'A third commented, “Get well soon, I will act on your wisdom - ‘Listen to your body, don't wait for the wake-up call' and with your permission, I will use this Sermon in my sessions for entrepreneurs and top professionals who tend to keep health on hindsight.

US President Donald Trump will unveil a new tariff or ‘reciprocal tariffs' plan on Wednesday, April 2, in his first Rose Garden press conference of his second term, which he has dubbed “Liberation Day"".

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Monday that the full cabinet will be present for the event, but specifics of the plan remain uncertain as Donald Trump and his administration have floated multiple, sometimes conflicting, proposals in recent weeks.

On Monday, Donald Trump said he would be ""very kind"" to trading partners when he unveils further tariffs this week, risking global turmoil to address what he says are unfair trade imbalances.

""We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind.""

Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation by major trading partners such as China, Canada and the European Union. Already, China, South Korea and Japan have agreed to strengthen free trade between themselves.

On Sunday, Donald Trump said reciprocal tariffs would include “all countries” rather than a group of 10 to 15 countries with the biggest trade imbalances, triggering fears that an escalating trade war could lead to a US recession.

Director of Trump's National Economic Council Kevin Hassett, as reported by CNBC, said in an interview that the US government is looking at 10 to 15 countries that account for America's “entire trillion-dollar trade deficit"".

While Hassett did not name those countries, data from the commerce department shows that in 2024, the US had the highest goods trading deficit with China, followed by the European Union, Mexico, Vietnam, Ireland, Germany, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Thailand, Italy, Switzerland, Malaysia, Indonesia, France, Austria and Sweden.

Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised the high tariffs charged by India and other countries on American goods.

The so-called “Dirty 15” has sparked major debate, with the US keeping a close watch on trade imbalances.

Treasury secretary scott Bessent came up with the term to describe the 15% of economies that contribute the most to America's trade deficit—all while slapping hefty tariffs and restrictions on US goods.

While Bessent didn't name names, US department of commerce data for 2024 shows that China tops the chart with a massive $295.4 billion trade surplus with the US other major players include:

With fresh US tariffs looming, some of these countries are already making moves to soften the blow.

The White House has said India imposes a 100 per cent tariff on American agricultural products and the high levies charged by other countries make it “virtually impossible” for US products to be exported to those nations.

Karoline Leavitt on Monday said, ""Unfortunately, these countries have been ripping off our nation for far too long, and they've made, I think, their disdain for the American workers quite clear.""

""If you look at the unfair trade practices - we have 50% (tariff) from the European Union on American dairy and a 700% tariff from Japan on American rice. You have a 100% tariff from India on American agricultural products and nearly 300% from Canada on American butter and cheese,"" she said.

Despite the imminent announcement, the Trump administration has not provided clear details on which tariffs will be implemented. Over the past weeks, Trump and his advisers have discussed a range of measures, including reciprocal tariffs on all countries, the delayed enforcement of 25 per cent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and tariffs targeting lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals, and microchips, reported CNN.

While some officials have suggested that only certain countries will be affected, others, including Trump himself, have indicated that the tariffs might be more flexible. Last week, Trump stated that the tariffs would be “far more generous” than those imposed by other nations on the US.

However, on Air Force One Sunday, he said, “his reciprocal tariffs would be put in place on all countries as a starting point and then he'd negotiate them down if necessary.”

With uncertainty surrounding the details of Trump's tariff strategy, Wednesday's announcement will mark a key moment in his economic agenda.

A pancake-style collapse of several buildings and houses has become a challenge for rescuers in earthquake-ravaged Myanmar. 

Officials said a pancake collapse means buildings have landed on other buildings. It would have been easier to rescue trapped people had it been a titled collapse, they added.

Due to the pancake collapse, rescuers are being forced to cut through heavy slabs for hours and lift mounds of rubble through earth movers to look for people who could be alive.

Meanwhile, the stench of death has permeated quake-struck Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar.

The death toll from the initial quake and a series of aftershocks has climbed to 2,719, according to Myanmar's military chief. The number of injured stands at 4,521, with more than 400 missing. Since over 72 hours have passed, the chances of finding survivors are diminishing every hour.

Locals believe scores of people remain trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings.

Days after the 7.7 magnitude earthquake devastated the city, a spate of aftershocks have exacerbated the crisis as they are threatening already damaged structures.

On Tuesday, another aftershock measuring over 5 magnitude rattled the city at 5.31 pm local time, causing at least half a dozen already damaged buildings to collapse.

Two such buildings collapsed near street 78 of Mandalay as the fresh tremor again sent panic through the streets, where hundreds of families, displaced and desperate, have set up makeshift camps.

The city is already suffering crippling shortages of medical supplies, food, water and shelter.

“We haven't dared to sleep in our houses since Friday,” said one local, echoing the sentiments of many who now live in constant fear.

Meanwhile, India's NDRF team is also pressed into the rescue and relief operations. They are using four dogs to sniff signs of life.

India has dispatched a team of 80 NDRF rescuers to its neighbouring country.

The infrastructure and communication channels of several affected cities have been damaged, making rescue and relief operations difficult.

Iran supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's adviser Ali Larijani warned on Monday that the country would have to get nuclear weapon if attacked by the United States or its allies.

Khamenei's remarks followed US President Donald Trump's threat from Saturday, warning that ""there will be bombing"" if Iran did not agree to a nuclear deal, NBC News had reported. Donald Trump also threatened to punish Iran with what he described as 'secondary tariffs'.

Following this, Khamenei promised to hit back if Trump carried out his threat to bomb the Islamic republic if it did not make a nuclear program deal.

The supreme leader's adviser Ali Larijani, while speaking to state TV, said, ""We are not moving towards (nuclear) weapons, but if you do something wrong in the Iranian nuclear issue, you will force Iran to move towards that because it has to defend itself.""

He further added that, ""Iran does not want to do this, but...(it) will have no choice. If at some point you (the US) move towards bombing by yourself or through Israel, you will force Iran to make a different discussion.""

Meanwhile, it remained unclear whether the US president was threatening a bombing by Washington or an operation coordinated with another nation, likely Iran's nemesis Israel.

During a speech marking the end of Ramadan, Khamenei said, ""They threaten to do mischief. If it is carried out, they will definitely receive a strong counterattack.""

Iran's UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani also sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council over the US' threat and slammed the ""warmongering provocations"".

The envoy stated that Iran ""will respond swiftly and decisively to any act of aggression or attack by the United States or its proxy, the Israeli regime.""

Following the ""threats"" made by the US president, Iran's foreign ministry also summoned the charge d'affaires of the Swiss embassy, which represents American interests in Iran.

Meanwhile, General Amirali Hajizadeh, a senior commander in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said, ""The Americans have at least 10 bases in the region around Iran, and they have 50,000 troops.""

The man in-charge of Iran's ballistic missile programme on Monday threatened that ""someone who is in a glass room shouldn't throw stones at anyone"".

Notably, western countries including the US have for a long time been accusing Iran of pursuing a nuclear weapon, a statement that Tehran has denied many times, insisting that it enrichment activities were solely aimed at peaceful purposes.

Billionaire Elon Musk-led SpaceX hit a historic milestone for commercial spaceflight with the launch of a unique mission on Monday, dubbed ‘Fram2', to orbit Earth from pole to pole, sending four private astronauts where no one has gone before.

The Fram2 mission, led by a crypto entrepreneur, launched on a Falcon 9 rocket and use SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule Resilience to carry the four astronauts into a polar orbit for the first time.

Fram2, which was initially planned for late last year, launched at 9:48 pm ET on Monday (7:18 am IST on April 1) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The mission, dubbed Fram2, is led by Chun Wang, a Maltese investor and Bitcoin mining company founder, marking the first time humans will travel along this unexplored trajectory.

 

The crew of Fram2 mission travelled from the launchpad in a caravan of Teslas, a nod to Elon Musk's other tech company, with a police escort leading the way. Along the route, they witnessed an unrelated Falcon 9 rocket launching a Starlink mission, which Wang captured on video and shared on social media.

Chun Wang and his team will embark on a three-to-five-day mission that includes 22 scientific experiments. These experiments focus on studying the effects of spaceflight and microgravity on the human body, further advancing our understanding of space's impact on human health.

Chun Wang, who also serves as the commander of the mission and is the first Maltese citizen to go to space, has dubbed the flight ""Fram2,"" referencing the famous Norwegian Fram ship, which made groundbreaking voyages to the Arctic in the early 20th century, a Reuters report said.

Joining Wang on the historic space journey are Norwegian film director Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher and polar scientist Rabea Rogge, and Australian adventurer Eric Philips.

 

""This is a rocket launch... while we're on our way to a rocket launch,"" Wang said in a post on X, adding a playful glimpse of the crew's excitement ahead of their own monumental flight.

SpaceX's Fram2 mission represents the company's latest leap in private space exploration, continuing its dominance in the global human spaceflight industry. It also highlights SpaceX's big role in shaping the future of space travel for non-government astronauts, expanding beyond the initial niche market of wealthy tourists to include more specialised missions.

With this flight, SpaceX's Crew Dragon craft will complete its 16th crewed mission.

The cost of space travel aboard Dragon remains substantial-approximately $55 million per seat, according to a Reuters report, which added that despite this demand is steadily increasing as governments, scientific bodies, and private entities look to harness the unique opportunities space offers.

An estimated 14 million undocumented migrants in the United States, lurking in fear of deportation, are resorting to desperate measures to avoid the gaze of immigration agents allegedly scouting neighbourhoods to look for “illegals”.

Residents and immigrant rights advocacy groups told news agency AFP that the fear of deportation, have prompted undocumented migrants to go underground and pull out their children from schools to avoid detection.

Many have also formed online communities on messaging apps like WhatsApp to stay informed of enforcement actions around their communities, the AFP report said.

Rosario (name changed), a 35-year-old mother of two, entered the United States in 2021 after an arduous journey. She has been living underground in her Washington home and anxiously scrolls through community groups to keep informed of real-time updates, often unverified or false information.

“You stay informed and stay a little more alert thanks to the group. That way, you get rid of fear a little bit -- but fear always persists,” she said while looking through her window blinds for any lurking agents from ICE -- the Immigration and Customs Enforcement department.

Rosario is unable to verify the information but remains confident that the group, helped by other immigrants and advocates, provided reliable information that helped her decide on daily activities to avoid potential detection.

Despite a rise in raids and arrests, the number of deportation flights since Trump took office on January 20 has been roughly the same as those in the final months of President Joe Biden's administration, AFP reported. But communities are shocked by the Trump administration's rhetoric and tactic to publicise raids and widely share videos of deportees being shackled on military flights.

A director of an immigration advocacy group in Washington echoed a similar argument, “In the current scary climate, it is hard to know what's true, what's inaccurate. (Its hard to) decipher fact from fiction,” he said, requesting anonymity.

Last month an online video of claiming arrest by immigration agents was found to have been staged by AFP during its fact checking. Another video of an undocumented Colombian woman being expelled was also found to be a fictionalized clip posted in 2023 by an American YouTuber.

Fear is also amplified by the Trump administration's decision not to exempt sensitive locations like the schools, hospitals and religious places from enforcement action by immigration agents. Messages of raids on such places keep undocumented migrants on the edge.

A woman was rescued in Myanmar's capital on Tuesday from the rubble of a high-rise building that collapsed in last week's powerful earthquake that hit the country and its adjoining regions, fire services reported.

The fire department in Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble after being buried for 91 hours. The building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit midday Friday.

While the woman was rescued, the hope of finding more survivors continued to fade. The death toll, meanwhile, has crossed 2700.

Experts say the likelihood of finding survivors drops dramatically after 72 hours, AP reported.

The head of Myanmar's military government, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, told a forum in Naypyitaw that 2,719 people have now been found dead, with 4,521 others injured and 441 missing, Myanmar's Western News online portal reported.

It has also been reported that shelter, clean water and medicine are in short supply following the earthquake in Myanmar that has caused significant structural damage and had a devastating human toll, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Tuesday.

Multiple UN Agencies have raised the alarm about the shortage of drinking water, with concerns of cholera spreading.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said hospitals were overwhelmed and that medical supplies were running out, and that there were shortages of running water and fuel.

Just days after the deadly quake, the ruling military regime resumed bombing parts of the war-torn country where it lost crucial territory over more than a year of intense fighting.

Pro-democracy rebel groups reported fresh airstrikes in areas close to the epicentre. The ruling State Administration Council's spokesman, Major General Zaw Min Tun, did not respond to requests seeking comment.

He has previously said the military government is busy with rescue efforts, highlighting efforts to find survivors in collapsed buildings.

China's military on Tuesday said it had begun joint army, navy and rocket force exercises around Taiwan to ""serve as a stern warning and powerful deterrent against Taiwanese independence"", calling Taiwan's President Lai Ching-Te a ""parasite"".

China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring democratically governed Taiwan under its control, has stepped up military and political pressure against the island in recent years.

""The focus is on exercises such as combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes,"" a statement from Eastern Theater Command said on its official WeChat social media account.

A poster accompanying the drills titled ""Closing In,"" and showing Chinese warships and fighter jets circling the island, was released shortly after the announcement on the Eastern Theater Command's Weibo.

A video titled ""Shell"", and depicting Lai Ching-Te as a cartoon bug held by a pair of chopsticks above a burning Taiwan, was on the Eastern Theater Command's WeChat page.

Little over twenty-four hours before he drops the reciprocal tariff bomb for the world, including his countrymen to deal with, Donald Trump has made a stunning claim - that he heard India will drop tariffs on US imports substantially.

During a press briefing at the Oval Office in the White House, President Trump was asked about reciprocal tariffs that he would officially announce on April 2, and if that would push away some of America's allies.

In his reply, President Trump said, ""I think a lot of them will drop their tariffs because they were being done in an unfair way. They've done this for years. If you look at the European Union, they already dropped their tariffs on cars down to two-and-a-half per cent. It was announced a couple of days ago. And I think I heard just a short while ago that India will be dropping its tariffs very substantially.""

Mr Trump however, did not give any names or specifics which back his claim that India will be significantly reducing tariffs, which have been in place for decades. There has been no official confirmation on the matter by India either.

President Trump also denied that his reciprocal tariffs might push allies and partners more towards China. ""No, it won't"", said the US President bluntly.

India and the US have been negotiating on a mutually beneficial trade deal even amid repeated threats of reciprocal tariffs by the Trump Administration. The US President has called April 2 ""Liberation Day"" for the United States.

""A lot of countries will drop its tariffs,"" fearing America's move to do to them, as they do to us, claimed Mr Trump.

On a number of occasions, Donald Trump has labelled India as the ""tariff king"" and also said that India is one of the biggest ""abuser of tariffs"".

Earlier today, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt spoke about the ""unfair"" trade practices in India's tariff structure, highlighting how India imposes 100 per cent tariffs on agricultural imports from the US. She also mentioned similar high tariff structures by the EU (50 per cent on American dairy products), Japan (700 per cent on rice), and Canada (300 per cent on butter and cheese). These hinder and hurt US exports and leads to imbalances and trade deficits in the US, she said.

""This makes it virtually impossible for American products to be imported into these markets, and it puts a lot of Americans out of business and out of work over the past several decades,"" she added.

While most countries have vowed to retaliate US reciprocal tariffs, India has been one of the very few countries which wants to avoid animosity and friction, and has hence been working to find ways to manage the India-US trade ties amicably.

India has already reduced tariffs on certain products like Harley Davidson motorbikes and American bourbon whiskey. According to a Reuters report, India has apparently also offered to reduce import duties on select agricultural products. News agency Reuters also claims that India has offered reductions on more than half of US imports worth $23 billion - but only if US exempts India from any reciprocal tariff.

In its annual Union Budget for 2025, India has already announced reduction of customs duties on American solar cells, machinery, and luxury cars. India has also announced that it will remove the 6 per cent tax on digital advertisements starting April 1, 2025 - a move that will greatly benefit US tech firms like Meta, Google, and Amazon.

India and the US also aim to speed up talks of a mega trade deal much before its autumn deadline. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Amid suspense over US President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day tariff"" plans, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt confirmed on Monday that there won't be any exemptions on reciprocal tariffs. Listing tariffs imposed on American products by foreign nations, Ms Leavitt said that the ""unfair trade practices"" need to stop.

This comes as President Trump prepares to announce a round of reciprocal tariffs on April 2, a day he has labeled ""Liberation Day"" of America.

""The goal of Wednesday is a country-based tariff, but certainly sectoral tariffs. The President has said he's committed to implementing them, and I would leave it to him when he makes that announcement,"" Leavitt said, adding that ""It's time for reciprocity.""

HOLY SH*T 🚨 Karoline Leavitt brings a chart and shuts down Fake News Media with Tariff Facts:- 700% tariff from Japan on rice- 50% tariff from the EU on American dairy- 100% tariff from India on agricultural productsWE COME WITH RECEIPTS pic.twitter.com/z1Tmd8rOd9

Holding a piece of paper listing massive tariffs from the European Union, India, Japan, and Canada, the White House Press spokesperson said, ""If you look at the unfair trade practices that we have-- 50 per cent from the European Union on American dairy. You have a 700 per cent tariff from Japan on American rice. You have a 100 per cent tariff from India on American agricultural products. You have nearly a 300 per cent tariff from Canada on American butter and American cheese.""

""This makes it virtually impossible for American products to be imported into these markets, and it puts a lot of Americans out of business and out of work over the past several decades,"" she added.

Countries often heavily tariff foreign imports to protect industries or sectors vital to their own economies. President Trump's reciprocal tariffs aim to match other countries' higher tariff rates for specific goods and compensate for non-tariff barriers that put US exports at a disadvantage.

The Trump administration has argued that the tariff discrepancy is unfair for Americans and hurts their homegrown companies and workers. 

Ms Leavitt pledged that Trump's new tariffs will bring ""historic change"" to America's trade relationships, adding, ""Unfortunately, these countries have been ripping off our country for far too long...And they've made their disdain, I think, for the American worker quite clear.""

Meanwhile, the Trump administration on Monday also released an encyclopedic list of foreign countries' policies and regulations it regards as trade barriers, two days before the proposed hitting global trading partners with reciprocal tariffs.

The Office of the US Trade Representative's annual National Trade Estimate Report on foreign trade barriers lists average applied tariff rates for trading partner countries and non-tariff barriers ranging from onerous food safety regulations to renewable energy requirements and public procurement rules.

""No American President in modern history has recognized the wide-ranging and harmful foreign trade barriers American exporters face more than President Trump,"" US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement.

""Under his leadership, this administration is working diligently to address these unfair and non-reciprocal practices, helping restore fairness and put hardworking American businesses and workers first in the global market,"" Greer added.

It is unclear how the 397-page report will impact Trump's reciprocal tariff plans.

Many of the listed trade barriers are technical in nature or the result of government regulation that blocks some U.S. exports, such as delays in EU approvals for genetically modified crops or bans on agricultural imports containing residues of certain types of pesticides.

The report flagged a new EU requirement for a minimum amount of post-consumer recycled content in plastic packaging as potentially creating ""unjustified barriers to US exports,"" saying the U.S. would work with the EU on the rule's implementation.

The report also highlighted longstanding sources of trade disputes, such as Canada's ""supply management"" system for its dairy, poultry and egg industries, which use production limits on import quotas and high tariffs, with out-of-quota tariffs on cheese at 245 per cent and butter at 298 per cent.

It listed VATs and their implementation as burdensome to US imports in some other countries, including Argentina, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. The report said China's use of VAT rebates to encourage exports of certain products acted as a kind of subsidy. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Donald Trump said Monday he hopes Tiger Woods and his former daughter-in-law will be happy together in their relationship, describing the golf superstar as ""a fantastic guy.""

Woods -- renowned for guarding his private life over the years -- last week confirmed tabloid rumors that he was dating Vanessa Trump, who split from Donald Trump Jr. during his father's first term in the Oval Office.

The US president told reporters in Washington on Monday he was delighted that she had found love again.

""Tiger actually called me a few months ago, and we have a very special, very good relationship with Tiger,"" he said.

""I played golf with him a couple of times over the last month, and he's a fantastic guy and a fantastic athlete, and he told me about it, and I said 'Tiger, that's good,'"" Trump continued.

""I'm very happy for both, I just, let them both be happy. Let them both be happy. They're both great.""

The presidential seal of approval comes after Woods took to social media to post photos of him and his new beau.

""Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side,"" he wrote in a caption above two pictures of the couple relaxing together.

Vanessa Trump, who divorced Donald Trump Jr. in 2018 after a 13-year marriage, also posted a picture of her and Woods together on her Instagram account in what appeared to be a coordinated announcement.

Woods' private life was laid bare during the 2009 sex scandal that upended his career and led to the implosion of his six-year marriage to Elin Nordegren, the mother of his two children.

Nordegren and Woods separated amid revelations of the golf star's serial infidelity, with reports suggesting he had slept with as many as 120 women during their marriage.

A US court has said that no complaint was delivered to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval during his visit to Washington in February, dismissing a claim by Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun that court documents, including a summons, had been served on the top Indian official.

""The Court has reviewed the above letter and attached exhibits... and finds that service was not completed. The Complaint was not delivered to a member of the hotel management or staff or any officers or agents providing security for Defendant, as required by the Court's Order,"" US District Judge Katherine Polk Failla said in the recent order.

Pannun has filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Doval and another Indian national, Nikhil Gupta. Gupta has been accused by federal prosecutors of working with an Indian government employee in a foiled plot to kill Pannun on American soil.

Pannun claimed in court papers that when Mr Doval was in Washington, accompanying Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the visit to meet US President Donald Trump on February 12-13, he had ""hired two process servers and one investigator"" to serve the complaint on the National Security Advisor (NSA).

In the first instance, an attempt was made on February 12 to deliver the complaint to Mr Doval at Blair House, the President's Guest House where PM Modi and his delegation were staying during the DC visit.

Pannun said in court papers that there was significant security at Blair House and it was barricaded, with the sole checkpoint guarded by Secret Service agents. The individual tasked with serving the complaint approached one of the agents and explained that he was there to serve legal documents on Mr Doval and ""that he had a Court Order permitting service of the documents on any member of the Secret Service providing security"" during the NSA's stay.

""He showed the Secret Service agent a copy of this Court's Order, but the agent refused to accept any documents and told the individual to leave the checkpoint,"" Pannun said in court papers.

Pannun said the individual he had hired to deliver the complaint ""feared that if he took any further action he would be arrested"".

The next day, on February 13, another individual attempted to serve the documents on Mr Doval at Blair House but ""three Secret Service agents"", including a sergeant, stopped him ""at the checkpoint outside Blair House, refused to allow him beyond the checkpoint, and refused to accept any documents"".

The individual told the agents that he would place the envelope containing the service documents on the ground in front of them but one of the agents told him that ""if he left the documents on the ground, agents would arrest him"".

The individual then left the documents at a coffee store near Blair House and told the Secret Service agents to retrieve them and give them to Mr Doval. In court papers, Pannun claims that he has completed the process of serving the complaint on Mr Doval, which the court rejected.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has released satellite images of the widespread damages caused by the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Myanmar and rattled neighbouring countries on Friday. 

Using its most sophisticated Earth imaging satellite, the Cartosat-3, which can help with images at a resolution of less than 50 centimetres, the ISRO has managed to capture photos from a 500 kilometre altitude above the earth. The images show how a huge bridge over the Irrawaddy River collapsed. The damages to the Mandalay University and collapse of the Ananda Pagoda are also highlighted.

According to the space agency, Cartosat-3, which was launched in 2019, is a third generation agile advanced earth imaging satellite. ISRO rarely releases images from this highly sophisticated satellite.

The National Remote Sensing Centre, a part of ISRO, said the post-disaster Cartosat-3 imagery was acquired on Saturday, over the cities of Mandalay and Sagaing in Myanmar. Additionally, Cartosat-3 data acquired on March 18, covering the same area, was referred for change analysis and assessment of damage. Significant damage to infrastructure in Mandalay city was observed. 

The damaged caused to Mandalay city and Ava bridge.

An earthquake of magnitude 7.7 struck Myanmar on Friday, followed by a strong aftershock of magnitude 6.4. The epicentre was located at a depth of 10km near Sagaing-Mandalay border. Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, registered severe damage. 

The earthquake also rattled the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw and other regions, resulting in the collapse of infrastructure, roads and residential buildings. The tremors were felt not only in Myanmar but also in neighbouring countries and as far as Chiang Mai and northern parts of Thailand, where some places reported damages. 

The images showed significant damage to infrastructure in Mandalay city, with major landmarks such as Sky Villa, Phayani Pagoda, Mahamuni Pagoda and Ananda Pagoda, University of Mandalay and several others suffering either complete or partial damage. 

In Sagaing city, the Ma Shi Khana Pagoda and several monasteries and other buildings were damaged. 

The damage caused to Mandalay city.

As seen from the imagery, the earthquake led to the collapse of the historic Ava (InnWa) Bridge on the Irrawaddy River, near Inn Wa City. Cracks in flood plains of the Irrawaddy river with associated liquefaction were also observed. In its damage assessment summary, ISRO said Myanmar is located near the convergent boundary of the Indian and Eurasian plates, where the Indian Plate is moving northward toward the Eurasian Plate at a rate of about 5 cm per year. 

Besides, Myanmar also sits near several smaller fault zones, such as the Sagaing Fault, which runs through central Myanmar. The Sagaing fault is a significant active strike-slip fault that accommodates lateral motion between the blocks of the Indian and Eurasian plates. Friday's earthquake was likely associated with the release of accumulated stress along the Sagaing fault or its accessory faults in the region.

India was one of the first countries to fly in rescue teams and provide assistance to Myanmar. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Police have issued a critical update concerning Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre, who, after a car crash, stated she had only four days left to live.

The Western Australia Police Force (WAPF) confirmed receiving a report of a ""minor crash"" involving a bus and a car north of Perth on March 24.

However, Kylie Whitely, Acting Western Australia Police Commissioner, said no injuries were reported. ""There were no reported injuries as a result of the crash,"" the Western Australia police spokesman said in a statement, the Telegraph reported. 

In an Instagram post shared on Monday, 41-year-old Virginia Giuffre claimed she was struck by a school bus travelling at 110 km/h (68.3 mph) and had been given just four days to live. She also shared a photo that appeared to show her lying in a hospital bed with extensive facial bruising, including a black eye.





A post shared by Virginia Roberts (@virginiarobertsrising11)



Giuffre stated that she was being transferred to a specialist hospital in urology, which treats kidney and other organ-related conditions. Expressing her final wish, she wrote: ""They've given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology. My last wish is to see my three children one last time.""

Reflecting on the crash, she added: ""No matter what your car is made of, it might as well be a tin can when a school bus comes at you at 110 km/h while you're slowing down for a turn.""

A WAPF spokesperson told The Mirror that the crash, which occurred in Neergabby on March 24 just after 3 p.m., was reported by the bus driver the following day. The car sustained approximately AUD 2,000 in damage, and no injuries were reported.

Brad Edwards, who has represented Giuffre in past legal cases, described her condition as ""very bad"" but expressed hope that she would recover with proper medical care.

Originally from California, Giuffre now resides in Australia. She was a victim of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and has previously alleged she was trafficked to Prince Andrew. While Andrew has denied the claims, he reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022, which included no admission of liability.

Days before Donald Trump said he is ""not joking"" about aiming for a third term as US President, he used his presidential privilege of an executive order to introduce sweeping changes to America's voting system. A move that has now forced opposition Democrats to sue him.

""It is simply not within the president's authority to set election rules by executive decree,"" a statement issued by advocacy group Campaign Legal Center stated after the lawsuit was filed in a US court.

Among the massive changes in the US electoral process ordered by President Trump, a few that have analysts concerned are requiring voters to register themselves by submitting documents proving their US citizenship, else not be eligible to vote; and limiting the counting of mail-in ballots that arrive after voting day.

The Democratic Party, upset over such changes - which may impact millions of voters, and potentially sway the election result - demanded that the federal court block the President's executive order. ""The President does not get to dictate the rules of our elections,"" said the lawsuit filed in Washington by the Democratic National Committee, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and others.

Describing the changes as ""radical"", the Democratic Party's lawsuit against Trump said, ""The executive order seeks to impose radical changes on how Americans register to vote, cast a ballot, and participate in our democracy - all of which threaten to disenfranchise voters,""



""None of this is legal,"" it claimed.

Donald Trump, who signed the presidential order titled 'Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections' on March 25, called it ""the farthest-reaching executive action ever taken"". He had said he has done so to secure the US election from ""widespread rigging"".

Till date, Donald Trump does not agree with or acknowledge his defeat in the 2020 US presidential election. He has repeatedly questioned the integrity of the US electoral system. He has been very vocal about ""massive election fraud"" in the United States, particularly involving ""absentee voting"".

A faction of legal experts, who back the Democratic Party lawsuit against Trump, have denounced the presidential order as ""an abuse"" of his power. These changes, they say, will ""prevent millions of voters from casting their ballot"".

""The president's executive order is an unlawful action that threatens to uproot our tried-and-tested election systems,"" a statement issued by them says.

Donald Trump insists those who are coming to vote must register with proper documentation proving their citizenship - like a passport, for example. President Trump gave India's example and credited the world's largest democracy for having something called a voter card and Aadhaar card, which ensures proper registration of voters.

Though his current presidential order mentions nothing about proposing any changes to the number of terms a US President can have, Donald Trump has said he is actively considering a third term in office - which happened only once in US history, after which a two-term limit was introduced by way of a constitutional amendment.

The US Constitution limits the number of 4-year terms that a President can have to just two. These can be consecutive or non-consecutive, but cannot exceed two terms or 8 years. For Donald Trump to contest for a third term as President, his party will have to introduce a Constitutional amendment - which is difficult to achieve as it required sweeping support both in the US Congress as well as in a majority of the 50 states.

In a telephonic interview to NBC News, Donald Trump made his intentions clear. ""No, I'm not joking. I'm not joking (about a third term as President)."" However, he added that ""it is far too early to think about it,"" considering his second term in office has just completed two months.

On being asked how he plans to go ahead with it, President Trump simply said, ""There are methods by which you could do it, as you well know,"" declining to elaborate or give specifics of how or when he plans to do so.

To allow for a third term, Donald Trump and his party will have to change the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. But a proposal to overturn a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress and ratification by the legislatures of three-fourths of the 50 US states.

Some Trump allies have floated the idea of keeping Trump in the White House beyond 2028. Donald Trump, who at 78 was the oldest US president at the time of his inauguration, would be 82 if he took on another four-year term following the November 2028 election.

America's first president, George Washington, had set a precedent in 1797 by stepping down after serving two terms in office, but the two-term presidential limit was only formally codified more than 150 years later.

Only one US President - Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt - served more than two terms in the White House. President Roosevelt was elected four times - in 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944. His fourth term ended prematurely with his death on April 12, 1945. He was 63 at the time of his death.

Other former US Presidents, notably Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt, had sought a third term in office, but failed to win the nomination or re-election.

The 22nd Amendment limiting a President to two terms in office was passed in 1947 - two years after Franklin D. Roosevelt's death - by two-thirds of the House of Representatives and two-thirds of the Senate.

It was ratified by three-quarters of the 50 US state legislatures in 1951.

Russian authorities have dismissed growing speculation over reports of an unidentified virus that causes patients to cough up blood and suffer from prolonged high fever, saying no new pathogens have been detected, Newsweek reported. 

Reports of a mysterious respiratory illness, initially circulated by the Telegram channel SHOT and later amplified by local media, described patients experiencing severe symptoms while testing negative for influenza and COVID-19.

Russian health officials now attribute these cases to common respiratory infections, including Mycoplasma pneumonia. In a statement, Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's public health watchdog, asserted that there is ""no evidence of a new or unidentified virus circulating in the Russian Federation.""

The rapid spread of such rumours highlights an ongoing challenge for health authorities in Russia and globally. The claims emerged against the backdrop of lingering public anxiety from the COVID-19 pandemic, where early miscommunication and underreporting led to delays in containment efforts.



Moscow authorities acted swiftly to investigate and dispel the reports. However, public distrust in Russian institutions remains high, particularly regarding transparency in health matters. During the COVID-19 pandemic, scepticism extended to the Russian-made vaccine, with a 2020 survey showing that 52% of 3,000 medics were unwilling to take it.

The first reports of an ""unknown virus"" appeared on March 29 via SHOT, a Telegram news channel with alleged ties to federal agencies. It claimed that patients in multiple Russian cities were experiencing persistent high fevers, and severe coughing- sometimes with blood and body aches, despite negative tests for influenza A, B, and SARS-CoV-2.

A woman identified as Alexandra told SHOT that by the fifth day of her illness, she began coughing up blood. ""Even after a week of taking antibiotics, the coughing fits didn't stop,"" she said. She was later diagnosed with Mycoplasma pneumonia, a bacterial infection that mimics flu and pneumonia symptoms.

Several other cases reported by SHOT described similar symptoms, body aches, high fever, and a persistent cough. Doctors reportedly listed the diagnosis as ""acute upper respiratory tract infection of unspecified origin"" and advised patients to seek emergency care if symptoms worsened.

Mainstream Russian media, including Lenta.ru and Newizv.ru, picked up the reports, reiterating the claims while noting the lack of official confirmation from health authorities.

Users on Telegram channels such as Moscow Live also shared their experiences, with one writing, ""It's a nightmare- my ribs hurt from coughing, I can't eat, and even the medications make me sick."" 

Another user said, ""The cough has lasted over a month, and the fever stayed for nearly three weeks. I got over COVID much easier.""

Despite the public concern, Rospotrebnadzor reiterated on Monday that the situation remains ""stable and completely controlled.""

A massive explosion was triggered on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday after a gas pipeline operated by Malaysia's state energy firm Petronas caught fire, prompting authorities to order evacuations from nearby residential areas. More than 100 people were injured in the blaze, with over 60 of them admitted to hospitals with serious injuries, the fire department said.

The explosion happened during Eid celebrations near Malaysia's capital, officials said.

So far, no deaths have been reported, and the operations to try to tackle the blaze are underway, Selangor state fire officials said in a statement. However, more than 50 houses have been affected by the blast, they confirmed.

Videos of the incident were widely shared on social media, which show a fiery mushroom cloud billowing into the sky followed by a plume of smoke.

The inferno, which was visible kilometres away, was caused by ""a gas pipeline leak stretching approximately 500 metres (1,600 feet)"", according to the statement.

The valve to the affected pipeline belonging to Malaysia's state-run oil firm Petronas has been shut off, the statement added.

The Fire Department received a distress call about the explosion at around 8:10 am, according to local media reports.

""Dozens of firefighters were immediately rushed for rescue operations. The team identified a burst pipeline as the cause of the fire,"" The Star newspaper reported, quoting fire department director Wan Mohamad Razali Wan Ismail. 

Reports also said that several homes have caught fire in the accident, and some individuals were trapped inside the flames, however, the exact number is not clear.

The inferno forced people from their homes during Eid celebrations as it towered over residential districts near Kuala Lumpur in Muslim-majority Malaysia. The fire department said it was still investigating the extent of the fire in the residential area.

The Netflix drama ""Adolescence"", which has sparked widespread debate about the toxic and misogynistic influences young boys are exposed to online, is to be shown in UK secondary schools, officials said on Monday.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who met the creators of the show alongside charities and young people at his Downing Street office, called the move ""an important initiative"" which would help start conversations about the content teenagers consume online.

Starmer said he had watched the drama -- in which a 13-year-old boy stabs a girl to death after being radicalised on the internet -- with his own teenage children and that it had ""hit home hard"".  

The internet and social media meant ""ideology"" can now be ""pumped directly into the minds of our children"", he added.

""Adolescence"", which was released on March 13, follows the aftermath of the schoolgirl's fatal stabbing, revealing the dangerous influences boys are subjected to online and the secret meaning youngsters are giving to seemingly innocent emojis.

Maria Neophytou of the UK's children's charity NSPCC said the meeting with the prime minister had been a ""critical milestone"".

""The online world is being polluted by harmful and misogynistic content which is having a direct impact on the development of young people's thinking and behaviours. This cannot be allowed to continue,"" she said.

The series has resonated with an audience increasingly disturbed by a litany of shocking knife crimes committed by young people and the misogynistic rhetoric of influencers like Andrew Tate.



Earlier this year it emerged that Axel Rudakubana, a British teenager who stabbed to death three young girls in a knife rampage last July, had viewed footage of another high-profile stabbing just before the attack.

Pressures on young people

Australia notably banned access to social media for all under-16s late last year.

""Adolescence"" also highlights the ""incel"" (involuntary celibacy) culture of males who feel unattractive to the opposite sex and harbour a hatred of women.

Netflix's vice president of UK content Anne Mensah said the series had ""helped articulate the pressures young people and parents face"".

""Adolescence"" had 24.3 million views in its first four days, making it Netflix's top show for the week of March 10-16, according to the entertainment industry magazine Variety.

New UK rules requiring technology firms to tackle illegal content on their platforms -- including extreme pornography and child sex abuse material -- came into force on March 17 as part of the government's Online Safety Act, but were dismissed as ""timid"" by critics.

Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly died aged 14 in November 2017 after viewing harmful material on social media, said the approach had been dominated by media regulator Ofcom's ""fear of legal challenge and their eagerness to placate the tech companies"".

""Worried parents across the country are dismayed by yet more half measures,"" he added.

""Adolescence"" writer Jack Thorne said he hoped a solution could be found to the issues raised by the series.

""It's about other people ... being given the opportunity to have conversations they haven't had before and that they should have had that might lead to policy change and things being made better for our young people,"" he told Sky News after the meeting.

China and India should work more closely together, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Indian President Droupadi Murmu, saying their relationship should take the form of a ""Dragon-Elephant tango"" - a dance between their emblematic animals.

The Chinese and Indian presidents exchanged congratulatory messages on Tuesday, the 75th anniversary of the start of their diplomatic ties, as tensions ease after a 2020 clash between their troops along their shared border in the Himalayas.

Xi said the neighbours should find ways to coexist peacefully and that he was ready to deepen communication and coordination in major international affairs, and jointly safeguard peace in border areas.

Signs of life were detected in the ruins of the 30-story skyscraper that collapsed in Bangkok following the deadly 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck neighboring Myanmar last week. According to official figures, as many as 74 people are feared to be still buried in the rubble, however, sources told NDTV that the number can be as high as 300 to 400.

So far, 13 bodies have been pulled out from the rubble of the unfinished tower, which was being built for Thailand's State Audit Office by a Chinese company and a Thai construction firm. Rescuers were continuing search and rescue efforts on Tuesday to find people trapped three days after a massive quake in Southeast Asia that killed at least 2,000.

Officials and locals, who did not wish to be named, told NDTV that most of the construction workers buried under the debris are from neighbouring Myanmar, which has been ravaged by four years of civil war sparked when the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government in 2021.

""At least 50-60 people trapped in the rubble are Burmese. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in Asia, and a lot of workers come to  Bangkok for menial jobs,"" they said.

Meanwhile, Thai authorities have started investigating a Chinese-backed company over the collapse of the skyscraper, the only Bangkok building to completely crumble by the massive tremors. Thailand's anti-corruption watchdog had earlier flagged to authorities irregularities it found in the construction of the building before it collapsed.

A Reuters report said that tests have found that the materials gathered at the site indicated the presence of substandard steel among the wreckage, which has been sent for further analysis. A report on this is expected to arrive this week.

Construction of the building began in 2020 and is being carried out by a joint venture between Italian Thai Development PCL and China Railway Number 10 (Thailand) Ltd, a local unit of China's state-owned China Railway Group.

The construction has been on a halt for a long time and restarted recently. The government had threatened to cancel the project in January due to delays and potential corner-cutting.

Thai police on Sunday detained four Chinese nationals, who were employed by the construction company, trying to remove important documents from their office at the collapse site.

Scanning machines and sniffer dogs have been deployed at the unfinished skyscraper, and Bangkok's Deputy Governor Tavida Kamolvej said rescuers were urgently working out how to access an area where signs of life had been detected, three days on from the quake.

Realistic chances of survival diminish after 72 hours, she said, adding: ""We have to speed up. We're not going to stop even after 72 hours.""

In central Myanmar, rescuers freed four people, including a pregnant woman and a girl, from collapsed buildings in the city of Mandalay near the epicentre of Friday's earthquake.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

AI-created Ghibli-style artwork is sweeping social media, with users posting breathtaking, surreal images based on Studio Ghibli's animation. OpenAI's recent ChatGPT update has made it simple for users to create illustrations that look like the classic style of Hayao Miyazaki's movies. The trend has turned everything from scenes in movies to personal family photographs into Ghibli-style visual images. Apart from creating digital sensation, the viral trend has also raised privacy concerns among the internet experts and social media enthusiasts. Experts caution against possible data threats, calling on users to be mindful of how their personal data can be treated when using AI image-generation technology. While having fun, privacy concerns cannot be ignored in this fast-emerging trend. 

Proton, a platform that works on data privacy and security, noted on X, ""From the risks of data breaches, once you share personal photos with AI, you lose control over how they are used since those photos are then used to train AI. For instance, they could be used to generate content that may be defaming or used as harassment.""

Think this is a fun trend? Think again.While some don't have an issue sharing selfies on social media, the trend of creating a ""Ghibli-style"" image has seen many people feeding OpenAI photos of themselves and their families.Here's why that's a problem:1/4 pic.twitter.com/o9VqS3Teoe

The platform further warns that ""many AI models, particularly those used in image generation, rely on large training datasets. In some cases, photos of you, or with your likeness, might be used without your consent.""

British futurist Elle Farrell-Kingsley also tweeted that uploading pics/thoughts to AI tools risks exposing metadata, location, and even sensitive data - esp for kids. If it's free, you (& your data) are the price. If you're fine with that, great, but it's good to be aware.""

These X handles are not alone; many digital privacy activists have raised concerns over OpenAI's Ghibli-style AI art generator, claiming it may compromise user privacy by using personal photos to train AI, leading to loss of control over their usage.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Data says 34% of those in US stopped purchasing breakfast staple and won't buy again until costs lower to $5 a carton

As egg prices have reached record highs, about a third of American consumers have stopped buying them in response to the rising costs, a new study suggests.

According to research from Clarify Capital, 34% of Americans have stopped purchasing eggs as prices for the breakfast staple are becoming less affordable. On average, these consumers say they won't begin buying eggs again until costs come down to $5 or less for a carton.

The report compared the average price of eggs across all US states, observing a significant jump in 2018, when the average was $1.49. In 2025, that figure is sitting at about $5.18.

The study found that nearly 95% of Americans have noticed the significant rise in egg prices, with shoppers reporting their perceived average as $7 a dozen. The average American said they would stop buying eggs when prices hit $8 a dozen.

Illinois, a state which is about three-quarters farmland, is seeing the most dramatic jump in egg prices, increasing 1,048% from $0.42 to $4.82.

The research also found that the majority of Americans (61%) are eating fewer eggs due to rising costs, and 44% are seeing themselves using fewer eggs in their cooking and baking habits. It also found that more than two in five Americans (42%) have observed other shoppers “panic-buying” eggs.

The rising costs of eggs are largely due to the current spread of bird flu in the US. According to the study, 67% of Americans blame the higher egg prices on the bird flu, while 31% believe government regulations and policies are behind the expensive eggs.

The price of eggs had quickly become a political talking point despite being driven mostly by a viral outbreak beginning last year. Donald Trump campaigned heavily on soaring egg prices being a Democratic creation, before acknowledging that bird flu was to blame after being elected. Still, it seems that a large portion of Americans believe that the government, Democratic or Republican, is culpable for egg prices.

The US has turned to other countries even amid the looming threat of tariffs in hopes of collecting more eggs, but has seen little success so far.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Official says Kilmer Armado Abrego-Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his wife and child, is in El Salvador prison due to ‘oversight'

Donald Trump's administration acknowledged on Monday in court documents that a Maryland man with protected status was deported to El Salvador and blamed an “administrative error”.

The administration also said it is unable to bring him back because US courts lack jurisdiction now that he is in Salvadoran custody.

The man, Kilmer Armado Abrego-Garcia, is a Salvadoran national who resided in Maryland with his wife and their five-year-old child.

Abrego-Garcia, who has had protected legal status since 2019, is currently detained at Cecot, the notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, after he was deported by the Trump administration on 15 March.

In the court filing, Abrego-Garcia's attorneys said that Ice had initially attempted to deport him in 2019. At the time, immigration officials claimed that a confidential informant had told them that Abrego-Garcia “was an active member of the criminal gang MS-13”, an accusation that he has denied.

That year, Abrego-Garcia contested the claims and efforts to deport him and filed an application for asylum.

According to the court filing, Abrego-Garcia was granted “withholding of removal to El Salvador” by an immigration judge in October 2019, a protected status that prevents an individual being returned to their home country if they can show that there's a “more likely than not” risk that they will be harmed.

But last month, on 12 March, Abrego-Garcia's attorneys say that he was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers, who they say “informed him that his immigration status had changed”.

Abrego-Garcia's attorneys said in the filing that “Ice was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador”.

“After being detained, he was questioned about gang affiliations and transferred ultimately to a detention center in Texas,” the court filing states – and then deported to El Salvador on 15 March. He was deported on the third of three deportation flights to the country that took place that day, which are now at the center of an intense legal battle in which the Trump administration has been ordered to demonstrate how it did not violate a federal judge's halt on the flights.

His deportation was first reported on Monday by The Atlantic.

“Abrego-Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the filing states.

Then on Monday, acting Ice field office director Robert Cerna described the deportation in a court declaration as “an error”. He said that Abrego-Garcia was “not on the initial manifest of the … flight to be removed to El Salvador” but “rather, he was an alternate”.

As other detainees “were removed from the flight for various reasons”, Abrego-Garcia “moved up the list and was assigned to the flight”, Cerna said.

He added: “The manifest did not indicate that Abrego-Garcia should not be removed.

“Through administrative error, Abrego-Garcia was removed from the United States to El Salvador. This was an oversight, and the removal was carried out in good faith based on the existence of a final order of removal and Abrego-Garcia's purported membership in MS-13.

This removal was an error.”

In the filing, the administration said that it no longer has custody of Abrego-Garcia and therefore does not have ability to bring him back to the US.

Abrego-Garcia's attorneys wrote that – on 16 March – his wife identified him in a photograph in a news article showing individuals entering Cecot.

Abrego-Garcia's wife and relatives then filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on his behalf.

In the initial complaint, Abrego-Garcia's attorneys said that he denied he was a member of any “criminal or street gang” and said that the US government “has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded accusation”.

On Monday night, JD Vance defended the deportation of Abrego-Garcia in a post on X, arguing – without offering evidence – that he had “no legal right to be here”.

Abrego-Garcia's ordeal is one of several immigration-related episodes to make headlines in the US in recent days.

On Monday, a state judge in Boston dismissed a criminal case against a man who had been detained mid-trial by Ice agents. The judge found that the Ice agent involved had demonstrated “egregious conduct”, was in contempt of court and referred him to local prosecutors, according to Boston 25 News.

The judge said it would be up to prosecutors whether they pursue criminal charges against the agent.

Meanwhile, community members in the Chicago area are rallying in support of two brothers from Venezuela, one of whom was detained by Ice agents. One of the brothers is in need of a kidney transplant, and his sibling was planning to be his donor before Ice detained him, as reported by NBC News.

The detained brother has been in custody for weeks and faces deportation.

Furthermore, over the weekend, a woman from Mexico in Michigan was arrested on immigration-related charges after she went to the police to report that she was assaulted at her job.

According to the Detroit Free Press, immigration officials were not aware that she lived in Michigan until she went to local police in February to report the assault allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Amendments pushed by Republican Jeff Landry on crime, courts and finances resoundingly defeated in vote

Louisiana voters soundly rejected four constitutional amendments championed by the Republican governor, Jeff Landry, related to crime, courts and finances.

Voters said no to each amendment by margins exceeding 60%, according to preliminary results the secretary of state's office released after voting concluded on Saturday evening.

Landry and his allies had crisscrossed the state in support of an amendment that would have made sweeping changes to the revenue and finance section of the Louisiana's constitution. The amendment received bipartisan support from lawmakers during a November special session on tax reform and was presented as a way to boost teacher salaries, curb excess spending and get rid of special tax breaks in the constitution.

Yet critics from across the political spectrum lambasted the proposed amendment as lacking transparency. The bill exceeded 100 pages but was condensed into a 91-word ballot question for voters.

While major teachers' unions backed the amendment, a coalition of liberal advocacy groups and influential conservative religious figures opposed the changes that would have liquidated educational trust funds and removed constitutional protections for tax breaks for some kinds of properties owned by religious institutions.

Another proposed amendment would have made it easier for lawmakers to expand the crimes for which juveniles could be sentenced as adults. Criminal justice reform groups rallied to oppose what they described as draconian punishment that would not address the root causes of youth crime.

The remaining amendments would have allowed lawmakers to create regional specialty courts, which opponents said could be used to usurp judicial authority from local courts, and provided more flexibility in the timeline for holding elections for the state's supreme court.

Landry said he was disappointed but would continue to fight for “generational changes” in Louisiana.

“We do not see this as a failure,” he said in a statement. “We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a state that is conditioned for failure.”

Landry blamed his loss at the ballot box on the leftwing billionaire George Soros and “far left liberals”. Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization founded by Soros, did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Louisiana's Democratic party called the outcome “a resounding defeat” for Landry.

“Together, with voters from every party, people came to the conclusion that the constitutional amendments were at best misguided – at worst an attempt to give tax breaks to the rich while locking up more of our children,” the party said in a statement. “That is not the Louisiana values we stand for.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Rolling Stone interviews with 10 people reveal claims that Jeremy Lewin threatened a girl with a knife and openly shared racist views

An employee of Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), who was parachuted in as a senior manager at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as it was being wound up, has been accused of a history of misogyny, racism and violent outbursts.

The claims against 28-year-old Jeremy Lewin were made following an investigation by Rolling Stone magazine, which said it was based on interviews with 10 people who know him.

Among the claims are that a girl had complained to police that Lewin had threatened her with a knife, that he physically assaulted a fellow student in the cafeteria at the elite private school he attended, and that had a history of racist remarks.

The magazine said neither the Trump administration nor Lewin had responded to repeated requests for comment. Representatives for Doge did not immediately respond to the Guardian's requests for comment about Lewin, and a representative for the Department of State, which assumed control of USAID programs after it was shuttered, said it does not comment on personnel matters.

According to the magazine: “Police records show he was also once accused of threatening a girl with a knife, asking why ‘he shouldn't gut [her] and cut [her] right now,'” adding that the girl told police she feared for her life.

Lewin was recently appointed deputy administrator for policy and programmes at what remained of USAID after the Trump administration's decision to dismantle it. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that all local workers, diplomats and civil servants associated with USAID overseas had been fired, the final step in shuttering the aid organization. Congress was notified on Friday that virtually all of USAID's employees were to be fired by September and all of its overseas offices will be shuttered.

According to Rolling Stone, it was Lewin who signed the email last week officially closing USAID as he noted that he and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, were “grateful” for employees' “continued service to our great nation”.

According to the magazine, Lewin previously worked with the prominent constitutional legal scholar Laurence Tribe, a frequent critic of Trump, and those familiar with Lewin described an individual prone to violent outbursts and racially demeaning comments.

“I have a vivid memory of him telling me that he believed non-white people were inherently of ‘lower value' than white people,” a former acquaintance who called him “blatantly racist” told Rolling Stone, one of five former classmates it said made similar remarks.

Another person who knew Lewin well as a teenager recalls him being ejected from classes for espousing racist ideals. “He was into the Great Replacement Theory before it was a thing,” they said.

The claims about Lewin follow controversies over other individuals who have become promoted by Musk and Doge. In February another young Musk hire at Doge, 25-year-old Marko Elez, who previously worked for Musk's SpaceX company, resigned over racist remarks before Musk insisted he would rehire him.

A social media account connected to Elez posted a variety of inflammatory comments including the statement: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.” Another post, in September, said: “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.”

The most serious incident involving Lewin occurred at a party at his parents house in 2015.

According to the police report seen by Rolling Stone, “Jeremy started yelling at [a girl who was also at the party] and blamed her for his missing belongings.”

“[Redacted] states during the argument Jeremy pulled out a knife with an Orange [sic] handle and said ‘Tell me why I shouldn't gut you and cut you right now.' [Redacted] continued to tell [police officers] that she felt threatened by Lewin's actions and she was in fear for her life. [Redacted] then left the party and had her friend drop her off at the Newton police station.”

In the report, Lewin told police that the girl threatened him during an argument and threw a notepad at his head. He admitted taking out a knife, but said he slammed it on the kitchen countertop and asked her to leave in response.

The police officer who investigated the incident called for a hearing to be scheduled “for the charge of assault by means of a dangerous weapon”, which ultimately did not take place for reasons that are not clear.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

State attorney general had said anti-conspiracy laws might be used to charge groups helping women travel for abortions

Alabama's attorney general cannot prosecute individuals and groups that help Alabama women travel to other states to obtain abortions, a federal judge ruled on Monday.

The US district judge Myron Thompson sided with an abortion fund and medical providers who sued Alabama's attorney general, Steve Marshall, after he suggested they could face prosecution under anti-conspiracy laws. Thompson's ruling declared that such prosecutions would violate both the first amendment and a person's right to travel.

Marshall has not pursued any such prosecutions. However, he said he would “look at closely” whether facilitating out-of-state abortions is a violation of Alabama's criminal conspiracy laws. The ruling was a victory for the Yellowhammer Fund, an abortion assistance fund that had paused providing financial assistance to low-income people in the state because of the possibility of prosecution.

Alabama bans abortion at any stage of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest.

“It is one thing for Alabama to outlaw by statute what happens in its own backyard. It is another thing for the state to enforce its values and laws, as chosen by the attorney general, outside its boundaries by punishing its citizens and others who help individuals travel to another state to engage in conduct that is lawful there but the attorney general finds to be contrary to Alabama's values and laws,” Thompson wrote in the 131-page opinion.

Thompson said it would be the same as the state trying to prosecute Alabamians planning a Las Vegas bachelor party since casino gambling is also outlawed in the state.

The Yellowhammer Fund, an obstetrician and others had filed lawsuits seeking a court declaration that such prosecutions are not allowed.

“Today is a good day for pregnant Alabamians who need lawful out-of-state abortion care,” Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund, said in a statement. “The efforts of Alabama's attorney general to isolate pregnant people from their communities and support systems has failed.”

A spokesperson for the Alabama attorney general's office said: “The office is reviewing the decision to determine the state's options.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Andry José Hernández Romero sent to an El Salvador prison after claim ‘crown' tattoos proved he was a gang member

For as long as anyone can remember Andry José Hernández Romero was enthralled by the annual Three Kings Day celebrations for which his Venezuelan home town is famed, joining thousands of fellow Christians on the streets of Capacho to remember how the trio of wise men visited baby Jesus bearing gold, frankincense and myrrh.

At age seven, Andry became a Mini King, as members of the town's youth drama group Los Mini Reyes were known. Later in life, he tattooed two crowns on his wrists to memorialise those carnival-like Epiphany commemorations and his Catholic roots.

“Most Capacheros get crown tattoos, often adding the name of their father or mother. We've lots of people with these tattoos – it's a tradition that began in 1917,” said Miguel Chacón, the president of Capacho's Three Kings Day foundation.

The Latin American tradition appears to have been lost on the US immigration officers who detained Hernández, a 31-year-old makeup artist, hairdresser and theatre lover, after he crossed the southern border last August to attend a prearranged asylum appointment in San Diego.

Hernández, who is gay, told agents he was fleeing persecution stemming from his sexual orientation and political views. Just weeks earlier, Venezuela's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, had unleashed a ferocious crackdown after being accused of stealing the presidential election to extend his 12-year rule.

But Hernández's tattoos were deemed proof he was a member of Venezuela's most notorious gang, the Tren de Aragua, and a “security threat” to the US.

“Detainee Hernandez ports [sic] tattoos ‘crowns' that are consistent with those of a Tren de Aragua member,” an agent at California's Otay Mesa detention centre claimed, according to court documents published this week.

Those 16 words appear to have sealed the fate of the young Venezuelan stylist, who friends, family and lawyers say has never committed a crime.

On 15 March, after more than six months in custody in the US, Hernández was one of scores of Venezuelans flown from Texas to a maximum security prison in El Salvador as part of Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign. To the horror of their relatives, some detainees were paraded before the cameras and filmed being manhandled by guards and having their heads shaved before being bundled into cells.

“Let my son go. Review his case file. He is not a gang member,” Hernández's mother, Alexis Dolores Romero de Hernández, pleaded as she came to terms with her son's disappearance into the notorious Central American “terrorism confinement centre”, known by the Spanish acronym Cecot.

“Everyone has these crowns, many people. But that doesn't mean they're involved in the Tren de Aragua … He's never had problems with the law,” said Hernández, 65, who has not heard from her son since he called on the eve of his transfer to let her know – incorrectly – that he was being deported to Venezuela.

“We know nothing. They say nothing. They give no information. That's the trauma – not knowing anything about these young men, especially mine,” Alexis Hernández complained.

Her son's plight has caused outrage in Táchira, the western state where he grew up, with people packing Capacho's picturesque 19th-century church, San Pedro de la Independencia, to demand his freedom.

“We're talking about someone who has been part of Capacho's Three Kings Day celebrations for 23 years,” said Chacón, who is leading the campaign. “That's why I'm doing everything I can to get this young man released. He is completely innocent.”

Krisbel Vásquez, 29, a manicurist, denied her “calm, kind and humble” childhood friend was a villain. “I've known him all my life. He doesn't bother anyone,” Vásquez said, urging Trump and El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, to backtrack.

Xiomara Ramírez, 57, said her son had grown up with Hernández, with the pair doing homework together at her house. “I wonder why so much injustice. Why doesn't the US give good people like Andry opportunities?” Ramírez asked.

Melissa Shepard, an attorney from the California-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, representing Andry, was perplexed that her “very sweet, kind and thoughtful” client had been incarcerated in “one of the worst places in the world.

“The fact that this administration has taken somebody who is so vulnerable and put them into such a terrifying situation has just been horrific. We fear that if it can happen to him, it can happen to anyone,” she said.

Growing indignation over Hernández's plight, and that of other apparently innocent Venezuelans deported to El Salvador on the basis of their tattoos, is spreading to unexpected places.

“It's horrific,” Joe Rogan, a Trump-endorsing podcaster, said on his latest show. Rogan supported Trump's offensive against Venezuelan “criminals” the president claimed terrorised the US. “But let's not [let] innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs,” he said, asking: “How long before that guy can get out? Can we figure out how to get them out? Is there any plan in place to alert the authorities that they've made a horrible mistake and correct it?”

But the Trump administration has shown no sign of reconsidering its decision to send so many Venezuelans to El Salvador on the basis of such flimsy evidence.

On Monday, Trump thanked Bukele for receiving another group of alleged Latin American criminals “and giving them such a wonderful place to live!”

Bukele said the deportations were “another step in the fight against terrorism and organised crime”, claiming the 17 detainees were all “confirmed murderers and high-profile offenders”.

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, bristled when questioned about agents' use of a “points system” to classify detainees as gang members based on their tattoos or attire. “Shame on you and shame on the mainstream media for trying to cover for these [criminal] individuals,” she replied, claiming “a litany of criteria” was used to correctly identify “foreign terrorists” or “illegal criminal aliens” for removal.

Shepard questioned the administration's assertion that detainees such as Hernández were being “removed”. “He has been disappeared,” she said. “I know the government tries to use the language that he was ‘removed' [but] … he has absolutely been disappeared.”

Thousands of miles away in Capacho, Hernández's mother spoke sorrowfully of how her son had decided, against his family's wishes, to abandon their economically damaged country last May and make the perilous journey north through the Darién jungles between Colombia and Panama. “He left because he wanted to help us … and to fulfil his dream,” Hernández said, adding: “Now the reality is different.”

On a recent evening, she and hundreds of protesters filled the San Pedro church for their latest vigil in support of Hernández. The crowd included three men dressed as the Three Kings, who wore theatrical beards and diadems dotted with fake jewels and carried plaques bearing the words: Conscience, Justice and Freedom.

“We, his family, and the entire town vouch for [Hernández's] innocence. It's not possible that in Capacho having a crown tattoo is a symbol of pride, but for him, it makes him a criminal,” Chacón said, appealing directly to the presidents of the US and El Salvador.

“I know Trump is a good man and Bukele is a good man,” Chacón said. “But it cannot be that they have sent this young man to prison. There must be many others like him.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Trump administration begins reducing Health and Human Services workforce as Kennedy plans up to 10,000 job cuts

Thousands of Health and Human Services (HHS) employees across the country are being dismissed on Tuesday as the Trump administration began implementing its controversial workforce reduction plan, which could ultimately remove 10,000 staff from the department through forced layoffs.

The job cuts mark the first tangible impact of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's departmental overhaul announced last week, landing just days after Donald Trump moved to strip collective bargaining rights from workers at HHS and other federal agencies.

Health department workers lined up outside of federal buildings in Washington DC and Maryland on Tuesday morning, some for hours, as they waited to find out if they were still employed. At least one office employee waved their badge at the entry point to see if a red or green light would appear – indicating if they still had a job or not.

One employee, who has been with the department for 20 years and was waiting in line to find out her fate, said her colleagues have known for some time that HHS would be a target under the Trump administration.

“It's in Project 2025,” she said. “Basically since February they've been telling us we might be let go.”

In the early 2000s, the department was among several others to offer legal reductions of force through voluntary buy-outs and early retirement packages. This time has been different.

“We're being led through a security line like you would if you were at TSA,” the HHS employee, who is a supervisor, said. “We have to take off our shoes, take out our laptops and they have to check our badge to make sure we can swipe it, and then check our names against a list.”

Kennedy's restructuring goal is meant to dramatically reshape the department that oversees the US's food supply, monitors disease outbreaks, conducts critical medical research, and administers health insurance for nearly half the country. He has also said he will create a new office – “the administration for a healthy America” – which is meant to absorb agencies controlling billions of dollars in funding that manage addiction services and community health centers.

When finished, the cuts are expected to reduce HHS staffing from 82,000 to 62,000 positions – slashing nearly a quarter of its workforce through a combination of layoffs and early retirement offers.

Union representatives were notified last Thursday that 8,000 to 10,000 employees would be terminated, with positions in human resources, procurement, finance and IT targeted. Jobs in “high cost regions” and those deemed “redundant or duplicative” will be prioritized for elimination, according to a reduction of force email seen by the Guardian.

The department has outlined specific job losses across a number of agencies, including 3,500 positions at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2,400 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and 300 at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

In Congress, former health and human services staffers confronted Republican lawmakers about huge department cuts and layoffs sweeping through the agency. Indiana Republican senator Jim Banks told former HHS budget analyst Mack Schroeder he “probably deserved” to lose his job “because you seem like a clown” according to video footage shared by Schroeder himself.

In a post on LinkedIn, the former CMS executive Karen Shields said one team was given a reduction in force notice that suggested they contact the former director of the office if they had a complaint. But that director died in December, Shields wrote.

“I knew her. This would have broken her heart.”

Back in Washington, the HHS employee waiting in the security line outside of her office building could not wrap her head around the motive behind the White House's plan.

“We help vulnerable people, vulnerable communities,” she said. “We're civil servants, we don't work for political parties.”

“This is not fair; normally they look at job series, performances, costs,” she added in between tears. “I don't think that's happening.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Democratic New Jersey senator's address saying ‘our nation is in crisis' passed the 20-hour mark on Tuesday afternoon

Cory Booker, the Democratic US senator from New Jersey, has embarked on a marathon speech on the Senate floor to warn of what he called the “grave and urgent” danger that Donald Trump's presidential administration poses to democracy and the American people.

Booker began his speech at 7pm on Monday night and passed the 20-hour mark with barely a break in speaking at 3 pm on Tuesday afternoon.

“I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,” Booker said near the start of his speech. “I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our nation is in crisis.”

Booker said that he has heard endless stories of “pain and fear” from constituents who are both Democrats and Republicans due to the Trump administration's policies.

“Institutions that are special in America, that are unique in our country are being recklessly – and I would say unconstitutionally – affected, attacked and even shattered,” Booker said.

“In just 71 days the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for, from our highest offices, a sense of common decency.

“These are not normal times in America and they should not be treated as such. I can't allow this body to continue without doing something. The threats to America's democracy are grave and urgent.”

Booker's speech is not technically a filibuster as he is not trying to run down the Senate's time to prevent a piece of legislation from passing.

Instead, he has used his speaking slot to decry the Trump administration's spending cuts, its attempt to abolish the Department of Education, the president's attempts to bypass the judicial system and the removal of people from the US who speak out against the administration.

Booker's speech has been supported with reams of quotes from speeches by the late American politicians John McCain and John Lewis, as well as excerpts from newspaper articles.

Some of the senator's fellow Democrats have helped support him during his monologues, with several asking questions that have allowed Booker to have a break without yielding the floor.

The Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, was the first to pose a question to his New Jersey colleague, and he praised Booker for his “strength and conviction”.

“You're taking the floor tonight to bring up all these inequities that will hurt people, that will so hurt the middle class, that will so hurt poor people, that will hurt America, hurt our fiscal conditions, as you document,” Schumer said in his own question to Booker.

“Just give us a little inkling of the strength – give us a little feeling for the strength and conviction that drive you to do this unusual taking of the floor for a long time to let the people know how bad these things are going to be.”

At one point, Booker spoke about the need for bipartisanship and mentioned a recent dinner he had with Ted Cruz, the arch-conservative Republican senator from Texas. Cruz is no stranger to marathon speeches, having spoken for more than 21 hours in 2013 in an attempt to filibuster an expansion of Medicaid eligibility.

Amber Ruffin skewers journalists who canceled her appearance, mocking their subservience to Trump

A comedian whose skit for White House reporters was canceled for fear of upsetting Donald Trump skewered the journalists who dropped her in a biting late-night talk show routine mocking their perceived subservience to the president.

“I thought when people take away your rights, erase your history and deport your friends, you're supposed to call it out. But I was wrong,” Amber Ruffin said during a brief appearance Monday on NBC's Late Night With Seth Meyers.

“Glad to find that out now, because if they had let me give that speech, ooh baby… I would have been so terrifically mean.”

Ruffin was dropped at the weekend from the 26 April White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) dinner when the group decided its “focus is not on the politics of division”. As a comedy writer for Meyers and host of her own chat show on Peacock, Ruffin has frequently mocked or criticized Trump and his actions.

Talking with Meyers, she ridiculed the advice she said she had received from the WHCA ahead of the dinner, which she relayed on a Daily Beast podcast Friday, “to be, you know, equal and make sure that you give it to both sides and blah blah blah…

Her invitation to be the dinner's headline act was revoked Saturday after she said there was “no freaking way” she would acquiesce.

“If there's one thing I learned from this weekend, it's you have to be fair to both sides,” Ruffin told Meyers, who replied that: “When people are objectively terrible, we should be able to point it out on television.”

“I thought that too… on Friday,” Ruffin said.

“But today is Monday. And Monday's Amber Ruffin knows that when bad people do bad things, you have to treat them fairly and respectfully. When you watch The Sound of Music, you have to root for the singing children and the other people.”

“You mean the Nazis?” Meyers said, referring to Trump's comment that there were “good people on both sides” at a 2017 white supremacist rally in Virginia in which a civil rights activist was killed.

“I mean, it's just the whole reason we have a free press is so we can report stories, you know, as they actually happen.”

“No,” Ruffin replied. “We have a free press so that we can be nice to Republicans at fancy dinners. That's what it says in the first amendment.”

The exchange began when Meyers introduced a story about a burglar who raided a New York convenience store, and Ruffin stepped in claiming she needed to stop him delivering a punchline making fun of the offender because it would be “divisive”.

“But that doesn't make sense in this case. You know, there's an innocent bodega owner. There's a burglar,” Meyers said.

“Hear me out, there are very fine people on both sides,” Ruffin said, claiming that the burglar was providing “an innovative ventilation system” when he shattered a glass door, and “received a micro loan” when he stole money from the register.

The sketch ended with Ruffin, a host of the satirical game show Have I Got News for You on CNN, declaring she needed to return the dress she had rented for the WHCA dinner.

“I already took the tags off, but I'm a just say they blew off in the wind,” she said.

“But that's lying, Amber. That's wrong,” Meyers said.

Ruffin replied: “You can't say that. That's journalism.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The detailed relics were found in a necropolis and experts believe the woman depicted could have been an important priestess

Two almost lifesize sculptures of a man and woman, who was believed to have been a priestess, have been found during the excavations of a huge tomb in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii.

The detailed funerary relics adorned the tomb containing several burial niches built into a wide wall in the necropolis of Porta Sarno, one of the main entrance gates into the ancient city. Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79.

Experts believe the female sculpture was of an important local woman who was perhaps a priestess of Ceres, who in ancient Roman religion was a goddess of agriculture, fertility and motherly relationships, because of the jewellery and accessories, including earrings, rings and bracelets, carved into it – especially the lunula, a crescent moon pendant hanging in the middle of the necklace.

The woman is veiled and dressed in a large cloak over a tunic, while the man is wearing a toga wrapped over his left shoulder.

However, experts are not convinced that the figures, which were joined together and are believed to date back to the late Roman Republic period, represented a married couple.

Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii archaeological park, said: “Because she really looks like a very important woman in the local elite, there is also this idea that she could have been a priestess of Ceres, holding these lands and what appears to be a purist role.”

She is holding what appears to be laurel leaves, which were used to purify and bless religious spaces by dispersing incense and the smoke from aromatic herbs.

With most women in Roman society relegated to domestic roles, being a priestess, an important position in public life, was the highest position a woman could aspire to and gave power on a similar level to a male priest.

Zuchtriegel said such funerary sculptures did not always represent couples. “Sometimes you get two men, or sometimes they come in threes,” he said. “This could be her husband, but it could also be her son. There was no inscription, so we don't know.”

By the feet of the male statue is the preserved root of an ancient tree that grew on top of the tomb. “It was quite a surprise to find it there a few centimetres beneath the ground,” said Zuchtriegel.

The two sculptures are being restored and will be displayed at an exhibition in Pompeii, beginning on 16 April.

The excavations at the Porta Sarno necropolis are a joint project between Pompeii archaeological park and the European University of Valencia. In 2021, the partly mummified remains, including hair and bones, of a former slave who rose through the social ranks, were found.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Critics say bans would hinder rights as proponents would impose their beliefs on others who don't share their views

Rightwing groups around the US are pushing legislation that would place new limits on what books are allowed in school libraries in a move that critics decry as censorship often focused on LGBTQ+ issues or race or imposing conservative social values.

Caught up in the attempts at suppressing books are classics like The Color Purple and Slaughterhouse Five.

Opponents of such bills argue that they would actually hinder individual rights because the proponents would be imposing their beliefs on parents and children who do not share their views. Those campaigning for the restrictions say it would prevent children from being exposed to what they label sexually explicit and obscene content and increase parental rights.

There are at least 112 proposed state bills concerning school – and public – libraries that seek to expand the definition of what is deemed obscene or “harmful to minors” and to limit librarian staff's ability to determine which books are in their collections, according to the American Library Association.

Judges have already declared some recent laws that banned books unconstitutional and if approved, the other legislation would probably face court challenges.

The battle over school libraries represents another front in the culture war over how American society deals with race, sexual orientation and gender identity.

“Parents want to be able to have a certain way of making sure that inappropriate, sexually explicit books aren't being put in school libraries, and if they ever find these books in the school library, that they can easily and smoothly remove those books,” said Mary Elizabeth Castle, director of government relations for Texas Values, a conservative advocacy group that has tried to ban books that they describe as pornography and has pushed for creationism to be taught alongside evolution.

While there have always been efforts to censor books, there has been a surge in recent years in legislation that concerns material in libraries. In 2014, there were 183 titles targeted for removal from public and school libraries; in 2023, there were 4,240, according to the American Library Association (ALA), which also states that it is not a complete list.

“There has been a coordinated effort by” groups like Moms for Liberty that “because of their personal, political, moral or religious beliefs don't want young people to be reading certain books, and they want the publicly-funded schools and publicly funded libraries to reflect their views”, said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the library association's office for intellectual freedom.

In Texas, there are at least 31 bills – the most of any state – that would impair libraries ability to “acquire and provide diverse materials, resources and programming”, according to the library association. During the 2023-24 school year, there were 538 book bans in Texas, which trailed only Florida and Iowa, according to PEN America, a group dedicated to promoting free expression.

Texas state lawmakers are now considering senate bill 13, which would require that local school boards – rather than librarians – approve all books added or removed from school libraries.

They would have to establish a local advisory council, comprised mostly of parents or students in the district, that would recommend which books should be in the school catalog. And they would not be allowed to have “indecent” or “profane” content, including books with “grossly offensive language”.

Christin Bentley, a member of the state Republican executive committee who chairs a subcommittee, stop sexualizing Texas kids, has advocated for the senate bill because she is concerned about “sexually explicit [books] and books that tell kids to go look at porn online”, she said.

“It's sexually grooming children,” said Bentley, a mother of two who lives near Tyler in the north-eastern part of the state.

Texas districts have also banned books such as Beloved and The Handmaid's Tale, along with newer novels like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and The Underground Railroad, according to the Dallas Observer.

Bentley said she was most concerned about books like Blue Is the Warmest Color and A Game of Thrones graphic novel because of their sexually explicit content.

“A lot of the books that are sexually explicit or very indecent and profane, they are part of a genre called young adult, and that's relatively new,” Bentley said.

While supporters of such legislation argue that parents need greater control over what their children are exposed to in schools, librarians already welcome parent input, according to Lucy Podmore, a librarian and former chair of the Texas Association of School Librarians.

“If a parent has a concern about their specific child's reading options, we have always been willing to have those conversations with parents to make sure that we tailor their reading options to whatever it is that the parents have decided,” Podmore said.

Proponents of legislation to ban certain books in schools argue that students who want to read banned books can still obtain them in a library or store. But Carolyn Foote, a retired librarian in Texas, said there are towns throughout the state that do not have a bookstore or public library.

“Sometimes the school library is just the center for academic pursuits,” said Foote, who along with other librarians founded a group, Texas FReadom Fighters. “Also, it assumes a certain amount of privilege that everyone has money and can just go to the bookstore.”

Foote spent 29 years as a librarian and said she has experienced other “waves of censorship”, but she said the scale of those did not compare to the last few years.

The Texas senate passed the bill on 19 March, and it now goes before the state house.

Part of the bill could violate the first amendment's right to freedom of speech and expression, according to Catherine Ross, a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University.

Determining what books are “harmful” is “incredibly subjective, and it would potentially sweep in much too much material that is protected, even for students in grades K through 12”, Ross said.

If the bill becomes law, librarians would also have a harder time adding books, and it would require a significant time commitment from volunteers who serve on the advisory committee to review all new books, Podmore said.

But banning books because some parents think they are obscene means that other students can no longer access them in schools.

“If you don't want your child to read a book, they don't have to read it, but you're not allowed to tell every child in my campus that they can't read this book because you don't believe in it,” said Margarita Longoria, a Texas school librarian.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Moscow's refusal highlights the limited progress Donald Trump has made on his promise to end the war

Moscow has described the latest US peace proposals as unacceptable to the Kremlin, highlighting the limited progress Donald Trump has made on his promise to end the war in Ukraine since taking office in January.

Sergei Ryabkov, a foreign policy adviser to Vladimir Putin, said some of Russia's key demands were not being addressed by the US proposals to end the war, in comments that marked a rare acknowledgment from the Russian side that talks with the US over Ukraine had stalled in recent weeks.

“We take the models and solutions proposed by the Americans very seriously, but we can't accept it all in its current form,” Ryabkov was quoted by state media as telling the Russian magazine International Affairs. It came after Trump on Sunday revealed his frustration with Putin, saying he was “pissed off” and threatening to impose tariffs on Russian oil exports.

“All we have today is an attempt to find some kind of framework that would first allow for a ceasefire – at least as envisioned by the Americans,” Ryabkov said.

“As far as we can see, there is no place in them today for our main demand, namely to solve the problems related to the root causes of this conflict.”

Putin has repeatedly referred to what he claimed were the “root causes” of the conflict to justify his hardline position on any prospective deal to end the war in Ukraine.

As preconditions for a ceasefire, the Russian leader has insisted on terms that would, in effect, dismantle Ukraine as an independent, functioning state – pulling it firmly into Russia's sphere of influence.

He has demanded that Kyiv recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea and four partly occupied regions in the south-east, withdraw its forces from those areas, pledge never to join Nato, and agree to demilitarisation.

In recent weeks the Russian president has also been openly pushing for regime change in Ukraine, claiming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal and suggesting that Ukraine needs external governance.

Trump appears to be growing increasingly impatient with his lack of progress in a war that he promised to end in 24 hours, expressing frustration with Russian and Ukrainian leaders as he struggles to forge a truce.

Trump's comment that he was “pissed off” with Putin over the Russian leader's approach to a potential ceasefire in Ukraine was a noticeable shift in tone from a leader who had previously expressed admiration for Putin. However, Trump later dialled back his rhetoric and by Monday was accusing Ukraine of trying to renegotiate an economic deal with the US.

The White House on Tuesday said Trump was frustrated with leaders on both sides of the war.

Despite a flurry of US-brokered meetings and parallel talks with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia that produced – on paper – a 30-day energy ceasefire, both sides have continued to strike each other's energy infrastructure.

The Trump administration also attempted to broker a ceasefire in the Black Sea, but Moscow sought to attach several conditions to the deal, including the easing of European sanctions, a demand swiftly rejected by Brussels.

Grigory Karasin, who represented Russia at the talks with the US in Saudi Arabia, last week admitted that the sides had failed to make significant progress and that negotiations may drag into next year.

But Trump's team has said it remains committed to halting the war, with the US leader telling NBC he and Putin planned to speak again this week.

The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, who spent time with Trump over the weekend, said he proposed setting a deadline of 20 April for Putin to comply with a full ceasefire.

However, those close to the Kremlin believe Moscow is unlikely to accept a full ceasefire without securing some of its demands, which include the cessation of all arms and intelligence supplies to Ukraine from the US and other allies.

“We're prepared to keep fighting for some time,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian foreign policy analyst who heads a council that advises the Kremlin. “The continuation of the war, which we are slowly but surely winning, is in our interest. Especially considering that the main sponsor [the US] seems to be backing out … Why should we rush in a situation like this?”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Conservatives bid to overturn liberal majority on Wisconsin supreme court while Florida votes to replace Mike Waltz 

US voters are headed to the polls on Tuesday in Wisconsin and Florida in elections that some see as a test of Donald Trump's popularity and the political clout of his billionaire ally Elon Musk.

In Florida, voters are casting ballots in two special elections to fill vacancies in the first and sixth congressional districts – solid Republican areas that may be surprisingly competitive. But the most closely watched contest is a battle for a seat on Wisconsin's seven-member supreme court.

Conservatives are trying to flip ideological control of the court, which currently has a 4-3 liberal majority. The contest, which features the liberal judge Susan Crawford facing off against the conservative Brad Schimel, will have huge consequences in the state.

The supreme court is set to determine the future of abortion and collective bargaining rights. The court could also ultimately require the state legislature to redraw the state's eight congressional districts, which are heavily distorted in favor of Republicans, who control six of them.

The race has become the most expensive judicial election in American history, with more than $80m spent on both sides. Elon Musk and groups aligned with him have spent more than $20m, and Musk traveled to the state over the weekend to distribute two $1m checks to voters as part of a sweepstakes-like contest. Musk's investment in the race began shortly after Tesla filed a lawsuit challenging a state law that prevents the company from opening car dealerships in the state. It also comes as he has waged a dangerous attack on judges who block Trump's executive actions.

Trump endorsed Schimel in March.

Advertising spending on behalf of Crawford ($42.1m) so far has exceeded that spent on Schimel's behalf ($33.7m), according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political spending. That much spending is significantly more than the $51m spent on the 2023 state supreme court race and it is orders of magnitude more than was spent in the 2020 race, when candidates spent a combined $10m.

Democrats have seized on Musk's entrance into the race and sought to energize voters disturbed by his efforts to gut the federal government and make the race a referendum on Trump's two and a half months in office.

After casting her ballot at Olbrich Botanical Gardens just before 9am in Madison, the state capital and a liberal stronghold, Jeannine Ramsey, 65, said she voted for Crawford and not the “Elon Musk-supported Brad Schimel”, who would not rule fairly on the issues most important to her.

“I think it's shameful that Elon Musk can come here and spend millions of dollars and try to bribe the citizens,” she said. “I don't think it should be allowed. He doesn't live in our state, and I don't think he should be able to buy this election. It makes me angry.”

She said she was cautious about getting her hopes up. “I live in a very blue bubble and I've been very disappointed in the past,” she said. “I thought I knew what people were thinking and feeling, and I was really surprised that people would send a convicted felon back into the presidential office.”

Lemuel Anderson, 30, voted for Crawford early and said it was her environmental record that got his support.

“It's a really important race, because you have a lot of cases coming up in the next two years to the Wisconsin supreme court that will determine not only the trajectory of the state, but also the national trajectory,” he said.

“The Wisconsin supreme court race is the first major test of Elon Musk's political power since the November presidential race,” Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party, said in an interview in March.

In Florida, much of the attention will be on a special election to replace Mike Waltz, who resigned from Congress to serve as Trump's national security adviser. Waltz easily won re-election last year in the sixth congressional district, which includes Daytona Beach, by 33 points in November. But there are now concerns that the race may be more competitive than expected.

The Democratic candidate in the race, Josh Weil, has brought in more than $10m while his opponent, the Republican Randy Fine, still favored to win, has brought in around $1m. Weil has also campaigned by emphasizing the threats Musk poses to Medicare and social security.

At the Church of Christ polling place in Daytona Beach on Tuesday, there were multiple cars with pro-Trump bumper stickers in the parking lot, including an Oldsmobile that had a “Trump Girl” sticker.

Volunteers for Weil and Fine were outside the polling station, with Weil volunteers at a table with flyers and other resources. The volunteers for the Fine campaign only had a single folding chair.

Victor Valentin, a Weil volunteer, said that this was the first time he had volunteered with a campaign. “I saw the hate that is out there,” he said. “Calling all immigrants or noncitizens ‘illegal' or calling them ‘criminals' is insane. I'm a Hispanic man from Puerto Rico, and those are my fellow Hispanic folks also. These are great people that come here to work hard. They come here to educate their kids.”

Robert Craddock, a volunteer for the Fine campaign, was also outside the polling place. “Why in the world if you love America would you want to tear down America?” he said.

Koralee Sanford, a Democrat, and her friend Diane, a Republican, who declined to give her last name, both went to vote together.

“I want the United States to be back on budget. There is so much corruption – I'm talking about all of them over the years, Republicans and Democrats. And Trump is cleaning it up. I mean, that Doge is just haulin' ass,” Diane said.

“Corruption is also the main thing for me, and the money. We're so far in debt,” Sanford said.

Public and private polling has shown a closer than anticipated race, Axios reported last week. Fine is still favored to win the race, but if Weil comes within a closer than expected margin, it could still be a sign of momentum for Democrats.

If Democrats were able to flip the seat, it would have significant reverberations in the US House. Republicans hold an extremely narrow 218-213 majority in the lower chamber (there are currently four vacant seats) and cannot afford to lose any advantage in their majority. The concern was so prominent that Trump last week pulled the nomination of Elise Stefanik to be his ambassador to the UN so Republicans could preserve their margin.

The other special election on Tuesday is a contest in the Florida panhandle to fill the seat once held by Matt Gaetz, who resigned when Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general and then later withdrew his nomination. The Republican Jimmy Patronis is expected to win the seat.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

US climate agency upended as Doge efforts to slash federal government compromise email security

A sense of chaos has gripped the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), one of the world's premier research agencies, with key staff hastily fired and then rehired, cuts to vital weather forecasting operations and even a new, unsecured server that led to staff being deluged by obscene spam emails.

Noaa is currently being upended by Donald Trump's desire to slash the federal government workforce, with more than 1,000 people already fired or resigning from the agency and 1,000 more staffers are expected to be removed as the purge continues. In total, this represents around 20% of the Noaa's workforce.

Along with leading climate and marine research, Noaa also houses the National Weather Service, which provides bedrock weather forecasts to private providers and the public. There are concerns that the Trump administration's cuts, spearheaded by Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), could imperil public safety by hindering timely warnings of tornadoes and hurricanes.

Doge has already had to reverse some of its initial firings after removing staff including those who help track hurricanes. Five people involved in the “hurricane hunter” flights were fired, only for three of them to be told their jobs will be reinstated. Other staff within the National Weather Service have also been asked to disregard their terminations.

Noaa's data collection activity is still being affected, though, with the agency reducing the number of weather balloons it releases in six locations across the US. The balloons, fitted with weather instruments, are crucial in providing the information for weather forecasts.

This tumultuous era for Noaa was for some staff crystallized by Doge's decision to use a new email server to send missives from the federal government's office of personnel management to the agency. The email server was not secure, meaning that staff got dozens of spam-like emails in January, one of them with a lewd title about the president and another stating: “the next 4 years has an [sic] 99% chance of shit showers.”

While Noaa has since resolved the lack of email server security, staff said that it was emblematic of growing turmoil within the agency.

“The feeling has been ‘you've got to be kidding me,'” said one staffer, who was fired but is now on administrative leave pending potential reinstatement.

“These people at Doge think they are the best at what they do but they can't even protect an email list. They fired people and then had to hire them back, they are cutting contracts without learning what they are. I mean good lord take a minute before doing this. It's an absolute joke.”

Some former Noaa staff and elected Democrats have held recent protests outside the agency's headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, warning that the cuts risk hampering the flow of crucial weather and climate information, as well as regulatory work around fisheries that prevent the over-exploitation of the oceans.

“Dysfunction is the polite way of putting it, you could also say it is incompetent chaos,” said Andrew Rosenberg, formerly the deputy director of Noaa's national marine fisheries service.

“This administration is paying people on administrative leave and asking staff to name five good things they've done but they get email bounce backs when they do because the inboxes are full. If you were looking at the inverse of efficiency, this would be it.”

Rosenberg said remaining Noaa staff are striving to continue their work but the mission of the agency is being degraded.

“A year from now people will notice things are missing that used to be there and Doge and others promoting this will say: ‘See, told you government can't do things', rather than: ‘We broke it and it got worse,'” he said.

“Noaa staff right now aren't happy because they don't know if they will keep their jobs. Work has been made harder for no reason and they are being told they are worthless. No one has even explained why they are doing all of this crap.”

Noaa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Farming groups are starting to voice concerns for Trump's tough approach at a time when they face many challenges

It has been a perilous few years for the Red Fire Farm in western Massachusetts.

Since the pandemic, rising interest rates, labor and seed costs on the 200-acre produce farm have made life for owners Ryan and Sarah Voiland a spiraling challenge.

Having spent millions of dollars building their business from scratch since 2001, last year the farm's barn burned down, taking with it the store, a tractor, irrigation equipment and tools.

This year, Ryan had hoped a $125,000 grant won through the Rural Energy for America Program to build a solar canopy system, and a $40,000 allowance to distribute fall leaf litter from nearby towns across their fields, would help offset the farm's ever-increasing refrigeration and fertilizing costs.

But in January, the Trump administration froze billions of government funding dollars from Biden-era projects – including more than $2bn for 30,000 ranchers and farms such as Red Fire Farm.

“When something is signed and contracted it's just totally unfair for [the government] to rescind something that farmers are already making investments in,” he said.

“It's leaving farmers on the hook for thousands of dollars.”

That prompted Voiland to join an Earthjustice lawsuit against the US Department of Agriculture that's seeking a court order against the administration's refusal to disburse the funding.

American farmers are not unused to the impulses of Donald Trump, who in his first presidency fueled a trade war with China that ended up adversely affecting exports of US pork and soybeans. But back then, many farmers stayed afloat in large part due to a $28bn handout from the federal government.

Today, there's no sign of checks in the post for farmers.

Trump has suggested farmers are in for “a little bit of an adjustment period” with more reciprocal tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada and European countries set to come into force on Tuesday.

This comes at a time when farming, whether at the local producer or commodity crop level, faces major challenges.

Plummeting demand from China, rising land prices and Trump's threats to cut visas for foreign farm workers have put one of the world's most productive agricultural economies in a major spin. John Deere, the machinery manufacturer, has been shedding thousands of jobs across the midwest due to falling demand fueled by farmers' economic struggles. Imports of agriculture products, which can undercut US farmers, have never been as high.

And while ranchers and farmers make up a small part of the wider US economy, its struggles could have major implications: 10% of all US workers are employed in or adjacent to agriculture.

Across the country, farming groups are beginning to voice concerns for Trump's tough tariff approach.

“Trade policies must come with real, tangible protections for the farmers directly affected,” said the National Farmers Union president, Rob Larew.

“We've heard there's a strategy in place – now we need to see it. Promises alone won't pay the bills or keep farms afloat.”

With around 20% of all US agricultural production going overseas, some agronomists fear the ructions caused by the Trump administration could put pay to relations that took decades to develop, and which in particular could ill-affect American corn and soybean farmers.

“It's been a very good relationship with Mexico. But if this tariffs situation gets out of control, I wouldn't be surprised that within five years you hear of Mexico building a deep sea port [to facilitate imports from countries other than the US],” said Jim McCormick, the co-founder of Agmarket.net, a Missouri-based agricultural marketing and consulting firm.

“The best thing you can do is build a trade relationship that works well for both countries. It works well for Mexico – they get a cheap supply of food – and it works well for the American producer – we overproduce in the United States. That is the reality – we are built to feed the world.”

In recent years, China, the world's largest importer of soybeans which until recently was largely sourced from American farmers, has developed a new trade relationship with Brazil as a direct result of the first Trump administration's trade war.

Brazil has rapidly grown its soybean crop to become the world's largest producer today, with 40% of the global share, and is the world's third-largest producer of corn. Its mild climate allows two harvests per year and it has cleared thousands of square miles of savannah and forest for crop farming.

In November, a huge port opened in Chancay, Peru, which was paid for by China in a move meant to give Beijing easier access to South American products.

“My fear is that it's going to be a lot tougher negotiating with these countries than what people think,” said McCormick. “The first go around [in 2017] we were just battling China. Now, we're pretty much battling the world. It could get very volatile.”

Still, farmers have been widely supportive of the president. In the country's 444 agriculture-dependent counties, Trump won 77.7% of the vote in last November's presidential election, up from 73% in 2016 and 76% in 2020.

Commodity crop growers are this month set for some relief with $10bn in assistance being released through a program signed into law during the Biden administration.

“I think farmers are not exactly thrilled at the economic situation we're in right now, but they still believe he's got their back,” said McCormick, adding that whether or not tariffs go into place on 2 April will shape wider sentiment towards the White House. “They're going to wait and see.”

On the Red Fire Farm, which employs around 75 people during the summer season on its food subscription, U-pick and wholesale operations, feelings of hope and trepidation mingle as the Voilands gear up for the 2025 growing season. Construction of a new barn is in the works, although its financial implications are worrying, says Ryan.

Another point of concern is the Trump administration's canceling of $1bn worth of local food purchase funding for food banks and schools, which hits producers such as Voiland and in-need consumers alike.

But pressure through calls and emails has helped a small conservation grant won by the Voilands and other farmers previously frozen in January be revived last month.

“I wanted to do everything possible to fight back and resist it,” said Voiland, “both for the sake of my farm and for the general good of agriculture”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Jerry Nadler says president is attacking higher education ‘cloaked under the guise of fighting antisemitism'

A group of Democratic-led states have sued the Trump administration over its decision to cut $11bn in federal funds that they were allocated during the Covid-19 pandemic.

In the lawsuit, attorneys general and governors from 23 states and the District of Columbia argue that Department of Health and Human Services lacks the authority to unilaterally claw back funding the states had already built health programs around.

The “sudden and reckless cuts violate federal law, jeopardize public health, and will have devastating consequences for communities nationwide,” the lawsuit writes.

The lawsuit asks the court to immediately stop the Trump administration from rescinding the money, which was allocated by Congress during the pandemic and mostly used for Covid-related efforts such as testing and vaccination, Associated Press reports.

First lady Melania Trump spoke at the International Women of Courage Award ceremony on Tuesday where she spoke about courage as “a strength that is based in love”.

Trump, during a rare public appearance at the state department, recognized eight women from around the world for bravery, including an Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas. She said:

I have harnessed the power of love as a source of strength during challenging times. Love has inspired me to embrace forgiveness, nurture empathy and exhibit bravery in the face of unforeseen obstacles.

Congressman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, has issued a statement strongly condemning the Trump administration for cancelling $400m in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University because of what it alleged was the college's repeated failure to protect students from antisemitic harassment.

The administration announced on Monday that a federal antisemitism taskforce is also reviewing more than $255m in contracts between Harvard University and the federal government, as well as $8.7bn in grant commitments to Harvard and its affiliates.

“I strongly condemn former President Trump's latest attacks on higher education cloaked under the guise of fighting antisemitism,” Nadler said in his statement on Tuesday.

Withholding funding from Columbia and, potentially, Harvard will not make Jewish students safer … Make no mistake. Trump's actions are not rooted in genuine concern for combatting hate.

Nadler noted that the president's record “is stained by praise for neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers, and white nationalists”, adding:

I call on our nation's universities to reject President Trump's demands and to fight back against these hostile acts. If necessary, these issues must be litigated in federal court to put an end to the illegal and unconstitutional actions taken by the Trump Administration.

From Sam Levine in New York and Ashley Spencer in Daytona Beach, Florida:

Andrew Julius, a veteran, cast his vote for Josh Weil, a Democrat, at the John Dickerson Community Center on Tuesday in a special election to determine who will replace Mike Waltz, the US national security adviser.

I'm actually a fan of Josh Weil. I listened to him talk. I actually went to one of his town halls a couple of weeks ago at the church and I was like, all right, he seems like an educated person. He's a teacher, level headed, doesn't have those crazy conspiracy thoughts. And so I felt comfortable saying, okay, I can vote for this guy instead of not voting at all.

A former sonar technician in the navy, Julius said he was concerned over the recent disclosure that top Trump administration officials had used Signal to communicate about sensitive bombing plans in Yemen. He said:

I had a top secret security clearance with my job in the Navy because I was a sonar tech. So we had to have a security clearance, and if I would have done just a fraction of a mistake or what was done with this whole Signal-gate fiasco, I would have been court martialed. I would have been court martialed, kicked out of the Navy, lost rank, lost pay.

“It's really concerning that no one has even taken responsibility like, hey, we messed up. That was a mistake. We shouldn't have done that,” he added.

The district is solidly Republican, and the GOP candidate, Randy Fine, is still the favorite to win. But recent polling has shown that the race may be closer than expected, prompting some Republican skittishness.

Republican House speaker Mike Johnson tried – and failed – to block a bipartisan effort to change House rules to allow new parents in Congress to vote remotely after the birth of a child.

The House, in a 206-222 procedural vote, fell short of the votes needed to adopt a rule that included language blocking a proxy vote resolution led by Republican congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna of Florida and Democratic congresswoman Brittany Pettersen of Colorado.

“If we don't do the right thing now, it'll never be done,” said Luna, who gave birth to her son in 2023.

Pettersen, with a diaper over her shoulder and her four-month-old son in her arms, pleaded with House colleagues. “It is unfathomable that in 2025 we have not modernized Congress,” she said. “We're asking you to continue to stand with us.”

Elon Musk's cost-cutting team is finalizing the dismantlement of the US Agency for International Development, ordering the firings of thousands of local workers and US diplomats and civil servants assigned to the agency overseas, two former top USAID officials and a source with knowledge of the situation said on Tuesday.

On Friday, Congress was notified that almost all of USAID's own employees were being fired by September, all of its overseas offices shut, and some functions absorbed into the state department.

The latest move by Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” will in effect eliminate what is left of the agency's workforce.

The Trump administration has fired staff who were working on the Food and Drug Administration's bird flu response as part of its mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services, Reuters reports.

Among those fired today were leadership and administrative staff at the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, the news agency writes, citing a source.

The center's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network tests raw pet food for bird flu. In recent weeks, the FDA has issued several pet food recalls after detecting bird flu contamination.

The move will bring operations at the laboratory network to a halt, the source told Reuters.

As egg prices have reached record highs, about a third of American consumers have stopped buying them in response to the rising costs, a new study suggests.

According to research from Clarify Capital, 34% of Americans have stopped purchasing eggs as prices for the breakfast staple are becoming less affordable. On average, these consumers say they won't begin buying eggs again until costs come down to $5 or less for a carton.

The report compared the average price of eggs across all US states, observing a significant jump in 2018, when the average was $1.49. In 2025, that figure is sitting at about $5.18.

The study found that nearly 95% of Americans have noticed the significant rise in egg prices, with shoppers reporting their perceived average as $7 a dozen. The average American said they would stop buying eggs when prices hit $8 a dozen.

A comedian whose skit for White House reporters was canceled for fear of upsetting Donald Trump skewered the journalists who dropped her in a biting late-night talk show routine mocking their perceived subservience to the president.

“I thought when people take away your rights, erase your history and deport your friends, you're supposed to call it out. But I was wrong,” Amber Ruffin said during a brief appearance Monday on NBC's Late Night With Seth Meyers.

Glad to find that out now, because if they had let me give that speech, ooh baby… I would have been so terrifically mean.

Ruffin was dropped at the weekend from the 26 April White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) dinner when the group decided its “focus is not on the politics of division”.

As a comedy writer for Meyers and host of her own chat show on Peacock, Ruffin has frequently mocked or criticized Trump and his actions.

When asked about more possible dismissals in the federal government, White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said:

“The President has given the responsibility to his Cabinet secretaries to hire and fire at their respective agencies, and they reserve that right. You saw the Secretary of Health and Human Services announced more layoffs today. This is all part of the administration's effort for a mass reduction in force in the federal bureaucracy here in Washington DC, to save American taxpayers money.”

Ashley Spencer reports on the ground from Florida:

At the Church of Christ in Daytona Beach, voters lined up to vote in Florida's special election to replace Rep. Mike Waltz after he was appointed Trump's national security advisor. At the church, Trump bumper stickers dotted the parking lot. But the campaign for Democratic candidate Josh Weil had a more robust table set up with flyers and resources than that of Republican Randy Fine, who is favored to win.

“Calling all immigrants or noncitizens ‘illegal' or calling them ‘criminals' is insane,” said Victor Valentin, who volunteered for a political campaign for the first time and on behalf of Weil. “I'm a Hispanic man from Puerto Rico, and those are my fellow Hispanic folks also. These are great people that come here to work hard. They come here to educate their kids.”

Meanwhile, a Fine campaign volunteer wore a shirt with Trump's mugshot that said Never Surrender. The former Democrat said he supported Trump and key ally Elon Musk. “I want him to do what he's trying to do,” he said of Musk. “Anybody who's not happy with him is either brainwashed or a crook.”

California attorney general Rob Bonta sent letters to 15 insurance companies reminding them that under AB 571, they cannot deny, cancel, or increase premiums on malpractice insurance for medical providers who offer abortion, contraception, or gender-affirming care in California.

The letter sent to insurers requests proof of compliance, and Bonta also issued a general industry alert.

“California has been and remains committed to protecting the right to choose and the right of individuals to access necessary medical care,” said Bonta. “Licensed providers that offer reproductive and gender-affirming care too often face significant obstacles in securing malpractice insurance — the California Legislature passed, and the Governor signed into law, AB 571 to tear down those barriers.”

Leavitt was asked about the error regarding a Salvadoran national with protected legal status who was deported to El Salvador last month, despite his legal protections. The Trump administration acknowledged in court that his deportation was due to an “administrative error”.

“The error you're referring to was a clerical error,” Leavitt said on Tuesday. “It was an administrative error. The administration maintains the position that this individual, who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country, was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Founded in 1983, the restaurant known for waitresses in skimpy outfits has run into financial difficulties lately

Hooters, the US-based restaurant chain known for chicken wings and skimpy waitstaff outfits, has filed for bankruptcy protection.

HOA Restaurant Group filed the motion for chapter 11 protection Monday in the north Texas bankruptcy court in Dallas.

The company – whose outlets are often derisively called “breastaurants” and are known for their so-called “Hooters girls” – ran into financial woes as its debts mounted, but it says it intends to stay open and resolve its troubles within months. A group of the company's original founders that own almost a third of Hooters' US locations, including about half of its largest-volume restaurants, plans to buy and operate more of the outlets, Hooters said in a news release.

“Our renowned Hooters restaurants are here to stay and we are taking action to strengthen our business to better serve our valued customers over the long term,” the company said in a notice on its website.

Hooters, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was founded in Clearwater, Florida, in 1983. Trouble had been brewing for a while.

Hooters had sponsored the No 9 Nascar car driven by Chase Elliott since 2017. But last year, Hendrick Motorsports ended its ties to the longtime sponsor because it was not meeting its financial commitments.

Its business strategy has faced challenges over the years, including lawsuits over its hiring of only women to serve customers.

Last year it agreed to pay $250,000 and provide other relief to settle a race and color discrimination lawsuit brought by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against a Hooters outlet in Greensboro, North Carolina.

In 2022, the restaurant refuted claims it was shutting down and rebranding due to changing customer tastes.

In 2019, the Hooters hotel-casino off the Las Vegas Strip was sold to an Indian hotel company and rebranded as the Oyo Hotel and Casino.

Senior doctor who saw bodies says men appeared to have been ‘executed', adding to evidence of potential war crime

Some of the bodies of 15 Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, killed by Israeli forces and buried in a mass grave nine days ago in Gaza, were found with their hands or legs tied and had gunshot wounds to the head and chest, according to two eyewitnesses.

The witness accounts add to an accumulating body of evidence pointing to a potentially serious war crime on 23 March, when Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance crews and civil defence rescue workers were sent to the scene of an airstrike in the early hours of the morning in the al-Hashashin district of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.

International humanitarian teams were only allowed access to the site this weekend. One body was recovered on Saturday. Fourteen more were found in a sandy grave at the site on Sunday and were brought back for autopsies in the nearby city of Khan Younis.

Dr Ahmed al-Farra, a senior doctor at the Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis, witnessed the arrival of some of the remains.

“I was able to see three bodies when they were transferred to the Nasser hospital. They had bullets in their chest and head. They were executed. They had their hands tied,'' Farra said. “They tied them so they were unable to move and then they killed them.”

He provided photographs he said he had taken of one of the dead on arrival at the hospital. The pictures show a hand at the end of a long-sleeved black shirt with a black cord knotted around the wrist.

Another witness, an official from an international aid agency who took part in the recovery of remains from Rafah on Sunday, also said they saw evidence of one of the dead having been shot after being detained.

“I saw the bodies with my own eyes when we found them in the mass grave,” the witness, who did not want his name used for his own safety, told the Guardian in a telephone interview. “They had signs of multiple shots in the chest. One of them had legs tied. One was shot in the head. They were executed.”

The accounts add to allegations made by a senior Palestinian Red Crescent official, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Gaza health ministry that some of the victims had been shot after they were detained and put in restraints by Israeli troops.

The incident came after the Israeli government ended a two-month-old ceasefire and resumed its military campaign against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza on 17 March, with heavy aerial bombing and ground operations. The people of Rafah were ordered to leave the town on Monday, before Israeli ground operations there.

The international criminal court issued arrest warrants for war crimes in November against the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and the ICC prosecutor has said he is still investigating Israeli forces and Hamas for suspected atrocities.

The victims are believed to have been killed on 23 March, two of them in the early hours when their ambulance came under Israeli fire while on the way to collect injured people from an earlier airstrike. The remaining 13 of the dead were in a convoy of ambulances and civil defence vehicles dispatched to retrieve the bodies of their two colleagues. One of the dead was a UN employee. A Red Crescent paramedic, named as Assad al-Nassasra, is still missing.

The UN said the ambulances and other vehicles were buried in sand by bulldozers alongside the bodies of the dead, in what appears to have been an attempt to cover up the killings. UN video footage taken by the recovery team showed a crushed UN vehicle, ambulances and a fire truck that had been flattened and buried in the sand by the Israeli military.

“This is a huge blow to us … These people were shot,” Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN aid coordination office, said on Tuesday. “Normally we are not at a loss for words and we are spokespeople, but sometimes we have difficulty finding them. This is one of those cases.”

Israel's military has said its “initial assessment” of the incident had found that its troops had opened fire on several vehicles “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”, and has claimed, so far without evidence, that Hamas fighters and other militants had been using the ambulances for cover.

The Israel Defense Forces have so far not responded to questions, first posed on Monday, about the reports that the bodies and their vehicles had been buried or to the allegations that some had been shot after being detained.

Dr Bashar Murad, the Red Crescent's director of health programmes in Gaza, said at least one of the recovered bodies of the paramedics had had his hands tied, and that one of the paramedics had been on a call to the ambulance dispatcher when the attack took place.

On that call, Murad said, gunshots fired at close range could be heard as well as the voices of Israeli soldiers on the scene speaking in Hebrew, ordering the detention of at least some of the paramedics.

“The gunshots were fired from a close distance. They could be heard on the call between signal officer and of the medical crews that survived and phoned the ambulance centre for help. The soldiers' voices were clearly audible in Hebrew and very close, as well as the sound of the gunfire.”

“Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them,” was one of the lines that Murad said could be heard by the dispatcher. He said the call had not been recorded.

Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza, said the bodies had been found with at least about 20 gunshots in each of them and confirmed that “at least one of them had their legs bound”.

In a statement released on Monday, Gaza's health ministry said: “They were executed, some of them handcuffed and had sustained head and chest injuries. They were buried in a deep hole to prevent their identities from being identified.”

On Monday the IDF issued evacuation orders covering most of Rafah, indicating it could soon launch another major ground operation, eight days after the paramedics and rescue workers were killed.

According to the Red Crescent, an ambulance was dispatched to pick up the casualties from the airstrike in the early hours of 23 March and called for a support ambulance. The first ambulance arrived at hospital safely but contact was lost with the support ambulance at 3.30am. An initial report from the scene said it had been shot at and the two paramedics inside killed.

The Palestinian Red Crescent president, Dr Younis al-Khatib, said the IDF had impeded the collection of the bodies for several days. The IDF said it had facilitated the evacuation of bodies as soon as “operational circumstances” allowed.

“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.

Their burial had been put off pending autopsies at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. The autopsies have now been carried out, according to hospital sources, and a full report is due to be delivered to the Gaza health ministry within 10 days.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Head of European Commission says bloc would prefer to negotiate but all countermeasures are on the table

The European Union has a “strong plan” to retaliate against tariffs imposed by Donald Trump but would prefer to negotiate, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said.

Trump, who has upended eight decades of certainties about the transatlantic relationship since taking office, has threatened tariffs on goods from around the world from Wednesday. His administration in March put tariffs on imported steel and aluminium and said higher duties on cars would come into effect on Thursday.

Von der Leyen, speaking to the European parliament on Tuesday, said the next sectors facing tariffs would be semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and timber.

She said many Europeans felt “utterly disheartened” by the US announcements. “Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate, but if it is necessary we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it,” she said.

After the announcement of the steel and aluminium tariffs in March, the commission said it would impose countermeasures on up to €26bn of US goods. These include the reimposition of tariffs on $4.5bn of US goods, such as jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes, which were suspended during the presidency of Joe Biden. The measures are due to be implemented in mid April, after the EU executive chose to delay the initial 1 April date in order to align them with other steps and fine-tune the EU position among the 27 member states.

The EU executive is consulting member states over a second tranche of tariffs, worth around €18bn, covering steel, aluminium, poultry, beef, seafood and nuts.

However, it is facing pressure from European capitals to protect national interests. France, for example, is concerned about the impact on French wines and spirits if the commission targets American bourbon. Its prime minister, François Bayrou, described proposed EU tariffs on Kentucky bourbon as a misstep, after meetings with the French cognac industry.

Under the EU-US trade relationship, worth €1.6tn in 2023, the European bloc exports more goods across the Atlantic than the US does, led by cars, medicines and pharmaceutical products, which could give it leverage.

EU officials have not ruled out retaliatory measures on US services, such as suspending intellectual property rights. In theory, retaliation could target US tech companies, banks and financial service providers.

Without giving away details, von der Leyen said “all instruments” – all countermeasures – were on the table. “Europe holds a lot of cards. From trade to technology to the size of our market,” she said. “But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm countermeasures if necessary.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

No 10 says deal to cede UK's last African colony now being finalised after months of doubt

Donald Trump has signed off the UK's handover of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, Downing Street has indicated, paving the way for the UK to cede sovereignty over its last African colony after a six-month standoff.

Under the terms of the deal, the UK will give up control of the Chagos archipelago while paying to maintain control of a joint US-UK military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia, under a 99-year lease.

The agreement came under fire from senior Republicans in the US last year, and more recently some inside the UK government who questioned why the UK was spending billions on it amid cost pressures.

The prime minister's spokesperson said on Tuesday that the deal was being finalised after receiving the green light from Trump. “My understanding is it's now between us and the Mauritian government to finalise the deal, following the discussions with the US,” he said.

Trump told Keir Starmer during his visit to the White House in February that he was “inclined to go with your country” over the Chagos deal and that he had “a feeling it's going to work out very well”.

The plan to cede control over the islands was announced in October, before a change of administration in Mauritius and Trump's return to the White House threw it in doubt.

Senior figures in Trump's administration including Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, criticised the proposals, and Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, spent months openly lobbying the president and his advisers to reject the deal, creating embarrassment for the Labour government.

Critics have argued that the handover will compromise the security of the joint military base because of Mauritius's relationship with China.

UK officials claim the links between Mauritius and China are overstated, however, and that India is the more influential regional power. Mauritius is one of the few countries in the region that has refused to take part in China's belt and road initiative.

Ministers have also argued that the UK has to give up the territory due to international legal rulings in favour of Mauritius, and that legal uncertainty over the legitimacy of the military base could compromise its security.

The UK government revealed it would spare China from facing stronger rules as part of its register of foreign lobbyists coming into force on 1 July.

Russia and Iran would both be included in the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme once it was launched this summer, Dan Jarvis, the security minister, told the Commons.

The enhanced tier of the scheme is reserved for countries that pose a risk to UK national security. Anyone who is directed by Russia or Iran to carry out activities in the UK must declare it or face five years in prison.

Jarvis declined to comment on China's status in the scheme or to speculate on “which countries may or may not be specified in the future”. Should ministers decide to impose stricter rules on China or any other countries such as North Korea, they will need to give three months' notice of the change.

Announcing greater restrictions on Russian activity, Jarvis said Moscow “presents an acute threat to UK national security” and that its “hostile acts have ranged from the use of a deadly nerve agent in Salisbury, espionage, arson and cyber-attacks, including the targeting of UK parliamentarians through spear-phishing campaigns”.

In response Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, described China as the “elephant in the room” and said the country “engages in industrial-scale espionage, seeking to steal technology from government, universities and from industries. They repress Chinese citizens here and have sought to infiltrate our political system.”

The foreign influence registration scheme was expected to come into force last year but the new Labour government delayed its implementation.

Ministers said on Tuesday that they would work with business and academia to help them prepare for the scheme's launch, and that there would be a three-month grace period to register existing ties with foreign states.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Survey shows between 56% and 79% across seven countries in favour if Trump introduces ‘Liberation Day' levies

A large majority of western Europeans support retaliatory tariffs against the US, a survey has suggested, if Donald Trump introduces sweeping import duties for major trading partners as expected this week.

The US president appears likely to unleash a range of tariffs, varying from country to country, on Wednesday, which he has called Liberation Day. He also said last week that a 25% levy on cars shipped to the US would come into force the next day.

Many European firms are likely to be hit hard. Some, including Germany's car manufacturers and France's luxury goods firms and wine, champagne and spirits makers, rely on exports to the US for up to 20% of their income.

The EU has already pledged a “timely, robust and calibrated” response to Washington's plans, which experts predict are likely to depress output, drive up prices and fuel a trade war. Global markets and the dollar fell on Monday after Trump crushed hopes that what he calls “reciprocal tariffs” – arguing that trading partners are cheating the US – would only target countries with the largest trade imbalances.

A YouGov survey carried out in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK found that if the US tariffs went ahead, large majorities – ranging from 79% of respondents in Denmark to 56% in Italy – favoured retaliatory levies on US imports.

In both Germany, where carmakers such as Porsche, BMW and Mercedes face a significant blow to their profits, and France, where US sales of wines and spirits are worth nearly €4bn (£3.4bn) a year, 68% of respondents backed retaliation.

Respondents in all seven countries favoured a tit-for-tat response despite the damage they expected US tariffs to do to their national economies, with 75% of Germans saying they expected “a lot” or “a fair amount” of impact.

That assessment was shared by 71% of respondents in Spain, 70% in France and Italy, 62% in Sweden, 60% in the UK and half of Danes questioned in the survey, which was carried out in the second and third weeks of March.

Of the six EU countries polled, majorities of between 60% in Denmark and 76% in Spain thought US tariffs would have a significant impact on the bloc's wider economy. That was the sentiment of 74% of German and 68% of French respondents.

Trump, who was elected partly on a promise to restore US industry, has repeatedly complained that the EU has been “very unfair to us” when it comes to trade. He also said in February that the 27-nation bloc had been “formed to screw the United States”.

Those who have not already left Grindavík warned nearby eruption could be much bigger than previous 10 since 2021

The Icelandic town of Grindavík and the nearby Blue Lagoon tourist attraction have been evacuated after the area was hit by another volcanic eruption.

The eruption is the 11th since 2021, when the Reykjanes peninsula, a region south-west of Reykjavík, started its latest eruption period.

The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) said an “earthquake swarm” started at about 6.30am on the Sundhnúkur crater row in a similar place to previous eruptions, before erupting at 9.45am local time just north of the protective barrier near Grindavík.

The orange-red fissure, expelling lava and smoke, quickly spread southward and by 10am local time it had already reached through the defence walls north of Grindavík. Warning sirens went off around the town. By 12.35pm local time it was estimated to be 1,200 metres long.

A second fissure has also opened between Grindavík's protective barriers and the town.

Dramatic video footage showed magma spewing up on the Grindavík side of the defence barrier. “The fissure continues to grow, and it cannot be ruled out that it may continue to open further south,” the IMO said.

The IMO later said it had received a report of a broken hot water pipeline in northern Grindavík, which it said “confirms that significant fault movements have occurred within the town”.

Later in the afternoon it said that while volcanic activity appeared to have significantly decreased, seismic activity was “ongoing”.

The fishing town, about an hour's drive from the capital, has been largely uninhabited since 10 November 2023, when an eruption resulted in the town cracking open with fissures reaching a depth of 20 metres. Although some of the town's 3,800 residents and some of its businesses returned, most dispersed to other parts of the country after the state bought up most of its buildings because they were uninhabitable.

Regional police said they had completed the evacuation of Grindavík, with the exception of a small number of residents who refused to leave. The Blue Lagoon, one of Iceland's most popular tourist attractions, said it had successfully evacuated the thermal spa.

Runólfur Þórhallsson, Iceland's director of civil protection, urged those who had chosen not to leave the town to evacuate, saying the eruption could be much larger than recent ones because the magma tunnel is longer and a lot of magma has accumulated.

The Blue Lagoon said it was temporarily closed due to the volcanic eruption and that it would provide more information as it became available.

Earlier in the day, the IMO said the signals it was picking up were stronger than those recently on Sundhnúkur crater row, indicating that “a considerable amount of magma is currently on the move”.

“Emergency responders in Grindavík have reported that earthquakes can be felt in the town, and signs of deformation are also visible there, suggesting that fault movements could occur within the town itself,” it added.

The Icelandic tourist board said there was “no threat to the population” and that flights were operating as usual at Keflavík airport.

Snorri Valsson, a spokesperson for the tourist board, said: “The area has been closed off and is completely closed until further notice. Gas pollution might form in isolated areas around the eruption depending on wind direction and is closely monitored.”

Valsson added: “The eruption is still developing and we will publish further information when gathered.”

Although there was an initial effect on tourist numbers after the November 2023 eruption – which the tourism board in part blamed on international reporting – numbers have since slightly increased.

The number of foreign nationals coming through Keflavík airport rose by 2% to 2,261,391 in 2023-24 compared with the same period the year before, according to Statistics Iceland. The 383,963 overnight hotel stays recorded in November 2024 were also up compared with the number in November 2023.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

President backs ‘commonsense reforms' to stop soaring resale prices as singer urges Congress to pass legislation

Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday that aimed to protect fans by cracking down on “exploitative ticket scalping” and introduced “commonsense reforms” to the way live entertainment events are priced.

Flanked by a bespangled Kid Rock in the Oval Office, the president signed what he called a “very serious” order designed to protect fans from “having to pay crazy prices” for tickets.

“Anyone who's bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years – no matter what your politics are – knows that it's a conundrum,” Kid Rock, wearing sunglasses and a white fedora, said, lamenting the frustration of purchasing a ticket online after bots scoop up the tickets and then “jack up” the price. “This is a great first step.”

Targeting “unscrupulous middle men who impose egregious fees”, the order directs the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to ensure that scalpers reselling tickets at a higher price than their face value are operating in full compliance with the Internal Revenue Service rules, according to a White House fact sheet.

A 2023 law requires e-commerce platforms to report to the IRS if sellers' proceeds from ticket sales exceed $600. Excessive proceeds will generate a tax form that may result in additional taxes for the seller. The rule change stems from legislation in the early months of the Biden administration that was phased in to take effect in 2023.

It also orders the Federal Trade Commission to work with the attorney general to ensure that competition laws are appropriately enforced and to ensure “price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process”.

“Ticket scalpers use bots and other unfair means to acquire large quantities of face-value tickets, then re-sell them at an enormous markup on the secondary market, price-gouging consumers and depriving fans of the opportunity to see their favorite artists without incurring extraordinary expenses,” the fact sheet said, citing reports that some American consumers have paid as much as “70 times the face value of a ticket price to obtain a ticket”.

“I didn't know too much about it, but I checked it out, and this is a big problem,” Trump said during the signing.

The issue has been bubbling for years, after several high-profile controversies that have forced fans to pay soaring prices for the chance to see their favorite artists. Perhaps most famously was the debacle surrounding Taylor Swift's Eras tour sale, which prompted a Senate hearing on the matter and an antitrust probe by the Biden administration.

The justice department under Biden eventually sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, accusing the concert promotion and live ticketing giant of operating an “illegal monopoly” that thwarts competition in markets across and drives up the cost of tickets.

In the Oval Office on Monday, Kid Rock – wearing a bright red, sparkly rhinestone-studded suit emblazoned with images of the American flag, eagles and stars – noted the cross-partisan appeal of tackling this problem and said Ticketmaster was “on board” with the change.

“I want the fans to have fair ticket prices,” he said. “There's plenty of money to go around. Nobody's going to lose here.”

He also urged Congress to pass legislation capping the price of resale tickets, quickly qualifying that he was a “capitalist”. The musician then quipped that he was “overpaid” and would rather be “a hero to working-class people” by offering lower-priced tickets to his fans: “I can't control that right now.”

In a statement, Live Nation said it supported the order and “any meaningful resale reforms”, including strengthening enforcement of the 2016 Bots Act, which outlaws the use of bots to purchase tickets and resell them at inflated prices, and caps on resale prices.

“Scalpers and bots prevent fans from getting tickets at the prices artists set, and we thank President Trump for taking them head-on,” it said.

During the signing ceremony, Trump took a range of questions, many from friendly news outlets, including one from a reporter who asked if the president would ever wear Kid Rock's red jacket with the American flag motif. (Trump said he was “not sure” he would.) After the lengthy session, Trump realized he hadn't signed the order yet and quickly scrawled his name in black pen.

“You better do well with this,” Trump told Kid Rock, handing him the order. The musician laughed, hoisted up the Sharpie-signed order and declared: “Make America Fun Again.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Senior figures also reject claim verdict against Le Pen on embezzlement charges was ‘political and partisan'

French ministers have condemned threats against the judges who convicted the far-right leader Marine Le Pen and banned her from public office for five years as the chief judge was placed under police protection after receiving death threats.

France's prime minister, François Bayrou, told the Assemblée nationale the trial judges had his “unconditional support” after they found Le Pen guilty of embezzlement charges, threatening her 2027 presidential run and throwing France into political chaos.

Threats and insults against the president of the court, Bénédicte de Perthuis, one of three trial judges, began on social media almost immediately after the verdict was announced on Monday. Posts giving the judges' full names, photographs and a part of de Perthuis' address were condemned by French legal bodies.

Rémy Heitz, the public prosecutor at the court of cassation, France's highest court, said the “highly personalised” attacks were “unacceptable” and that any threats may be subject to criminal prosecution.

“Justice is not political; this decision is not a political decision but a legal one rendered by three independent, impartial judges, in accordance with the law,” Heitz said.

The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said such threats were unacceptable: “In a democracy, it is unacceptable for people to physically threaten judges. When we call for the rule of law it includes all free and independent magistrates in this country.” He called on far-right MPs to support the threatened magistrates.

Darmanin said he hoped that if Le Pen appealed against her conviction – as she has said she will – a new trial “can be organised within as reasonable a timeframe as possible”, but added it was up to the courts to fix a date.

The French court of appeal said on Tuesday that it should be able to provide a decision in summer 2026.

Jordan Bardella, 29, the RN president, also called on supporters not to threaten or insult the judges. “This is unacceptable and we condemn it,” he said.

Hours after the verdict, RN officials went on the offensive, giving interviews, press conferences, planning a leafleting campaign and setting up a petition that crashed the party's website.

The RN is reported to be planning a major rally in support of Le Pen in Paris either this weekend on the next and is calling for nationwide demonstrations against  the court's decision to ban her from public office for five years, seemingly wrecking her hopes of succeeding Emmanuel Macron as president .

Le Pen and 24 others from RN, including party officials, employees, MEPs and assistants, were convicted of embezzling millions in European parliament funds as part of a fake jobs scam.

The trial last November heard how the party took money for EU parliamentary assistants but spent it on paying staff in France. None of the accused benefited personally from the embezzlement and all denied the charges.

Le Pen, 56, was also given a four-year prison term, two years suspended and two to be served wearing an electronic bracelet. The sentence will be postponed until the appeal process is exhausted, but the five-year ban on standing for public office takes immediate effect.

Le Pen went on TV to denounce what she said was the court's “political decision” and vowed to “pursue all legal avenues” to be able to stand in 2027. An appeal by Le Pen will lead to a new trial that she hopes will overturn the conviction and public office ban in time to campaign for the presidency.

Bardella said French people “must be outraged” after what he called a “disproportionate, political and partisan” judgment that would rob them of a voice in the election.

He said the ban would deprive millions of French voters of their democratic right to put Le Pen in the Elysée Palace and called for “peaceful, democratic protests” across France as part of a “people's mobilisation”.

Bardella,who is seen as the RN's plan B if Le Pen fails, said he refused to consider stepping into her shoes as a presidential candidate  and pledged his loyalty to her.

“Marine Le Pen has given me everything in politics,” he said. “The least I can do is to fight with her to the end. We work together, hand in hand and in total confidence.

“I have total loyalty. Those who think they have killed off the RN and put us out of the game will not succeed.

“If you are in politics, you are not above the law, but neither are you below it.”

Bardella added that he hoped the appeal court hearing could be held in time to “correct the error” of the lower court so that Le Pen could stand in 2027, and said RN voters were being ignored as “second-class” citizens.

“We are not fashos, racists or far right. We are reasonable people who are patriotic, who love our country and we are fighting for the French people. We are fighting to get into power, not to remain in opposition.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Group's chief executive condemns president's ‘dangerous' agenda and says funding cuts will cause ‘devastation'

The reproductive health provider Planned Parenthood said the Trump administration would cut federal family planning funding as of Tuesday, affecting birth control, cancer screenings and other services for low-income people.

Planned Parenthood said that nine of its affiliates received notice that funding would be withheld under a program known as Title X, which has supported healthcare services for the poor since 1970.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) planned an immediate freeze of $27.5m in family planning grants for groups including Planned Parenthood.

Planned Parenthood says more than 300 health centers are in the Title X network and Title X-funded centers received more than 1.5m visits in 2023. It did not say how much funding would be halted by the Trump administration.

The White House and HHS did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. An HHS spokesperson said last week the department was reviewing grant recipients to ensure compliance with Donald Trump's executive orders.

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, predicted that cancers would go undetected, access to birth control would be severely reduced, and sexually transmitted infections would increase as a result.

“President Trump and Elon Musk are pushing their dangerous political agenda, stripping health care access from people nationwide, and not giving a second thought to the devastation they will cause,” McGill Johnson said in a statement.

Trump has named Musk, the billionaire who helped the president get elected, to head up an initiative targeting government agencies for spending cuts.

Conservatives have long sought to defund Planned Parenthood because it also provides abortions. However, US government funding for nearly all abortions has been banned since 1977.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Gérald Darmanin stresses court timelines are outside government control as PM admits he has questions over immediate public office bans

A regular session of questions to the government is under way in Paris, and – you guessed it – it's off to a rocky start.

It opens with a question by a National Rally lawmaker, Jean-Philippe Tanguy, on the court's decision against Marine Le Pen, effectively banning her from the 2027 presidential race, for embezzlement of public funds.

He repeated earlier attack lines expressed by Le Pen (11.58), attacking “tyrant judges” and saying the party “will not let you steal the presidential election,” asking “what is Marine Le Pen accused of, it not of being able to defeat this system?”

Responding on behalf of the government, justice minister Gérald Darmanin said that Le Pen could appeal against the ruling if she disagrees with it, and said he “personally hoped” that it would be organised “within the most reasonable time possible,” although he stressed that the court is independent of the government in deciding its timelines.

Le Pen's lawyer already confirmed plans to bring an appeal. But under the French laws, it would not result in an interim suspension the application of the immediate public office ban, risking prolonged uncertainty about her eligibility to stand in the 2027 race until the appeal is decided.

He also called Tanguy out for not condemning attacks on and threats against the independent judiciary in the aftermath of yesterday's decision.

Speaking for the Socialist Party, its parliamentary group president Boris Vallaud criticised those attacking the decision by saying that “to question a court decision is to breach the basic principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law.”

He said “all French women and all French people are equal before the law,” and one should only look at the “damning” facts of the case, as he warned that to juxtapose the courts with the will of the people would be “a dead road” undermining democracy.

He asked prime minister François Bayrou to express “unconditional support” for judges, despite “attacks against our rule of law made from the Kremlin to the White House by the friends of Le Pen.”

In response, Bayrou said it would not be right for a government official to ever criticise a court decision as he declared his “unconditional, unmeasured” support for the independent judiciary.

He also stresses that Le Pen can appeal against the decision.

But in comments that are likely to cause further controversy, he adds that, speaking as a private citizen, he has some questions about the unappealable nature of the immediate public office ban.

And on that lighter note, that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

The far-right National Rally called a public, erm, rally “in support of Marine Le Pen” in Paris on Sunday, as part of its broader plans for “peaceful mobilisation” in protest at yesterday's court decision effectively banning Le Pen from the 2027 presidential race as part of a conviction over embezzlement of public funds.

Éric Ciotti, leader of the Union of the Right for the Republic, has announced plans to bring forward a proposal to abolish the immediate effect of the public office ban, regardless of the appeal, calling it a “political death sentence.”

He said the proposal will be tabled in June.

Prime minister François Bayrou's comments that he has “questions” about the immediate application of the public office ban, which is a decision of far-reaching consequences that do not get suspended on appeal, are likely to cause a stir.

But he appeared to make a rather nuanced argument, clearly differentiating between him passing judgment on the specific ruling – which he said would not be appropriate for a government official – and talking in broader, theoretical, terms about a possible parliamentary “reflection” on the law that led to the decision.

He appeared to say it was the lawmakers' job to reform the rules on public office bans if they wished to – as suggested by Éric Ciotti – instead of criticising the judges who framed their verdict based on the existing law.

He said that, given the separation of powers, “the process is very simple” as a bill would then be examined by both chambers, and “it is parliament that will decide whether or not it is appropriate to change the wording of the law” on which the decision was based.

German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said on Tuesday that the United States should not to be misled by any “stalling tactics” of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Reuters reported.

“At the upcoming meeting of Nato foreign ministers, we will make it clear to the American side that we should not engage with Putin's stalling tactics,” she said in a statement after arriving in Kyiv for a visit.

“There will only be real and lasting peace when the Russian president realises that he cannot win this war, that his destruction is not successful,” she said at a news conference on Tuesday, adding that Ukraine had to “conduct the peace negotiations from a position of strength”.

The Icelandic town of Grindavík and the nearby tourist attraction the Blue Lagoon have been evacuated after the area was hit by another volcanic eruption.

The eruption is the 11th since 2021, when the Reykjanes peninsula, a region south-west of Reykjavík, started its new eruption period.

The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) said an “earthquake swarm” started at about 6.30am on the Sundhnúkur crater row in a similar place to previous eruptions, before erupting at 9.45am local time just north of the protective barrier near Grindavík.

The orange-red fissure, expelling lava and smoke, quickly spread southward and by 10am local time it had already reached through the defence walls north of Grindavík. Warning sirens went off around the town. By 10.30am local time it was estimated to be 700 metres long.

The Icelandic tourist board said there was “no threat to the population” and that flights were operating as usual at Keflavík airport.

Spain is also looking to increase its defence spending soon, with defence minister Margarita Robles declaring it would reach 2% GDP “well before” the previously declared target of 2029.

Spain currently has the lowest defence spending as a percentage of GDP among Nato members at just 1.28%, behind Belgium (1.3%), Canada (1.37%) and Portugal (1.55%).

Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has been touring Europe in recent weeks, urging allies to step up, partially in response to repeated complaints from US president Donald Trump.

Last week, Rutte said in a speech in Warsaw that Spain was now expecting to meet the alliance's 2% target by the summer. This prompted the Spanish government to tell Rutte it would do its best to get closer to the target by that time, a government source told Reuters.

“It's not so much a problem of deadlines, but I believe that well in advance, before 2029, we will meet our obligations … We are working on it in a serious and rigorous manner,” Robles said on the sidelines of an event in Lisbon.

Finland will follow Poland and the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in planning to withdraw from the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel landmines, the country's prime minister Petteri Orpo said.

The government said that the change was necessary because of the long-term threat that Russia poses to Europe.

Orpo said that while there was no “immediate” military threat, “withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention will give us the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way,” or – to put in plain English – to stockpile and potentially use landmines on Finland's 1,340 km long border with Russia.

The decision was taken after some “preparatory work” by Finnish officials, who concluded that mines “are well-suited for Finland's national defence,” as they are “are technically simple and are therefore well suited for training and use in a conscription system,” the government said.

It added that landmines “can also be produced quickly and in large quantities in Finland.”

The note stressed that the Finnish forces would not deploy mines “in normal conditions,” and the country “remained committed to its international obligations concerning the responsible use of mines,” but it was part of a broader preparation for “what if”.

A formal proposal to withdraw from the convention will be prepared in the near future, and the exit will take legal effect six months after the notice is made to the UN secretary general.

Separately, Orpo said the government plans to increase its defence spending to at least 3% GDP by 2029, up from estimated 2.41% last year and 1.4% in 2021, the last full year before Russia's aggression on Ukraine.

Back to Strasbourg, EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas spoke about Russia's war crimes in Ukraine, saying “the evidence is overwhelming” to prove “heinous” crimes committed.

She said:

“From photos to phone records and decoded call signs used by commanders of Russian radio channels, there is no denying it. We know exactly who the perpetrators are. 

With the technology we have at our fingertips today, impunity for war crimes is, frankly, impossible, so long as we put the work in [investigating] it. And that is what we must do, because the number of possible crimes committed in this war is simply beyond belief.”

Kallas particularly condemned “the forcible transfer and deportation of Ukrainian children,” calling it “one of the gravest crimes committed, an extreme violation of human rights.”

She said that by continuing aggression against Ukraine, “Russia is destroying Ukraine's present while denying the countries its future.”

The EU's foreign policy chief said that around 170,000 criminal cases have been opened by the Ukrainian authorities, and are being supported by the EU.

“When this war is over, and one day it will be, recovery will come not from only a reconstruction of the buildings in Bucha or Borodyanka or Bakhmut … it will also come in the pursuit of justice and accountability for the heinous crimes committed by Russia, because only justice will give every Ukrainian family the peace of mind they need to move on and rebuild their lives,” she said.

A new Toluna Harris Interactive poll for RTL, published today, showed that party president Jordan Bardella would come top in the first round of the presidential election if he was picked as the National Rally's candidate instead of Le Pen, with 35-36% of votes.

Former centre-right prime minister Édouard Philippe came second with 25% of the declared support, with the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon third at 13%.

In various scenarios polled, about 90% of Le Pen and the National Rally's voters would transfer his support to Bardella.

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen is back in her usual fiercely campaigning mode this morning, as she has just declared the National Rally would “not let the French people have the presidential election stolen from them” after yesterday's court verdict effectively banning her from the 2027 race.

In comments reported by the French media, she told a group meeting opened to pressthis morning that she wanted to “defend the French people, who have the right to vote for whomever they wish.”

Le Pen compared the verdict against her to “a nuclear bomb” dropped on her “by the system,” arguing that “if they use such a powerful weapon against us, it is because we are on the verge of winning the elections.”

“We will not let this happen,” she added.

Le Pen also blamed the courts for “interfering” with the electoral process, saying it undermined France's ability to defend democracy globally.

But she pointedly criticised reported threats to judges, saying they were “scandalous” and “unacceptable.”

Her comments come hours after the National Rally's president – and a potential future presidential candidate – Jordan Bardella announced a “peaceful mobilisation” to express support for Le Pen, with protests and leafleting campaigns planned for this weekend.

Bardella claimed that an online campaign, started last night, had already gathered “hundreds of thousands” of signatures in support, with more campaigning expected over the coming days.

Groups say president's demands set out in executive order threaten to ‘silence potentially millions of Americans'

Donald Trump's executive order seeking to overhaul the nation's elections faced its first legal challenges on Monday as the Democratic National Committee and a pair of non-profits filed two separate lawsuits calling it unconstitutional.

The Campaign Legal Center and the State Democracy Defenders Fund brought the first lawsuit on Monday afternoon. The DNC, the Democratic Governors Association, and Senate and House Democratic leaders followed soon after with a complaint of their own.

Both lawsuits filed in the US district court for the District of Columbia ask the court to block Trump's order and declare it illegal.

“The president's executive order is an unlawful action that threatens to uproot our tried-and-tested election systems and silence potentially millions of Americans,” said Danielle Lang, senior director of voting rights at the DC-based Campaign Legal Center.

“It is simply not within the president's authority to set election rules by executive decree, especially when they would restrict access to voting in this way.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The legal challenges had been expected after election lawyers warned some of Trump's demands in the order, including a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration and new ballot deadline rules, may violate the US constitution.

The order also asserts power that legal experts say the president doesn't have over an independent agency. That agency, the US Election Assistance Commission, sets voluntary voting system guidelines and maintains the federal voter registration form.

The suits come as Congress is considering codifying a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration into law, and as Trump has promised more actions related to elections in the coming weeks.

Both the legal challenges draw attention to the constitution's “elections clause”, which says states – not the president – get to decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run. That section of the constitution also gives Congress the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office, but it does not mention any presidential authority over election administration.

“The constitution is clear: states set their own rules of the road when it comes to elections, and only Congress has the power to override these laws with respect to federal elections,” said Lang, calling the executive order an “unconstitutional executive overreach”.

The lawsuits also argue the president's order could disenfranchise voters. The non-profits' lawsuit names three voter advocacy organizations as plaintiffs that they allege are harmed by Trump's executive order: the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Secure Families Initiative and the Arizona Students' Association.

The DNC's lawsuit highlights the role of the government's controversial cost-cutting arm, the so-called “department of government efficiency”.

It alleges the order's data-sharing requirements, including instructing Doge to cross-reference federal data with state voter lists, violate Democrats' privacy rights and increase the risk that they will be harassed “based on false suspicions that they are not qualified to vote”.

“This executive order is an unconstitutional power grab from Donald Trump that attacks vote by mail, gives Doge sensitive personal information and makes it harder for states to run their own free and fair elections,” reads a statement from the plaintiffs.

Trump, one of the top spreaders of election falsehoods, has argued this executive order will secure the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens. Multiple studies and investigations in individual states have shown that noncitizens casting ballots in federal elections, already a felony, is exceedingly rare.

Monday's lawsuits against Trump's elections order could be followed by more challenges. Other voting rights advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have said they are considering legal action. Several Democratic state attorneys general have said they are looking closely at the order and suspect it is illegal.

Meanwhile, Trump's order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls.

If courts determine the order can stand, the changes Trump wants are likely to cause some headaches for both election administrators and voters. State election officials, who already have lost some federal cybersecurity assistance, would have to spend time and money to comply with the order, including potentially buying new voting systems and educating voters of the rules.

The proof-of-citizenship requirement also could cause confusion or voter disenfranchisement because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. In Kansas, which had a proof-of-citizenship requirement for three years before it was overturned, the state's own expert estimated that almost all the roughly 30,000 people who were prevented from registering to vote during the time it was in effect were US citizens who had been eligible.

Monday's lawsuits are the latest of numerous efforts to fight the flurry of executive actions Trump has taken during the first months of his second term. Federal judges have partially or fully blocked many of them, including efforts to restrict birthright citizenship, ban transgender people from military service and curb diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives among federal contractors and grant recipients.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Northern Ontario is seeing a ‘shorter window' for ice roads that deliver vital supplies to remote First Nations

At first there was no answer on the satellite phone. But on the third call, Donald Meeseetawageesic heard his sister's voice. “We need somebody to come and tow us out,” he told her.

It was a warmer-than-normal night in early March and Meeseetawageesic, the elected band councillor for Eabametoong First Nation, was stranded in a 4x4 truck on the dark winter road leading to his community. The tyres were stuck in the deep snow and the temperature outside was below freezing. Help was about 60km (37 miles) away.

Made entirely of snow and ice, the winter road forms a vital route connecting Eabametoong in northern Ontario to cities farther south. It has 24 snow bridges spanning creeks, and a daunting 5.5-km crossing over a frozen lake. But warmer winters are making the route unpredictable: the snow bridges are weakening and the lake ice is thinning.

In past decades, temperatures have been cold enough in March for a firm road surface. But this year, a mild winter has softened the snowy road, and as Meeseetawageesic and his brother drove along the road, their truck got stuck in the snow.

More than 50 Indigenous communities – with a total population of 56,000 people – depend on about 6,000km of winter roads.

With no all-season roads connecting them to the nearest cities, small planes are the communities' only lifeline for most of the year. But in winter, lakes and rivers freeze, allowing the construction of a vast network of ice roads.

Indigenous communities in Canada's north rely on such routes to truck in supplies such as lumber for housing, fuel, bulk food and bottled water, which are too bulky and expensive to fly in by plane. For Eabametoong, construction materials are crucial as the community is facing a housing crisis, with up to 14 people living in a single home.

Last year was the hottest year since record-keeping began, bringing deadly wildfires, heatwaves, floods and rising sea levels. In Canada's north, rising temperatures are threatening a way of life, as the winter road season grows shorter every year. Last year, chiefs declared a state of emergency after the roads failed to freeze on time. This March, rain temporarily closed the winter road to Eabametoong and four other communities.

“We're getting a shorter window for sure,” said Meeseetawageesic, who oversees housing in Eabametoong. Trucks used to bring materials by winter road in January, but warm temperatures are forcing them to wait until March; the winter road typically melts in April.

While they waited on the winter road, Meeseetawageesic and his brother chopped down wood and built a fire. Hours passed, and then suddenly headlights lit up the road. A passing trucker offered to take them toward Eabametoong. He drove them over the bumpy road until they encountered the rescue party – Meeseetawageesic's sister and her friends in two trucks. They drove the brothers the rest of the way, arriving home at 4am.

****

Days later, a blizzard was blowing through Eabametoong. But inside Isabel Boyce's home, a wood stove kept things toasty.

Boyce sat on her living room couch. Across the room lay a mattress on the floor, where a baby slept soundly as other children ran around. Seven people live in the two-bedroom home.

“It's my own family, so I don't consider myself overcrowded,” Boyce said, explaining that other homes have several families under one roof. Homes are in short supply – and pervasive mould is eating away at the housing stock, including Boyce's previous home. “We had to move out because it was getting all mouldy [and] rotting.”

People in First Nations communities are four times more likely to live in crowded housing and six times more likely to live in housing in need of major repairs than non-Indigenous people, according to Canada's 2021 census. To close the housing gap, more than 55,000 units need to be built, a report by the Assembly of First Nations found.

Canada's historical policies reduced the land base of Indigenous communities to only 0.2% of their original territories, making it nearly impossible to generate revenue from their lands. They rely heavily on federal transfer payments, and the government holds the purse strings for basic infrastructure, including water treatment plants, schools and housing.

Now, more funding is needed – not only for housing materials but also to safely and reliably transport them into Eabametoong. “They should build an all-season road,” Boyce said. “It would benefit the community in the future.”

Meeseetawageesic sits in his elderly mother's living room, speaking to her in Ojibwe. “She has noticed a change on the winter roads. The ice is not freezing as it should. January and February are supposed to be our coldest months, but it's not as cold as it was before,” he said, translating her words.

After separating from his wife, he now lives in his mother's home. Although he makes decisions about housing for the community of about 1,600 people, there is nowhere else for him to live. The housing committee has received 180 housing applications from families and individuals.

The winter roads crisis is putting pressure on Eabametoong in other ways, too.

In January 2024, the community lost its only school to a fire. There was no functioning fire truck, and although new fire trucks were scheduled to arrive, warm temperatures prevented them from being transported by winter road. The community built a temporary school for the children, who missed months of education.

When the winter road is unavailable for hauling essential supplies, the community must bring them in by air – at a much higher cost.

Like other remote First Nations, Eabametoong relies on diesel fuel that used to be trucked over the winter road. “We fly all the fuel in now, and probably for the last four years, five years, because of the ice conditions,” said the Eabametoong chief, Solomon Atlookan.

The costs of flying fuel into remote First Nations are soaring. Ontario First Nations collectively move about 20m litres of fuel each year by winter road, according to Indigenous Services Canada emails obtained through public records request. “It costs approximately $0.69/litre more to mobilise by air – potentially resulting in a pressure of $13.8m [per year in Ontario] should winter roads not be available,” an ISC employee wrote in one email. The records show that ISC is aware that long-term planning is needed to address fuel supply issues “due to winter roads trending to open later in the year”.

Ultimately, many First Nations will need all-season roads. But they cannot afford to build the roads themselves. “‘Emergency' doesn't even feel strong enough [to describe the situation],” said the ISC minister, Patty Hajdu. “It's so urgent that we do more together to figure out what this next stage of living with climate change looks like for, in particular, remote communities.”

Climate adaptation would look different for each community, Hadju said: some First Nations wanted permanent roads while others were contemplating using airships to bring in heavy loads. The cost of building roads would probably be covered by cost-sharing between different levels of government, and, she said, the federal government was ready to commit funding “in theory”.

“For each community, there are many steps to get the federal government's commitment on any particular cost-shared project. Obviously, we would want to make sure that we're working in partnership with the province, in partnership with the First Nations,” Hajdu said.

Eabametoong has completed a feasibility study for an all-season road. Chief Atlookan is concerned about the impacts on the community – he knows the road could bring tourism, which could threaten traditional ways of life. But climate change and higher costs are forcing him to seriously consider an all-season road. “We need to begin working on it now,” he said.

First Nations are not the only communities anticipating the end of winter roads.

Pickle Lake, the most northern town in Ontario accessible by all-season road, is a hub for truckers to refuel before driving north on the winter roads to First Nations. At the bulk fuel supplier Morgan Fuels, semi-truck drivers streamed through the doors in search of coffee and a bathroom.

Andy Rae was charging his radio before driving a truck full of groceries to Wunnumin First Nation. He pointed to a spot on a map where his truck slid off the winter road and smashed through a frozen creek last year. “We didn't know the creek was there. Nobody did. I found it,” he joked.

Another time, Rae drove a heavy truck across a lake with dangerously thin ice that popped and cracked under his wheels. “They didn't tell me how thick the lake was until after,” he said. Repeating advice he had received from an older trucker, he said: “As long as you're popping and cracking, you're good. If it's dead silent, you're going through.”

Behind the front desk sat the site supervisor, Brent Beever, who has worked at Morgan Fuels since the 1980s and watched climate change wreak havoc on the winter roads. “With the warming conditions, that's your biggest challenge,” he said.

Beever explained that temperatures used to drop well below freezing at this time of year, but now he sees rain and above-freezing temperatures in February and March. Warmer conditions mean rougher roads, collapsing snow bridges, and more truck maintenance. “It makes it hard on equipment going in there, and it's challenging for the drivers to get into the communities,” he said.

“I guess that's why they're more and more working toward all-season roads. How long that will be, I don't know. It'll be probably a few years.”

Speakers are available to the media except for Harris. “No interviews” was listed next to her biography.

Founded by Australian property mogul John McGrath, the chief executive officer of the ASX-listed McGrath Estate Agents, the event will be held on Queensland's Gold Coast in late May.

In a statement, the organisers said Harris' participation in the conference would be her first speaking engagement in Australia.

Promotional material for the event described Harris as “a trailblazer through her entire career, committed in her vision for ensuring all Americans can climb the ladder of economic opportunity, including bringing down the cost of living and making housing more affordable”.

She will join a “selection of esteemed international speakers and Australia's leading real estate professionals set to impart their expertise, industry insights, and strategies for success in an ever evolving property sector”, according to organisers.

Organisers would not disclose how much the speakers would be paid.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Veteran lauded for helping preserve history and legacy as well as vital role played during second world war

The Bletchley Park code breaker Charlotte “Betty” Webb has died at the age of 101, the Women's Royal Army Corps Association (WRACA) has confirmed.

Arriving at Bletchley from the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) aged just 18, Webb spent four years during the second world war at the code-breaking centre working in various roles.

Webb, from Wythall in Worcestershire, intercepted German police messages, which revealed the beginning of the Holocaust, and paraphrased decoded Japanese messages for the Pentagon in the US.

Confirming her death, the WRACA said on Facebook: “Betty inspired women in the army for decades and we will continue to take pride in her service during WWII and beyond, and as a champion of female veterans.

Speaking to the Guardian in 2018, Webb admitted she was unaware of the significance behind the complex codes she was breaking.

“The messages were in groups of five letters or figures in morse code – nothing was clear at all. Some dates appeared. It was total gibberish, but you had to register everything, so senior people could call on a date or message at any time. We knew very little of what was going on. We really were in the dark.”

Webb was appointed MBE in 2015 and Knight of the Légion d'honneur in 2021, a prestigious order of merit awarded for both military and civil service in France.

She was president of the WRACA Birmingham branch.

In a statement, Bletchley Park said her contributions to the estate's work during the second world war and to ensuring its legacy, would never be forgotten.

They said: “Betty was not only a member of the incredible team at Bletchley Park during world war two, but she also dedicated much of her life to raising the profile of Bletchley Park in more recent years.

“Her tireless efforts in bringing the history of Bletchley Park to a wider audience, through sharing the stories of those who worked here, helped ensure that the vital role of Bletchley Park during world war two and its impact on the conflict was recognised.

“Betty's passion for preserving the history and legacy of Bletchley Park has undoubtedly inspired many people to engage with the story and visit the site. Betty's impact at Bletchley Park will be remembered for many years to come.”

Tess Dunlop, historian and broadcaster, said she was with Webb on her final day. Posting on X, Dunlop said: “Betty was the very best. I was lucky enough to hold her hand yesterday as she gently glided to another place. She is one of the most remarkable woman I have ever known.”

A German speaker, Webb's job was taking decoded messages and reordering the unencrypted wording to be sent to allied commanders, so that if intercepted by the enemy, they would not discover their transmissions were being deciphered.

She was 18 and studying at domestic science college near Shrewsbury in Shropshire when she and several others on her course decided to serve.

She completed her basic training in Wrexham at the Royal Welch Fusiliers' barracks before being taken to London for an interview and then immediately to Bletchley Park.

Webb never told anyone about her work and it remained a secret until 1975. She was never able to tell her parents as they had already died.

From then, she gave talks to schools and other organisations and wrote a book about her experiences.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

President promises he will be ‘very kind' but critics warn his strategy risks triggering chain reaction and global trade war

As Donald Trump prepared to unveil a swathe of reciprocal tariffs, global markets braced and some Republican senators voiced their opposition to a strategy that critics warn risks a global trade war, provoking retaliation by major trading partners such as China, Canada and the European Union.

The US president said on Monday he would be “very kind” to trading partners when he unveils further tariffs this week, potentially as early as Tuesday night.

The Republican billionaire insists that reciprocal action is needed because the world's biggest economy has been “ripped off by every country in the world”, promising “Liberation Day” for the US.

He could also unveil more sector-specific levies.

Asked for details, he told reporters on Monday: “You're going to see in two days, which is maybe tomorrow night or probably Wednesday.”

But he added: “We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind.”

Some Republican senators spoke out against Trump's tariffs on Canada and are considering signing on their support for a resolution blocking them, CNN reported. Senator Susan Collins warned that tariffs on Canada would be particularly harmful to Maine and that she intended to vote for a resolution aimed at blocking tariffs against Canadian goods.

Republican Senator Thom Tillis also said he was considering backing the resolution, adding: “We need to fight battles with our foes first and then try to figure out any inequalities with our friends second.”

Already, China, South Korea and Japan agreed on Sunday to strengthen free trade between themselves, ahead of Trump's expected tariff announcement.

But Trump said on Monday he was not worried that his action would push allies toward Beijing, adding that a deal on TikTok could also be tied to China tariffs.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the goal on Wednesday would be to announce “country-based tariffs”, although Trump remained committed to imposing separate sector-specific charges.

The uncertainty has jolted markets, with key European and Asian indexes closing lower, although the Dow and broad-based S&P 500 eked out gains.

Market nervousness intensified after Trump said on Sunday his tariffs would include “all countries”.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that advisers have considered imposing global tariffs of up to 20%, to hit almost all US trading partners. Trump has remained vague, saying his tariffs would be “far more generous” than ones already levied against US products.

Trump's fixation on tariffs is fanning US recession fears. Goldman Sachs analysts raised their 12-month recession probability from 20% to 35%.

This reflects a “lower growth forecast, falling confidence and statements from White House officials indicating willingness to tolerate economic pain”. Goldman Sachs also lifted its forecast for underlying inflation at the end of 2025.

China and Canada have imposed counter-tariffs on US goods, while the EU unveiled its own measures to start mid-April. Other countermeasures could come after Wednesday.

For now, the IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, said at a Reuters event on Monday that US tariffs were causing anxiety, although their global economic impact should not be dramatic.

Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics said to “expect the unexpected”, anticipating that Trump would “take aim at some of the largest offenders”.

Besides reciprocal country tariffs, Trump could unveil additional sector-specific levies on the likes of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He earlier announced car tariffs to take effect on Thursday.

Economists have expected the upcoming salvo could target the 15% of partners that have persistent trade imbalances with the US, a group that the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has dubbed a “Dirty 15”.

The US has some of its biggest goods deficits with China, the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada and India.

US trade partners are rushing to minimise their exposure, with reports suggesting India may lower some duties.

The European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday that Europe should move towards economic independence, telling France Inter radio that Europe faces an “existential moment”.

Separately, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke with Trump on “productive negotiations” towards a UK-US trade deal, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the EU would respond firmly to Trump but was open to compromise.

It was “entirely possible” for fresh tariffs to be swiftly reduced or put on hold, said Greta Peisch, a partner at law firm Wiley Rein.

In February, Washington paused steep levies on Mexican and Canadian imports for a month as the North American neighbours pursued negotiations.

Queenslander ordered to pay $350,000 plus interest and costs as judge finds his video about American gamer Billy Mitchell was ‘recklessly' based on false claim

A professional YouTuber in Queensland has been ordered to pay $350,000 plus interest and costs to the former world record score holder for Donkey Kong, after the Brisbane district court found the YouTuber had defamed him “recklessly” with false claims of a link between a lawsuit and another YouTuber's suicide.

William “Billy” Mitchell, an American gamer who had held world records in Donkey Kong and Pac-Man going back to 1982, as recognised by the Guinness World Records and the video game database Twin Galaxies, brought the case against Karl Jobst, seeking $400,000 in general damages and $50,000 in aggravated damages.

Jobst, who makes videos about “speed running” (finishing games as fast as possible), as well as gaming records and cheating in games, made a number of allegations against Mitchell in a 2021 YouTube video. He accused Mitchell of cheating, and “pursuing unmeritorious litigation” against others who had also accused him of cheating, the court judgment stated.

Sign up for Guardian Australia's breaking news email

The court heard Mitchell was accused in 2017 of cheating in his Donkey Kong world records by using emulation software instead of original arcade hardware. Twin Galaxies investigated the allegation, and subsequently removed Mitchell's scores and banned him from participating in its competitions.

The Guinness World Records disqualified Mitchell as a holder of all his records – in both Donkey Kong and Pac-Man – after the Twin Galaxies decision.

The judgment stated that Jobst's 2021 video also linked the December 2020 suicide of another YouTuber, Apollo Legend, to “stress arising from [his] settlement” with Mitchell, and wrongly asserted that Apollo Legend had to pay Mitchell “a large sum of money”.

The judgment noted multiple versions of the video were published, with the allegations removed or addressed, before Jobst issued a retraction video in July 2021, two months after the original. The first video was viewed by more than 500,000 people, including 200,000 in Australia, the court heard.

Judge Ken Barlow found Jobst had made five defamatory imputations about Mitchell, including that Mitchell had required Apollo Legend pay him a large sum of money and thus implying he “in essence, hounded Apollo Legend to death”.

Barlow found this was “based on a fallacy” – and that Jobst, in not making further inquiries before publishing the video, had been “recklessly indifferent” to if it was true.

Jobst denied the imputations had been made in the video. He argued Mitchell had a pre-existing bad reputation because he had been previously exposed as a cheat, the court heard.

Barlow found Mitchell did have an existing reputation as a cheat and for suing people who alleged he was a cheat, and found that Mitchell had expressed joy when he believed – incorrectly – on an earlier occasion that Apollo Legend may have died. But Barlow found Jobst had severely damaged Mitchell's reputation and caused distress.

He described Jobst as having a “self-aggrandising and perhaps self-protective tendency not to admit error and not to back down once he has taken a stance”.

Barlow framed Jobst's actions as a “crusade” against Mitchell, stating that he was trying to “[show] his audience that he is the knight who slew the Mitchell dragon”.

The judgment summary noted that the court was not called on to decide, and did not decide, if Mitchell had cheated in his world record scores.

The court awarded Mitchell $300,000 in damages for non-economic loss, and an additional $50,000 in aggravated damages due to Jobst's publishing the video twice, mocking Mitchell's complaint about it, failing to apologise and withdraw the allegations, and his “clear malice” towards Mitchell.

Jobst was ordered to pay more than $40,000 in interest on the damages from the date of publication, as well as Mitchell's costs.

Mitchell had previously sued Twin Galaxies in the US in a case which settled in January 2024. As part of the settlement, Twin Galaxies published a statement that Mitchell had “produced expert opinion that the game play on the tapes of Mr Mitchell's record game plays could depict play on an original unmodified Donkey Kong arcade hardware if the hardware involved was malfunctioning, likely due to the degradation of components”.

The company said it would reinstate all of Mitchell's previous scores on its website's official historical database, and remove the dispute thread about Mitchell's records. Mitchell's Guinness World Records were also reinstated in June 2020.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

IDF says residents should evacuate Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Zayed, al-Manshiya and Tal al-Zaatar

The IDF has issued a forced evacuation order to residents in parts of northern Gaza: Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Zayed, al-Manshiya and Tal al-Zaatar.

Avichay Adraee, an Arabic language spokesperson for the Israeli army, said it is a “final” warning before the “raid”.

“We have warned about this area many times. For your safety, you must move immediately west to the known shelters in Gaza City,” he wrote in a post on X this morning.

It comes a day after the Israeli military ordered a sweeping evacuation order for the southern city of Rafah and parts of neighbouring Khan Younis – the biggest since the war resumed last month when Israel broke the ceasefire agreement with Hamas by launching a wave of airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinian people, including many women and children.

The IDF claims the evacuation orders are issued to protect Palestinian civilians from Hamas fighters who the Israeli military says are using civilians as human shields.

The UN has said the evacuations have failed to comply with the requirements of international law, as Israel is accused of failing to provide adequate health or safety conditions to civilians forced to flee.

Yesterday, residents in parts of southern Gaza were advised to leave immediately for the al-Mawasi “humanitarian zone”, a narrow strip of coastline at the southernmost end of the strip. But there have been many deadly Israeli airstrikes in the zone so there is no guarantee of safety there.

The IDF has issued a forced evacuation order to residents in parts of northern Gaza: Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Zayed, al-Manshiya and Tal al-Zaatar. Avichay Adraee, an Arabic language spokesperson for the Israeli army, said it is a “final” warning before the “raid”. “We have warned about this area many times. For your safety, you must move immediately west to the known shelters in Gaza City,” he wrote in a post on X this morning.

Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Moussawi said the Israeli attack on Beirut that killed at least four people amounted to “a major and severe aggression that has escalated the situation to an entirely different level”. Speaking in a televised statement after visiting the building that was struck, he called on the Lebanese state to “activate the highest level of diplomacy to find solutions”.

At least 50,399 Palestinian people have been killed and 114,583 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. At least 42 bodies and 183 injured people have been received by hospitals in Gaza over the last day, according to the territory's health ministry, which said that at least 1,042 Palestinian people have been killed by Israeli forces since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas on 18 March.

Amjad Al Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network (PNGO), an umbrella group of 30 Palestinian NGOs and ActionAid's partner in Gaza, has warned that Gaza will probably enter a “new cycle of famine, starvation and thirst” in the coming days as bakeries across the strip are forced to close because of fuel and flour shortages caused by the ongoing Israeli aid blockade.

The World Food Programme says it's immediately closing all of its bakeries in Gaza after a month-long blockade by Israel into the strip, the Associated Press reports. In an internal memo circulated among aid groups, the UN agency said that due to the lack of humanitarian aid, its supplies are running out and it doesn't have enough wheat flour needed to make bread. The agency said it's distributed all available food rations, and there are no more stocks.

Unicef, the UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, has said at least 322 children have reportedly been killed and 609 injured since the resumption of Israel's “intense bombardments” and “ground operations” in the Gaza Strip on 18 March. In a press release, Unicef wrote: “The breakdown of the ceasefire and resumption of intense bombardments and ground operations in the Gaza Strip has reportedly left at least 322 children dead and 609 injured – constituting a daily average of around 100 children killed or maimed over the past 10 days. Most of these children were displaced, sheltering in makeshift tents or damaged homes.”

UK foreign secretary David Lammy has said the UK “categorically” condemns the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank during a session in parliament, warning that they do not enhance Israeli security and undermine the prospect of a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. “I'm clear with my Israeli counterparts that settlement expansion must stop. We will continue to work with our partners to ensure the prospects for a Palestinian state”, said Lammy.

One year after Israel's killing of three British aid workers employed by World Central Kitchen, the family of James Kirby, one of those killed, said they had still not received answers from the British government. The three British citizens were killed in an Israeli airstrike despite their vehicle being clearly marked. Seven aid workers were killed in the strikes to which the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) admitted took place. Two IDF members were dismissed.

US president Donald Trump said on Tuesday he spoke with Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and discussed topics including military progress against Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthis and possible solutions in Gaza. Trump said the call went very well, Reuters reported.

One year after Israel's killing of three British aid workers employed by World Central Kitchen, the family of James Kirby, one of those killed, said they had still not received answers from the British government.

The three British citizens were killed in an Israeli airstrike despite their vehicle being clearly marked. Seven aid workers were killed in the strikes to which the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) admitted took place. Two IDF members were dismissed.

Louise Kirby said the pain of losing her cousin James remains ever-present, but adds “what has been equally devastating is the lack of justice and accountability. Despite repeated calls for answers, the family continues to be met with silence and no substantial action from the UK government.

She said it was “disheartening” that after all this time “we still have no concrete proof of accountability from any responsible party. The government's response has been nothing but empty apologies, which are and will never be sufficient. My family and I remain deeply concerned that breaches of policy or laws may have possibly occurred, which is possibly why the government has failed to engage meaningfully with us”.

She said the family were still calling for a formal in depth investigation presented to an unbiased court. “We want justice for James and the truth to be known, no matter how difficult or uncomfortable that may be.”

In the Commons the middle east minister Hamish Falconer urged the Israeli military forces speedily to complete its investigation into whether criminal proceedings were going to be taken in relation to the incident.

Amjad Al Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network (PNGO), an umbrella group of 30 Palestinian NGOs and ActionAid's partner in Gaza, has warned that Gaza will likely enter a “new cycle of famine, starvation and thirst” in the coming days as bakeries across the strip are forced to close because of fuel and flour shortages caused by the ongoing Israeli aid blockade.

He said:

The people of Gaza are totally dependent on humanitarian aid...We are warning that in the coming days, the bakeries which produce bread and community kitchens which produce meals will stop. This means Gaza will (go into) a new cycle of famine, starvation and thirst, which will be the worst that Gaza witnessed.

This is the real time for the international community to intervene, to pressure Israel to respect international law, to reopen the crossings, to stop its attacks on Palestinian civilians. To get justice for the victims, protection for children, women and elders.

The warning comes after the head of the Bakery Owners Association said it had been told by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), which supports 18 bakeries across Gaza, that flour had run out in its warehouses.

“The bakeries will no longer operate until the occupation opens the crossings and allows the necessary supplies to enter. We call on the world to pressure the occupation to open the crossings to prevent the famine from worsening in the Strip,” Abdel Nasser al-Ajrami was quoted by Al Jazeera as having said.

The World Food Programme says it's immediately closing all of its bakeries in Gaza following a monthlong blockade by Israel into the strip, the Associated Press reports.

In an internal memo circulated among aid groups, the UN agency said that due to the lack of humanitarian aid, its supplies are running out and it doesn't have enough wheat flour needed to make bread.

The agency said it's distributed all available food rations, and there are no more stocks.

For a month Israel has shut off all sources of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies for the Gaza Strip's population of more than 2 million Palestinians. It's the longest blockade yet of its 17-month war on Gaza, with no sign of it ending.

Aid workers have stretched supplies, but warn of a catastrophic surge in severe hunger and malnutrition.

The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said at the start of March it was imposing a blockade on Gaza because Hamas would not accept a plan which it claimed had been put forward by the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to extend phase one of the ceasefire and continue to release hostages, and postpone phase two, which envisaged an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.

The Egyptian foreign ministry has accused Israel of using starvation as “a weapon against the Palestinian people”, comments echoed by Qatar which said it “strongly condemns” Israel's blockade.

Describing the banning of aid as a “collective punishment” on Gaza's population, overwhelmingly “children, women and ordinary men,” the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, has called for the siege to be lifted immediately.

Unicef, the UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, has said at least 322 children have reportedly been killed and 609 injured since the resumption of Israel's “intense bombardments” and “ground operations” in the Gaza Strip on 18 March.

In a press release, Unicef wrote:

The breakdown of the ceasefire and resumption of intense bombardments and ground operations in the Gaza Strip has reportedly left at least 322 children dead and 609 injured – constituting a daily average of around 100 children killed or maimed over the past 10 days. Most of these children were displaced, sheltering in makeshift tents or damaged homes.

These figures include children who were reportedly killed or injured when the surgical department of Al Nasser hospital, in southern Gaza, was struck in an attack on 23 March.

The resurgence of relentless and indiscriminate bombardments, combined with the complete block on supplies entering the Gaza Strip for more than three weeks, has put the humanitarian response under severe strain and Gaza's civilians – especially its one million children – at grave risk.

UK foreign secretary David Lammy has said the UK “categorically” condemns the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank during a session in parliament, warning that they do not enhance Israeli security and undermine the prospect of a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.

“I'm clear with my Israeli counterparts that settlement expansion must stop. We will continue to work with our partners to ensure the prospects for a Palestinian state”, said Lammy.

Asked by Tory MP Kit Malthouse whether the UK would take more concrete action against settlers – including a possible trade ban on products from settlements, sanctions, and proscribing Israeli organisations that carry out attacks against Palestinian civilians – Lammy said he had announced sanctions in October and would keep those measures under review but did not outline any new measures the UK government was planning.

Brian Leishman, a Scottish Labour MP, asked whether the UK was still exporting British-made F-35 parts to Israel in light of its aerial bombardment of Gaza since Israel violated the ceasefire on 18 March.

Hamish Falconer, a minister in the Foreign Office, did not give a direct response to the question but said the UK government would “continue to press these issues with the Israeli government”.

President promises to be ‘very kind', but critics warn his strategy risks triggering chain reaction and global trade war. Plus, Nasa astronauts reject claims of neglect

Good morning.

As Donald Trump prepared to unveil a swathe of reciprocal tariffs, global markets braced themselves and some Republican senators voiced their opposition to a strategy that critics warn risks a global trade war, provoking retaliation by major trading partners such as China, Canada and the EU.

The US president said on Monday he would be “very kind” to trading partners when he unveiled further tariffs this week, possibly as early as Tuesday night.

The Republican billionaire insists that reciprocal action is needed because the world's biggest economy has been “ripped off by every country in the world”, promising “Liberation Day” for the US.

What do Europeans think of the plans? A large majority of western Europeans support retaliatory tariffs against the US, a survey has shown, if Trump introduces sweeping import duties for major trading partners as expected this week.

Members of Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” (Doge) reportedly gained access to a payroll system over the weekend that processes the salaries of about 276,000 federal employees across various government agencies, despite warnings from senior staff about the potential risks.

According to two people familiar with the situation who spoke to the New York Times, Doge employees had spent about two weeks trying to obtain administrative access to the program, known as the Federal Personnel and Payroll System.

Then, toward the end of last week, senior career officials at the interior department reportedly issued a memo highlighting the unusual nature of the request and the associated risks with granting it.

What did the memo say? The memo, reviewed by the Times, stated that “such elevated access to critical high-value asset systems is rare with respect to individual systems and no single [Department of Interior] official presently has access to all HR, payroll and credentialing systems”.

The president of France's far-right the National Rally (RN) party has described a court's decision to ban Marine Le Pen from public office for five years as “disproportionate, political and partisan”.

Myanmar's military faces criticism over continued airstrikes and claims it is blocking aid to earthquake survivors, as international agencies urged “unfettered access” to humanitarian aid in the conflict-riven nation.

Donald Trump's executive order seeking to overhaul US elections faced its first legal challenges yesterday as the Democratic National Committee and a pair of nonprofits filed two separate lawsuits calling it unconstitutional.

At least three people have been killed and seven injured in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs early on Tuesday, the Lebanese health ministry said.

OpenAI said it had raised $40bn in a funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at $300bn – the biggest capital-raising session ever for a startup. It comes in a partnership with the Japanese investment group SoftBank and “enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further”, OpenAI announced, adding it would “pave the way toward AGI (artificial general intelligence)” for which “massive computing power is essential”.

The fear that artificial intelligence (AI) will replace millions of jobs is widespread. But equally, in today's tough job market, not using AI wisely as part of your search could mean you miss out, Harriet Meyer writes. It's a tricky balancing act to harness the technology's power without losing the human touch. Here are some tips for supercharging your search and beating the screening, sharpening your speaking skills and boosting your negotiating position.

Economic models have systematically underestimated how global heating will affect people's wealth, according to a study that finds 4C warming will make the average person 40% poorer – an almost four-fold increase on some estimates. The study, by Australian scientists, says average global GDP per person will be reduced by 16% even if warming is kept to 2C higher. This is much higher than previous estimates of a drop of about 1.4%.

In the end, whatever Elon Musk and Donald Trump liked to insist, the astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Sunita Williams have said they were never stuck, nor stranded in space, and definitely not abandoned or marooned. The world heard on Monday, for the first time since their return to Earth two weeks ago, from the two Nasa astronauts whose 10-day flight to the International Space Station (ISS) last summer turned into a nine-month stay. And their story was markedly at odds with the narrative that came from the White House.

Taiwan says it has detected nearly 20 vessels off its coast as Beijing orders large scale sea and air exercises and calls leaders in Taipei ‘parasites'

China has launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan, accusing its leaders of being “separatists” and “parasites” who were pushing the democratically run island into war.

The drills, accompanied by a propaganda campaign, were launched without warning on Tuesday morning. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) said they were a “stern warning” to Taiwan's democratically elected government over what Beijing claims is separatist activity.

“China's reunification is an unstoppable trend - it will happen, and it must happen,” Guo Jiakun, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a daily press conference on Tuesday afternoon.

Forces from the PLA Navy, Army and Rocket Force were approaching Taiwan from “multiple directions”, said China's Eastern Theatre Command, which manages military operations in the region, on its official WeChat social media account.

It said the drills would focus on “combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes”.

The Command later said China's Coast Guard was also involved, conducting what it called “law-enforcement patrols” close to Taiwan's main island. A key element of China's military advancement has been the integration of non-military arms, including the Coast Guard, and its maritime militia fleet of fishing boats, and the conversion or creation of civilian ships for military transport.

“These drills are concrete actions to exercise legitimate jurisdiction and control over the Island in accordance with the one-China principle,” said Zhu Anqing, a China Coast Guard spokesperson.

Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected 71 PLA aircraft and at least 19 Navy and Coast Guard vessels on Tuesday , including the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong. More than 10 of the ships approached close to Taiwan's contiguous zone, which stretches 24 nautical miles (44km) from the coast, military officials told Reuters. Taiwan's military had deployed aircraft, Navy ships, and coastal missile systems in response, the ministry said.

Beijing claims Taiwan is Chinese territory and is building capability to seize it by military force. Analysts believe it is not there yet, but has been making significant advances and in the meantime uses military pressure – such as drills – and other coercive means to push Taiwan towards submission.

“‘Taiwan independence' means war, and pursuing ‘Taiwan independence' means pushing the people of Taiwan into a dangerous situation of war,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, claimed in a statement.

Taiwan, which is recognised as a country by around a dozen others mostly in the Pacific and Caribbean, operates as a sovereign state with its own democratically elected government, military and currency. Its government and people overwhelmingly oppose the prospect of Chinese rule.

Taiwan's presidential office spokesperson, Wen Lii, condemned China's “escalatory behaviour” and “military provocations”, linking it to other recent exercises near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines and in the South China Sea.

“China's wide-ranging drills indicate that its ambitions are not limited to annexing Taiwan, but rather aim to achieve hegemony in the western Pacific.”

The PLA also bombarded social media with propaganda and nationalistic hashtags, releasing several propaganda videos and posters declaring it was “closing in” on Taiwan, and depicting a full-scale assault on the island including missile attacks. Other imagery called Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, a “parasite courting ultimate destruction” and portrayed him as a cartoon bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. That cartoon, which was in Chinese and English, also showed him holding a former opposition figure, Ko Wen-je, in a cage, in apparent provocation of Taiwan's febrile domestic politics – Ko is now in jail on corruption charges but some supporters have called it a political persecution.

China has launched numerous drills against Taiwan in recent years, often in response to perceived acts of separatism or pro-independence. Lai, who was elected last year to continue the rule of the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive party, has taken a forthright approach to cross-strait tensions. Last month he declared China to be a “foreign hostile force” under national security legislation, and announced a series of measures to counter its growing influence and espionage operations. His speech and measures were specifically cited in Tuesday's propaganda.

Amanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group's China practice, said Tuesday's propaganda “makes it clear that China is breaking from what has been a relatively quiet approach since Trump's election”.

“This is primarily about Lai's 13 March speech which Beijing found provocative,” she said. “The publicity around the exercise likely also has the US in mind – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan.”

Tuesday's drills have differed slightly from more recent efforts, which have not been so explicitly linked to “punishing” Taiwan. They were also launched with little warning. Taiwan's government and military have been ramping up their response training amid growing concern that Beijing might launch a real attack or blockade under the guise of a drill.

On Tuesday, defence ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said Taiwan had elevated its readiness level to ensure China didn't “turn drills in to combat” and “launch a sudden attack on us”.

The drills appeared to be of similar size to the PLA's “Joint Sword” exercises held in 2023 and 2024, but were unnamed, which a Chinese military analyst told state media was a sign of such activity being “normalised”.

The US secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, has visited several Asian countries in recent days, emphasising that countering China and deterring it from attacking Taiwan was a key priority for the US.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Coalition of former allies Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria fought armed insurgents including Boko Haram

Niger's ruling junta has quit a regional force fighting armed Islamist groups in west Africa's Lake Chad area, cementing an acrimonious split from former allies in the region.

The decision to exit the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) was announced in a bulletin on state television over the weekend. The move “reflects a stated intent to reinforce security for oil sites”, the bulletin stated, without providing further details.

The MNJTF was formed in 2015 by Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria in the wake of increasing jihadist attacks across their territories. At its peak, it had an estimated 10,000 troops and fought many armed groups, especially Boko Haram and its offshoots. But any serious progress has been hampered or even undone by poor collaboration and equipping, analysts say.

“The force was never that effective, said Ulf Laessing, the Bamako-based director of the Sahel programme at Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a German thinktank. Its decline, he added, was “good news for jihadists and it is bad news for villagers on the lake side, fishers or farmers who just want to go about their business but who will now get less military support”.

Niger's exit from MNJTF came days after the junta's leader, Abdourahmane Tiani, was sworn in as president until 2030 under a new charter that suspended the constitution and dissolved all political parties.

Niger has also isolated itself from the Economic Community of West African State (Ecowas), after Ecowas imposed a range of sanctions following the coup that ousted the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, in July 2023.

Within two months of the coup, it had joined the splinter Alliance of Sahel States (AES) along with Burkina Faso and Mali, where there have also been military takeovers since 2020.

Since then, AES has introduced new biometric passports to replace the old regional passports and on Monday, it announced a 0.5% levy on imported goods from Ecowas states.

Ikemesit Effiong, managing partner at Nigerian geopolitical risk advisory SBM Intelligence, said the levy put an end to “a long history of free trade across the western Sahel” and could change the dynamics of Ecowas's negotiations with AES.

“When squared with Ecowas's statement commitment to keep open trade and borders with AES states, I think this [levy] will force Ecowas to drop its kid gloves strategy and be more forceful with the AES,” Effiong said.

It remains unclear what impact Niger's withdrawal from the MNJTF will have on a security agreement signed with neighbouring Nigeria last August. The countries share a border that spans 1,000 miles but Nigeria-led Ecowas's push for a rapid return to democratic governance has caused friction between both countries.

Effiong said recent moves in the capital, Niamey, which has been seeking new military and economic partners since expelling French troops in 2023, are unsurprising.

“Niger has been pulling out of all its main regional bilateral and multilateral commitments, much of which it sees as western influenced or inspired,” said Effiong, who noted that MTNJTF had received military and intelligence aid from western partners in the past.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Attempts to seal porous borders through which guns, drugs and fuel flowed in Assad times are turning local tensions deadly

Hidden trails snake through the mountains in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa valley, the furrowed earthen paths veering off before entirely disappearing into the mountainside scrub. “That's Syria,” said Haidar, a smuggler using a pseudonym, tracing with his finger the contours of a route that if followed for about half a mile would cross the borders of Syria and Lebanon with authorities being none the wiser.

In the remote Lebanese village of Qasr, borders are just a suggestion. The town sits a stone's throw from Syria and save for three soldiers manning an army checkpoint at the entry to the village, the presence of the Lebanese state is minimal.

The people of Qasr and the villages that straddle both sides of the nearly 248 mile-long (400km) Syria-Lebanon border were for decades in business together. Authorities in Assad's Syria profited from the flow of weapons, drugs and fuel over the border, and its ally in Lebanon, the Iran-backed Shia militia Hezbollah, relied on routes used by smugglers to receive weapons coming from Iran.

But after the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad was ousted by Syrian rebels on 8 December and a war-battered Hezbollah lost its grip over the Lebanese state, authorities in both countries have sought to reassert control over their borders and crack down on smuggling.

The attempt to seal the porous border has disrupted the decades long smuggling trade between Syria and Lebanon and has turned local tensions into deadly international military incidents.

On 16 March, three Syrian soldiers were killed in Lebanese territory, prompting the Syrian army to begin to pummel Qasr and surrounding villages with artillery. Smuggling tribes in the villages returned fire and the Lebanese army also responded to Syrian rockets, with a ceasefire agreed a day later.

In all, three Syrians and seven Lebanese were killed on both sides, while another 52 were wounded in Lebanon.

It was the second time in a month that clashes had erupted between Syria and Lebanon. Syrian authorities blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah for the skirmishes, claiming it had infiltrated Syrian territory, kidnapped three Syrian soldiers and killed them. Hezbollah denied any involvement.

Lebanese people painted a very different story, of a new Syrian army that did not yet know the lay of the land, and of a local dispute that escalated quickly.

A member of the Lebanese Jaafar tribe, an influential smuggling clan that controls many of the routes in the area, said: “Three Syrian soldiers [were] walking, and stepped on Lebanese land by accident. They ran across a shepherd who got scared and called his relatives, who killed the soldiers immediately.”

He described how tensions have been running high between the people of Lebanese border villages and the new Syrian authorities. “Smugglers are scared to go to Syria now, they don't feel there's security,” he said.

Many Lebanese living in towns on the Syrian side of the border for decades fled after the fall of Assad for fear of the new authorities. One 68-year-old farmer who was born and raised in Syria said his land had been taken from him in December, so he fled to Qasr.

Arms have poured into Lebanese border towns after Assad's troops abandoned their posts, leaving weapons ranging from rifles to light artillery by the roadside. The Jaafar family member said it was now common to find Kornets, a Russian anti-tank guided missile, in Qasr – and that they were quite cheap, too.

When Syrian artillery fire started on Qasr and the surrounding area, tribes such as the Jaafar family took up arms to defend the town – and arms they had aplenty. A video of an al-Arabiya correspondent inside Syria during the clashes captured the moment a rocket was shot from the Lebanese side, slightly injuring the reporter.

Many people in Qasr are members of Hezbollah – the group announced four of its fighters were killed in the clashes – although residents insisted the militia did not direct the battle, but rather fighters participated as members of the town.

Experts say the relationship between smugglers and Hezbollah is more of a partnership, rather than the tribes that engage in smuggling being under the Lebanese group's control.

Joseph Daher, the author of Hezbollah: The political economy of the party of God, said: “Most of these clans are politically covered and have connections with Hezbollah. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) [the Islamist authority that rules Syria] is trying to strengthen its controls at the border, especially targeting clans affiliated with Hezbollah.”

The Lebanese state has also been keen to strengthen its control over the Syria-Lebanese border, eager to show western powers it is preventing weapons from reaching Hezbollah. Before the fall of the Assad regime, the Lebanese group would receive weapons shipments via Syria through the Bekaa valley.

Despite the clashes, business is business. Smugglers say the flow of illicit goods has continued after the fall of Assad. “Publicly, [HTS] is saying they want smuggling to stop, but they need our goods. Business doesn't have an identity,” said a second member of the Jaafar family. The new Syrian authorities have regularised and decreased the fees they charge smugglers, he said, as Syria desperately needs Lebanese fuel and diesel as western-led sanctions have throttled its ability to import them.

The only goods smugglers can no longer traffic are drugs. The factories that used to produce the popular amphetamine captagon were run by the now deposed Assad regime and smuggled through the Bekaa valley to be exported via Lebanon's ports. Syria's new authorities have cracked down on the narcotics trade.

Lebanon's smugglers and Syrian officials are still getting to know one another. Gone are the fourth armoured division soldiers under the control of Maher al-Assad, the brother of Syria's ousted president, which used to control the Syrian side of the smuggling routes.

The introduction is off to a rocky start. As the Jaafar clan member was speaking, bursts of machine-gun fire erupted, followed by the dull thuds of rocket-propelled grenades fired by the Syrian authorities at a neighbouring village.

“If the ceasefire continues then we won't attack them and they won't attack us. But it seems we are entering a cycle of violence and revenge,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Doctors helping with aftermath of disaster and UN special rapporteur say aid is disappearing or being blocked in some areas

Myanmar's military is facing criticism over continued airstrikes and claims it is blocking aid to earthquake survivors, as international agencies urged “unfettered access” to humanitarian aid in the conflict-riven nation.

The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that hit central Myanmar on Friday has caused widespread destruction, killing more than 2,700 people and leaving affected areas in dire need of basic necessities such as food and water.

Two Australia-based doctors helping coordinate the emergency response at the epicentre in Mandalay and Sagaing have accused the junta of blocking emergency aid.

“Some of the supplies of aid, well most of it, was not given to the people who need it. In some areas in Mandalay the aid did not arrive. The aid was confiscated by the military junta,” said Dr Nang Win.

Since the earthquake, Nang has been communicating with colleagues in Mandalay, where she says aid has been scarce and makeshift clinics are being set up in lieu of a proper emergency response system.

She said one medical colleague in the city had signed paperwork to receive $1,000 in aid but received only about $100 of it, claiming the skimmed supplies would probably end up in a disaster black market. “Then there is a market that happens and they have to go around and buy their own,” she said.

Since Myanmar's military seized power in a February 2021 coup, an armed resistance movement – comprising various groups that formed to oppose the junta, as well as older, ethnic armed groups – has been locked in a chaotic and deadly civil war with the junta. Over the past year the junta has been consistently losing ground, controlling less than 30% of the country's territory, though it retains control of the biggest cities.

The military had been blocking aid and rescuers from areas where it does not have full control, said Dr Nang. “If a group of rescuers comes and say we want to enter, especially in Sagaing, they will not let you, they will say you need a permit and once you get a permit it is too late,” she said.

A spokesperson for the junta did not immediately respond to the claims.

Dr Tun Aung Shwe, a medical doctor and Australian representative of Myanmar's exiled opposition National Unity Government (NUG), said the military was leveraging control of checkpoints to block medicine flowing to areas controlled by the NUG and ethnic resistance groups.

“Outside of the major cities, the military already checks and then tries to block the flow of aid,” he said, adding that local communities were forced to seek alternative routes. “They're finding other ways. So it's getting there, but it's taking longer.”

Emergency aid had been being blocked to areas such as Sagaing as well as Mogwe, he said.

A member of a rescue team in Sagaing said they faced restrictions and blockades. “When we try to transport supplies from Mandalay, the military council doesn't permit it. Even yesterday, when food supplies were being transported from Mandalay, they confiscated half of everything,” they said. The military inspects the rescue teams, they said, suspicious of weapons being brought into the areas under the guise of aid supplies. “They scrutinise even the helping teams thoroughly, prioritising only their [own] security. They don't prioritise rescuing civilians. They also investigate food distribution teams, asking where they're from and checking everything. If supplies are transported across the river from other cities, food supplies are confiscated and don't reach their destination adequately,” the rescue worker said.

On Tuesday, a major rebel alliance declared a unilateral ceasefire to support the humanitarian response to the earthquake. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, which comprises the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army, said it would not initiate offensive operations for one month to allow the rescue effort, and would engage in combat only in self-defence. The NUG previously announced that groups affiliated with it would observe a two-week ceasefire in earthquake-affected areas, with an exception for defensive actions.

The junta also faces criticism for conducting airstrikes on villages. The Karen National Union, one of Myanmar's oldest ethnic armies, said in a statement the junta “continues to carry out airstrikes targeting civilian areas, even as the population suffers tremendously from the earthquake”.

Tom Andrews, the UN's special rapporteur on Myanmar, said confirming what was happening on the ground was challenging due to communication outages but that there were “consistent reports of aid being blocked” and that airstrikes were continuing.

“Instead of focusing every ounce of energy, attention and resources on saving lives the junta is taking lives. That's the first thing. Secondly, yesterday there have been consistent reports of aid being blocked, of aid workers being denied access at checkpoints,” he said.

These reports were emerging from areas that were under opposition control or contested, he said, adding that the military should “stop killing people and focus on saving people”.
 On Monday night, airstrikes were reported in Singu township, Mandalay region, and Nawnghkio township, Shan state. Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said: “Myanmar's military junta still invokes fear, even in the wake of a horrific natural disaster that killed and injured thousands. The junta needs to break from its appalling past practice and ensure that humanitarian aid quickly reaches those whose lives are at risk in earthquake-affected areas.”

Scot Marciel, a retired US diplomat and ambassador to Myanmar from 2016 to 2020, said the military had a bad track record when it came to providing assistance to its citizens in need.

“Myanmar has very poor infrastructure, and where the military government, where to the extent it controls things, [it] is not really going to lift much of a finger to help,” he said. “It's a really bad place for it to happen.”

During the Covid pandemic, he said, the military heavily restricted aid, providing oxygen mostly only to its supporters. During cyclone Nargis in 2008, a disaster that claimed almost 140,000 lives, the military leaders initially rejected all international aid.

“Their history shows that they basically are willing to stand by and let lots of suffering and even death happen, if not inflicting it themselves, rather than do anything that might risk their power position,” Marciel said.

Aid agencies warned of an urgent need for clean water and food in affected areas, and said there is a lack of sanitation systems.

Kanni Wignaraja, the UN assistant secretary general and regional director for Asia and the Pacific at UNDP, said the magnitude of the devastation was unimaginable.

“If you look at basic infrastructure … we're already seeing that more than 80% of Sagaing town's infrastructure is either destroyed or unsafe,” Wignaraja said.

“A lot of these urban centres are going to have to be razed.
 “[It is] really important that the UN disaster assessment and response teams that are ready in Bangkok are allowed in fast,” she said, adding that a total ceasefire was needed so that relief work could be conducted.
 Myanmar's junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, said in a televised address that the death toll was expected to surpass 3,000, having reached 2,719 on Tuesday, with 441 missing.

In Sagaing, the epicentre of the quake, the stench is becoming unbearable as a country wracked by civil war bears the burden of burying thousands killed in Friday's disaster

Days after a powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake ripped through central Myanmar, upending buildings, pagodas and thousands of lives, the grim reality of the disaster is setting in.

At a cemetery in Sagaing, a city in central Myanmar that lies at the epicentre of the quake, the bodies are starting to pile up.

“The corpses have been emitting a foul smell since yesterday. Today, it's beyond description. The bodies can't be removed from the city yet, and rescue teams haven't arrived,” says Aye Moe, 20, a Sagaing resident.

Officially, the death toll from the quake has passed 2,000. Unofficially, many fear it could be thousands more. The US Geological Survey estimated that deaths could climb beyond 10,000.

“They have to bury people with 10 bodies per grave,” says Aye Moe of the situation in Sagaing, “When there isn't enough space there, they have to take them to Mandalay for cremation, but there aren't enough furnaces there either.”

Access to Myanmar, the vast borderlands of which are controlled by a patchwork of ethnic armed organisations, has been restricted to the foreign media since the military seized control of the country in a February 2021 coup.

Covering the military atrocities that followed in an ensuing civil war saw many journalists from Myanmar forced into exile in neighbouring Thailand, complicating the flow of information – first about the conflict, and now about the disaster.

But as the days go on, more details are coming to light.

“Everything is being handled through self-reliance. We still don't know the exact number of bodies,” says Aye Moe, “At the main hospital, there are both patients and corpses, and it's becoming unmanageable. There's no manpower, and there are almost no young people – some have fled to the forest, others have left the country.”

In Sagaing, Aye Moe says rescue teams were yet to arrive by Monday.

Aung Gyi, 25, another Sagaing resident, says: “Everyone is facing difficulties”. The city, he says, has been reduced to “ruins” with people desperate for basic supplies such as food, water and mosquito coils.

“The main problem is that two- and three-storey buildings have collapsed, and people trapped underneath can't be pulled out,” he says, adding that one of Sagaing's main bridges has been damaged, preventing heavy vehicles needed for rescue operations from crossing.

“What we still don't know about are the highland areas,” he adds. “And many monasteries and nunneries remain unchecked.”

Emergency aid and teams of rescue workers from countries such as China, India, Russia, the US and around South-east Asia are starting to flow into the country, mostly through the capital of Naypyitaw, but its swift delivery is complicated not only by the destruction caused by the natural disaster, but also the logistics of delivering it in a country wracked by civil war.

The fallout from Myanmar's earthquake has overwhelmed parts of the healthcare system, the World Health Organization has said, with rescue operations facing “significant obstacles including damaged roads, collapsed bridges, unstable communications and the complexities related to civil conflict”, the WHO said in an update.

In Myanmar's second-largest city of Mandalay, footage of which shows swathes of it flattened into a jumble of bricks and rubble, people are sleeping in the street in fear of aftershocks toppling more buildings.

“People are trying to help each other,” says Dr Nang Win, a Burmese medical doctor based in Australia who has been trying to assist her relatives, colleagues and friends in the city. “The system from the beginning is not set up, there is no disaster planning.”

Some aid has started to arrive in the city, she says, with her colleagues also setting up makeshift clinics. However, delays in emergency assistance, she says, has already caused unnecessary loss of life.

“1,700 is not the real death toll,” she says, “Even in one town in Mandalay it would be more than that.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Pin down Putin over peace talks, say foreign ministers, as Peskov talks of ‘drawn-out process'; Ukraine seeks changes to minerals deal. What we know on day 1,133

European foreign ministers have called out Moscow for delaying a ceasefire in Ukraine as the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it would be “a drawn-out process”. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said on Monday: “Russia is playing games and not really wanting peace. So our question is, how can we put more pressure on Russia.” There should be some kind of deadline for Russia accepting a ceasefire in Ukraine, the Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, said on Monday in Madrid where like Kallas he was attending an EU foreign ministers' meeting.

The French foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, said in Madrid that Russia owed a clear response to the US on whether it wants to go on a peace path at all. Donald Trump, the US president, has threatened sanctions against the remaining buyers of Russian oil if Vladimir Putin does not agree to a ceasefire soon. Russia has effectively rejected a US proposal for a 30-day general ceasefire; Moscow instead wants a partial ceasefire on the Black Sea but has sought to impose far-reaching conditions.

The Institute for the Study of War, in an assessment on Monday, said there were “continued Russian efforts to hold the temporary ceasefire in the Black Sea hostage to stall efforts toward a general ceasefire and extract additional concessions from the west”. The thinktank added it was “unlikely that the United States, Ukraine, and Russia could negotiate the terms of a general ceasefire within the next three weeks”.

British, French and Ukrainian military leaders will meet again in the coming days to build on “real momentum” in efforts to boost Ukraine's security, said the office of Keir Starmer, the British prime minister. The meeting to “drive forward the next stage of detailed planning” was agreed on a call between Starmer and Zelenskyy. Britain and France are spearheading a “coalition of the willing” plan that includes putting troops in Ukraine as what have been variously described as a peacekeepers, ceasefire monitors or a reassurance force.

Russian forces shelled a frontline settlement in Ukraine's south-east Zaporizhzhia region on Monday, killing a 66-year-old woman and injuring five, said the regional governor, Ivan Fedorov. Zaporizhzhia is one of four regions partly occupied by Russian forces. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, came under another Russian drone attack overnight, injuring three people, the Ukrainian interior ministry said on Monday. Russia said its air defences shot down 66 Ukrainian drones early on Monday over three Russian regions.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Monday for Russia to be punished for more than 183,000 alleged war crimes. Zelenskyy, with first lady Olena Zelenska and visiting European officials, paid tribute in Bucha to victims of Russia's month-long occupation of the town which lies north-west of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. It was invaded in February 2022 by Russian troops who were expelled by Ukrainian defenders the next month.

Russian troops are accused of atrocities including executions, rapes and torture during the Bucha occupation. The Russian forces committed more than 9,000 crimes in the area around Bucha including 1,800 killings, according to Ukraine's acting prosecutor general, Oleksiy Khomenko. Khomenko said on Monday that Ukrainian authorities had so far charged 178 individuals and convicted 21. He said Kyiv was continuing to work with the ICC and 25 other countries that were carrying out their own investigations. “Ukraine will not stop on the path of bringing those responsible to justice.”

Ukraine said it was working on changes to a draft agreement with the US over sweeping access to Ukrainian natural resources, referred to as critical minerals or by Donald Trump as “rare earths”. Trump has warned Kyiv of “big problems” if it rejects the US proposal. “We will try to pass on Ukrainian proposals sometime by the end of this week,” said a Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said talks had been held online with the US side on Friday and that the Ukrainian team would report to Zelenskyy “today or tomorrow … then we will prepare our position and send it to [the US]”.

The Kyiv source also told the Agence France-Presse news agency that Europe was taking an interest in the agreement, following reports that some of its provisions could contravene Kyiv's commitments to the EU, which it is seeking to join. “The agreement must take into account our obligations in the context of association with the EU and Ukraine's movement towards the EU,” the source said.

Sweden will donate 16 billion kronor (€1.4bn) in fresh military aid to Ukraine, the government said on Monday – the largest such package from the Nordic country since Russia's 2022 invasion. Most of it would go towards the acquisition of newly produced materials, “mainly from the Swedish, but also the European defence industrial base”, said the Swedish government. It is the 19th batch of military aid that Sweden has provided to Ukraine, with the total estimated at 80 billion kronor, according to the government.

When it announced a previous aid package in January, Sweden said it was moving from donating weapons from stockpiles to purchasing new arms. Earlier in March it said it would donate 18 of its home-developed Archer mobile artillery systems to Ukraine, of which it had previously donated eight. It has sent 50 of its CV90 armoured combat vehicles and “around 10” Leopard 2 tanks, as well as anti-air missile systems.

Vladimir Putin has ordered 160,000 servicemen be drafted by 15 July, a higher figure than previous conscription drives. Russian men are liable to be drafted for mandatory military service through bi-annual call-ups. The Kremlin and defence ministry say they are not sent into combat; however, Kyiv has said throughout the conflict that it has taken Russian conscripts captive.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Woman's lawyer says verdict proof of ‘patriarchal' justice system and does not rule out taking case to European court of human rights

A Cyprus court's acquittal of five men accused of abducting and raping a British woman in the resort of Ayia Napa has been met with outrage as calls mount for the verdict to be challenged.

Dismissing the charges on Monday, the three-member district court in Paralimni ruled the testimony of the 20-year-old had not been credible because it “lacked coherence and contained numerous substantial contradictions”. The defendants, Israelis aged between 19 and 20, claimed sexual contact with the woman had been consensual.

But her lawyer, Michael Polak, described the assertion as absurd. “The young lady in this case is gay, any suggestion that she voluntarily agreed to group sex with men she had never met before, who were speaking in a different language, is ridiculous,” he told the Guardian. “She has been left completely distraught by the court's verdict today. It was one of the hardest phone calls I have ever had to make.”

All five accused had been remanded in custody since the alleged incident on 3 September 2023. On Monday, they were allowed to walk free with lawyer Nir Yaslovitzh, who represented two of the men, telling Israel's Channel 12: “It is a brave decision that completely rejected the complainant's version and completely accepts our clients' version.”

Polak, who directs the London-based legal aid group Justice Abroad, said the case was further proof of a sexist attitude in Cyprus's “patriarchal” justice system. “Recently, the European court of human rights ruled that there is no effective protection for women subject to sexual offences in the Republic of Cyprus,” he added.

“Unfortunately, nothing I have seen shows that there have been any improvements in this area.”

He did not rule out the case being taken to the European court of human rights.

In February, another British woman who also claimed she had been gang-raped in Ayia Napa by more than a dozen Israeli men in July 2019 won a “monumental victory” over Cypriot authorities after the Strasbourg-based tribunal ruled they had “failed in their obligation to effectively investigate the applicant's complaint of rape”.

Judge Michalis Papathanasiou, sitting in Paralimni on Monday, had been the judge on the district court who had overseen the earlier case. Last year, the island's supreme court not only overturned his decision but, in an unusual rebuke, criticised the way he had conducted proceedings, agreeing with the defendant's lawyers that the trial process had been “manifestly unfair” and his “interruptions and interventions unjustified and inadmissible”.

The Briton, who cannot be legally identified, had been described as “highly distressed” when, giving testimony to police, she recounted how she had been “taken by force” during a party around the pool area of the defendants' hotel to a room and sexually assaulted.

Women's groups and campaigners voiced outrage as they reacted to the ruling, with some raising the prospect of the close diplomatic ties between Cyprus and Israel influencing Monday's judgment.

“What this shows is that Cypriot courts haven't reflected at all on their past mistakes,” said Susana Pavlou, who heads the Mediterranean Institute of Gender Studies in Nicosia, the island's capital. “We are shocked and appalled.”

Pavlou said she had been particularly angered by the court's argument that, although the woman had taken class A drugs and consumed a “significant amount” of alcohol, neither were enough to remove “her ability to consent”.

“That was particularly shocking,” she said. “It is clear, more than ever, that judicial authorities in Cyprus continue to be influenced by stereotypical attitudes and beliefs in relation to victims of sexual violence and rape.” Research, she said, had shown that victims of sexual violence were “often considered unreliable witnesses” because of the lack of psychological and legal support navigating the judicial process.

 Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673.

Vast scheme aims to counter disinformation and increase awareness in country where low HPV vaccine take-up means many die from the preventable disease



Tens of thousands of doctors across India are being trained to promote the HPV vaccine, in a push to eliminate cervical cancer in the country.

They will check with mothers attending medical appointments that they intend to vaccinate their daughters, and visit schools and community centres armed with facts and slideshows to counter vaccine disinformation.

One in five cervical cancer cases worldwide occur in India – and the overwhelming majority of those are caused by the human papillomavirus, or HPV.

HPV vaccination has become routine practice in many countries and has been available in India privately since 2008, but with low take-up.

Sutapa Biswas, co-founder of the Cancer Foundation of India, said imported vaccines were expensive and people were reluctant to spend money on prevention. Misinformation surrounding deaths during, but unrelated to, an HPV vaccine trial in the country had left it with “baggage”, she said.

However, India has recently started manufacturing its own cervical cancer vaccine, and the government is expected to make it part of the national vaccination programme later this year or early next year.

Biswas said it had been frustrating to know a vaccine was available but was not being used. “So many times [we would hear] all kinds of excuses – ‘the cost is so high, we cannot vaccinate'. But the cost of treating cancer is way higher.”

Now, she said: “Everything is kind of converging and we want to make the most of this opportunity. We are also keeping the pressure on the government so that we don't miss this chance.”

Last year about 11,000 members of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (Fogsi) underwent virtual training. About 100 of those trainees have now become the National HPV Faculty and will each train 500 general physicians from the Indian Medical Association over the next six months.

The idea, Biswas said, “is to build confidence”. Training includes practical information on dosages, details of the World Health Organization's push to eliminate cervical cancer, and advice on how to answer common questions.

The implementation of India's cervical screening programme had been sluggish, she said. Most cancers are diagnosed late, and most people's experiences of the disease relate to death.

Many non-specialist doctors “didn't even know that a cancer could be eliminated and vaccination could be such a gamechanger”, Biswas said.

After the training, doctors are asked to approach their community in their local language to give short presentations.

The Covid-19 pandemic, and associated vaccination campaigns, had helped, Biswas said – even in less-educated rural communities people now understood the link between viruses and vaccines. “Now, when we are talking in the community, we can [explain] there's a virus causing cervical cancer – that's why we are here, we have a vaccine.”

Training was also offered separately to local civil society organisations, she said “on how to understand this and talk about it so there is no backlash”.

Dr Priya Ganeshkumar, the gynaecologist and cancer specialist leading the project within Fogsi, said gynaecologists were well placed to do advocacy work.

Families often returned to the doctor who had delivered their baby when their daughters started having periods, or in subsequent pregnancies “so we have a lot of scope for talking about this vaccine”, she said. It might be “the daughter is sitting with the mother, and [we can] proactively ask the question ‘hey, girl – what's your age?' [and ask the parent] ‘Did you vaccinate your child?'”.

While many gynaecologists were already aware of the HPV vaccine, she asked: “Did they emphasise it?” The training, she said, helped them to understand the importance of raising it with patients and to not assume that vaccination was the job of a paediatrician. The HPV vaccine is typically given to preteens, later than most childhood vaccinations.

The potential was vast, Ganeshkumar said. “We all know about cervical cancer – India is a hub of it. Every seven to eight minutes, a lady in India is dying due to cervical cancer, when it is preventable.”

Cancer Research UK is providing about a quarter of the project's funding. Its chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, said it was part of efforts towards “a future where almost nobody develops cervical cancer”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Conservative party leader says she believes show ‘is based on real story', a claim described as wholly untrue by writer and co-creator of series

Kemi Badenoch has given credence to a conspiracy theory about the Netflix hit Adolescence being based on a real story, but involving a black boy not a white boy.

This has been described as wholly untrue by Jack Thorne, the writer and co-creator of the series, which has been praised by Keir Starmer for the way it has opened up a debate about the radicalisation of young men.

Starmer met Thorne, and some of the shows other creators, in Downing Street this week, along with charities engaged in child protection, and the PM said he would like as many pupils as possible to watch the series.

The four-part drama is about a 13-year-old boy arrested for the murder of a girl at his school. The Guardian's reviewer described it as “the most devastating and immaculately scripted and played series I have ever seen – as close to televisual perfection as you can get”.

In an interview with GB News, asked if she has seen it, Badenoch replied:

Well, I think Adolescence is a fictional story. It's based on a real story, but my understanding is that the boy who committed that crime was not white.

So, people can do whatever they like in fiction. The prime minister should not be building policy on fiction. He should be building policy on reality. What is the reality? Phones are disrupting schools and not enough schools have effective bans.

Badenoch went on to talk about the Tory policy to ban mobile phones in schools. In an earlier LBC interview this morning she said that she had not actually watched the programme, because “I don't have time to watch anything these days, to be honest.”

Speaking to LBC, Badenoch also stated her belief that Adolescence was based on a true story. She said:

The story which it is based on has been fundamentally changed and so creating policy on a work of fiction rather than on reality is the real issue.

But, in an interview last week on the News Agents podcast, Thorne said there was no truth in the claim that he had adapted a real story involving a black boy. He said:

They've claimed that Stephen [Graham] and I based it on a story and so they're saying that we race swapped it, because we were basically here and then ended up there, and everything else, and nothing is further from the truth. 

I have told a lot of real-life stories in my time. I know the harm that can come when you take elements of a real-life story, and you put it on screen, and the people aren't expecting it. There is no part of this that's based on a true story, not one single part.

Asked about critics who complained about the main character being white, Thorne said:

It's absurd to say that this is only committed by black boys, it's absurd, it's not true. And history shows a lot of cases of kids from all races committing these crimes. 

We're not making a point about race with this. We are making a point about masculinity. We're trying to get inside a problem. We're not saying this is one thing or another. We're saying this is about boys.

The claim that Adolescence was based on a real story involving a black boy has been circulated on social media, including by people claiming that the colour of the main character was changed to conform with an anti-white agenda.

Ian Miles Cheong, a prominent rightwing commentator on X, floated this argument last month in a post that has attracted 4.8m views saying:

Netflix has a show called Adolescence that's about a British knife killer who stabbed a girl to death on a bus and it's based on real life cases such as the Southport murderer.

So guess what. They race swapped the actual killer from a black man/migrant to a white boy and the story has it so he was radicalized online by the red pill movement.

Just the absolute state of anti-white propaganda.

This attracted a comment from Elon Musk, the X owner, billionaire Trump ally and far-right provocateur, saying: “Wow.”

Badenoch has been accused, including by Keir Starmer at PMQs, of spending too much time reading social media.

Keir Starmer has rejected claims that the expected imposition of US tariffs on Britain means he has been “played” by President Trump. Starmer said that the UK and the US were at an “advanced stage” in negotiating an economic deal, and he suggested that this could lead to the UK getting exemptions from US tariffs in future. (See 9.53am and 1.15pm.) According to Steven Swinford from the Times, a deal is ready to sign. “But US is refusing to sign it until after hitting UK with tariffs on April 2, aka Liberation Day,” Swinford says.

Richard Hughes, the chair of the Office of Budget Responsibility, has told MPs that the OBR is likely to downgrade its growth forecast in the autumn. As the Telegraph reports, he said the OBR's most recent report, which downgraded the UK growth forecast for 2025 from 2% to 1%, was based on IMF projections from January, before Trump's policies kicked in. Hughes told the Treasury committee:

Putting in place more restrictions on global trade around the world is not very good for global output, and it's pretty reasonable to say the direction of that is going to be down.

Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has denied that the issue of free speech has featured in tariff negotiations with the US after reports a deal could be jeopardised by the outcome of a criminal case in Dorset.

Shabana Mahmood's intervention to halt new guidelines on sentencing is “dangerous” and a “deliberate step backwards”, according to senior legal figures and prison campaigners.

Kemi Badenoch has given credence to a conspiracy theory about the Netflix hit Adolescence being based on a real story, but involving a black boy not a white boy – despite also admitting she has not seen the show. (See 3.59am.)

Shabana Mahmood's intervention to halt new guidelines on sentencing is “dangerous” and a “deliberate step backwards”, according to senior legal figures and prison campaigners, Rajeev Syal reports.

This morning the Commons work and pensions committee held a session in Manchester town hall, where it took evidence from witnesses in relation to jobcentres and pensioner poverty.

Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, gave evidence, and, as the Daily Mirror reports, he argued that jobcentres should be renamed live well centres, in line with Greater Manchester's Live Well initiative to promote wellbeing that links healthcare with employment support.

As Ashley Cowburn reports, Burnham said:

I would like Jobcentre Plus to be renamed Live Well centres. In the name it should be positive - it should say to the public ‘you are going to be helped when you come in here.

It's not just the name. It's what happens when you go inside. What's the atmosphere like? What's it like to be in there? I just think there's a huge opportunity.

As Steve Robson reports in the i, Burnham also also said that Westminster governments put too much emphasis on punitive sanctions when reforming welfare. He said:

From my time in Westminster, and I was probably guilty of it at the time, I think benefits policy in this country has too much, under all governments, been written to create headlines to please certain newspapers and not actually to do the job of encouraging the recovery of people back to a better position in their lives.

I think once you leave as a minister and become a mayor, you just don't think ‘will this please that paper? It's a completely different, bottom-up offer that you give to people

If you really want to help people, if you really want to save money and get more people into work, I think you have to come at it a completely different way.

Yesterday, in his speech to the Organised Immigration Crime conference, Keir Starmer announced that 24,000 migrants have been removed from the UK since Labour took office. This included the four biggest return flights ever, he said.

If you are a Labour activists, you can now buy leaflets from party HQ making the same point.

The Green party says it is horrified. Carla Denyer, the Green's co-leader, said:

Labour's recent leaflet boasting about deporting more people than the Tories is sickening.
  Labour are failing to provide safe and legal routes into the UK while seemingly revelling in turning people's lives upside down.
  Any claim the Labour party may have once had to be a party of compassion or principle has well and truly gone.

The controversy is reminiscent of what happened in 2015, when the party produced official mugs with the slogan “Controls on immigration”. This was one of the party's five election pledges, and so it was understandable that the party wanted to publicise it. But the mugs were very unpopular with some Labour activists who felt they sounded rightwing.

A deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius is being “finalised” after winning approval from Donald Trump's US, Downing Street has said. PA Media says:

The plan will see the UK give up sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory but pay to lease back the strategically important Diego Garcia military base, which is used by the US.

Discussions are ongoing between the UK and the Mauritian government over the terms of the deal.

“The finalisation of the deal is ongoing,” the PM's spokesperson said.

US President Trump indicated his backing for the deal during Keir Starmer's visit to Washington in February, saying: “I have a feeling it's going to work out very well”.

The PM's spokesperson said: “You will have seen from the president that he recognised the strength of the deal.

“I think we are now working with the Mauritian government to finalise the deal and sign the treaty.

“My understanding is it's now between us and the Mauritian government to finalise the deal, following the discussions with the US.”

Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said: “Labour should have the courage to come to the House of Commons and face scrutiny over their deal to surrender the Chagos Islands and pay for the privilege.

“This remains a very bad deal for British taxpayers – and we now know money is going to be frontloaded to Mauritius, at a time when Labour is stripping vulnerable pensioners of their winter fuel payments and whacking family farms and businesses with punishing taxes.”

Kemi Badenoch has given credence to a conspiracy theory about the Netflix hit Adolescence being based on a real story, but involving a black boy not a white boy.

This has been described as wholly untrue by Jack Thorne, the writer and co-creator of the series, which has been praised by Keir Starmer for the way it has opened up a debate about the radicalisation of young men.

Starmer met Thorne, and some of the shows other creators, in Downing Street this week, along with charities engaged in child protection, and the PM said he would like as many pupils as possible to watch the series.

The four-part drama is about a 13-year-old boy arrested for the murder of a girl at his school. The Guardian's reviewer described it as “the most devastating and immaculately scripted and played series I have ever seen – as close to televisual perfection as you can get”.

In an interview with GB News, asked if she has seen it, Badenoch replied:

Well, I think Adolescence is a fictional story. It's based on a real story, but my understanding is that the boy who committed that crime was not white.

So, people can do whatever they like in fiction. The prime minister should not be building policy on fiction. He should be building policy on reality. What is the reality? Phones are disrupting schools and not enough schools have effective bans.

Badenoch went on to talk about the Tory policy to ban mobile phones in schools. In an earlier LBC interview this morning she said that she had not actually watched the programme, because “I don't have time to watch anything these days, to be honest.”

Speaking to LBC, Badenoch also stated her belief that Adolescence was based on a true story. She said:

The story which it is based on has been fundamentally changed and so creating policy on a work of fiction rather than on reality is the real issue.

But, in an interview last week on the News Agents podcast, Thorne said there was no truth in the claim that he had adapted a real story involving a black boy. He said:

They've claimed that Stephen [Graham] and I based it on a story and so they're saying that we race swapped it, because we were basically here and then ended up there, and everything else, and nothing is further from the truth. 

I have told a lot of real-life stories in my time. I know the harm that can come when you take elements of a real-life story, and you put it on screen, and the people aren't expecting it. There is no part of this that's based on a true story, not one single part.

Asked about critics who complained about the main character being white, Thorne said:

It's absurd to say that this is only committed by black boys, it's absurd, it's not true. And history shows a lot of cases of kids from all races committing these crimes. 

We're not making a point about race with this. We are making a point about masculinity. We're trying to get inside a problem. We're not saying this is one thing or another. We're saying this is about boys.

The claim that Adolescence was based on a real story involving a black boy has been circulated on social media, including by people claiming that the colour of the main character was changed to conform with an anti-white agenda.

Ian Miles Cheong, a prominent rightwing commentator on X, floated this argument last month in a post that has attracted 4.8m views saying:

Netflix has a show called Adolescence that's about a British knife killer who stabbed a girl to death on a bus and it's based on real life cases such as the Southport murderer.

So guess what. They race swapped the actual killer from a black man/migrant to a white boy and the story has it so he was radicalized online by the red pill movement.

Just the absolute state of anti-white propaganda.

This attracted a comment from Elon Musk, the X owner, billionaire Trump ally and far-right provocateur, saying: “Wow.”

Badenoch has been accused, including by Keir Starmer at PMQs, of spending too much time reading social media.

Lisa Smart, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson, says she is in the unusual position of agreeing with much of what the Conservative spokesperson said. She also asks about China, and in particular about China's application to build a new super embassy in China.

Jarvis says national security has been the core priority for the government in dealing with the embassy application. But he says there is a limit to what he can say because the final decision will be taken by Angela Rayner, as housing secretary, in a quasi-judicial capacity.

Jarvis is responding to Philp.

He says he can understand why Philp is asking about China.

Countries will be considered separately, he says.

He says he won't speculate on what countries may or may not be included in the Firs (foreign influence registration scheme) enhanced tier in future.

On China, the government's policy is to “coperate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must”.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, is responding to Jarvis.

He welcomes the decision about Russia.

But he says Jarvis ignored “the elephant in the room”, China. Why was he silent?

Philp goes on:

We know China engages in industrial scale espionage, seeking to steal technology from government, universities and from industry.

They repress Chinese citizens here, and have sought to infiltrate our political system. In 2022 it was exposed by MI5 that China sought to infiltrate this very parliament via their agent, Christine Lee.

China has set up undeclared and illegal police stations in the UK and in December China placed a bounty on the head of three Hong Kong dissidents living in the UK.

He says MI5 and the FBI have both warned about the “epic threat” posed by China.

Dan Jarvis, the security miniser is now making a Commons statement about the foreign influence registration scheme, an initiative to allow the government to monitor people lobbying on behalf of foreign governments in the UK. It is part of the National Security Act 2023.

Jarvis says it will go live in July.

The scheme imposes routine requirements for people lobbying on behalf of foreign governments, but it also has an enhanced tier, covering hostile countries, where the rules are much tighter. If a country is in this tier, anyone carrying out activity in the UK on behalf of the country, or an entity linked to it, will have to register. Failure to comply will be an offence.

The government has already said that Iran will be in the enhanced tier.

Today Jarvis says Russia will also be in the enhanced tier.

The Green party has also criticised the government's decision to introduce the sentencing guidelines (pre-sentence reports) bill. In a statement, the Green MP Siân Berry said:

It has been chilling to witness the government pile pressure on an independent body which has been nothing but clear about the importance of these guidelines for passing effective sentences.

The new guidelines, which were publicly consulted on, would have helped create safer sentencing for many women, parents, pregnant and young people, for whom extreme custodial sentences can compound the harm that led to their offending in the first place. This delay will condemn too many people to unjust punishment while we wait for new plans.

Pre-sentencing reports offer judges information, they do not determine sentences. Politicians' wilful misunderstanding of these processes is dangerous and will cause irrevocable harm for many if this bill is passed.

In the Commons the Labour MP Nadia Whittome said she was alarmed by the implication that, if the Sentencing Council guidelines are withdrawn, judges would not be advised to get pre-sentence reports before sentencing pregnant women.

Mahmood said the bill would not affect policy relating to pregnant offenders, because there is already court of appeal precedent saying pre-sentence reports should be obtained before pregnant women are sentenced.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Many of the people displaced by Eacop project were inadequately rehoused or compensated, report says

People displaced from their homes alongside the site of an oil pipeline under construction in Uganda have complained of being inadequately rehoused or compensated.

When completed, the East African crude oil pipeline (Eacop) will transport oil from the Tilenga and Kingfisher oilfields in western Uganda to the port of Tanga in Tanzania.

The project – a partnership of the governments of both countries, the French oil company TotalEnergies, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation – has been touted by Uganda as transformative for the country's economy. However, from the start, it has faced criticism over its potential impact on important ecosystems and displaced people.

About 13,000 people in Uganda and Tanzania have been displaced by the pipeline. Those obliged to move were given the option of resettlement or cash compensation.

On Tuesday, Haki Defenders Foundation, a Kampala-based nonprofit, and the University of Sheffield released a report based on interviews with 100 people affected by the pipeline in Uganda, including those whose land had been compulsorily acquired.

The researchers found that although the project included a resettlement plan in accordance with local laws and international best practices that emphasise restoration or improvement of livelihoods, many people reported unfair and inadequate compensation and a lack of transparency.

Those who chose resettlement moved to designated areas such as the Kyakaboga resettlement camp. The researchers found people were given uniform houses, regardless of household sizes, meaning larger households are overcrowded. A typical resettlement house consists of one bedroom and a living room.

The researchers also found that the resettlement sites lack basic infrastructure, with people having to travel long distances to access water, markets and medical facilities.

Among those who chose cash compensation, the researchers found many had felt under pressure to accept terms they did not fully understand due to language barriers and a lack of access to legal advice.

The report says that many people found the monetary compensation inadequate to secure new land or rebuild their livelihoods. Land was often undervalued, and compensation for residential structures was calculated based on government rates that did not account for regional variations or actual rebuilding costs.

In September, the Uganda government took landowners who refused to move to court.

TotalEnergies said the land acquisition process was being “carried out in accordance with the stringent standards of the International Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the World Bank, aimed at ensuring compensation for affected populations”. A spokesperson added that both Total and Eacop “take a proactive approach to ensuring that the projects are implemented in accordance with internationally recognized human rights standards”.

Spokespeople for Eacop and the Ugandan energy ministry did not respond to requests for comment, but Eacop has previously said it was “committed to world-class environmental and social compliance” and was carrying out land acquisition “in compliance with national laws and the applicable international standards”.

Jonathan Silver, a professor of urban geography at the University of Sheffield and co-author of the study, said the research aimed to show how large-scale infrastructure projects affected lives. “We cannot forget the lived experiences of those displaced,” he said. “We should pay attention to the ways in which projects such as Eacop cause a spectrum of harm.”

A total of 6.5bn barrels of crude oil were discovered in western Uganda in 2006. According to an analysis by the Climate Accountability Institute, transporting, refining and burning oil would produce 379m tonnes of global carbon emissions over the 25-year operation of the pipeline.

The project, which is due to be completed next year, is expected to cost about $5bn (£3.87bn).

The researchers also found that authorities in Uganda had suppressed dissent about the project by affected people, activists and community-based organisations. People have been denied permits to hold peaceful protests, and where the assemblies have taken place, security forces have violently dispersed them.

As part of what activists call a government crackdown on protesters against Eacop, 11 environmental activists were charged with “common nuisance” and remanded after a rally in Kampala in February.

Dr Tom Ogwang, a senior lecturer in political economy of natural resource at Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda, said it was important for concerns about the pipeline to be addressed. “If people feel they have been given a raw deal, then their hearts and minds will never be for that project,” said Ogwang, who has researched Eacop's impacts.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Education minister criticises ‘extreme' Coalition stance as treasurer warns threat to funding comes ‘right from the Doge playbook'

Peter Dutton has left the door open to slashing the federal education department as part of his pledge to sack 41,000 public servants. Responding to questions about a “woke agenda” in curriculums, the opposition leader suggested students were being “indoctrinated” at school – a move Labor has described as being pulled “from the Doge playbook”.

The opposition leader has refused to say exactly where or how he would cut the public service, but on Tuesday indicated cuts could fall on “back-office operations”, and that he could put conditions on federal education funding.

This prompted a stinging response from the education union and the federal education minister. Jason Clare accused Dutton of an “extreme” and “dangerous” agenda reminiscent of Donald Trump, who signed an executive order last month ordering the US education department be dismantled.

“That should put the fear of God into any Australian that cares about our kids,” Clare said.

The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, echoed him, saying Dutton “threatened cuts to school funding, which was right from the Doge [Elon Musk's so-called department of government efficiency] playbook”.

“We also know that he wants to Americanise Medicare as well,” Chalmers told reporters on Tuesday afternoon.

“This is Doge-y Dutton, taking his cues and policies straight from the US.”

On ABC's Afternoon Briefing, Labor MP Josh Burns agreed that Dutton sounded like “our friends in America” and accused him of “playing … culture wars”.

At a Sky News forum on Monday night in his electorate of Dickson, Dutton was asked what the Coalition would do to combat “the woke agenda” in education.

The Liberal party leader did not use the word “woke”, as the questioner did, but responded that the federal government could “influence” state governments about what schools taught.

“We do provide funding to the state governments and we can condition that funding,” Dutton said.

“We should be saying to the states … that we want our kids to be taught the curriculum … not be guided into some sort of an agenda that's come out of universities,” he said.

“That's a debate that we need to hear more from parents on. I think there is a silent majority on this issue right across the community.”

The Greens accused Dutton – who has previously hinted the education department could be reduced if he was elected – of seeking to hold education funding to ransom.

Dutton began his answer on Monday night by saying the federal education department employs “thousands and thousands of people” but “doesn't own or run a school”.

“Which is why people ask: ‘Why is there is a department of thousands and thousands of people in Canberra called the education department if we don't have a school or employ a teacher?'” he said.

Dutton doubled down on the topic on Tuesday. He did not provide specific examples of lessons or subjects he viewed as “woke”, but raised examples of university lecturers joining political protests and said the Coalition's curriculum would “reflect community standards”.

He did not deny that he would look to cut the education department when asked, answering: “We have said we want to take waste out of the federal budget and put back into frontline services.”

He said, however, that the current Labor budget funding to health and education was “our commitment”.

“I want to make sure that we are spending money on frontline services, not back-office operations,” Dutton said when asked, separately, if he would pledge not to make cuts to health, education, ABC or SBS.

“I support young Australians being able to think freely, being able to assess what is before them, and not being told and indoctrinated by something that is the agenda of others.”

Asked on ABC's Afternoon Briefing on Tuesday if he thought children were being “indoctrinated” in schools, Liberal MP Keith Wolahan said it was “loaded language”. But he argued teachers should not bring “radical politics” into the classroom.

“If you are telling your students there is only one particular view or only one is acceptable, that's not fair on the students and it's not fair on the parents paying taxes for that to be put into schools,” he said.

Clare highlighted that the current curriculum was “the curriculum that the Scott Morrison government put in place”.

“Peter Dutton has no ideas of his own, no plan for Australia, just half-baked ideas imported from the US,” the education minister claimed.

In a press conference, he pointed to recent Albanese government funding deals with states on education agreements and said he was focused on more children finishing high school.

“Peter Dutton isn't focused on the fundamentals. I think [it] shows that he's distracted by these culture wars,” Clare said.

The Australian Education Union president, Correna Haythorpe, accused Dutton of copying Trump – a comparison Dutton has previously rejected as a “sledge”.

“Now he is taking a leaf from the Trump playbook by going for the Department of Education by threatening to cut thousands of jobs, control what teachers teach – and pull funding if they don't comply with his ideology,” Haythorpe said.

“Peter Dutton's proposed control of the school curriculum is chilling, when we see what is happening in the US with book banning and the destruction of teachers' professional autonomy.”

Dutton had briefly touched on the topic in his budget reply speech last Thursday, saying the Coalition would “restore a curriculum that teaches the core fundamentals in our classrooms”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Tens of millions of dollars is being withheld for Planned Parenthood chapters across the US in an attempt by the Trump administration to force the clinics to change their operations, Politico reports.

The clinics, which provide important healthcare services for low-income Americans have been cited for “possible violations” of the president's executive orders, according to letters issued to nine chapters on Monday.

The Department of Health and Human Services has given the organization 10 days to provide evidence they will comply with the executive orders including those that ban diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

The administration referenced Planned Parenthood's mission statements and other public-facing messaging that highlight their “commitment to black communities” and also stated the funding was being frozen due to the organization's willingness to serve undocumented immigrants.

More from Politico:

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement that the withheld funds would cause ‘devastation.'

‘We know what happens when health care providers cannot use Title X funding: people across the country suffer, cancers go undetected, access to birth control is severely reduced, and the nation's STI crisis worsens,' she said.

Trump said Wednesday will be “Liberation Day” when he announces reciprocal tariffs on nearly all US trading partners. Global stock markets were a sea of red on Monday and investors fled to gold amid recession fears.

The Trump administration has announced a review of federal contracts and grants at Harvard University over allegations of antisemitism.

Senate majority leader John Thune said he believes Donald Trump is “probably messing with you” with his remarks on Sunday that there are “methods” by which he could run for a third term.

A coalition of civil rights groups filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking to block portions of Donald Trump's executive order that would require voters to prove their citizenship in order to vote.

Trump took aim at ticket scalping in a new executive order signed today, which directs the Department of Justice and the FTC to crack down on ticket resellers who price-gouge.

Tens of millions of dollars is being withheld for Planned Parenthood chapters across the US in an attempt by the Trump administration to force the clinics to change their operations.

A federal judge has put the Trump administration plans to deport hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants on pause, ruling Monday that protections struck down by officials should be reinstated while lawsuits continue.

Some GOP senators are speaking out against Trump's tariffs on Canada and are considering signing on their support for a resolution blocking them, CNN reports.

Senator Rand Paul has signed on as a cosponsor of the resolution, expected to come to a vote tomorrow. Senator Susan Collins, meanwhile, highlighted how the brewing trade war could impact Maine.

“Imposing tariffs on Canada, which is our closest neighbor, a friendly ally, is a huge mistake and will cause disruption in the economies of both countries,” Collins told reporters on Monday, who noted that she wore a Canadian flag pin alongside a US flag pin on her lapel.

At least four Republicans must join the 47 Democrats who have pledged support for the resolution for it to pass. But, according to Politico, it's unlikely to get a vote in the House.

GOP leadership worked language into the stopgap funding bill to bar any member of Congress from calling for a vote on Trump's policies connected to declared national emergencies, including the fentanyl emergency cited as the justification for the tariffs.

Former congressman Anthony D'Esposito has been nominated by Trump as inspector general for the labor department. D'Esposito, a former NYPD detective who lost his bid for re-election in 2024 after just two years in office, came under fire last year after a NYT investigation revealed he had put a woman he was having an affair with and his fiancee's daughter on his payroll. He paid them a combined total of $29,000 and the actions could have violated congressional code of conduct rules.

D'Esposito denied any wrongdoing at the time, and called the investigation a “partisan ‘hit piece'”.

The independent watchdogs are tasked with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse in federal agencies. The position has been vacant since Trump fired former labor department IG, Larry Turner, along with 16 other IGs during his first week in office.

Trump said at the time he would “put good people in there that will be very good”.

A federal judge has put the Trump administration plans to deport hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants on pause, ruling Monday that protections struck down by officials should be reinstated while lawsuits continue.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) enables migrants escaping armed conflicts, natural disasters or other destabilizing issues to live and work in the US. Trump administration officials sought to end the humanitarian protections – which are codified by law – for Venezuelans who were granted 18-month extensions by the Biden administration.

Ending the initiative could enable officials to deport close to 350,000 people, the New York Times reports, with hundreds of thousands more facing uncertainty later this year.

Judge Edward M Chen, a federal judge in San Francisco, found that the actions, undertaken by homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, would inflict severe harm, both on migrants and their families, and on communities across the US.

From the NYT:

In his ruling on Monday, Judge Chen said the government had failed “to identify any real countervailing harm” in continuing the program for Venezuelan TPS holders. He said the plaintiffs had also demonstrated they were likely to succeed in showing that the actions taken by the Ms. Noem were “unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.”

The secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, has issued an order to eliminate gender-specific physical fitness standards for combat roles in the military, a move that could mean fewer women will qualify for those positions.

“All combat roles are open to men and women but they must all meet the same, high standard,” Hegseth said in a post on social media. “No standards will be lowered and all combat roles will only have sex-neutral standards.”

Trump took aim at ticket scalping in a new executive order signed today, which directs the Department of Justice and the FTC to crack down on ticket resellers who price-gouge.

“I didn't know too much about it but I checked it out and it is a big problem,” Trump said before he signed the order, adding that his friend, Kid Rock – or Bob, as the president referred to him – had been trying to do something about it for 20 years.

Robert Ritchie, better known by his moniker “Kid Rock”, was clad in a head-to-toe bright red ensemble, complete with an American flag decal emblazoned across his middle, and stood to Trump's right with his hands folded until he was asked to speak.

“It doesn't matter your politics,” Kid Rock said, outlining how the issue has impacted his ability to offer lower-priced entry to his concerts for fans. “The artists don't see any of that money and ultimately I think this is a great first step.”

The order directs officials at the FTC and the justice department to ensure scalpers comply with tax rules and pushes for more price transparency through the ticket-selling process. But Kid Rock is hoping for more.

“I would love down the road if there would be legislation and we can put a cap on the resale of tickets,” he said. “I am a capitalist and a deregulation guy,” he added with a laugh. “But they have tried this in some places in Europe and it seems to be the only thing for us as artists to be able to get the tickets into the hands of the fans at the prices we set.”

House majority leader Steve Scalise has dismissed the idea of Donald Trump seeking a third term, suggesting that the president's remarks yesterday were designed to “get people talking”.

“I don't know what he was referring to. I never saw it,” Scalise told NBC News, adding:

You know, you see it like with Greenland, like with Panama canal. There's a lot of things the president talks about. Ultimately, it gets people talking and addresses some other issues too.

Asked if he would support changing the US Constitution to allow Trump to run for a third term, he said:

There's no proposal to change the constitution right now.

Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order today aimed at protecting fans from “exploitative ticket scalping”, a White House official said.

The order directs the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and attorney general, Pam Bondi, to ensure that ticket scalpers are in full compliance with the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service and others applicable law, according to a fact sheet seen by Reuters.

The order directs the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that competition laws are appropriately enforced in the concert and entertainment industry, it said.

Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican, has left the hard-right House Freedom caucus, according to multiple reports.

“With a heavy heart, I am resigning from the Freedom Caucus,” Luna wrote in a letter obtained by Axios. Luna, a strong Trump ally, is the fourth member that the Freedom caucus has lost or ejected in the last two years, it says.

According to reports, her withdrawal comes amid a break with her colleagues on whether the House should allow proxy voting for new parents.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Office of US trade representative releases report on ‘foreign trade barriers' including Australia's biosecurity regime for imported beef, pork and poultry

Anthony Albanese has said he will not bend to president Donald Trump after the US trade body placed Australia's subsidised medicine system, meat and fruit industries and refreshed media bargaining code in its crosshairs for potential tariffs.

On Wednesday US time, Trump is expected to announce a series of historic tariffs aimed at revitalising the superpower's domestic industry.

Overnight, the office of the US trade representative released its report on “foreign trade barriers”, listing Australia's biosecurity regime on importing beef, pork and poultry from US producers as one of its major grievances.

The trade body also took issue with Australia offering generic drugs at lower prices without notifying US patent owners, plans to strengthen laws forcing foreign social media companies to pay Australian media companies for news and plans to lift local content quotas for streaming services.

Albanese on Tuesday said he was concerned the report targeted the news bargaining incentive while raising concerns about pharmaceuticals and Australia's comprehensive biosecurity controls. He said the three issues were not up for negotiation.

“The idea that we would weaken biosecurity laws is like cutting off your nose to spite your face. In order to defend the exports that total less than 5% of Australia's exports, you undermine our biosecurity system. Not on my watch,” the PM told reporters in Adelaide.

“I have very clearly indicated Australia is not negotiating over the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We are not negotiating over the news bargaining code. We will not undermine our biosecurity.”

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said on Tuesday he supported Albanese's decision to stand up to Trump on tariffs, but claimed he would have more “strength of leadership and experience” than the current prime minister.

The US trade ambassador praised Trump for recognising “the wide-ranging and harmful foreign trade barriers” impacting US exporters.

“Under his leadership, this administration is working diligently to address these unfair and non-reciprocal practices, helping restore fairness and put hardworking American businesses and workers first in the global market,” Jamieson Greer said in a statement accompanying the report's release.

The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who faced his own troubles with Trump in 2017, said leaders had to be prepared to be “as tough as him”.

“The bottom line is, you see [an Australian prime minister] will get the respect from the United States because Trump will see ‘this guy is standing up to me, he's tough and he has the backing of his country',” Turnbull told the National Press Club on Tuesday.

Turnbull said Dutton faced a double-edged sword in standing up to Trump – he needed to look tough but also risked alienating part of the conservative section of his fanbase who strongly supported the controversial US president.

“The difficulty of taking on Trump is you're then taking on the most popular person in the ecosystem in which you live,” he said.

“Albanese doesn't have that. He doesn't have the advantage of great connections through … plutocrats and billionaires, but he also doesn't have the problem that his political base, his media environment … [are] fanboys for Donald Trump.”

The Australian government has said it would continue arguing its case to wind back US tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminium exports announced in March as part of Trump's worldwide trade barriers on all nations.

Trump in February had promised Anthony Albanese “great consideration” for a carve-out, despite the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, consistently accusing Australia of “dumping” its steel and aluminium in the US.

The US is expected to announce further tariffs on 2 April – or “liberation day” as Trump calls it – targeting countries that have the largest trade imbalances with the US.

Trump last week announced sweeping 25% tariffs on foreign cars. Possible future tariffs could impact the agriculture and medicine sectors, with Australian farmers anxiously waiting to hear whether meat exports would be hit in the next round.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The US president's attack on the Smithsonian isn't about truth. It's about erasure, and ‘erasure is violence'

Last week, Donald Trump issued another executive order, this one aimed directly at the Smithsonian Institution, and called for “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”. He contended that the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and that it advocates “narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive”. Specifically, the order targeted American history and art that focused on stories of race and racism.

Being responsible for the distillation of the nation's narrative is no small thing. The Smithsonian oversees 21 museums, libraries, research centers and the National zoo. Every year millions of people visit various sites that are free to the public. The collection of museums represents the pinnacle of public history and the story America tells the world about itself.

But Trump's executive order is not about restoring the truth. Quite the opposite. It creates false narratives and myths that promote the supremacy of whiteness. This executive order has the potential for harm because erasure is violence; it robs the public of the truth. Because there is no way to explain slavery and segregation as not “inherently harmful and oppressive”, Trump would rather not explain it at all.

One of the most popular Smithsonian sites is the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), affectionately known by Black people as the “Blacksonian”. The museum was conceived of as early as 1915 by Black veterans who fought during the civil war and wanted recognition for their service and valor. These soldiers were not only left out of national memorials and ceremonies, but also faced tremendous discrimination often culminating in deadly violence when they returned home. They wanted a space and memorial that would honor their achievements and pivotal contributions.

It was impossible to separate the story of Black military service and valor from racial discrimination and violence. Similarly, one cannot separate out the “good” from the “bad” in creating an honest narrative about the United States. Accordingly, the NMAAHC holds a special place in America, one where the complexity of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are recognized as founding fathers and slaveholders. There is no abolitionist movement without slavery. There is no suffrage movement without women's denial. There is no civil rights movement without racism and oppression. These are the facts. Museums exist to collect, preserve and exhibit the past as it happened. Archivists and curators care deeply about their mission to be accurate and authentic.

An America that will re-erect statues and rename military bases after Confederate generals, while simultaneously stripping the evidence of race and racism from the Smithsonian history museums isn't correcting the historical record. That nation is whitewashing the political record to legitimize the actions of those in power. Slavery is a fact. Jim Crow is a fact. Racist and exclusionary immigration laws are a fact. Japanese internment is a fact. Native American removal and extermination is a fact. Mexican and Mexican American expulsion is a fact. Removing them from the sight of the public doesn't change the facts, it only changes one's perspective on and relation to them politically.

Museums offer cautionary tales, hard lessons about where the country has been and where we hope to never be again. They hold a great deal of public trust, perhaps more than schools, media, newspapers or even films. Patrons get to experience first hand documents, letters, original photographs and artefacts. Museums are public time capsules of where we have been. I will never forget seeing Emmett Till's casket, Harriet Tubman's shawl, Nat Turner's Bible or an early flag of the First Republic of Haiti. These artefacts do more than defy the odds by still existing; they tell a powerful story about who people were during the times that they lived. Museums should not be party to culture wars. Our history is a collective memory whether Trump likes it or not.

A nation that cannot reckon with its past, triumph and tragedy, is ultimately a weaker one; puffed up with its own delusions of grandeur. There is more power in the truth than there is in a lie. The efforts in the last 50 years to give the powerless a place politically, academically and legally is not from a revisionist view of American history, but rather a move to make all of America the democratic nation it claims to be.

Moreover, key features of the NMAAHC reflect optimism, spirituality and joy because anti-Blackness is not the totality of the Black experience. The museum showcases Black food pathways, artistry, music, sports, film, ingenuity and technological advancements. It is a celebration of achievement despite the barriers and challenges racism presents. But even if museums solely focused on slavery, they still deserve a right to exist. America has been a land with enslaved people longer than it has been a county without slavery.

Are museums contested spaces? Absolutely. No one space can include everything and offer an exhaustive history of a country, person or movement. But what is included or not included is painstakingly considered. Museums are bipartisan sites where everyone can grapple with the good, bad and the ugliness of nation making. But Trump will not stop until every American relic reflects his imaginary world view, a place where few can see their lived experiences on full display.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Aid agencies say the workers were killed and buried in a mass grave in Rafah in southern Gaza. Residents described being shot at along the evacuation route.

JAFFA, Israel — Israel on Monday ordered the evacuation of most of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, warning that the military is “returning to combat in great force” in the area, a day after the bodies of more than a dozen emergency personnel, missing for a week after responding to a strike, were recovered from a mass grave in the city.

Over the past week, the Israeli military has pushed back into Rafah, launching air and artillery strikes, sending troops into several neighborhoods and forcing Palestinians who had recently returned under a ceasefire to flee once again, according to residents who escaped the bombardments and gunfire.

The evacuation order Monday was the largest since Israel resumed military operations in Gaza nearly three weeks ago, covering swaths of Rafah that, while mostly destroyed, hosted many families who returned during a two-month ceasefire that began in January. In a statement, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Avichay Adraee directed Palestinians toward Mawasi in western Gaza, an Israeli-designated “humanitarian zone” that many Rafah residents had left just weeks ago.

Israel has long seen the control of Rafah, which sits on the border with Egypt, as crucial to stemming the flow of weapons and goods to Hamas, the militant group that ruled Gaza before the war. But Israeli leaders have also warned of plans to expand operations across the territory, including a much larger ground campaign that could culminate in the long-term occupation of Gaza.

The Washington Post spoke to eight residents who recently fled Rafah and described harrowing scenes as intensive strikes began in the city late on March 22, days after Israel broke a two-month ceasefire with Hamas and unleashed strikes that killed more than 400 people in a single night on March 18.

“They bombed the house right in front of us,” said Sanaa Abu Taha, 42, who was staying in the rubble of her home in the Saudi neighborhood of Rafah before fleeing on March 23. “Three people on our street were killed. … The shooting did not stop.”

Amid the chaos of the first night, the Palestine Red Crescent Society dispatched two ambulances to the scene of a strike in Rafah's Hashashin area shortly before 4 a.m. on March 23, according to PRCS spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh.

The dispatchers soon lost contact with one of the ambulances, she said, and paramedics in the other vehicle were sent to search for their missing colleagues. Not long afterward, they relayed what they saw: The ambulance was found near vehicles belonging to the United Nations and Gaza's civil defense. The paramedics had been shot and were wounded, Farsakh said, and PRCS dispatched two more ambulances to retrieve the injured.

The organization also lost contact with those ambulances, but not before one of the medics briefly called the dispatch center and Israeli forces could be heard speaking in the background, Farsakh said.

For days, the paramedics were missing, along with a team from Gaza's civil defense and a staffer with the U.N. But on Sunday, the PRCS, the civil defense force and the U.N. all said they had recovered their colleagues' bodies in a mass grave in Rafah, including eight paramedics, six civil defense workers and one U.N. staff member. In a statement, PRCS called the incident a “massacre.”

“They were killed in their uniforms. Driving their clearly marked vehicles. Wearing their gloves. On their way to save lives,” Jonathan Whittall, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Gaza and the West Bank, wrote on X.

He described the efforts to find the teams, including on the first of day of Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. “This should never have happened,” Whittall wrote.

In a statement, the IDF said its forces opened fire at vehicles after they “advanced suspiciously toward the troops … eliminating a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.” The IDF said an initial investigation found that “some” of the vehicles had been ambulances and fire trucks. It did not provide evidence of the claim that militants were in the convoy and did not respond when asked why the first responders were buried in a mass grave.

The IDF also said that the vehicles were moving “without prior coordination,” though Adraee, the military spokesman, published an evacuation order for the area on his X account several hours after the incident. Farsakh said the area was not a “red zone” when the ambulances were dispatched, as it is the organization's policy to generally not send first responders to closed military areas where coordination is needed.

“We demand answers and justice,” U.N. humanitarian affairs chief Tom Fletcher said Monday.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. It launched the war in response to the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, a rampage that killed about 1,200 people.

Hamas and allied militants also took 251 hostages into Gaza, some of whom are still in captivity. The IDF said Saturday that its “troops located and recovered findings associated with the body of” Menachem Godard, who was killed on Oct. 7, 2023. The IDF said the remains were found in “an outpost area in Rafah” belonging to Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally.

Residents said that as they fled Rafah last week, they were being fired on by the Israeli military or seeing the bodies of people who were shot along the evacuation routes. “It was like a video game,” said Mustafa Jabar, 36, who said he saw more than 10 bodies on the ground as he fled the Saudi neighborhood with his extended family on March 23.

Haroun al-Karnab, 29, said “the gunfire was random” as he evacuated from Rafah's Tel al-Sultan neighborhood the same day, adding that it did not appear that Israeli troops were clashing with militants. In his post on X, Whittall said he and his team “witnessed a woman shot in the back of the head” as they were traveling to the area where the paramedics were buried. “When a young man tried to retrieve her, he too was shot.”

In a statement, the military denied firing on civilians leaving Rafah, saying that it “completely rejects the claims.”

“The IDF allows the civilian population to evacuate from combat zones in the Gaza Strip to protect noncombatant civilians,” it said.

Rafah residents said that the IDF dropped leaflets and sent text messages with an evacuation route but that they had little notice, could take few if any belongings and were fearful of the path provided. The IDF route directed Palestinians to a makeshift checkpoint and inspection cameras set up near an abandoned U.N. warehouse.

Haya Abu Labda, 25, said she lost her brother-in-law, 15-year-old Mustafa, in the mayhem of the evacuation. The family had split up because her husband wanted to wait with his grandmother, she said. Neighbors later said they saw Mustafa lying on the ground, shot dead, near a military checkpoint. He had a cart carrying some food and clothes, and it appeared he had taken a route not designated by the IDF, Abu Labda said.

With no belongings and nowhere to go, the extended Abu Labda family has fled to Mawasi, which they left only weeks ago.

“Until this moment, I still cannot believe what happened,” she said.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

European officials are worried that measures against companies like Google and Meta could escalate the trade war, but they say Trump has shifted the goalposts.

ROME — Scrambling to respond to the Trump administration's cascading list of tariffs, the European Union is weighing whether to hit one of the most lucrative U.S. exports: billions of dollars' worth of digital services that American Big Tech companies sell to European consumers.

The debate over digital services risks expanding the trade war from manufactured goods such as cars, steel and whiskey to services from cloud storage and satellite internet provided by U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Google, Meta and Elon Musk's Starlink network.

European officials, largely behind closed doors, have been debating for weeks the wisdom of targeting digital services with tariffs and other measures: part of a carrot-and-stick response that would also include new trade concessions to Washington. As attempts to negotiate with the Trump administration have hit a wall, several nations within the 27-member E.U. bloc are more seriously pressing to include digital services in countermeasures, according to three European officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Some nations, including France, are actively pushing for a tougher response that includes digital services, one of the officials said, adding that others, such as more Trump-friendly Italy, remain generally opposed, seeing such a move as only provoking the White House into further escalation.

But it was still possible that the bloc could unite to impose “some partial measures against American services,” the official said.

A second official said that targeting digital services had previously been viewed as an overly provocative step, but the Trump administration's continued escalation and refusal to negotiate could change that. “The goal posts have been shifted by the Americans.”

Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo addressed the question of targeting digital services Monday after meeting with the E.U. trade commissioner. “Let's wait and see what the measures are that the U.S. puts on the table, and depending on that, we will react,” he told reporters.

The discussions underscore Europe's frustrations with what they call Trump's selective grievances about trade, which have largely focused on the U.S. deficit with Europe in manufactured goods. While the E.U. enjoys a trade surplus with the United States of $170 billion on goods, it shoulders a deficit of $118 billion in services, according to 2023 European trade data.

The European officials cautioned that there is no agreed-on hit list of digital services. But discussions on what services to target could be accelerated depending on the scope of new U.S. tariffs set to be announced Wednesday. The Trump administration has already declared stinging global tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum. The Europeans remain worried that new tariffs will go significantly further, hitting food, pharmaceuticals and other key goods.

A move to target digital services risks opening an even wider rift with the White House, which warned Europe in February that its digital regulations could lead to reciprocal tariffs. The E.U. has spearheaded global tech regulation and described it as essential to preventing abuse. But Silicon Valley has long bristled at what it sees as the bloc's overly onerous rules that firms say are aimed at stifling U.S. tech companies in Europe.

Vice President JD Vance singled out the bloc's signature Digital Services Act and what he called Europe's “excessive regulation” of artificial intelligence during a speech in February at a tech summit in Paris, in comments that echoed U.S. corporate complaints.

European fines — including a penalty of 150 million euros ($162 million) that France heaped on Apple on Monday for abuse of competition laws — have also drawn U.S. ire. The European Commission, the E.U.'s executive branch, is also expected in the coming days to announce new penalties against Meta and Apple for violations of its Digital Markets Act.

“Europe has been targeting U.S. tech companies with its regulatory framework, but moving directly to tariffs would be an escalation,” said Kay Jebelli, senior director for Europe at the Chamber of Progress, a tech industry coalition group whose partners include Apple, Uber, Amazon and Google. “Europe will understandably retaliate against U.S. tariffs, but targeting tech on top of its existing regulatory interventions will only widen the digital divide.”

European officials remain cautious — concerned about provoking Trump, but also wary of undermining the bloc's own argument that its actions to date against U.S. tech companies have been regulatory in nature rather than punitive or anticompetitive.

Any move to target U.S. digital service exports would hit one of the biggest profit centers for tech companies. The U.S. exported $283 billion in digital services to Europe in 2021, more than double what it exported to the entire Asia-Pacific region, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

European officials are also discussing possible trade concessions. They have signaled their willingness to reduce the 10 percent tariff on American autos and increase purchases of U.S.-made liquefied natural gas and defense equipment. The E.U. may also be willing to reverse course on some of the $26 billion in countermeasures it announced in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, two of the European officials said.

That response targeted a host of American goods, including Harley Davidson motorcycles, bourbon and soybeans. They were set to be phased in starting Tuesday but have been delayed until mid-month, giving the bloc more time to study the impact of the American tariffs set to be announced by Trump this week.

Maros Sefcovic, the European trade commissioner, has traveled twice to Washington seeking an off-ramp from the accelerating trade war but said that the Trump administration does not want to engage in concrete negotiations until after unveiling its measures Wednesday.

Many European exporters are putting enormous pressure on their governments to reach a truce on trade with the White House, even as others say the Europeans must be prepared to fire back.

European wine producers are already reporting massive shipments stuck at port amid cancellations from U.S. importers. Other Europe-based exporters say they have received desperate calls from their U.S. distributors, asking them to consider sharing the cost of Trump's tariffs to avoid big price hikes for American consumers. Still others, such as the Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari, have outlined price increases of up to 10 percent on some models.

The E.U. can tighten rules on Big Tech or limit U.S. companies' access to public contracts without resorting to its harshest measure, called the Anti-Coercion Instrument. That tool allows the bloc to target services to respond to economic pressure with sweeping countermeasures, such as revoking patents or blocking online streaming services and software licensing.

Such moves are considered a “nuclear option,” given that they could take the trade war to new heights of rhetoric while inflicting real economic damage on both sides of the Atlantic.

Europe's exporters are calling for a measured response. Francesco Mutti, chief executive of Italian food maker Mutti, a major tomato exporter, said European leaders should wait and see what further tariffs the U.S. imposes and seek to negotiate a solution.

But he also said that Apple, Netflix and other U.S. companies that do huge business in Europe should be fair game if the Trump administration imposes restrictions on items including European foods.

“Yes, absolutely yes,” he said, calling for a “proportionate” response. “This is a break, or a reduction, in relations. I do not understand the reason.”

One analyst called China's large-scale drills a “pre-invasion operation” as it ramps up attacks on Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, calling him a “parasite.”

With warships and a barrage of propaganda, the Chinese military launched large-scale military drills on Tuesday to protest Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's increasingly forceful rejection of Beijing's claim to rule the self-governed island democracy.

The exercises involve army, navy, air and rocket forces practicing a coordinated seizure of the sea and airspace around Taiwan, blockading Taiwanese sea lanes and launching attacks against maritime and ground targets, China's Eastern Theater Command said in a statement.

The announcement was accompanied by posters declaring that the Chinese military was “closing in” on “Taiwan separatists” and a series of unusually personal attacks on Lai. In one animation, the democratically elected president of Taiwan was depicted as a poisonous “parasite” trying to hijack Taiwan — until he ultimately met a fiery end.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office called the drills “severe punishment” for Lai's “rampant provocation” with recent actions that “exposed his ugly side of being anti-peace, anti-exchange, anti-democracy, and anti-humanity.”

“It's not just a drill,” said Huang Chung-ting, an associate research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, a government-funded think tank. “To be concrete about the threat these Chinese exercises pose to Taiwan, we should call it a pre-invasion operation.”

By specifically targeting Taiwan and blaming Lai, Huang said, China is engaging in “cognitive warfare” that is gradually making Taiwanese numb to the real threats they face.

The Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan but calls the island of 23 million its “sacred territory.” The party's powerful leader, Xi Jinping, calls unification “inevitable” and regularly threatens to take control by force if Taipei refuses to submit.

Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have continued to escalate since President Donald Trump entered the White House, as both Beijing and Taipei try to work out whether his “America First” foreign policy means the United States will pull back from protecting Taiwan.

While the U.S. is law-bound to help Taiwan boost its own defenses, Washington has always been deliberately vague about whether it would send American troops to help fend off a Chinese invasion.

Many in Taipei have watched Trump's ebbing support for Ukraine with concern that Taiwan could be next, although those fears have been partly alleviated by an internal Pentagon memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth calling for the U.S. military to prioritize deterring a Chinese takeover of Taiwan.

Beijing has sought to undermine Lai by exploiting rising doubts about American support.

“History proves that the U.S. only gives Taiwan superficial ‘rock-solid' support, while long preparing to ‘abandon Taiwan' for its own interests,” the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper said Tuesday.

Beijing especially dislikes Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party he leads for previously advocating formal independence. As vice president then as president, Lai softened his stance and promised to focus on keeping the peace across the Taiwan Strait.

But Beijing again expressed outrage last month when Lai labeled China a “foreign hostile force” and revived martial-law-era military courts to punish Chinese spies. He also pledged to raise defense spending to 3 percent of gross domestic product, the highest level in a decade.

From Beijing's perspective, Lai's designation was “another huge step on the path of provoking Taiwan independence,” said Xin Qiang, director of the Center for Taiwan Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.

Labeling China an outside power is “a huge provocation to Beijing politically and blocks the mainland's expectations for peaceful reunification,” Xin said.

Aside from calling him a parasite, the Chinese military also accused him of Joseph McCarthy-like tactics to take down his political opponents and likened him to the demon boss from “Black Myth: Wukong,” a popular Chinese video game.

“We want to warn the Lai administration that if they continue to pursue ‘independence,' the People's Liberation Army will take further action,” Lt. Col. Fu Zhengnan, a researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, told state media.

Professor Zheng Jian of Xiamen University's Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies even compared Lai to Adolf Hitler in using populism to drive young people against China.

Lai's office condemned the drills Tuesday and called Beijing a “recognized troublemaker” for its military harassment across the Asia-Pacific. “Taiwan's determination to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait remains unchanged,” spokeswoman Kuo Ya-hui said.

Beijing often uses extreme threats to put psychological pressure on Taiwan's leaders and sap the Taiwanese people's hope in their ability to defend against a Chinese attack.

Those tactics are increasingly combined with real-world preparation for an invasion, however.

Beijing has staged similar large-scale drills with increasing regularity over the past three years to probe Taiwan's defenses. The People's Liberation Army often uses the exercises to mimic blockades or potential lines of attack.

It was unclear how large the current drills will be or how long they will last. Unlike previous rounds, Eastern Theater Command did not give a planned conclusion date nor did it announce exclusion zones that would indicate the scale of operations planned.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry said that China sent 71 fighter jets and 21 warships, including an eight-vessel carrier strike group, into the air and seas close to Taiwan between 7 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. local time Tuesday.

Six teams of Chinese Coast Guard ships also took part in the drills, with two vessels entering restricted waters near one of Taiwan's outlying islands, Dongyin, on Tuesday, Taiwan's Coast Guard said.

This time, China appears to be focusing on “a single command theater's ability to conduct joint operations across the army, navy, air force and rocket forces,” said Lin Ying-yu, a Chinese military expert at Tamkang University in Taipei.

The gradual ratcheting up of activity in frequency and complexity raises the possibility that “drills could escalate into actual conflict,” Lin said.

The retreat of the RSF has revealed the scope of looting and destruction in a city that was once a refuge of last hope for the war-weary and displaced.

Sudan's capital was once a refuge for those fleeing a countryside ravaged by successive conflicts and climate crises. For years, the war-weary and displaced came to Khartoum on donkey carts and in rickety trucks, driving population growth that was expected to continue.

Only a few years ago, the city ranked among other burgeoning megalopolises — what The Washington Post in a 2021 report called Africa's rising cities, set to dominate the world's urban future. More growth and development — even if uneven and beset by the challenge of expanding squatter camps populated by more recent arrivals — appeared inexorable.

That was before the ruinous civil war began in 2023. Sudan's military last week recaptured Khartoum from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces after nearly two years of fighting.

Photographs reveal the extent of the destruction and looting of the capital's landmarks during a devastating conflict that has killed more than 150,000 people and created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

More than 6 million people lived in the city before the ongoing civil war began. A quarter of that population, according to U.N. estimates, or more than half, according to some researchers, settled in Khartoum after displacement by war, including the decades of conflict that eventually led to the independence of South Sudan in 2011.

The current war has displaced more than 11 million people internally and pushed nearly 4 million people out of the country, according to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration. Khartoum alone, fragmented into enclaves by the conflict, accounted for nearly a third of the displaced, according to IOM figures.

In the years leading up to the civil war, Khartoum was becoming a more cosmopolitan and fashionable city, with a lively street life, said Alden Young, an associate professor of history and global affairs at Yale and author of the book “Transforming Sudan.”

“There would be tons of civic gatherings on the banks of the Nile,” said Young, adding that one of the major challenges of reconstruction would involve welcoming back and housing people displaced from the city.

The army chief and de facto head of state, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, landed on the tarmac of Khartoum International Airport in a helicopter on Wednesday after it was recaptured by the military, kissing the ground as he emerged.

The airport was stormed and occupied by paramilitary forces in April 2023 — shuttering it for nearly two years, during which time much of the airport was destroyed. A photo showed the rusted carcass of a minivan outside the terminal on Thursday. In a nearby hangar were the charred remains of an aircraft.

“Khartoum is now free,” Burhan told journalists as he toured the remains of the war-ravaged presidential palace Wednesday.

From the outside, photographs showed the palace walls blackened by fire or shelling, and parts of the roof were destroyed. The grounds were overgrown.

In an arched hall of the palace, fallen masonry and other debris littered the ground. Another room was lined with shelves of charred documents.

The destruction of Khartoum has elevated the importance of other cities such as Port Sudan, which became the country's temporary administrative capital in 2023.

“One of the questions that everyone is asking is, will Khartoum be able to recapture its status as the capital of a united Sudan?” Young said.

Photographs released by the Sudanese National Corporation for Antiquities showed the country's national museum — once billed as a “sanctuary of African art and archaeology,” with artifacts dating back to the Stone Age — plundered of its treasures.

Fears of widespread looting surfaced early in the conflict, as footage on social media appeared to show fighters raiding the museum.

The Sudan Tribune posted a video of one of the few remaining artifacts: a large statue of King Taharqa, a Nubian from the Kingdom of Kush, in what is now known as Sudan, who ruled Egypt from 690 B.C. to 664 B.C.

The museum's windows were shattered and the entrance was piled with rubble.

When a 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar sent shockwaves into Thailand, Naruemon Thonglek and Chanpen Kaewnoi didn't immediately hear it also had collapsed a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, where their friends and families had been working

BANGKOK — When the earthquake that hit Myanmar sent its tremors to Thailand, Naruemon Thonglek didn't immediately know it also had collapsed a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok.

Seeing images of the debris on television news later, Naruemon immediately recognized the building where her long-time Burmese partner, his son and four of her friends had worked for the past month.

“My legs gave up. I lost all strength in my hands,” she said. “After the quake stopped I called him, messaged him, but there was no response. I couldn't contact him. I sent him voice messages and he never read it. Then I knew for sure that he must have been inside.”

At least 18 people died in Bangkok, Thailand's capital, more than 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) from the center of the magnitude 7.7 quake in Myanmar on Friday, which killed more than 2,000 people there. According to Myanmar state television, the quake has so far killed 2,065 people, with more than 3,900 injured and about 270 missing.

Relief agencies expect those numbers to rise sharply, since access is slow to remote areas where communications are down.

In Bangkok, 78 people remain missing. Thai authorities are racing against time to find anyone left alive under the ruins as the crucial 72-hour mark passes. While the authorities have said they detected possible sounds of life, so far only one person was pulled alive from the rubble.

Tavida Kamolvej, Bangkok's deputy governor, told reporters at the site Monday that crews are speeding up the search.

“Every second really counts,” she said.

Among those missing are the mother and younger sister of Chanpen Kaewnoi, who had been working at the site for a couple of months.

Chanpen said she couldn't contact them after the quake, but later was told by a survivor that they had been on the fifth floor of the 30-story building.

“He told me that they ran from the fifth floor, and once he reached the ground, the building just collapsed,” she said. “He said he couldn't find my mom and my sister. He said it was just a split second and he lost them.”

Naruemon said her partner, Kyi Tan, and the other five were assigned to work much higher up on the 26th floor. While her partner had extensive construction experience, this was his first high-rise project. As he left home on the morning of the quake, he said he would stay late in the hope of finishing his work by the end of the month.

Naruemon and Chanpen said they never heard their family members raise safety concerns while working at the building.

The authorities said they are investigating the cause of the building collapse as criticisms and concerns grow over safety and quality standards of Bangkok buildings. Chadchart Sittipunt, the city governor, has ordered a blanket inspection of all high-rise buildings in the capital.

Videos of the collapse show the building, which was meant to be a new State Audit Office, shaking a little before tumbling to the ground, sending a huge plume of dust into the sky as people scream and run away.

When Naruemon arrived at the site the following day, the scene of the ruins broke her spirit.

“I had a meltdown. I could only pray. I kept calling for them,” she said. “I wanted them to come back. I was so devastated. I didn't know what to do.”

For two days, Naruemon walked around near the site with her family and friends, hoping to see any developments as heavy machines and rescue crews searched for survivors. She prayed and performed a religious rite asking the spirits to protect her loved ones.

“I want everyone trapped there to be found. In whatever conditions, I'm ok with it,” she said. “I've already made some peace with it. It's been a few days already. A part of me still hopes they will survive, for a miracle, if it exists.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

By Andrew Osborn

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia cannot accept U.S. proposals to end the war in Ukraine in their current form because they do not address problems Moscow regards as having caused the conflict, a senior Russian diplomat said, suggesting U.S.-Russia talks on the subject had stalled.

The comments by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov suggest Moscow and Washington have so far been unable to bridge differences which President Vladimir Putin raised more than two weeks ago when he said U.S. proposals needed reworking.

They come as U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be growing increasingly impatient with what he has suggested might be foot-dragging over a wider deal by Moscow.

Trump in recent days has said he is ""pissed off"" with Putin and has spoken of imposing sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil if he feels Moscow is blocking a deal.

Ryabkov, a specialist in U.S.-Russia relations, said Moscow was not yet able to move forward with a deal however.

""We take the models and solutions proposed by the Americans very seriously, but we can't accept it all in its current form,"" Ryabkov was quoted by state media as telling the Russian magazine ""International Affairs"" in an interview released on Tuesday.

""As far as we can see, there is no place in them today for our main demand, namely to solve the problems related to the root causes of this conflict. It is completely absent, and that must be overcome.""

Putin has said he wants Ukraine to drop its ambitions to join NATO, Russia to control the entirety of four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, and the size of the Ukrainian army to be limited. Kyiv says those demands are tantamount to demanding its capitulation.

'VERY COMPLEX'

Asked about Trump's latest remarks about wanting Putin to do a deal on Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier on Tuesday that Moscow was ""continuing our contacts with the American side"".

""The subject is very complex. The substance that we are discussing, related to the Ukrainian settlement, is very complex. This requires a lot of extra effort.""

Russia also said on Tuesday it was fully complying with a U.S.-brokered moratorium on attacking Ukraine's energy facilities.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told state TV that Defence Minister Andrei Belousov had briefed Putin on alleged Ukrainian violations during a meeting of Russia's Security Council on Tuesday. Russia passed a list of the violations to U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Lavrov said.

Before the weekend, Trump had taken a more conciliatory stance towards Russia that has unnerved the United States' European allies as he tries to broker an end to the conflict in Ukraine, now in its fourth year.

But in recent days, and amid lobbying by Europeans such as Finland's president urging him to hold Russia to account, he has adopted a tougher tone.

President Donald Trump's administration is done with talking about the group war chat scandal. And so should everyone else now, too.

That appeared to be the message on Monday from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, after she was asked for an update on any review into the fiasco that saw the number of The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg accidentally added to an exchange on the messaging app Signal in which top Trump officials discussed a war strike on Yemen.

“This case has been closed here at the White House, as far as we are concerned,” said Leavitt. “There have been steps made to ensure that something like that can obviously never happen again.”

Leavitt didn't detail exactly what the “steps” were.

“We're moving forward,” she added.

Critics, though, argued the case hadn't really been opened and demanded accountability for the security gaffe that, so far, appears not to have seen any official face consequences.

A fire caused by a burst gas pipe spread to several homes and sent a fireball soaring into the sky outside Malaysia's largest city on Tuesday, injuring more than 100 people.

The towering inferno near a gas station in Putra Heights outside Kuala Lumpur was visible for miles and lasted for several hours.

It happened during a public holiday as Muslims, who are the majority in Malaysia, celebrate the second day of Eid.

National oil company Petronas said the fire started at one of its gas pipelines at 8.10am and the affected pipeline was later isolated. Disaster management officials said shutting the valves will eventually snuff out the fire.

The flames, 20 stories high at one point, were small enough for firefighters to approach at about 2.45pm, the Selangor state fire department told the Star newspaper.

At least 49 houses were damaged and 112 people were injured, with 63 sent to the hospital for burns, breathing difficulties and other injuries, Selangor deputy police chief Mohamad Zaini Abu Hassan was quoted by national Bernama news agency as saying.

Selangor chief minister Amirudin Shari said the fire department evacuated nearby homes as a safety measure and the residents will be placed in mosques nearby until the situation is under control.

Pictures and videos of the fireball went viral on social media, with some residents saying they felt a strong tremor with the doors and windows of their homes shaking.

Lee Weng Ken, who suffered burns to his left leg, said he was shocked when the ceiling of his house collapsed and crushed his car parked in the compound of the house.

“I rushed out of my house but fell and suffered burns due to the heat from the blaze near my house,” he told Bernama.

Another victim who only wanted to be known as Andy, told Bernama he ran out of his home with his children when they felt tremors and saw the raging fire about 100 metres away.

“I could only take the car out. My 18-year-old daughter injured her foot when she fell while climbing the fence due to the heat, he said.

Petronas said three gas stations were closed as a precaution, though they were not affected, and investigations are still underway.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Scientists at the world's largest atom smasher have released a blueprint for a much bigger successor that could help solve some of the remaining enigmas of physics.

The plans for the Future Circular Collider: a nearly 57-mile loop along the French-Swiss border and even below Lake Geneva, published late on Monday put the finishing details on a project roughly a decade in the making at Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research.

The study lays out features like the proposed path, environmental impact, scientific ambitions and cost of the project.

Independent experts will take a look before Cern's two-dozen member countries – all European except for Israel – decide in 2028 whether to go forward, starting in the mid-2040s at a cost of some 14 billion Swiss francs (about £12.5 billion).

Cern officials have touted the promise of scientific discoveries that could drive innovation in areas like cryogenics, superconducting magnets and vacuum technologies that could benefit humankind.

Outside experts pointed to the promise of learning more about the Higgs boson, the elusive particle that helped explain how matter formed after the Big Bang.

“This set of reports represents an important milestone in the process, but a full sense of the likelihood of it being brought to fruition will only be known through careful studies by scientists, engineers and others, including politicians who must make difficult decisions at time when uncertainty rules the day,” said Dave Toback, a professor of physics and astronomy at Texas A&M University, in an email.

The new collider “provides and exciting opportunity for the particle physics community, and indeed all of physics, on the world stage,” said Prof Toback, who was not affiliated with the study, and who worked for years at the Fermilab Tevatron collider in the United States that was shut down in 2011.

For roughly a decade, top minds at Cern have been cooking up plans for a successor to the Large Hadron Collider, a network of magnets that accelerate particles through a 17-mile underground tunnel and slams them together at velocities approaching the speed of light.

Work at the particle collider confirmed in 2013 the existence of the Higgs boson – the central piece in a puzzle known as the standard model that helps explains some fundamental forces in the universe.

Cern scientists, engineers and partners behind the study considered at least 100 different scenarios for the new collider before coming up with the proposed circumference at an average depth of 200 metres.

The tunnel would be about five metres in diameter, Cern said.

“Ultimately what we would like to do is a collider which will come up with 10 times more energy than what we have today,” said Arnaud Marsollier, a CERN spokesman.

“When you have more energy, then you can create particles that are heavier.”

A bigger collider would also offer greater precision to help plumb particularities of the Higgs boson, which “we have kind of a blurry image of” now, he added.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building in Myanmar's capital on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the earthquake that killed at least 2,000, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a bloody civil war.

The Myanmar fire department in the Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble early on Tuesday, 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that occurred at midday on Friday.

The earthquake's epicentre was near the country's second-largest city, Mandalay, and so far the military-run government has reported 2,065 people killed, more than 3,900 injured and 270 missing.

Those figures are widely expected to rise, but the earthquake hit a wide swathe of the country, leaving many areas without power, telephone or mobile phone connections and damaging roads and bridges, leaving the full extent of the devastation hard to assess.

Most of the reports so far have come from Mandalay and Naypyitaw.

The World Health Organisation said overall, more than 10,000 buildings are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged in central and north-west Myanmar.

The earthquake also rocked neighbouring Thailand, causing a high-rise building under construction to collapse and burying many workers.

A colossal fire has erupted just outside of the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, prompting evacuations of nearby homes.

The towering inferno, located near a petrol station in the suburb of Putra Heights in central Selangor state, was visible for miles.

National oil company Petronas said in a statement that the fire broke out at one of its gas pipeline at 8.10am local time.

It said in a brief statement that the affected pipeline has been isolated. Three petrol stations nearby the fire site were not affected but have been temporarily closed as a precautionary measure, Petronas said, adding that investigations are still underway.

The Selangor Disaster Management unit said in a statement that the blaze spread to several houses in a nearby village, and efforts were being made to rescue trapped residents.

It added that several people suffered burns and will be taken for treatment, but the extent of the full damage is being assessed, and said that the valve to the pipeline has been shut, and that will eventually snuff out the fire.

The Star English newspaper said that fire and rescue teams had rescued seven victims, including two elderly individuals. No casualties have been reported so far.

Selangor chief minister Amirudin Shari said the fire department has quickly evacuated residents from nearby homes as a safety measure.

He said they would be temporarily placed in a mosque nearby until the situation is under control.

Pictures and videos of the fireball went viral on social media, with some residents saying they felt the doors and windows of their homes shaking believed to be due to the fire explosion earlier.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Venezuela is set to have its first female saint following approval from Pope Francis.

On Monday, he paved the way for the canonisation of Blessed Maria Carmen Rendiles by authorising a decree recognising a miracle attributed to her, the founder of the Congregation of the Handmaids of Jesus.

A date for her canonisation has not been set.

Carmen Rendiles was born on August 11 1903 in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, and died there on May 9 1977.

From a young age, following her father's death, Sister Rendiles helped her mother support the family and worked at a local parish.

She joined a French congregation in Venezuela in 1927 and became a novice at age 24. In 1961, supported by the local Catholic hierarchy, she founded an autonomous congregation.

The Catholic bishops conference of Venezuela said in a news release on Monday that she struggled with the loss of an arm, but her physical deficiency “did not prevent her from developing an exemplary Christian life”.

Catholic leaders in Venezuela requested her canonisation in 1995. She was beatified in 2018.

According to the Vatican, Sister Rendiles miraculously cured a young woman diagnosed with a type of hydrocephalus, a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid builds up within the brain.

Her condition had worsened until a Mass was celebrated before Sister Rendiles' grave.

Loved ones prayed for her recovery. And after the sick woman touched Sister Rendiles' portrait, her health improved.

“The young woman's recovery was complete, stable and long-lasting, and the event was deemed scientifically inexplicable,” the Holy See said in a written statement.

Earlier this year, Pope Francis approved the canonisation of Blessed Jose Gregorio Hernandez, born in October 1864, known as “the poor's doctor”, the first Venezuelan layperson to be beatified.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"
