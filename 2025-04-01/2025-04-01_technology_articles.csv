The use of Gmail, a far less secure method of communication than the encrypted messaging app Signal, is the latest example of questionable data security practices by top national security officials already under fire for the mistaken inclusion of a journalist in a group chat about high-level planning for military operations in Yemen.

A senior Waltz aide used the commercial email service for highly technical conversations with colleagues at other government agencies involving sensitive military positions and powerful weapons systems relating to an ongoing conflict, according to emails reviewed by The Post. While the NSC official used his Gmail account, his interagency colleagues used government-issued accounts, headers from the email correspondence show.

Waltz has had less sensitive, but potentially exploitable information sent to his Gmail, such as his schedule and other work documents, said officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe what they viewed as problematic handling of information. The officials said Waltz would sometimes copy and paste from his schedule into Signal to coordinate meetings and discussions.

The use of personal email, even for unclassified materials, is risky given the premium value foreign intelligence services place on the communications and schedules of senior government officials, such as the national security adviser, experts say.

NSC spokesman Brian Hughes said he has seen no evidence of Waltz using his personal email as described and said on occasions when “legacy contacts” have emailed him work-related materials, he makes sure to “cc” his government email to ensure compliance with federal records laws that require officials to archive official correspondence.

“Waltz didn’t and wouldn’t send classified information on an open account,” said Hughes.

When asked about a Waltz staffer discussing sensitive military matters over Gmail, Hughes said NSC staff have guidance about using “only secure platforms for classified information.”

Waltz has also created and hosted other Signal chats with Cabinet members on sensitive topics, including on Somalia and Russia’s war in Ukraine, said a senior administration official. The existence of those groups was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

Hughes said that Signal “is approved and in some cases is added automatically to government devices.” He acknowledged that it is not supposed to be used for classified material and insisted Waltz never used it as such.

Waltz’s creation of a Signal group chat that discussed sensitive information and included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of the Atlantic and a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, has rankled the president and frustrated other Cabinet members whose communications were exposed on the chat.

Publicly, Trump has strongly backed Waltz, but on Wednesday he met with Vice President JD Vance, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and others to discuss whether to keep him on. A day later, he informed aides he was not firing Waltz, but it was largely out of a desire to avoid giving the “liberal media a scalp,” said a senior administration official.

“This incident badly damaged Waltz,” said the official, who noted that the national security adviser was told after the meeting that he needed to be more deferential to Wiles. The Wednesday meeting was first reported by the New York Times.

Data security experts have expressed alarm that U.S. national security professionals are not more readily using the government’s suite of secure encrypted systems for work communications such as JWICS, the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System.

Most concerning, however, is the use of personal email, which is widely acknowledged to be susceptible to hacking, spearfishing and other types of digital compromise.

“Unless you are using GPG, email is not end-to-end encrypted, and the contents of a message can be intercepted and read at many points, including on Google’s email servers,” said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

National security experts have expressed alarm over the administration’s denial that the leaked Signal chat contained classified information.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s comments in the Signal chat detailed the sequencing, timing and weapons systems in advance of the Trump administration’s March attack on Houthi militants in Yemen, potentially jeopardizing U.S. airmen headed into harm’s way.

In the chat, Waltz offered a brief but highly specific after-action report of the strikes, revealing that the military had “positive ID” of a senior Houthi leader “walking into his girlfriend’s building” — pointing to what intelligence sources would later confirm was Israeli surveillance capabilities shared with the United States. Israeli officials expressed frustration that their capabilities were made public.

U.S. officials say Trump is much more upset about the inclusion of a liberal journalist on a confidential group chat than he is about exposing secrets to foreign adversaries. But White House officials have found Waltz’s denials increasingly hard to believe.

Waltz, who added Goldberg to the chat, told Fox News: “I take full responsibility. I built the group.” But he has subsequently said Goldberg’s contact information was “sucked into” his phone somehow and that he’s never met or talked to the journalist despite a newly circulated photo of the two men near each other at an event at the French ambassador’s residence in Washington.

“He’s telling everyone that he’s never met me or spoken to me. That’s simply not true,” Goldberg told “Meet the Press” on Sunday.

“This isn’t ‘The Matrix.’ Phone numbers don’t just get sucked into other phones,” he added.

Waltz, the first Green Beret elected to Congress and an adviser to former vice president Dick Cheney, has long pontificated about the importance of classified information and harshly criticized the Justice Department for not pursuing charges against Hillary Clinton for using a private email server as secretary of state.

“What did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing,” Waltz wrote on social media in June 2023.

While most Trump administration officials have downplayed the Signal breach publicly, some have acknowledged it was a significant mishap.

“Obviously, someone made a mistake. Someone made a big mistake,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters during a trip last week to Jamaica.

Rubio and his staff, who have years of experience with classified intelligence from his former role as vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, are known for taking operational security seriously, said a senior U.S. official.

Rubio noted that his contributions in the Signal chat were minimal.

“Just speaking for my role, I contributed to it twice,” Rubio told reporters. “I identified my point of contact, which is my chief of staff, and then later on … I congratulated the members of the team.”

On Sunday, Trump dismissed the controversy as a politically motivated attack. “I don’t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” he said.

Hughes, the NSC spokesman, said that “Mike serves at the pleasure of President Trump and the President has voiced his support for the National Security Advisor multiple times this week.”

While Democrats have seized on the incident as evidence of incompetence, some in the MAGA wing of the Republican Party have assailed Waltz as a George W. Bush-aligned neoconservative, circulating a video from 2016 in which he condemned Trump as a draft-dodger, saying “Stop Trump now.”

“The chattering of unnamed sources should be treated with the skepticism of gossip from people lacking the integrity to attach their names,” Hughes said.

A key mark in Waltz’s favor is that the breach was discovered by a left-of-center media outlet and not conservative media, officials said.",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,ChatGPT isn’t the only chatbot that’s gaining users,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/chatgpt-isnt-the-only-chatbot-thats-gaining-users/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","OpenAI’s ChatGPT may be the world’s most popular chatbot app. But rival services are gaining, according to data from analytics firms Similarweb and Sensor Tower.

Similarweb, which estimates traffic to websites, including chatbot web apps, has recorded healthy recent upticks in usage across bots like Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s OpenAI-powered Copilot. Gemini’s web traffic grew to 10.9 million average daily visits worldwide in March, up 7.4% month-over-month, while daily visits to Copilot increased to 2.4 million — up 2.1% from February.

Similarweb reports that Anthropic’s Claude reached 3.3 million average daily visits in March, and Chinese AI lab DeepSeek’s chatbot eclipsed 16.5 million visits that same month. Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok, which only gained a web app several months ago, averaged the same number of daily web visits as DeepSeek’s chatbot: 16.5 million.

The numbers pale in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in late March. Yet David Carr, editor at Similarweb, noted that there’s fierce competition for the No. 2 chatbot spot.

“[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” Carr told TechCrunch. “China’s DeepSeek came out of nowhere in January, but the AI platform with the greatest momentum at the moment is Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI, with traffic up nearly 800% month-over-month.”

AI companies’ mobile chatbot apps have been growing their user bases, too, perhaps fueled by recent AI model releases.

According to metrics from app data analysis company Sensor Tower, the Claude app saw a 21% week-over-week increase in weekly active users during the week of February 24, when Anthropic released its latest flagship AI model Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Two weeks prior, shortly after Google made its Gemini 2.0 Flash model generally available, the number of Gemini app weekly active users grew by 42%.

Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, attributed the rising tides not only to new models, but also to new capabilities. Just this past month, Google brought a “canvas” feature to Gemini that lets users preview the output of coding projects, and Anthropic has steadily added tools to its Claude client.

“The rollout of popular new AI models, heightened consumer interest in the space, the introduction of various new features and functions, and the growing number of unique use cases has propelled user growth for AI chatbot apps,” Yousef told TechCrunch.

But OpenAI probably isn’t panicking yet. Yousef pointed out that ChatGPT had 10x mobile app weekly active users compared to Gemini and Claude combined as of March.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Arkansas Social Media Verification Law Struck Down by Judge (1),https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/arkansas-social-media-age-verification-law-struck-down-by-judge,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:03:15 GMT","Arkansas’ youth-focused Social Media Safety Act infringes on the First Amendment rights of internet users and is unconstitutionally vague, a federal trial court judge ruled in a victory for Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and other social media companies.

The law—known as Act 689— required certain social media companies to verify the ages of those in the state seeking to create an account and check to ensure that minors have parental permission. However the law isn’t narrowly tailored to address the state’s interests in protecting minors from objectionable content, the US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas said.

“Rather than targeting content that is harmful to minors, Act 689 simply impedes access to content writ large,” Judge Timothy L. Brooks said.

Tech industry group NetChoice—the plaintiff—has become a formidable legal opponent to related social media restrictions across the country, notching early victories in California, Mississippi, and Utah. The influential group’s membership includes Meta, X Corp., and Snap Inc.

“We remain open to working with Arkansas policymakers to advance legislation that protects minors without violating the Constitution,” Chris Marchese, director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement praising the ruling.

Brooks said that because the law drew content-based and speaker-based distinctions to determine which companies had to follow the law, it had to, and failed to, survive strict scrutiny under the First Amendment.

“Arkansas takes a hatchet to adults’ and minors’ protected speech alike though the Constitution demands it use a scalpel,” Brooks wrote in an opinion issued Monday

The court also held the law to be too vague in defining what online services are covered by the age verification requirements.

Brooks highlighted the widely-used app Snapchat as a “prime example” of the kind of arbitrary decisions made under the law’s vague definitions, noting that the state’s attorney argued in court filings that the app was exempt from the requirements, but a co-sponsor of the legislation and the state’s expert witness think it is covered.

Brooks granted Netchoice’s motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the law.

“I respect the court’s decision, and we are evaluating our options,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement.

Friday, Eldredge & Clark LLP and Clement & Murphy PLLC represent NetChoice.

The case is NetChoice LLC v. Griffin, W.D. Ark., No. 5:23-cv-05105, 3/31/25.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,TikTok is shutting down its Instagram competitor TikTok Notes,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/tiktok-is-shutting-down-its-instagram-competitor-tiktok-notes/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","TikTok is shutting down its Instagram competitor, TikTok Notes, on May 8. The photo-sharing app launched in testing in Canada, Australia, and Vietnam last year.

The company is notifying TikTok Notes users of its decision to retire the app and is directing them to ByteDance-owned Lemon8, which isn’t surprising given that the apps are quite similar and offer the same sort of functionality.

“We’re excited to bring the feedback from TikTok Notes to Lemon8 as we continue building a dedicated space for our community to share and experience photo content, designed to complement and enhance the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.

While TikTok didn’t provide a specific reason for shutting down the app, it’s likely that the company didn’t see much adoption for TikTok Notes and is deciding to instead push Lemon8, which had around 12.5 million global monthly active users as of December 2024.

In a notice to TikTok Notes users, TikTok says the decision to shut down the app “was not made lightly.” The notice encourages users to download and save their TikTok Notes data and “continue sharing your creativity on Lemon8.” TikTok says that “Lemon8 is a lifestyle app that offers a similar experience to TikTok Notes” but with “even more features.”

Lemon8 launched in Japan in 2020 and later expanded to markets across the U.S. and Southeast Asia. The app is similar to Instagram and Pinterest, as it lets users share slideshows and photo collections and browse content through “Following” and “For You” feeds. Lemon8 offers users access to creative tools, filters, effects, stickers, text templates, and more.

While TikTok is pushing Lemon8 as an alternative to TikTok Notes, ByteDance has also tried to position the app as an alternative to TikTok itself in the face of a potential U.S. ban.

Last November, the company made it possible for users to directly access Lemon8 with their TikTok accounts and rolled out the ability for users to cross-share photo content between the apps. The move was seen as a way for ByteDance to move creators onto the new platform without having to get them to sign up for it separately in case TikTok were to go away.

Fast-forward to today, and TikTok continues to promote Lemon8 in its app as it faces a new ban deadline of April 5.",techmeme

Xiaomi said the driver had deployed the company’s Navigate On Autopilot, an assisted-driving feature, while going around 70 m.p.h. on the expressway. The car was traveling at that speed when it reached a roadblock, because a portion of the road was under repair with traffic diverted into a different lane.

https://techmeme.com,Gmail is making it easier for businesses to send encrypted emails to anyone,https://www.theverge.com/news/640422/google-gmail-email-encryption-enterprise-beta,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT","Google is updating Gmail to allow enterprise users to send encrypted messages to any inbox in just a few clicks. Google says it’s developed a new encryption model that, unlike the current encryption feature on Gmail, doesn’t require senders or recipients to use custom software or exchange encryption certificates.

The feature is rolling out in beta starting today, and will initially be available for Google enterprise users to send encrypted emails to other Gmail users within the same organization. Google says this will expand to emails sent to any Gmail inbox “in the coming weeks,” and to inboxes from any third-party email provider “later this year.”

Gmail’s current encryption feature, based on the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol, can already be used to send external emails. Doing so requires the recipient to have S/MIME configured and complete multiple steps with the sender before emails can be securely exchanged, however.

The new process will allow Gmail users to simply toggle on “additional encryption” in the email draft window to send an encrypted message. Non-Gmail recipients without S/MIME will then be provided a link to sign into a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and reply to the email in a restricted version of Gmail. If the recipient already has S/MIME configured then Gmail will send the message via the S/MIME process it currently uses. Emails to both business and personal Gmail accounts will be automatically decrypted in the recipient’s inbox.

Here’s a demo showing how Gmail users can send encrypted emails to non-Gmail users. GIF: Google

The encryption provided using this new system is higher than the standard Transport Layer Security Gmail uses by default on all emails, but we should note that this isn’t technically end-to-end encryption (E2EE), even if that’s what Google is calling it. The updated capability is powered by client-side encryption, which gives workspace administrators control over encryption keys, allowing them to revoke user access and “monitor user’s encrypted files,” according to Google’s help page.",techmeme

After a decade-long dalliance with big-screen theatrical releases, the giant tech company will take center stage this week at the annual convention for theater owners, spending several millions of dollars to parade a stream of A-list stars including Ryan Gosling, Ben Affleck and Chris Hemsworth. It is the first time the company has ever taken on such a role.

The point: to prove that its movie arm, Amazon MGM Studios, is serious about releasing around 14 big, broad commercial films a year to theaters nationwide and around the world.

The appearance is the culmination of a strategic change for Amazon that began when it bought MGM, with the venerable studio’s impressive library, in 2022 for $8.5 billion. For years, the company has released five to eight films theatrically, but it was never clear how long they would stay in theaters before going to Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming service. “Air,” starring Mr. Affleck and Matt Damon, received a 37-day exclusive theatrical release. “Red One,” with Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, hit Prime just weeks after it debuted in theaters.

Now with 14 movies a year, Amazon’s lineup will rival those from the big studios in both size and scope, and most will spend 45 days in theaters before hitting pay-per-view and then Prime.",techmeme

But by early last year, when her daughter was 8 years old, it filled her with dread. When she talked to other parents, “everyone universally said, ‘Yes, it’s a nightmare, but you’ve got no choice,’” recalled Ms. Greenwell, 41.

She decided to test that. A friend, Clare Fernyhough, had shared her concerns about the addictive qualities of smartphones and the impact of social media on mental health, so they created a WhatsApp group to strategize. Then Ms. Greenwell, who lives in rural Suffolk, in the east of England, posted her thoughts on Instagram.

“What if we could switch the social norm so that in our school, our town, our country, it was an odd choice to make to give your child a smartphone at 11,” she wrote. “What if we could hold off until they’re 14, or 16?” She added a link to the WhatsApp group.

The post went viral. Within 24 hours the group was oversubscribed with parents clamoring to join. Today, more than 124,000 parents of children in more than 13,000 British schools have signed a pact created by Smartphone Free Childhood, the charity set up by Ms. Greenwell, her husband, Joe Ryrie, and Ms. Fernyhough.

Starting today, Google is rolling out a seamless way for enterprise users to send encrypted emails to others, starting with people in the same organization.

As of today, Gmail already uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to communicate with other email service providers, and it also supports sending end-to-end encrypted emails using the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME). However, implementing the latter is quite complex and requires some training for both senders and receivers. While there are proprietary alternatives to S/MIME, they’re also difficult to implement and have other drawbacks.

To allow Gmail users to send encrypted emails to any inbox with just a few clicks, Google is leveraging client-side encryption (CSE) in Workspace, which encrypts data in the client’s browser before any data is transmitted or stored in Google’s servers. With CSE, encryption keys are stored in a cloud-based key management service that administrators control. Please note that this technology is different from end-to-end encryption, where encryption keys are generated on the client without any administrator control.

“Email messages are encrypted with just a few clicks in Gmail regardless of who they are being sent to — no need for end users to exchange certificates or use custom software,” the company explained. “The emails are protected using encryption keys controlled by the customer and not available to Google servers, providing enhanced data privacy and security. And the IT team no longer needs to go through the complex S/MIME setup or certificate management.”

In practice, when Gmail enterprise users send encrypted emails to other users in the same organization, these emails will be automatically decrypted in the recipient’s inbox. In the coming weeks, any Gmail inbox will also be able to receive and decrypt these emails.

Later this year, Gmail users will also be able to seamlessly send encrypted emails to non-Gmail inboxes. In that case, the recipients will receive a link to view and reply to the encrypted email in a guest Google Workspace account.

https://techmeme.com,Google Extends Gmail Client-Side Encryption to All Users,https://thenewstack.io/google-extends-gmail-client-side-encryption-to-all-users/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:00:46 GMT","For the 21st anniversary of the electronic mail service, Google has given Gmail an easy-to-use end-to-end encryption option.

The fresh feature is designed to minimize the complexities of installing and using a full encryption service to protect sensitive email, such as S/MIME and various proprietary solutions

On April 1, this feature launched in beta, with the ability to send end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) emails to any other Gmail users within your own organization.

In the coming weeks, users will be able to send E2EE emails to any Gmail inbox.

By the end of the year, Gmail users will be able to send fully encrypted messages to any email inbox, regardless of the platform or provider.

“The idea here is simple. Email messages are encrypted with just a few clicks in Gmail regardless of who they are being sent to — no need for end users to exchange certificates or use custom software,” wrote Google Workspace Product Managers Johney Burke and Julien Duplant in a blog item issued on Tuesday.

“And the IT team no longer needs to go through the complex S/MIME setup or certificate management.”

Client-Side Encryption

The service builds on the existing Google Workplace‘s Client-Side Encryption, a Google service for encrypting email within the Gmail universe.

Previously, only users of Workplace’s Enterprise Plus, Education Standard and Education Plus could deploy this feature.

With CSE, clients use encryption keys that are generated and stored in a cloud-based key management service, so the organization controls the keys and who has access to them. Recipients do not require a key to view the message.

The contents of the e-mail can then be encrypted though the email header — with subject, timestamps, and recipients — remains in plain text. The sender of the email can, through a new set of classification labels, set controls on the email, such as how long it can remain accessible.

For those without Gmail altogether they will be able to access the encrypted mail in “a restricted version of Gmail, using a guest Google Workspace account,” the Google docs note.

Less Work For Admins, Too

The blog announcement asserted that users will no longer have to worry about managing digital certificates — and CSE can be set as default for all mail being sent.

There is still some work for the admin in terms of managing the keys.

Today, for organizations that want end-to-end encrypted emails, including at rest and in transit, have to implement S/MIME, which requires managing digital certificates, and making sure each user has S/MIME configured properly as to participate in the exchange of certs.

“Few do,” the blog posters comment.

CSE’s cloud-based management simplifies this routine, with all the keys stored and managed in a central location. Google has no access to these keys.

An admin can revoke a user’s access to keys, as well as monitor the files that are encrypted.

The feature, announced Tuesday, allows Google Workspace customers to send an E2EE secure email to any inbox whether it be Outlook.com, Yahoo Mail or even AOL Mail.

The feature launched in beta on Tuesday, enabling E2EE between Gmail users from the same organization, with eventual plans to make Gmail’s E2EE work regardless of the recipient’s email provider.

“We’ve invented an entirely new type of encryption,” said Google Workspace Senior Product Manager Johney Burke and Product Manager Julien Duplant in an email to SC Media.

This new encryption scheme aims to remove the complexity and implementation challenges of traditional E2EE models such as Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), which requires both the sender and recipient to have S/MIME enabled.

“Alternatives to S/MIME, such as encryption features from email providers or proprietary point solutions, present significant drawbacks as well: the former requires sharing encryption keys, increasing data privacy and sovereignty risks, while the latter complicates end user experiences with custom applications, portals and browser extensions,” Google said.

Google explained that its new feature, launched on Gmail’s 21birthday, will allow enterprise Gmail users to send E2EE encrypted emails to any inbox without overly complicated processes. The feature is driven by client-side encryption, meaning data is encrypted prior to transmission or storage by Google, restricting access solely to the sender and recipient.

""Google's announcement marks an important step in making client-side encryption more accessible to enterprise Gmail users. While the underlying encryption capability has existed for some time, the general availability helps streamline adoption for regulated industries and privacy-conscious organizations,"" said Piotr Wojtyla, head of threat intelligence at Abnormal Security, in an email to SC Media.

Emails from an enterprise Gmail account to any other Gmail account (including personal accounts) will automatically be encrypted and then decrypted in the recipient’s inbox, Google explained, while emails to recipients who have S/MIME will be encrypted and decrypted via S/MIME.

Non-Gmail recipients without S/MIME enabled will be able to view E2EE in a restricted version of Gmail, using a guest Google Workspace account that allows them to securely reply, according to Google.

Google plans to expand the beta feature to allow E2EE emails to any Gmail inbox in the coming weeks, with the full capabilities planned to release by the end of this year.

Google is also adding additional features such as a setting for organizations to make all Gmail messages end-to-end encrypted by default, classification labels to mark message sensitivity, data loss prevention features to automatically classify and take action on certain emails, and a threat protection AI model to enhance spam and phishing detection and prevention.

SlashNext Email Security+ Field CTO J Stephen Kowski told SC Media that E2EE offerings like Gmail's may create a false sense of security, as humans continue to be the ""weakest link"" when it comes to email protection.

How Gmail’s end-to-end encryption compares to Microsoft Outlook

""Just like we saw with the Signal-related breach , which was 100 E2EE, we found that perfect encryption doesn't protect against users making mistakes or falling for social engineering tricks,"" Kowski noted.

Google Workspace, which includes its business Gmail offering, boasts a 50.34% share of the productivity software compared with the 45.46% share of Microsoft Office 365, which includes the Outlook business email client, according to ElectroIQ

Microsoft Outlook includes E2EE via S/MIME and Microsoft Purview Message Encryption , the latter of which, similar to Gmail’s new feature, allows non-Outlook users to open encrypted emails in a dedicated portal. Users can sign into this portal using with Microsoft, Google, Yahoo or a one-time password, according to Microsoft

Google’s Gmail announcement emphasizes that users will control their own encryption keys, which are stored away from Google’s infrastructure. Microsoft’s Purview Message Encryption relies on Microsoft Purview Information Protection, which uses Azure Rights Management Services (RMS) for email protection and encryption.

According to the latest information available from Microsoft , Microsoft manages the root key for Microsoft Purview Information Protection, formerly Azure Information Protection, by default, but offers a “bring your own key” option that can be set up by the user.

""The bigger challenge for both platforms remains ease of use and broader adoption, especially when encryption adds friction to collaboration and compliance workflows,"" Wojtyla said.

Sectigo Senior Fellow Jason Soroko noted, in an email to SC Media, that client-side encryption ""is only as secure as the environment in which it's used"" and requires organizations to ensure they can properly protect their encryption keys.

""If a user's device is compromised by malware or other vulnerabilities, the encryption keys (and therefore the encrypted data) might be at risk,"" Soroko said.",techmeme

How to access this encryption Gmail service

Gmail is 21 years old today and for its birthday present it wants to give the gift of easier encryption for all.

This is a service that’s aimed at companies in regulated industries to more easily encrypt their emails, no matter the recipient.

Recommended Videos

Currently this requires significant resources, involving proprietary solutions and getting into the complexities of Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.

Now, with this new offering, companies simply need Client Side Encryption on their supported Workspace Enterprise Plus setup with Assured Controls add-on in place.

That should mean that the encryption keys are controlled by the customer, not Google servers, allowing for that extra layer of internal security and control for data privacy.

How to turn on encryption in Gmail

Once all the above is setup at the enterprise level it’s a simple process to get encryption turned on for Gmail.

When composing an email there will be a lock icon in the top right side of the pop-out window. Tap this and it’s possible to select the “Turn on” option under the “Additional encryption” heading.

This, it says, will allow you to, “protect sensitive information and comply with company policies.”

This then turns the window blue so you know you’re operating in an encrypted environment.

How can others open encrypted emails?

If the encrypted emails are sent to other Gmail enterprise or personal users the messages are automatically decrypted to read right away.

If the recipient is using another email service provider they will be sent a link to “view the E2EE email in a restricted version of Gmail.” The sets them up with a guest Google Workspace account to view and reply to the email.

How to access this encryption Gmail service

At time of publishing companies are invited to sign-up for beta access to the service. Initially this is to only send E2EE emails to Gmail users in the same organization.

This should roll out to any Gmail inbox in the coming weeks, with further expansion to other email accounts later in the year.",techmeme
https://theverge.com,"A shady, shuttered tech bootcamp may be sneaking back online",https://theverge.com/news/640674/prehired-fast-track-cfpb-bootcamp,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:25:00 GMT","A year and a half ago, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) worked with state attorneys general to shut down Prehired, a shady tech sales bootcamp program that a court said deceptively saddled students with millions of dollars in loans. Now, as the federal watchdog is being dismantled by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a consumer advocacy group says the company is relaunching its old pitch under a new name: FastTrack.

Prehired was an online program that offered training for entry-level software sales roles, promising that students would only have to pay the course’s cost once they landed a job that paid more than $60,000 within 12 months of finishing. In a 2023 complaint, the CFPB and 11 states claimed that these were deceptively marketed loans with buried terms that left students on the hook even if they didn’t get a job. After students had signed up, Prehired allegedly claimed they’d benefit from converting these loans into settlement agreements with the company, which actually made it harder for them to fight debt collectors.

In November 2023, a court approved an order shutting down Prehired and permanently banning it from offering similar loans in the future. The company had already filed for bankruptcy. Prehired was ordered to refund $4.2 million paid by student borrowers on the income share agreements, and void $27 million worth of outstanding loans.

Prehired, however, has allegedly done little to honor those terms. Last year, former Prehired students came across a new company called FastTrack, which looked suspiciously similar. It offered the same “member success guarantee” of landing a job with a salary of at least $60,000 within 12 months of completing the program, featured the same images on its website, and even displayed reviews that appeared to have actually been reviews of Prehired. It also featured a page of blogs authored by Joshua Jordan — the name of the executive who previously ran Prehired (the author of those blogs has since been swapped out).

“There it was verbatim, just staring right at us — the exact same sales pitch”

In December 2024, the former Prehired students flagged the new FastTrack program to the Student Borrower Protection Center (SBPC), the nonprofit group that originally blew the whistle on Prehired. “We did a side-by-side comparison of what we had saved as records of his old scheme, and there it was verbatim, just staring right at us — the exact same sales pitch,” says Mike Pierce, SBPC’s executive director.

FastTrack is offering interest-free financing for $30,000 in deferred “dues,” rather than an income share agreement, but Pierce says the guarantee offered is basically the same as Prehired’s. “We knew that was a lie at Prehired because eventually he drove a bunch of students who didn’t get jobs into court and then into debt collection,” he says. “I would assume that that’s a lie here too, because it doesn’t seem like any other piece of the deal is any different.”

If FastTrack — which Pierce says apparently launched soon after the initial consent order — is simply a renamed Prehire, “it is likely that Jordan has flagrantly violated the terms of the Prehired settlement,” SBPC research and policy analyst Ella Azoulay says in a blog post. In letters sent on Monday to state AGs, SBPC claimed that Jordan appears to at least be violating the “clear intent” of the Prehired settlement, and FastTrack is “at the very least engaged in the same unlawful conduct that resulted in the settlement agreement.”

FastTrack, which claims it has helped “hundreds” of members, could put a whole new crop of students at risk of wasted time and financial damage. Prehired used tactics that “we had never seen a fraudster do before,” Pierce says. That included a “mass filing of debt collection actions against former students” to get them to pay their income share agreements, and later push them into arbitration.

One former Prehired attendee is Chris Belcher, a former Marine who signed up for the course in 2019 to get into tech sales. Belcher soon joined the company as a commission-based contractor, marketing the program to the military and to tech companies that might be interested in hiring Prehired students. But he says he was unable to recruit new businesses and left after a few months. That’s when he says Prehired “started harassing the crap out of” him. Belcher says he’d gotten a job selling windows — the glass, not the software — yet Prehired was coming to collect on the $15,000, seeming to take credit for Belcher landing a role in an unrelated field. Belcher says he held firm in refusing to pay the fee.

Belcher says he’s not entirely surprised to see Jordan’s name pop up again with a similar program, because he’s come to see many such businesses as suspect, though commonplace. “It just doesn’t surprise me, having learned about the shadiness of this side of this business,” he says. He now advises people trying to get skills to go into tech sales not to take classes like those Prehired offered if they cost any money to do so.

“Instead of doing their job, we have watched the Trump CFPB fire its enforcement attorneys, shut down the agency, [and] take the name off the building”

Under normal circumstances, the CFPB would have already initiated a new action against FastTrack and Jordan, says Pierce, who previously worked at the agency. But now, it’s been greatly weakened by President Donald Trump and DOGE. A backlog of cases built up under Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Budget and Management, who ordered staff to stop working on February 10th — and a judge only just ruled last Friday that they could get back to work while a broader case is pending. This injunction means the judge believes the workers’ union will likely prevail in claiming the Trump administration unlawfully dismantled the CFPB, but reaching that conclusion could take months — and if a Republican-led Congress formally shuts the agency down, much less can be done.

“The CFPB is supposed to be monitoring these consent orders to make sure that corporate criminals follow the terms of their deals here,” Pierce days. “Instead of doing their job, we have watched the Trump CFPB fire its enforcement attorneys, shut down the agency, [and] take the name off the building. So of course, that’s a giant ‘open for business’ sign for every two-bit fraudster in America.”

For now, as a battered CFPB is getting back to business, the SBPC is turning to state AGs as a “last line of defense,” Pierce says. But that doesn’t mean they’re a sustainable replacement for a federal watchdog. “You can’t have the kind of scale and resources in a state AG’s office that you get in Washington when you have a federal regulator with thousands of employees whose only job day in and day out is to watch for financial fraud,” he says. “This doesn’t mean that the state agencies weren’t doing their jobs. It means that CFPB has a mission and the resources to do its job, and when it doesn’t, people get hurt.”",theverge
https://theverge.com,Elon Musk’s $1 million handout winners are connected to Republican causes,https://theverge.com/politics/640230/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court-million-dollars-brad-schimel,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:21:33 GMT","is platforms and communities reporter with five years of experience covering the companies that shape technology and the people who use their tools.

On Sunday, a few thousand people in Green Bay, Wisconsin, gathered to hear Elon Musk speak — and give away two giant cardboard checks for $1 million. Attendance at the event was limited to people who had added their names to a petition against “activist judges,” created by Musk’s America PAC. He has promised money and other “surprise announcements” to people who sign the petition, and the splashy million-dollar giveaway ratcheted up the stakes. After their names were announced, winners shuffled onstage to awkwardly accept the prop checks and pause for a photo op with Musk, who has poured tens of millions of dollars into the race for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court seat.

The checks are Musk’s latest attempt to use his vast wealth to turn out voters ahead of Tuesday’s election. He has promised $100 to voters who sign the “activist judges petition” and micro-earnings for people who hold up a photo of Musk’s chosen candidate with a thumbs-up. The petition and the promises of money are a not-so-subtle way of collecting registered voter data.

It’s the same playbook Musk deployed ahead of the November presidential election that some elections experts say broke the law around vote buying. This time, Musk and his America PAC are looking to tilt the close Wisconsin race toward Brad Schimel, a conservative judge and outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump. Schimel is running against the more liberal Susan Crawford, who has garnered support from the state Democratic party.

At Sunday’s event, Musk repeatedly said the checks were a gimmick to garner media coverage. But the giveaways are clearly meant to entice voters as well, giving them the impression that anyone who signs America PAC’s petitions has a chance to win the money.

The two recipients, Nicholas Jacobs and Ekaterina Diestler, supported that narrative in professionally shot videos shared to X by Musk’s America PAC. “I did exactly what Elon Musk told everyone to do: sign a petition, refer friends and family, vote, and now I have a million dollars,” Diestler says in a video that has since been deleted. Another video states that Jacobs, who identifies himself as the chair of the Wisconsin College Republicans, “earned” the money for signing the petition.

“I was in the audience and my name was called as the recipient of a check for $1 million, and I didn’t believe it. I was nervous, I was shaking,” Jacobs says in the video clip.

Jacobs’ affiliation with the College Republicans wasn’t disclosed onstage, and most news coverage has described Diestler simply as “a voter,” a stand-in for an average person who could experience a windfall if they sign Musk’s petitions. But Diestler is a graphic designer, according to LinkedIn, for a packaging company in the Green Bay area called Belmark Inc — which has strong ties to major Republican donors. Coupled with Jacobs’ affiliation, it raises questions about how the “spokespeople” for America PAC were selected.

Belmark was founded by Bruce Bell, a major donor to Republican causes both personally and through organizations he controls. According to Federal Election Commission and Wisconsin campaign finance data, Bell contributed $7,500 to Schimel’s campaign between December 2024 and February 2025. Bell has also contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the Trump campaign, the Wisconsin Republican Party, and Republican politicians running in the state, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars to other causes over the years. Bell and other family members operate the Easter Foundation, which has given grants to anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy centers,” the Heritage Foundation, and other groups, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

The promises to Wisconsin voters mirror what happened in swing states like Pennsylvania leading up to the election of Trump in November. In those cases, Musk first claimed America PAC would randomly offer $1 million to signatories of a petition. Then, after scrutiny about whether the sweepstakes-style gimmick was legal, Musk backtracked. Lawyers representing the super PAC told a judge that winners were not randomly selected but handpicked based on their ability to be political talking heads.

Neither Belmark nor Diestler responded to The Verge’s requests for comment. The Wisconsin College Republicans also did not return a request for comment. America PAC declined to comment.",theverge

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

Yesterday, we wrote that a new Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) process would help private jet owners keep their registration details private upon request, and speculated that it would make things difficult for celebrity jet trackers. Jack Sweeney, known for his accounts tracking the flights of celebrities like Elon Musk and Taylor Swift, says he doesn’t think it will.

In an email, Sweeney told The Verge that learning “who owns what planes already requires research,” and that he and other jet trackers often “use the media and associated sources” rather than the FAA’s database of registrations.

The FAA said on Friday that it’s considering defaulting to withholding personally identifiable information from registration records. Even if jet trackers relied more on the FAA’s database, Sweeney suspected that the rule doesn’t apply to those who register their jets with trusts or other entities, something he says private jet owners do regularly. However, FAA spokesperson Kevin Morris told The Verge in an email that when it says it will withhold “personally identifiable information,” it’s referring “to both individuals and entities (trusts, LLCs, etc.) operating private aircraft.”

The FAA created its new process to comply with new requirements in the Biden-era FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. The law was written in response to privacy concerns raised about jet trackers like Sweeney’s ElonJet account that Twitter banned in 2022 and Meta later banned on Threads and Instagram.",theverge

Drastic “reductions in force” are upending agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Thousands of people who work at the CDC were notified by email today that they were subject to the Trump administration’s efforts to cull federal workforce jobs, Wired reports. Top officials were among those either put on administrative leave, laid off, or reassigned to remote roles, the Washington Post reports.

HHS announced last week that it would slash its workforce by 20,000 people. Now, the nation is starting to see how that purge is rolling out, affecting programs meant to prevent and treat HIV infection and sexually transmitted disease, respiratory diseases, and foodborne illnesses, to name a few.

“We’re going to have patients die, Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Chicago, tells Wired. “Unnecessary, preventable death.”

“Unnecessary, preventable death.”

HHS, on the other hand, says the changes will save $1.8 billion a year. “Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said in a press release when HHS announced its restructuring last week. Kennedy is a staunch anti-vax crusader who has spread disinformation falsely linking vaccines to autism.

The FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates vaccines, and director Peter Marks resigned on Friday, writing that “it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.”

Starting with this year’s football season, the NFL will use Sony’s Hawk-Eye cameras to measure the line to gain — a process the chain crew has done manually for decades. The 8K cameras will use virtual measurement technology to quickly and accurately determine whether the ball traveled 10 yards for a first down.

The Hawk-Eye system is made up of six 8K cameras that use optical tracking to determine the ball’s position. When officials receive a measurement, the system will create a digital recreation of the measurement that the NFL will show inside the stadium and on TV.

The NFL says Sony’s technology will offer a more “efficient” alternative to using sticks and a 10-yard chain to track the ball’s position. Measuring the ball with Sony’s Hawk-Eye system takes around 30 seconds, which the NFL says is 40 seconds less than the chain crew takes. But this doesn’t spell the end of the chain crew, as the NFL says they’ll still “remain on the field in a secondary capacity.”

The NFL began testing Sony’s Hawk-Eye last year. It will be deployed in all 30 US NFL stadiums and international venues.

Hell, that same jack will even charge your gadgets in a pinch, but not in the US because this e-bike is for Europe only.

Estonia-based Ampler is best known for making reliable direct-to-consumer e-bikes from its home in Tallinn using decent, mostly off-the-shelf parts that can be serviced at any local bike shop. Adding USB-C charging from a laptop charger you might already own makes a ton of sense as Europe standardizes on the port to eliminate redundancy and reduce waste. It also makes it easier to find a compatible bike charger if you leave yours at home.

You can charge the relatively small 48V 336Wh integrated batteries (removable for service only) on the Nova series e-bikes from zero to full in as little as three hours from a USB-C PD 3.1 charger operating at up to 140W. That’s very respectable. Some e-bikes fitted with a battery this same size can take five hours or longer to refill from chargers with proprietary connectors, and others fitted with larger batteries and 300-plus-watt charging bricks can bring that down to around two hours. Fortunately, 240W USB-C chargers are now starting to ship, so USB-C is well in position to compete.

Ampler has also tested its bikes to work with less capable Ikea and MacBook chargers that support the older USB-C PD 3.0 spec. If you don’t already have such a charger, Ampler will sell you its own 140W USB-C PD 3.1 charger for €80 (about $87). And while the USB-C port is bidirectional on the Nova series, it’s only capable of charging your USB-C gadgets at a modest 15W.

Both the €2,990 (about $3,230) Nova and €3,490 (about $3,770) Nova Pro are available in step-through and step-over frames in three sizes to accommodate most riders, with EU standard 250W motors maxing out at a basic 25km/h. They’re essentially improved Stout and Stella models designed to be more compatible with accessories like U-locks, third-party saddles, and child carriers. The base Nova model is fitted with wide 27.5-inch tires and depends on an oily chain and derailleur for its nine-speed transmission. The Nova Pro with single-speed Gates Carbon belt drive is the bike I’d opt for in flat Amsterdam, instead of the 10-speed Shimano Deore chain-driven system.

Both the Nova and Nova Pro are available to preorder starting today in the UK, EU, and Switzerland, with shipping set to begin in June.

ChatGPT’s latest image generator — which has gone viral for its ability to generate uncanny recreations of Studio Ghibli art — is now available for everyone, after OpenAI initially delayed the rollout beyond its paid tiers following heavy demand.

CEO Sam Altman announced on X that the image generation update has “now rolled out to all free users.” There are usage limits, though ChatGPT itself doesn’t elaborate — saying only that free users have “limited access” to image generation. Altman has previously posted that the free tier would get three image generations a day, however, and that’s exactly what the tool allowed before telling me to pay up.

Powered by the company’s GPT-4o model, the updated image generation initially launched on March 25th, and was always planned to be available across the ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Free subscription tiers. The free rollout was delayed just a day after launch, as Altman joked that “our GPUs are melting” following high demand. At one point ChatGPT picked up a million new users in a single hour.

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.

Though John Wick definitely seemed dead by the end of his last high stakes adventure, that no longer appears to be the case.

During its presentation at this year’s CinemaCon, Lionsgate announced that it has greenlit production on yet another John Wick feature that will see Keanu Reeves return to reprise his role as the Baba Yaga. Though Lionsgate has not yet shared any plot details or other casting announcements, longtime John Wick director / producer Chad Stahelski, and producers Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee are attached to the project.

Speaking at CinemaCon about the film, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group head Adam Fogelson assured attendees that Reeves, Stahelski, Iwanyk, and Lee wouldn’t signed on “unless they had something truly phenomenal and fresh to say with these characters and this world,” according to IGN.

In addition to a new live-action movie centering John Wick in the present, the larger John Wick brand will continue to grow with an animated prequel starring Reeves that tells the story of how he once completed the “impossible task” (the franchise’s terminology for killing all of one’s rivals in a single night.) The animated project will be directed by Shannon Tindle (Ultraman: Rising) and written by Vanessa Taylot (Game of Thrones, The Shape of Water.)

Lionsgate has also tapped Donnie Yen to both star in and direct a live-action spinoff built around the blind assassin character Caine, who first appeared in John Wick: Chapter 4.

Given the way John Wick has been featured in the trailers for Ballerina, it’s not entirely surprising to learn that reports of the character’s death were a bit exaggerated. But with Reeves returning to headline another John Wick mainline film, its even more clear now that Lionsgate intends to keep Wick’s story going as long as it possibly can.",theverge

Currently rolling out to paid and enterprise users, the new Gen-4 video synthesis model allows users to generate characters and objects across shots using a single reference image. Users must then describe the composition they want, and the model will then generate consistent outputs from multiple angles.

https://theverge.com,April Fools’ 2025: Dbrand’s new skins let you ‘touch grass’ without the hassle of going outside,https://theverge.com/news/638284/dbrand-touch-grass-skin-tablet-smartphone-handheld-console,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 14:00:00 GMT","is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

Dbrand wants you to feel less guilty about having your face buried in a screen all day and not getting outside to ‘touch grass.’ The company’s latest collection of skins lets you wrap your gadgets in bright green artificial turf so you can touch grass whenever you want and no matter where you are.

The Touch Grass collection is available now through Dbrand’s website for more than 100 different devices with pricing similar to its other premium skins: $29.95 for smartphones, $49.95 for tablets, and $69.95 for laptops.

Despite the April 1st timing, the Touch Grass collection isn’t a prank, Dbrand CEO Adam Ijaz assures The Verge. “Each year, April 1st rolls around and companies trip over themselves to see who can be the least funny. We, on the other hand, take the opportunity to launch real products. Are they drenched in satire? Yes — but they’re real products you can buy.”

The skins are covered in thousands of tiny polyethylene strands using a technique called electrostatic flocking, Ijaz explains. “Each polyethylene strand is electrically charged, causing it to stand upright and propel directly onto an adhesive-coated surface. In this application, the adhesive coating is applied directly to our classic 3M vinyl skin material.”

To ensure users don’t end up covered in tiny green pieces of artificial grass and to prevent the particles from finding their way inside devices, the strands are “embedded into an adhesive layer that covers roughly 25% of the strand’s height,” Ijaz says. The company subjected the skins to 10,000 abrasive rub cycles during durability testing and found “no issues with strands detaching or ‘bald patches’ forming.”

However, the company found its traditional methods for cutting the skins resulted in the fake grass strands eventually breaking off at the edges. The solution was to switch to laser cutting instead of die-cutting. “The heat from laser cutting effectively cauterizes (melts) the polyethylene strands along the perimeter,” Ijaz says. “This melting creates a sealed edge, bonding together the strands around the border. Ultimately, this was the key to preventing blades of grass around the edge from loosening or shedding over time.”

The biggest issue that Dbrand has found with the Touch Grass skins is that they also tend to function as effective yet unintentional lint catchers, but the company says they can be easily cleaned by gently wiping them.

It’s a fun idea, but in a time when microplastics are turning up in some very concerning places, we may not need another product potentially adding to the problem when it’s eventually discarded.",theverge

She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home , a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.

More than 1,900 scientists and engineers have signed a letter saying they “see real danger in this moment” as the Trump administration slashes federal support for scientific research.

“Wise investments by the US government have built up the nation’s research enterprise, making it the envy of the world,” says the open letter published on Monday. “Astoundingly, the Trump administration is destabilizing this enterprise by gutting funding for research, firing thousands of scientists, removing public access to scientific data, and pressuring researchers to alter or abandon their work on ideological grounds.”

The letter was penned by members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which was created by Congress under President Abraham Lincoln to advise policymakers. Each person signed to express their individual support rather than as representatives of the universities and research institutions with which they are affiliated.

They accuse the Trump administration of censorship through executive orders and funding threats meant to stop any initiatives the president and his close allies dislike, including efforts to address climate change and develop vaccines.

The White House didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

In less than 100 days in office, President Donald Trump and billionaire-backer Elon Musk have laid waste to the scientific arms of federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Trump administration is investigating more than 50 universities as part of its efforts to eliminate programs meant to support students from underrepresented and historically marginalized groups.

“The quest for truth — the mission of science — requires that scientists freely explore new questions and report their findings honestly, independent of special interests,” the letter says. “The administration is engaging in censorship, destroying this independence.”

By threatening to withhold $400 million in funding, the administration has already managed to strong arm Columbia University into changing school policies and academic programs. Other institutions have had to halt research, layoff staff, and stop graduate student enrollment, the letter notes.

The US is at risk of losing an entire generation of scientists as a result, the signatories warn. More than 1,200 scientists are already thinking about leaving the US because of the Trump administration’s drastic actions, making up 75 percent of respondents in a separate poll by the journal Nature.

“A climate of fear has descended on the research community,” National Academies members write in the letter. “We are sending this SOS to sound a clear warning: the nation’s scientific enterprise is being decimated.”",theverge

Members of ZeniMax Workers United, a union of over 300 quality assurance workers in Texas and Maryland, have voted to authorize a strike.

The vote, which passed with over 94 percent in favor of authorization, does not mean workers have gone on strike like SAG-AFTRA members have in the ongoing video game voice actors strike. But should contract negotiations break down, the ZeniMax union now has the permission to call a strike.

This authorization comes as contract negotiations between union members and parent company Microsoft continue into a second year.

The strike authorization is the latest escalation between the union and management. Last year, ZeniMax Workers United participated in a one-day strike claiming that Microsoft did not adequately address employee concerns over its return to office policies and its outsourcing practices. Those concerns have come up again in negotiations alongside better pay and benefits.

“Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time,” said associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield in the press release announcing the strike authorization. “Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”

“Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love,” Microsoft spokesperson Delaney Simmons says in a statement to The Verge. We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair — if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.”

ZeniMax Workers United is one of several unions under the Microsoft umbrella. It formed in 2023 and was once the largest union within the company with 300 members before Activision Quality Assurance United organized roughly 600 quality assurance workers last year.

A NASA astronaut, Butch Wilmore, had to take manual control of the vehicle. But as Starliner's thrusters failed, Wilmore lost the ability to move the spacecraft in the direction he wanted to go.

He and his fellow astronaut, Suni Williams, knew where they wanted to go. Starliner had flown to within a stone's throw of the space station, a safe harbor, if only they could reach it. But already, the failure of so many thrusters violated the mission's flight rules. In such an instance, they were supposed to turn around and come back to Earth. Approaching the station was deemed too risky for Wilmore and Williams, aboard Starliner, as well as for the astronauts on the $100 billion space station.

But what if it was not safe to come home, either?

""I don't know that we can come back to Earth at that point,"" Wilmore said in an interview. ""I don't know if we can. And matter of fact, I'm thinking we probably can't.""

Starliner astronauts meet with the media

On Monday, for the first time since they returned to Earth on a Crew Dragon vehicle two weeks ago, Wilmore and Williams participated in a news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Afterward, they spent hours conducting short, 10-minute interviews with reporters from around the world, describing their mission. I spoke with both of them.

Many of the questions concerned the politically messy end of the mission, in which the Trump White House claimed it had rescued the astronauts after they were stranded by the Biden administration. This was not true, but it is also not a question that active astronauts are going to answer. They have too much respect for the agency and the White House that appoints its leadership. They are trained not to speak out of school. As Wilmore said repeatedly on Monday, ""I can't speak to any of that. Nor would I.""",arstechnica

The litigation is led by Colorado, California, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Washington. The other plaintiffs are Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

The complaint, filed in US District Court for the District of Rhode Island, is in response to the recent cut of grants that were originally created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The sole stated basis for Defendants' decision is that the funding for these grants or cooperative agreements was appropriated through one or more COVID-19 related laws,"" the states' lawsuit said.

While Apple supports RCS messaging on iPhones now, it has not exactly been enthusiastic about it. Anyone using Google Fi on an iPhone was left in the lurch even after Apple changed course. The first RCS update rolled out in iOS 18 last fall, but it only supported postpaid plans on the big three carriers. Everyone else was left waiting, including Google Fi, as confirmed to Ars last year. It was a suitably amusing outcome, considering Google is largely responsible for reviving the RCS standard and runs the Jibe back-end servers through which many iPhone RCS messages flow.

Slowly but surely, Apple is making good on its promises to enable RCS. The company released iOS 18.4 this week, and hiding amid the control center tweaks and priority notifications is support for RCS on Google Fi and other T-Mobile MVNOs.

Price

Credit: MacroTrends Yen per US dollar, charted. Yen per US dollar, charted. Credit: MacroTrends

Likely: A $399 MSRP would reflect some of the eight years of inflation that Nintendo has seen in the (seemingly unmovable) $299 price of the original Switch. That price point would also put the Switch 2 at rough parity with the market-proven price point of the (older, non-portable) Xbox Series X and PS5.

Possible: Nintendo could surprise everyone and launch the Switch 2 at the same $299 price point that the Switch has enjoyed since 2017. Such a move, paired with the first-ever price drop for the original Switch, would supercharge interest in the new console and likely make initial Switch 2 supplies that much harder to find on store shelves.

Implausible: A price of $449 or more would be pretty out of character for Nintendo, which tends to launch its consoles at the lower end of the prevailing price distribution.",arstechnica

Salmon Run for the Atari 800 served as a powerful metaphor for life itself, one that resonates even more deeply when you learn about the creator's own struggles with cystic fibrosis.

As a kid growing up in the 1980s with an Atari 800 home computer, I discovered this hidden gem in our family's game collection, and it soon became a favorite. What struck me most—and what still amazes me today—was its incredible audio design, creating water sounds that seemed impossible for 8-bit hardware. But Salmon Run was about far more than impressive audio.

In the game, you play as Sam the Salmon, swimming upriver to spawn with a female salmon waiting upstream. You control your speed while dodging obstacles like rocks, waterfalls, and riverbanks, moving left to right and leaping from the water. And predators—bears, fishermen, and birds—are constantly trying to eat you.

Gameplay of Salmon Run for the Atari 8-bit computer family.

The ""swimming against the current"" gameplay isn't just clever game design. Williams spent his life navigating his own treacherous currents—hospital visits, treatments, and the constant struggle just to breathe. His personal battle with cystic fibrosis, characterized by chronic pain, infused Salmon Run with authentic meaning that transcends its simple pixels.

In a world grappling with anxiety, uncertainty, and relentless pressures, Salmon Run feels especially timely to me. While not all of us face challenges of Williams' magnitude, I am sure anyone reading can attest that life isn't easy. It isn't a passive process—it's a deliberate, ongoing work of labor. We constantly get pushed back by the current. And all the while, both metaphorical and literal bears are trying to eat us.",arstechnica

But the work, it has found me—on my couch, on a trip, wherever one might game, really.

In a 1.1 release on Satisfactory's Experimental branch, there are lots of new things, but the biggest new thing is a controller scheme. Xbox and DualSense are officially supported, though anyone playing on Steam can likely tweak their way to something that works on other pads. With this, the game becomes far more playable for those playing on a couch, on a portable gaming PC like the Steam Deck, or over household or remote streaming. It also paves the way for the game's console release, which is currently slated for sometime in 2025.

Coffee Stain Studios reviews the contents of its Experimental branch 1.1 update.

Satisfactory seems like an unlikely candidate for controller support, let alone consoles. It's a game where you do a lot of three-dimensional thinking, putting machines and conveyer belts and power lines in just the right places, either because you need to or it just feels proper. How would it feel to select, rotate, place, and connect everything using a controller? Have I just forgotten that Minecraft, and first-person games as a whole, probably seemed similarly desk-bound at one time?

The biggest hurdle to get past, for me, is not jumping in place when I wanted to do something, though it's not unique to this game. In most games that have some kind of building or planning through a controller, the bottom-right button (""A"" on Xbox, ""X"" on PlayStation DualSense) is often the do/interact/confirm button. In Satisfactory, and some other games where I switch between keyboard/mouse and controller, A/X is jump. Satisfactory wants you to primarily use the triggers and bumpers to select, build, and dismantle things, which feels okay when you've got the hang of things.

After about a half an hour, I started hearing [US Secretary of Homeland Security] Kristi Noem praising Trump and telling immigrants to get out of America, over and over. I went in to check, and caught this video looping 3 more times before it went back to the nature clips.

The user added that when trying to replicate this, the TV “played the video again after about 20 minutes,” but only once.",arstechnica

""As Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, I write to express the FTC's interests and concerns relating to the potential sale or transfer of millions of American consumers' sensitive personal information,"" Ferguson wrote. He continued:

As you may know, 23andMe collects and holds sensitive, immutable, identifiable personal information about millions of American consumers who have used the Company's genetic testing and telehealth services. This includes genetic information, biological DNA samples, health information, ancestry and genealogy information, personal contact information, payment and billing information, and other information, such as messages that genetic relatives can send each other through the platform.

23andMe's recent bankruptcy announcement set off a wave of concern about the fate of genetic data for its 15 million customers. The company said that ""any buyer of 23andMe will be required to comply with our privacy policy and with all applicable law with respect to the treatment of customer data."" Many users reacted to the news by deleting their data, though tech problems apparently related to increased website traffic made that process difficult.

23andMe's ability to secure user data is also a reason for concern. Hackers stole ancestry data for 6.9 million 23andMe users, the company confirmed in December 2023.

The bankruptcy is being overseen in US Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.

FTC: Bankruptcy law protects customers

Ferguson's letter points to several promises made by 23andMe and says these pledges must be upheld. ""The FTC believes that, consistent with Section 363(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, these types of promises to consumers must be kept. This means that any bankruptcy-related sale or transfer involving 23andMe users' personal information and biological samples will be subject to the representations the Company has made to users about both privacy and data security, and which users relied upon in providing their sensitive data to the Company,"" he wrote. ""Moreover, as promised by 23andMe, any purchaser should expressly agree to be bound by and adhere to the terms of 23andMe's privacy policies and applicable law, including as to any changes it subsequently makes to those policies.""",arstechnica
https://arstechnica.com,Review: Amazon’s Kindle Colorsoft is something less than “a Paperwhite with color”,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:20:29 GMT","It has been a bumpy start for Amazon's $280 Kindle Colorsoft, the company's first E-Ink book reader with a color screen. The company delayed shipments for a few weeks to correct a problem where a faint yellow band would appear across the bottom of the screen, something that has apparently been fixed for current versions of the reader (Amazon says it has made ""the appropriate adjustments"" to fix the problem but hasn't been specific about what those adjustments are).

Amazon didn't send us a Colorsoft for review at the time, maybe in part because of this problem early reviewers had, but we finally got one a few weeks ago and have been using it since then.

My main takeaway is that I don't mind the Colorsoft, but it also doesn't solve any problems I was having with the monochrome Kindle Paperwhite, and it doesn't meaningfully solve the big problems with color E-Ink. It also makes the experience of reading regular text subtly worse, which accounts for the vast majority of my Kindle activity. I'm curious to see future riffs on the idea, but this initial implementation leaves me cold.

What’s different in color?

The 12th-generation Kindle Paperwhite on the left, the Colorsoft on the right. This is with the brightness and warmlight set to the same levels—the Colorsoft's screen also takes on a slightly more purplish hue here. Credit: Andrew Cunningham

Even if you spend most of your time reading monochrome text, the Colorsoft does insert splashes of color wherever it can. The setup and sleep screens are all in color. Every book cover in your library or on your home screen is in color, and highlights can be made in four different colors (yellow, pink, blue, and orange).

These colors are the same as you get in the Kindle mobile and desktop/web apps, and highlights you make on the Colorsoft will show up in the same color in the other apps (and vice-versa).

Comics, PDFs, webpages, and other color content will also display in color on the Colorsoft's screen (though for webpages, you're stuck with the same limited web browser the Kindle has always had, and most pages won't render anywhere close to correctly). Colors won't be represented as accurately as on an LCD or OLED screen, since E-Ink supports just 4,096 colors, rather than millions. But the broad strokes will look mostly correct.",arstechnica

In 2025, Google Assistant is being phased out and replaced with Gemini. As Google, Amazon, and others move toward a world in which all virtual assistants are based on generative AI, it's reasonable to consider if this is actually a good idea. Despite promises of ""smarter"" AI and ever-increasing token limits, these robots still have a fundamental flaw that may make them bad assistants: They lie.

They don't set out to lie, of course, because they don't know what a ""lie"" is. These systems attempt to generate the most plausible next token to build an output. Because of this, generative AI is non-deterministic—you can't predict the output, and even running the same prompt multiple times will offer varying responses.

This can look impressively like thinking sometimes, but it also leads to frequent hallucinations. That's why the iPhone said Luigi Mangione was dead and Google told people to put glue on pizza. GenAI proponents like Google and Apple have been trying to curb the chaos of confabulations, but this may always be a problem because of the nature of the underlying technology.

Even if a generative AI assistant is right most of the time—and we are reaching that point—an occasional hallucination can still screw up your day. And yet, Google has moved with relentless efficiency to wedge generative AI into every one of its products, which is why we're all watching Assistant wither and die in favor of Gemini.

Trust but verify

I'm not deeply committed to Assistant—it's missing a lot of functionality, and sometimes the bugs can be so frustrating that I regret even engaging with it. However, I'm almost certain I'll miss it once it's gone. Assistant is great at basic things like setting timers and sending messages, and it does so without a fuss. These are things that Gemini, in spite of all its cloud-based processing muscle, still screws up. For anything more complex or important, Gemini is worse than inefficient—it's untrustworthy.",arstechnica
https://arstechnica.com,Four private astronauts launch on first human mission to fly over the poles,https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/four-private-astronauts-launch-on-first-human-mission-to-fly-over-the-poles/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:23:10 GMT","Four adventurers suited up and embarked on a first-of-a-kind trip to space Monday night, becoming the first humans to fly in polar orbit aboard a SpaceX crew capsule chartered by a Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire.

The private astronauts rocketed into orbit atop a Falcon 9 booster from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 9:46 pm EDT Monday (01:46 UTC Tuesday). Instead of heading to the northeast in pursuit of the International Space Station, the Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft departed Launch Complex 39A and arced to the southeast, then turned south on a flight path hugging Florida's east coast.

The unusual trajectory aligned the Falcon 9 with a perfectly polar orbit at an inclination of 90 degrees to the equator, bringing the four-person crew directly over the North or South Pole every 45 minutes.

Chun Wang, born in China and now a citizen of Malta, paid SpaceX an undisclosed sum for the opportunity to fly to space and bring three hand-picked crewmates along with him. SpaceX likely charged between $100 million and $200 million for the flight. Chun made his fortune as a crypto pioneer, co-founding F2Pool, once the world's largest bitcoin mining company. He named his mission Fram2 in honor of the Norwegian exploration ship Fram used for polar expeditions at the turn of the 20th century.

No one saw Earth's poles from space in the more than 400 human spaceflight missions preceding Fram2. The closest any crew mission has gotten to the poles was the Soviet Union's Vostok 6 mission in 1963, when Valentina Tereshkova's spacecraft reached a latitude of 65.1 degrees.

Something new

Chun didn't want to pay for a mission to repeat the well-trodden path to the International Space Station, or fly in a higher-altitude orbit as SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission did last year with billionaire commander Jared Isaacman and three crewmates. He wanted to try something new.

""Jared spent a lot of effort trying to fly as high as possible because he has a pilot background,"" Chun said in response to a question from Ars. ""But here on this mission, we have a group of polar explorers. We will do this from an explorer's perspective. I don’t want to repeat the same mission profile again and again. I have less interest in flying to ISS because every previous mission flies to the ISS again, again and again.""

Chun was inspired by Isaacman's first foray into orbit on the Inspiration4 mission in 2021. That was the first fully commercial human spaceflight to low-Earth orbit without any significant government involvement. Isaacman is President Trump's nominee to become the next NASA administrator.",arstechnica

The group, led by Nobel Prize-winner Sir Demis Hassabis, has introduced a tougher vetting process and more bureaucracy that made it harder to publish studies about its work on AI, according to seven current and former research scientists at Google DeepMind.

Three former researchers said the group was most reluctant to share papers that reveal innovations that could be exploited by competitors, or cast Google’s own Gemini AI model in a negative light compared with others.

The changes represent a significant shift for DeepMind, which has long prided itself on its reputation for releasing groundbreaking papers and as a home for the best scientists building AI.

Meanwhile, huge breakthroughs by Google researchers—such as its 2017 “transformers” paper that provided the architecture behind large language models—played a central role in creating today’s boom in generative AI.

Since then, DeepMind has become a central part of its parent company’s drive to cash in on the cutting-edge technology, as investors expressed concern that the Big Tech group had ceded its early lead to the likes of ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

“I cannot imagine us putting out the transformer papers for general use now,” said one current researcher.

Among the changes in the company’s publication policies is a six-month embargo before “strategic” papers related to generative AI are released. Researchers also often need to convince several staff members of the merits of publication, said two people with knowledge of the matter.",arstechnica

Despite a fundamental difference in direction that led Anthropic's founders to quit OpenAI in 2020 and later create the Claude AI assistant, a shared technical hurdle has now brought them together: How to easily connect their AI models to external data sources.

The solution comes from Anthropic, which developed and released an open specification called Model Context Protocol (MCP) in November 2024. MCP establishes a royalty-free protocol that allows AI models to connect with outside data sources and services without requiring unique integrations for each service.

""Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications,"" wrote Anthropic in MCP's documentation. The analogy is imperfect, but it represents the idea that, similar to how USB-C unified various cables and ports (with admittedly a debatable level of success), MCP aims to standardize how AI models connect to the infoscape around them.

So far, MCP has also garnered interest from multiple tech companies in a rare show of cross-platform collaboration. For example, Microsoft has integrated MCP into its Azure OpenAI service, and as we mentioned above, Anthropic competitor OpenAI is on board. Last week, OpenAI acknowledged MCP in its Agents API documentation, with vocal support from the boss upstairs.

""People love MCP and we are excited to add support across our products,"" wrote OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on X last Wednesday.

MCP has also rapidly begun to gain community support in recent months. For example, just browsing this list of over 300 open source servers shared on GitHub reveals growing interest in standardizing AI-to-tool connections. The collection spans diverse domains, including database connectors like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and vector databases; development tools that integrate with Git repositories and code editors; file system access for various storage platforms; knowledge retrieval systems for documents and websites; and specialized tools for finance, health care, and creative applications.",arstechnica

But fear not, the Webb Space Telescope just re-confirmed that asteroid 2024 YR4 has a nearly 0% probability of crashing into Earth. That said, astronomers are unable to rule out a possible impact with the Moon.

The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile discovered the asteroid on December 27, 2024. Shortly after its discovery, asteroid 2024 YR4 was deemed potentially hazardous, with the odds of it striking Earth reaching nearly 3%. Those odds aren’t massive, but when it comes to the potential threat of a city-killer asteroid, ideally you want them to be closer to a zero-chance probability. On February 20, NASA removed 2024 YR4 from its naughty list after calculations showed that the asteroid had a near-zero chance of hitting Earth.

Phew. The news gets even better—new observations from Webb double down on the confirmation: the asteroid poses no threat to Earth. As for the Moon, that’s apparently another matter.

When it was first spotted, asteroid 2024 YR4 was 515,116 miles (829,000 kilometers) away from Earth. Since then, the space rock has moved away from us, and its next close approach won’t be until December 2028. Ground-based telescopes from the International Asteroid Warning Network have been tracking the asteroid, but it will be too faint to observe until June 2028, according to NASA. That’s why Webb was called in for the job, measuring the asteroid’s brightness across a range of infrared wavelengths to better determine its size.

In late January, a team of scientists proposed using the mid-infrared instrument on Webb to observe the asteroid and better understand its damage potential. The team recently released the preliminary results of Webb’s observations of asteroid 2024 YR4, suggesting that, while the asteroid is larger and rockier than previous observations, it has nearly a 0% chance of hitting Earth during its upcoming flyby. The results have not yet been submitted for peer review and publication.

Webb first spotted the asteroid on March 26, observing it as it rotated every 20 minutes over a five-hour-long period. Using Webb’s observations, the researchers determined that the asteroid was slightly larger than previously believed. Initial estimates suggested that the asteroid measures between 130 and 300 feet wide (40 and 90 meters) based on its reflected light. Webb’s observations, however, measure the asteroid at 200 feet (60 meters) wide.

The recent observations also suggest that the surface of the asteroid is cooler than most other asteroids of its same size and distance from the Sun, which may be because asteroid 2024 YR4 is rockier than usual. The team will use Webb to observe the asteroid again in May to help refine its thermal and orbital properties.

Webb’s observations may have ruled out an Earth impact in seven years, but the results suggest that the asteroid “continues to have a non-zero probability of impacting the Moon at this time,” the researchers concluded. The Moon has likely endured thousands of asteroid impacts during its 4.5-billion-year history, but it’s not yet clear what would happen if asteroid 2024 YR4 strikes our natural satellite. At its current size estimate, the asteroid would likely release about 8 megatons of energy during impact—which is more than 500 times the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, and comparable to the energy released in the Tunguska blast of 1908, according to NASA.

The potential Moon impact would allow scientists the rare opportunity to observe a lunar crater being formed right before their eyes (assuming it hits within our view from Earth), and gain a better understanding of the violent history of the solar system.",gizmodo

Well, last month, that changed. What follows isn’t a list of all the best stuff streaming on all the big streaming services. We’ve looked at all those lists and come up with a few dozen titles that we think are noteworthy this month. Some are new, some are old, but either way, we’ll tell you why you should care. Or at least joke about it. So sit back, grab your remote, and get ready for the new and improved Nerd’s Watch highlighting the best movies and shows coming to streamers this month.

Conan the Destroyer (April 1 on Netflix)

You’re about to read an article with a lot of great Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and one of the best is this incredible 1984 fantasy film. Just as epic and awesome as movies like this get.

Fantasy sports movies starring Kevin Costner (April 1 on Netflix)

Clearly, we’re mainly referring to Field of Dreams here. An all-time sports classic. But also, the film Draft Day is coming to Netflix and Peacock April 1. You may not think that Kevin Costner film, about a general manager on the day of the NFL Draft, is also fantasy, but if you know the NFL, seeing something good happen to the Cleveland Browns is clearly a fantasy. (Sorry Browns fans. But seriously, Draft Day is such an under-appreciated personal favorite of mine, I wanted to let people know about it.)

Arrival (April 1 on Hulu and Paramount+)

Before he tackled Dune, Denis Villeneuve made another all-timer sci-fi film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, who deal with mysterious alien ships arriving on Earth. It’s magic.

Interstellar (April 1 on Hulu and Peacock)

Having seen a recent resurgence after its 10-year anniversary, Christopher Nolan’s space drama starring Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, and many more hits two streamers.

Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Jurassic Park III (April 1 on Hulu)

The first one is a classic, the second one is a huge step down, but mainly we’re putting these here so you do a marathon and see things from our perspective. Jurassic Park III is underrated.

21 and 22 Jump Street (April 1 on Hulu)

A little off the sci-fi bandwagon, but these beyond hilarious comedies starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have the kind of energy and excitement you simply can’t ignore in a movie.

Wes Anderson marathon (April 4 on Hulu)

Okay, five movies from the talented director are coming to Hulu this month, and while they aren’t all sci-fi, they are all varying degrees of incredible. There’s Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums—both masterpieces. There’s Fantastic Mr. Fox— amazing. Then also The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited—not as great as the rest, but super solid.

The Handmaid’s Tale (April 8 on Hulu)

Yes, it’s still on the air and this month marks the start of its final season. What’s in store for Gilead? Watch and find out.

In a Violent Nature (April 22 on Hulu)

One of 2024’s breakout horror films was this twist on the genre, which follows a psycho killer, not his victims. It was previously on Shudder but is now on Hulu.

Not Just A Goof (April 7 on Disney+)

The Goofy Movie celebrates its 30th anniversary this year and this is a brand new documentary all about it. Hopefully, it’s half as good as the episode of Atlanta with a similar spin.

The Abyss 4K (April 11 on Disney+)

Seeing classic James Cameron films in 4K is a rare treat, especially when it’s one that took forever to be transferred. But now, the 4K of The Abyss is coming to streaming, and even if your TV can’t handle it, The Abyss is a fantastic film.

Andor (April 22 on Disney+)

The second and final season of the Star Wars prequel show kicks off with the first of four three-episode mini movies following the exploits of newly minted rebel, Cassian Andor, played by Diego Luna.

Logan (April 1 on Max)

He may not have gotten his own chair last week, but Hugh Jackman’s Logan did get an epic send-off in this 2017 film by James Mangold.

The Terminator (April 1 on Max)

More James Cameron, more Arnold Schwarzenegger. This time it’s their first collaboration, the film that jump-started each of their careers. This sci-fi dystopian action film still packs a punch.

Y2K (April 4 on Max)

Here’s one you may have missed recently but you should check it out. Kyle Mooney directs Rachel Zegler and others in this period sci-fi comedy about what Y2K could’ve been if the machines revolted.

Face/Off (April 1 on Peacock)

You could argue director John Woo and stars John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were all at their peak in this delightful sci-fi action film about two rivals who switch faces.

The animated How to Train Your Dragon Trilogy (April 1 on Peacock)

To prep for the live-action remake, why not take a trip back to Berk with all three of the animated Dragon films: How To Train Your Dragon, How To Train Your Dragon 2, and How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.

Mother! (April 15 on Peacock)

Jennifer Lawrence is a woman going mad in this shocking, hard to watch, but incredible movie from director Darren Aronofsky.

Her (April 1 on Paramount+)

In 2013, the idea of a man falling in love with a faceless artificial intelligence seemed ridiculous. Twelve years later, the Spike Jonze-directed film starring Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson is more plausible than ever.

Shaolin Soccer (April 1 on Paramount+)

Stephen Chow writes, directs, and stars in this bonkers mashup of underdog sports movie and high-octane martial arts movie. It has to be seen to be believed.

Team America: World Police (April 1 on Paramount+)

After the South Park musical, you got the sense there was no way Trey Parker and Matt Stone would ever top themselves. But then they did a puppet musical with hardcore sex, violence, and songs about AIDS. But it’s good.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (April 1 on Paramount+)

After you watch The Terminator on Max, jump over to Paramount+ to watch its superior sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Seriously, does anyone not think T2 is better than the already awesome original?

The Running Man (April 1 on Paramount+)

With the first trailer for the Edgar Wright/Glen Powell remake imminent, why not go back to the Arnold Schwarzenegger original that pre-dated reality TV game shows?

Lesser Michael Myers (April 1 on Shudder)

We know every iconic slasher has good and bad outings, and some of Michael Myers’ less-beloved ones are coming to Shudder. Still, he’s Michael Myers, so even a bad movie is kind of fun. There’s Halloween H20, Halloween VI: The Curse of Michael Myers, and Halloween: Resurrection

Fright Night (April 1 on Shudder)

The 1985 original, not the 2011 remake. Perfect if you’re feeling like doing a little light vampire hunting.

Crimson Peak (April 1 on Shudder)

https://gizmodo.com,"MAGA Influencer Sells Her Tesla, Says Elon Musk Isn’t Paying Her Enough Child Support",https://gizmodo.com/maga-influencer-sells-her-tesla-says-elon-musk-isnt-her-paying-enough-child-support-2000583240,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:40:16 GMT","Ashley St. Clair, the anti-trans author and alleged mother to one of Elon Musk’s many children, sold her Tesla in recent days, according to video posted to the Daily Mail. Why? Apparently Musk isn’t paying enough money in child support. But the Tesla CEO says he’s giving St. Clair plenty of money.

“I’m selling because I need to make up for the 60% cut that Elon made to our son’s child support,” St. Clair says in the Daily Mail video.

Asked why she thought Musk would do that and whether it was vindictive, St. Clair replied that it was his “modus operandi when women speak out.” The author, most famous for an anti-trans children’s book she wrote, said to “check the stocks,” a reference to Tesla’s plunging stock price, and “I’m not the only one who is cleaning up after his messes.”

The video of St. Clair in front of her Tesla was posted to X by far-right influencer Laura Loomer on Monday, where she referred to St. Clair as a “gold digger and professional gaslighter.” Loomer wrote that St. Clair was “caught on camera” outside of her “ritzy Manhattan condo,” and claimed that Musk (who Loomer called her “sugar daddy), had paid for both the car and her condo. Loomer also claimed St. Clair “has hired anti-Trump lawyers to sue Elon Musk.”

Gizmodo has no inside knowledge on whether any of that is true, but it’s necessary to understand the context of the shitshow conversation that would follow on the billionaire’s own social media platform. Musk replied that he doesn’t actually know if the child is his, but sort of claimed he wanted to know, even without a court-ordered paternity test. The billionaire also said he was giving St. Clair plenty of money.

“I don’t know if the child is mine or not, but am not against finding out. No court order is needed. Despite not knowing for sure, I have given Ashley $2.5M and am sending her $500k/year,” Musk wrote.

St. Clair replied that she was being punished for “disobedience,” perhaps referring to the publicity she received after making it known that she had a child with Musk.

“Elon, we asked you to confirm paternity through a test before our child (who you named) was even born. You refused,” St. Clair wrote on X. “And you weren’t sending *me* money, you were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary… until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for ‘disobedience.’ But you’re really only punishing your son.”

St. Clair went on to accuse Musk of trying to silence her.

“It’s ironic that your last effort in court was to try to gag me while you use a social media channel you literally own to distribute derogatory messages about me and our child to the entire world,” St. Clair continued. “It’s all about control with you, and everyone can see it. America needs you to grow up, you petulant man-child.”

Why does any of this matter outside of family court? Perhaps it doesn’t in the grand scheme of things. But it does seem like an odd situation for a man whose worldview is so defined by having as many children as possible. According to Forbes, Musk is reportedly the wealthiest person on the planet, worth about $340 billion. And he wields enormous power, not just through his private companies like Tesla and SpaceX, but by dismantling the federal government, as he’s currently doing now with DOGE.

It’s with that gigantic platform and incredible amount of power that Musk is advancing an agenda based on people having as many kids as possible. The billionaire oligarch believes that everyone should just procreate frequently, circumstances be damned, but doesn’t seem to care about the conservative principle behind the traditional Republican idea of having kids: Supporting them financially and emotionally.

St. Clair has made Musk out to be a deadbeat father. And, again, it’s hard for an outsider to judge something like that. But it doesn’t seem to be in dispute that Musk’s many children (14 that we know of) don’t really get the attention they deserve. The Tesla CEO is frequently seen in public with his kid X, who he had with the musician Grimes, but there are many other children who don’t seem to get the same attention. And that’s to say nothing of Musk’s estrangement from his trans daughter Vivian, who says he wasn’t around much. Musk has publicly referred to her as “dead,” a brutally cruel thing to say about one of your own children just because they came out as trans.

It’s one thing to have as many kids as you can. It’s an entirely different thing to actually be a good father to those kids. And Ms. St. Clair doesn’t seem to think that’s happening right now with their son. Well, alleged son.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"John Wick 5 Is Real, and There’s More Coming",https://gizmodo.com/john-wick-5-is-real-and-theres-more-coming-2000583601,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:21:48 GMT","Here’s some exciting news for John Wick fans out of CinemaCon 2025: the long-teased John Wick: Chapter 5 is officially a go. A concept has been “locked in” and development is underway with series star Keanu Reeves.

And here’s more exciting news for John Wick fans to go with that: the franchise is also getting an animated prequel that will finally, at long last, showcase the “Impossible Task” that didn’t take, but for a brief moment allowed the title assassin to think he’d managed to retire from his crime-laden life. It’s something so wild that Lionsgate decided animation was the only way to tell it right. It will, obviously, take place before the first John Wick movie, and is being written by Vanessa Taylor (Game of Thrones, The Shape of Water) and directed by Shannon Tindle (Ultraman: Rising).

A press release from Lionsgate explained that “the animated film will go back in time to tell the story of John Wick before the first film, as he completes the Impossible Task—the killing of all of his rivals in one night—in order to free himself from his obligation to the High Table and earn the right to be with the love of his life, Helen.”

“I’ve always been fascinated with anime,” John Wick live-action director and animated film co-producer Chad Stahelski said in the release. “It has always been a huge influence on me, especially with the John Wick series. To have the opportunity to develop a John Wick anime seems to be the perfect progression for the John Wick world. I feel John Wick is the perfect property for this medium—anime holds the potential to expand our world, our characters, and our action in ways unimaginable before.”

As we already knew, John Wick spin-off movie Ballerina arrives in June—and another spin-off has now been confirmed, with Donnie Yen starring (reprising his role of blind assassin Caine) and directing. It begins filming this summer. The Hollywood Reporter notes that Mattson Tomlin (The Batman Part II) will write the script.

“The John Wick films have set an immensely high standard for action filmmaking and I greatly appreciate Lionsgate giving me the opportunity to further elevate the franchise,” Yen said in the release. “I am both thrilled and deeply inspired to make this happen.”

Stahelski added, “One of my favorite characters in the John Wick world is Caine. To have the chance to dive into his world and discover all his adventures excites us all. We envision a modern day kung-fu classic that explores the John Wick world, and who better to helm it than Donnie Yen himself. His understanding of the culture, the world, and, of course, the action, make him the perfect director for this project.”

Judge Timothy L. Brooks ruled the law, dubbed the Social Media Safety Act, was too broad as to violate the First Amendment rights of internet users and was so vague it was unclear which social networks the law would cover.

“Arkansas takes a hatchet to adults’ and minors’ protected speech alike though the Constitution demands it use a scalpel,” the US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas wrote in an opinion issued Monday.

Lawmakers across the United States and abroad have sought to protect minors against the potential long-term harms posed by social media, and smartphone access writ large. Utah recently passed a law that requires app stores from Apple and Google to verify the ages of users before they can download apps and requires minors to have accounts connected to their parents. Meta was in favor of this law because it put the onus on other companies to verify users; it was opposed to Arkansas’ law. States and school districts across the country have also been implementing laws that prohibit students from accessing their phones during the school day to eliminate distractions and potentially combat bullying.

While social media has been linked to increased mental health risks in adolescents, many teens have reported benefits to using the services, such as finding like-minded communities where they feel belonging. Moreover, critics of age-verification laws say while there are risks to minors using social media, these types of laws infringe on everyone’s right to privacy—in states like Florida and Texas, where laws have passed requiring porn sites to verify the ages of users, major services including PornHub have chosen to shut down rather than make users hand over personally identifiable information. In an age when the White House is willing to retaliate against individuals over their free expression, the risks of requiring users to verify their identities are clear.

“Rather than targeting content that is harmful to minors, Act 689 [the Social Media Safety Act] simply impedes access to content writ large,” Brooks said.

There are effectively no federal privacy laws concerning internet platforms, with the recent collapse of 23andMe highlighting the problem. It was recently announced that as part of the DNA testing company’s bankruptcy, genetic data from customers could be sold off, potentially to be used against individuals.

Judge Brooks also noted the law was too vague, pointing out that the state’s attorney general believed Snapchat was exempt from the requirements, while the law’s co-sponsor thought it was covered.

“I respect the court’s decision, and we are evaluating our options,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement.

Social media companies have continued to implement tools to combat bullying, such as by allowing users to restrict others’ access to their content. During the Biden administration, the U.S. Surgeon General recommended social networks should display warning labels highlighting the potential harms for adolescents, and potentially redesign their apps to address problems like insecurity that can be caused by beauty filters and other tools.

Some who believe social media is harmful to adolescents argue that laws like age verification and smartphone bans during the school day are not addressing the actual problem. Teenagers will get around age checks, and if they cannot use their phone during the school day, they will just use it more after class. These laws do not address the root cause, they argue, which is the inherent design of social media apps.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Lego’s April Releases Concern Hobbits,https://gizmodo.com/lego-april-2025-releases-lord-of-the-rings-shire-2000583645,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:35:46 GMT","After a blockbuster March, Lego is once again having a bit of a quiet season coming into April… but a small number of releases doesn’t make them any less major, as almost everything dropping this month is a huge set. Or, well, huge from your perspective, if you happen to be a halfling eager for the next Lord of the Rings release.

Yes, there may not be that many sets this month (Star Wars is smartly taking the month off to prepare for its usual extravaganza in May), but most of what is coming is pretty sizable. That includes the highlight set of the month, the third entry in the revived Lord of the Rings Icons series, whisking us away to the idyllic Shire to celebrate Bilbo’s 111th birthday. Check out what’s coming from Lego this month below!

Lego Icons Beauty and the Beast Castle

The latest Disney release takes us back to Beauty and the Beast with this lavish 2,916-piece castle. The set also comes with a line up of five minifigures (Gaston, LeFou, Belle, Beast, and Belle’s father Maurice), as well as five brick-built characters (Cogsworth, Chip and Mrs. Potts, Lumière, and Fifi)—and, of course, the enchanted rose at the heart of the story. ($280, available here from 4/1 for Lego Insiders, 4/4 wide release)

Lego Icons Lord of the Rings Shire

After wowing us with the beautiful safe havens of Rivendell and the ominous spires of Barad-Dûr, Lego is opting for the quiet life with the third entry in its annual collector-focused Lord of the Rings series. Taking us to the opening act of Fellowship of the Ring, the 2,017-piece set recreates Bilbo and Frodo’s home in the hobbit hole of Bag End, as well as a few extra elements of the Shire to depict Bilbo’s 111th birthday bash at the Party Tree. As well as Bilbo and Frodo of course, the set comes with seven more minifigures inspired by those scenes: Gandalf the Grey, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Rosie Cotton, and Farmer Proudfoot and his wife. ($270, available here from 4/2 for Lego Insiders, 4/5 wide release)

https://gizmodo.com,Trump Regime Used Gmail Accounts to Discuss Sensitive Plans: Report,https://gizmodo.com/trump-regime-used-gmail-accounts-to-discuss-sensitive-plans-report-2000583668,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:27:44 GMT","Top national security officials at the White House, including national security advisor Michael Waltz, have sometimes been using regular Gmail accounts to discuss highly sensitive military operations, according to a new report from the Washington Post. Gmail is not end-to-end encrypted like more secure government systems available to officials like Waltz and can be intercepted by foreign adversaries.

The Gmail accounts were used to discuss “sensitive military positions and powerful weapons systems relating to an ongoing conflict,” according to the Post, citing three unnamed government officials and emails reviewed firsthand by the newspaper. Personal email accounts of any kind are not considered a secure way to communicate sensitive information, though National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told the Post that no classified information was transmitted over insecure channels.

The report comes after Waltz and roughly two dozen officials were outed as using Signal to discuss attack plans in Yemen after mistakenly adding the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Waltz’s Yemen group chat wasn’t the only Signal chat where sensitive plans were being discussed.

Waltz is rumored to be losing support from President Donald Trump over the scandal, but Trump has also demonstrated a lack of understanding in his public comments. During one recent White House press conference, a reporter asked Trump if Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s job was in danger. Trump wondered why anyone would ask about Hegseth since he “had nothing to do with” the snafu. But Hegseth wasn’t just involved, he was the one who appeared to share the most sensitive information in the Signal group chat texts that were made public by the Atlantic, including the types of planes that were being deployed and when.

The New York Times reports that Vice President JD Vance and Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles met with President Trump last Wednesday to discuss whether Waltz should lose his job, but ultimately decided to keep him on. It’s not clear whether this latest article from the Post about Waltz’s use of Gmail will cause Trump to reconsider, but that seems dependent upon whether the story breaks through at Fox News. The president is infamous for watching a lot of TV and will often tweet his thoughts on TV news coverage on his social media platform Truth Social. The amount of TV coverage a given topic gets often determines whether Trump will act. Trump seemed reluctant to pull the nomination of Matt Gaetz for Attorney General until Fox News wouldn’t stop harping on the story.

The use of insecure email accounts by top Trump officials is ironic, of course, given the fact that Trump made information security such a central part of his 2016 presidential campaign. His opponent, Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, used a private server for some of her work as Secretary of State, something that Trump often said she should get tossed in jail for. Waltz himself has criticized Democrats for not being careful with classified material.

“Biden’s sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton’s private account,” Waltz tweeted in June 2023. “And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing.”

It seems unlikely that Waltz is going to advocate for charges to be brought against himself.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Longtime Writing Community NaNoWriMo Shuts Down After AI Drama,https://gizmodo.com/longtime-writing-community-nanowrimo-shuts-down-after-ai-drama-2000583619,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:15:15 GMT","NaNoWriMo, the non-profit organization that grew out of the annual tradition National Novel Writing Month, had a solid 25-year run encouraging writers to speedrun the novel writing process, but it has come to an end. On Monday, the organization announced that it would cease operations due to ongoing financial issues, as well as some very public drama that has played out in recent years.

In an email to community members (and shared on Reddit), the organization was pretty thorough in its reasoning. It acknowledged that the organization has had “six years of struggling to sustain itself financially,” which certainly is not unique among arts-based non-profits. A report found that 25% of arts organizations were facing a deficit equal to more than 10% of their budgets in 2023.

Those financial problems may have been in part what drove NaNoWriMo to partner with Inkitt in 2022, which drew backlash from the community—perhaps the first obvious red flag that things weren’t going great. Inkitt, an online publishing platform, was accused by some authors of being a scam and a content slop farm that took advantage of young or new authors.

The drama continued to boil up within NaNoWriMo in 2023 when a content moderator involved with the organization’s Young Writer’s Program forum was accused of running a smut site and grooming underage users. In addition to those claims, users complained about a general lack of attention from moderators that left user reports and complaints unresolved. While the board of the organization could not verify all of the allegations against the moderator accused of grooming, it opted to shut down the forum.

Perhaps the highest profile stumble for NaNoWriMo came last year, though, when the organization issued a statement on the use of artificial intelligence. While the organization said it neither supports nor opposes the use of AI in writing, it did state, “We also want to be clear in our belief that the categorical condemnation of Artificial Intelligence has classist and ableist undertones, and that questions around the use of AI tie to questions around privilege.”

That did not sit well with many in the NaNoWriMo community, including some disabled members who feel there is a difference between using accommodating tools and generative AI. Authors Maureen Johnson and Daniel José Older resigned from the nonprofit’s board following the statement. Other authors condemned the stance, too, noting that generative AI models were likely trained on their works without permission or compensation.

So, for the first time since 1999, there will be no more NaNoWriMo. If you want to write a full novel over the course of a month, you’ll have to hold yourself accountable now.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,The Problem Isn’t Tinder’s New AI but the Dating Apps Themselves,https://gizmodo.com/the-problem-isnt-tinders-new-ai-but-the-dating-apps-themselves-2000583553,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 19:53:22 GMT","It was inevitable. After signing a deal with OpenAI in 2024, Tinder is now featuring AI characters complete with generated personalities. It’s not to replace a potential date, but act as the punching bag for your pick-up lines and desperate pleas for a real relationship. Only using it quickly reminded me of how dating apps have limited our ability to make connections organically, and instead left us relying on an algorithm to serve us humans like Instagram Reels.

On April 1, Tinder launched “The Game Game,” an AI-fueled meet-cute simulator that’s supposed to help you practice your rizz before you actually enter the dating world. Unlike an app like Character.ai, which lets users create custom chatbot to talk to, The Game Game emulates a “meet cute” scenario with random AI-generated, conventionally attractive people. Even though it launched on April Fools, the game is real. You can access it by clicking on the Tinder icon in the top left corner of the app.

Tinder invited me to test it out early before launch. The game is built around OpenAI’s voice to voice model. Unlike the company’s Whisper API, this model features very little time between you talking to the AI and receiving a response. Users are supposed to use their natural charms to entice these AI-generated characters into a date. The app rewards players for “curiosity, warmth, listening, and asking questions.” More than anything, Tinder told us to “do what feels natural.”

There’s nothing natural about talking to a generated character—but is it truly any less awkward than entering into chat with an actual human? Is the AI any less real than the hunky male lead in every Hallmark movie? In an example for The Game Game, Tinder showed us several execs huddled around a phone trying to entice Chloe, 24 of Tennessee, into a date. Chloe came out speaking in the most Kentucky-fried accent I’ve heard from an AI. It was like listening to Foghorn Leghorn from Looney Toons as voiced by Tina Fey’s Liz Lemon from 30 Rock.

My own attempts at scoring an AI hookup didn’t fare much better. I can’t help but try to pull the AI’s leg, though the chatbot is designed to quickly exit any situation that enters uncomfortable territory. When Harper, 32, apologized for spilling wine on my outfit, I replied, “Sorry, I’m just a little flustered. That wasn’t wine you spilled, that was battery acid.” The AI apologized, told me to go see a doctor, and then ended the chat. I also didn’t get far in an escape room scenario with Mia, 32, after I joked with the AI that it should help me break a window as our quickest form of escape.

The characters are parodies of humans. In another scenario, an AI-generated woman with cartoonishly-shallow cheeks and I try to get into the same cab in New York. The AI affected a not-too-subtle Brooklyn accent and apologized too gracefully for a standard New Yorker. I told her I should just get an Uber, but she was insistent. I told her I’m off to report on some AI in a dating app, and she acted like it was one of the most interesting things she’s ever heard. The meet cute was going well, apparently. Tinder gave me nearly full marks for my awkward attempts at conversation.

Tinder stressed users shouldn’t take this seriously. But its partner, OpenAI, is keen to focus on this an opportunity to showcase its voice to voice model, which the company dubbed Realtime API. This uses GPT-4o models to make characters go back and forth at speeds that edge close to human speech. Still, Tinder seems like the worst app for this kind of AI simulation. The flame app is all about volume of conversations. Just ask the guy who found his wife by using ChatGPT to talk to 5,000 women. Dating apps stress a machine-like process to finding dates.

Tinder is owned by the major dating app conglomerate Match Group and that company also owns Hinge, OKCupid, Plenty of Fish, and more. Colloquially, these get lumped into the term “the apps.” People suffering through the online dating scene boil it down to “I’m on the apps.” I have friends who met their spouses on the apps, but I know just as many people who have done 50 first dates and very few follow-ups, no matter how much they try to analyze these dating profiles for common hobbies and interests.

The emphasis on spontaneity makes The Game Game feel out of place compared to how people normally use “the apps.” Pew Research data from 2023 shows how we’re more dependent on them for actually finding a long-term relationship. According to that data, more than a third of us are paying for the privilege. Apps like Hinge are designed to sap money from users by hiding “Standouts,” AKA people the app thinks you’ll like best, behind a paywall. Then, you’re incentivized to start conversations based on prompts in fellow users’ dating profile. It’s a process as optimized to arrest attention as scrolling on TikTok. There’s no chance for any kind of real “meet cute” situation while on “the apps.”

“It was inevitable,” is the opening line of Gabriel Garcia Márquez’ seminal novel Love in the Time of Cholera. I’ve been re-reading recently, perhaps in a lovesick fashion driven by my interaction with the apps and my impressions of finding love amid a crumbling society. It’s a book about longing, about desire, and how “love” as we define it does not border on the absurd, but is the very definition of absurdity. Love is a different kind of absurdity than OpenAI’s and Tinder’s latest gimmick. All it speaks to is how more folks may be better off not being on “the apps” if they actually want to meet people—especially not some AI caricature.",gizmodo

The mission is traveling where no crew has gone before, and SpaceX just revealed the first views of the planet’s chilly polar regions from above.

SpaceX released a short video taken from the Dragon crew vehicle, showcasing the incredible view from the freshly launched Fram2 mission. “First views of Earth’s polar regions from Dragon,” the company wrote on X. Fram2’s four-person crew is traveling in a polar orbit around the planet, where they are set to spend three to five days carrying out research from their unique vantage point.

First views of Earth's polar regions from Dragon pic.twitter.com/3taP34zCeN — SpaceX (@SpaceX) April 1, 2025

Fram2, named in honor of the original ship that reached both Earth’s Arctic and Antarctic regions, lifted off on March 31 at 9:46 p.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The private mission launched a crew of first-timers aboard the Dragon Resilience, the same spacecraft from which the Polaris Dawn crew pulled off the first commercial spacewalk in history just last year. Chun Wang, a crypto billionaire who founded the Bitcoin mining companies f2pool and stakefish, is commanding, and reportedly funding, the mission. The rest of the crew includes Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer; Eric Philips, an Australian polar adventurer; and Rabea Rogge, a German robotics researcher.

The Dragon spacecraft is flying over the planet’s polar regions at an altitude of around 265 to 280 miles (425 to 450 kilometers), and traveling in a polar orbit at an inclination of about 60 to 90 degrees to the equator. A group of humans has never ventured to polar orbit before, mainly due to the higher-than-usual radiation levels. It also requires a lot more energy, and money, to reach polar orbit because the trajectory does not benefit from Earth’s rotation.

The astronauts will conduct 22 research studies to improve our understanding of human health in space and prepare for long duration missions. The crew will attempt to take the first X-ray in space, perform exercise studies to maintain muscle and skeletal mass, and grow mushrooms in microgravity. Once back on Earth, the crew will exit the Dragon spacecraft “without additional medical and operational assistance, helping researchers characterize the ability of astronauts to perform unassisted functional tasks after short and long durations in space,” according to SpaceX.

From the unique vantage point, the private crew will also be able to observe the aurora-like phenomenon called STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), known for its hazy purple and green streaks across the sky.

So far, Fram2 has delivered with breathtaking views of Earth’s poles, and there’s plenty more to come from SpaceX’s latest private mission.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Substack Says It Will Protect Writers Targeted by Trump’s Government,https://gizmodo.com/substack-says-it-will-protect-writers-targeted-by-trumps-government-2000583569,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:25:53 GMT","The Trump administration has, through its attempted deportation of college students vocally critical of Israel, made clear that it does not believe free speech applies to foreign-born residents. Substack, the popular online publishing platform, is aligning itself with free expression. The company announced that it will partner with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) to offer legal support for foreign writers “residing lawfully” in the United States who are targeted by the government for their writing.

Substack already offers legal support to writers on its platform through Defender, a program that connects writers who face legal challenges to media lawyers who provide free advice and direction, as well as subsidizing the cost of mounting a defense. Notably, in the company’s announcement with FIRE, it urged writers who are facing government persecution to get in touch “whether or not you publish on Substack.”

In addition to Substack’s Defender program, FIRE also has a legal defense program for journalists, as well as one for university faculty and student journalists. Both programs offer guidance and resources for those facing litigation, as well as the potential that FIRE will help pay the legal fees for the legal challenge.

The organizations’ decision to offer support for vulnerable writers comes at a time when things feel particularly tenuous for critics of not just the Trump administration itself, but its allies and interests. Last week, Marco Rubio indicated that at least 300 students have been targeted by immigration officers for deportation and had their visas revoked. Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctoral student at Tufts University, was arrested last week for—as best as anyone can tell—co-writing an op-ed in her university newspaper that described Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as a genocide.

Öztürk is just the latest instance of students engaged in criticism of Israel and support for Palestine who have been targeted by the Trump administration—the most noteworthy being Mahmoud Khalil, who was disappeared by ICE agents and had his green card status revoked for his role in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Columbia University’s campus.

There are some who are a bit dubious of Substack’s judgement when it comes to the types of speech that it defends, given the company’s decision to go to bat for outright Nazis who use its platform. Back in 2023, the company defended its choice not to remove publishers who expressed white nationalist and Nazi ideology, allowing them to continue monetizing their content on the platform. That led to a revolt of some writers who ditched Substack over its decision.",gizmodo

In a statement released by the Justice Department on Tuesday morning, Bondi characterized the young suspect as a “cold-blooded” assassin: “Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Bondi said. “After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.”

Bondi also characterized Thompson’s murder as “an act of political violence.”

Gizmodo reached out to the Justice Department for more information.

The news follows on the heels of a recently issued legal memo by Bondi that resurrected the death penalty after the AG under Biden, Merrick Garland, put into place a moratorium on federal executions. “Since our Nation’s founding, the federal government, and nearly every state, has relied upon the death penalty as a just punishment for the most egregious crimes,” that memo read. “The American people, through their elected representatives, have repeatedly reaffirmed the effectiveness of capital punishment in deterring crime, achieving justice for victims, and closure for their loved ones.”

Mangione was arrested in December, nearly a week after Thompson was gunned down in front of his hotel in midtown Manhattan. Security camera footage of the incident shows a figure dressed in gray attire who, after killing Thompson, steps onto an e-bike and rides away. Bullet casings found at the crime scene were etched with the words “deny,” “defend” and “depose”—which some have speculated may reference a book about the healthcare industry.

Mangione has become a kind of folk hero to some for his alleged targeting of the private health insurance industry, a business that many Americans feel is predatory, unnecessary, and absurdly costly. When he was arrested, Mangione was allegedly found with a notebook that included rants about the healthcare industry. Despite this (or, perhaps, because of it), online support for Mangione—especially among young people—has been intense. A GiveSendGo fundraiser dedicated to the legal defense of the locked-up murder suspect has raised as much as $775,000.",gizmodo

As its name suggests, a qubit in a quantum computer performs the same function as a bit in a classical computer, with a major difference: Qubits can be treated as a 0 or 1 simultaneously, allowing quantum systems to process information much more rapidly than the fastest classical systems.

But there’s also a qudit, a different way of storing and making use of quantum information. Gizmodo spoke to Christine Muschik, a quantum researcher at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the University of Waterloo, Ontario, about the computational unit, which could capitalize on a key tenet of quantum systems to do more complicated computing than classical computers are capable of.

Muschik’s team published research last week in Nature Physics that they say “open the door for hardware-efficient quantum simulations of gauge theories with qudits in near-term quantum devices.” Muschik’s new paper comes on the heels of a 2021 paper on the same subject, published in PRX Quantum.

Gizmodo spoke with Muschik by phone to discuss the nature of the research paper and the future of qudits more broadly. Below is our conversation, lightly edited for clarity.

Isaac Schultz, Gizmodo: I realize you have this new paper out, but maybe first we can just talk about the term qudit, and what the heck it means.

Christine Muschik: We want to make computing as efficient and as powerful as possible. So that’s the overarching mission, to make computing as powerful as possible. Step number one is, of course, that we think quantum computers have an opportunity to be more powerful. But once we are on the route of harnessing quantum, what is the most efficient way to do that? The field was very much inspired by how regular computers work, because in regular computers, you have zeros and ones, and you can do logical operations on that. How most quantum computers work is you also take zeros and ones, only you add your bit of quantum to it. The zero and one can be in a superposition, and then, instead of a bit, you have a qubit. But the philosophy is the same. You have zero and one, and that’s how you process your information.

Now you have qudits, with a ‘D’—because why do we stop at two levels? Couldn’t we just go on? In modern day quantum computers you encode your qubits, you have just two levels and all the others you ignore. But what happens if we don’t ignore all the other states, but we encode information [in them]? We started with a qutrit—just one more level—a single information carrier is now three levels, three possible states.

Gizmodo: If you treat each one of those as a different way of encoding information, it sounds like you could encode exponentially more information.

Christine Muschik: You can fit more information by using more levels, but not exponentially more. If I were to send you a bit, I can send you a yes or no, but if I send you a [qutrit], I have the choices between yes, no, and maybe.

Gizmodo: How does that change the operation of a quantum computer?

Christine Muschik: There’s a price to pay, and then there’s the reward that we reap. You have to have more control across more levels, but the reward is that you have a number of information carriers—a register—that is much more compact.

The most important thing is that your circuit complexity shrinks. We’re in the business of designing logical circuits, and what hinders my team and me all the freaking time is that if the circuit gets too long, that’s our bottleneck. Quantum computers are not ever corrected, and every time you make an operation, you introduce a bit of noise. If you have a long, long, long, long, circuit, you accumulate so much noise that in the end you see only noise and not your answer. That’s our headache, and why we don’t sleep properly.

What we realized with these qudits is that, because information is manipulated so efficiently, it’s like you’re putting your circuit on a diet. Everything is more efficient, and you get your result more quickly and with less noise.

Gizmodo: Now we’re really touching on the research—could you speak to your team’s latest paper and exactly what you found? How did it move the needle on this idea?

Christine Muschik: My team had this dream that we wanted to simulate fundamental particle interaction—that’s actually what I got my job for, to simulate fundamental particle interactions. But it’s really hard to do on a quantum computer. You have a lot of noise. We had this dream of fundamental particle interactions and this other team was in the business of building a qudit quantum computer. We joined forces.

I would argue our outcomes moved the needle two-fold. We could simulate fundamental particle interactions beyond 1D—that was the first thing we set out to do. But accidentally, we also accomplished something else: the first full qudit algorithm. We put everything together and took it for a drive, a whole algorithm. Now you have a computing capability we can apply this to now.

Gizmodo: I was going to ask you about applications now that, now that you’ve derived this.

Christine Muschik: The obvious thing is in particle physics, where you can simulate many things. But then there are also other problems you can simulate, like in materials science, and chemistries you can simulate. It’s also extremely useful in quantum enthusiasts’ notion of the quantum internet that people try to build. You can make information more secure in quantum communication. We realized all these things last year in summer in a joint workshop at the Institute of Quantum Computing and the Perimeter Institute, where we brought together experimental people, theorists, and users. This week we started to write a perspectives paper, because we want to make a roadmap of how qudits can be useful in different areas of quantum technology. And also what is missing—there are gaps, holes, and in some cases canyons of missing information. For qudits, how do you do error mitigation, optimal control, error correction? There’s so much to figure out.

Gizmodo: How do these simulations and kinds of theoretical frameworks marry with real world experimentation that’s going on at places like CERN, at LCLS—places where they are colliding particles and looking at such subatomic interactions?

Christine Muschik: All our quantum computers are, like, really proof of concept. They’re small and noisy. We’re very limited by what we can do. We can demonstrate that it works, but we cannot outperform the strongest classical computers. We cannot even outperform my laptop. For a while classical computers will be well ahead [of quantum computers], but eventually they will hit a roadblock. But once we build [a quantum computer] there’s nothing blocking it. There are particle collisions at CERN—the quantum computer, hopefully based on qudits—that can make a prediction for the collision and you can compare that to the experiments. For instance, we simulate particle-particle pair creation, which is something we cannot see in experiments just yet. In the future, there will be experiments that rip particle-antiparticle pairs in QED out of the vacuum, and so we want to compare to that experiment.

But there are some problems where the classical computer is so good, there’s no reason to build an expensive quantum computer for it. But if you have conditions with a lot of matter, or anything dynamical—think of a neutron star, or the beginning of the universe—regular particle physics computing is out of the window.

Gizmodo: You mentioned that qudits should be in the game when we’re talking about particle collisions. Other strategies or quantum computing approaches are being workshopped that might compete in that space?

Christine Muschik: Oh they’re very, very compatible. Some people think that qubits and qudits would be competitors, but we had one quantum computer whose register was comprised of both. I call it a seamless merging opportunity—you can really plug and play according to what you need.

Gizmodo: What specifically are their synergies, and what kind of questions are better explored using qubits versus qudits and vice versa?

Christine Muschik: In our example, we have a gauge theory—just a fundamental particle interaction—and it has two fundamental ingredients. One ingredient is matter—in our case, we had electrons and positrons. It turns out there’s a very natural description in terms of qubits for an electron and positron, so we leave that to qubits. But force fields—what some call quantum gauge bosons—naturally have many different levels. You make everything super inefficient if you try to describe these force fields with two-level systems. We could get a lot more efficiency using qudits for that. Your infrastructure is the same, you just decide what you want to use.

Gizmodo: What are your team’s next steps, and the next step for qudits in general? What does this mean for quantum physics more generally?

Christine Muschik: We simulated for the first time, fundamental particle interactions with the matter and the force fields beyond one dimension. What we need to do next is we need to go to three dimensions, right? We also want to go to more complicated theories. We talked about electrons and positrons and how they interact. But next we want to include quarks and gluons. A few weeks ago we dove into quantum sensing with qudits. And we also need to investigate how to do better error correction on these qudits. If you could have this [qudit] efficiency but also error correction on top of that, then you’d really be in business.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,How to Watch the Nintendo Switch 2 Announcement,https://gizmodo.com/how-to-watch-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2000583461,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:56:29 GMT","In less than 24 hours, our eyeballs will be filled with Nintendo Switch 2 news. No more speculation and no more hoping to wake up from a fitful sleep to see an angelic Shigeru Miyamoto hovering above the bed with a Switch 2 in hand. The Sequel Switch is set to be one of the most-impactful console launches in recent memory, but we’ll still have to get our hands on it before we understand its true potential.

We don’t have to wait long before Nintendo finally drops the final details about the Switch 2. The company is set to show its stuff April 2 at 9 a.m. ET, 6 a.m. PT. You can watch it through Nintendo’s official YouTube channel or on the dedicated Switch 2 Nintendo Direct page. All those U.S. west coasters will have to wake before sunrise just to see if Nintendo finally shows us if the Switch 2 JoyCon can slide around like a PC mouse, or not. And if you don’t want to tune in you can at least check out Gizmodo, where we’ll be covering the whole announcement.

Join us on April 2nd at 6am PT for #NintendoDirect: Nintendo Switch 2 – 4.2.2025, where we will share a closer look at #NintendoSwitch2. ► https://t.co/XCecVa9Zid pic.twitter.com/ACu5pZUd0D — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) February 5, 2025

The company’s Nintendo Today! app has been counting down the days until the direct. In its latest posts, the app shows an image of the Switch 2 in multiple modes, including with the console docked, in handheld mode, and with the JoyCons connected to their own charging grip. And note the far right of the picture below. Nintendo added to the mouse-controls speculation by having the right-hand JoyCon arranged with its connection port facing down—ostensibly where the mouse optical sensor will sit.

The Switch-maker’s last Direct showed off a fair few games that were still set to launch on the original Switch. That includes both Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which seem like shoo-ins to receive a version on the Switch 2 too. Nintendo also detailed its new system for Virtual Game Cards, which let users transfer digital games between friends’ systems as well as your own. This is likely how Nintendo expects players to transfer games between the original and sequel Switch.

There’s still much we don’t know about the system, including what the hell that mysterious “C” button does on the right-hand controller. Some tips from relatively reliable tipster eXtas1s suggested it could allow players to connect to the original Switch to use as a second screen. Recently-revealed patents for a phone holder connection accessory further suggest the console could connect to a phone or other device to turn the Switch 2 into a pseudo-Nintendo DS.

We also still don’t know if the Switch 2 will finally support 4K resolution. Nintendo filed patents suggesting it had at least considered 4K upscaling for the sequel Switch. However, Insider Gaming reported this week that anonymous developers were confirming Switch 2 dev kits didn’t note any support for 4K output when docked. Nintendo releases these dev kits to developers early so they can craft their games around the Switch 2 hardware.

We’ll be covering all the big news out of tomorrow’s announcement so stay tuned.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Here’s Where Your Dog Is Most Likely to Catch Roundworms at the Park,https://gizmodo.com/heres-where-your-dog-is-most-likely-to-catch-roundworms-at-the-park-2000583477,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:05:43 GMT","Doggy park lovers, beware: Researchers in Ireland say they’ve pinpointed the park hot spots where roundworms are most likely to infect our precious pups.

Scientists at Trinity College in Ireland led the research, published late last month in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. They tested soil samples from parks across Dublin and found that entrances were the most heavily contaminated part of the park, teeming with dog roundworm (Toxocara canis) eggs. The findings could help prevent these irritating, sometimes dangerous, infections that can affect dogs, cats, and humans, the researchers say.

T. canis is one of the most common dog parasites around, with roughly 11% of the world’s canines thought to be carrying these infections. Dogs are its definitive host, meaning that they’re needed for the worms to successfully reach adulthood, mate, and lay the next generation of eggs that are pooped out into the environment.

The worms’ eggs will often be ingested by other dogs, quickly restarting the cycle. Sometimes, the eggs are eaten by secondary hosts, which can later be eaten by dogs—passing the infection along that way. And other times, non-compatible hosts like humans will swallow the eggs, stopping the cycle dead in its tracks. Humans can also become accidental hosts for the related cat roundworm (Toxocara felis).

Unfortunately, even these dead-end infections can still lead to trouble, since the eggs will give rise to larvae that embed themselves into our organs and other tissues, potentially causing serious health problems like blindness and seizures. T. canis infections are usually asymptomatic in dogs, though they can cause issues like diarrhea in adult dogs; they can also sometimes turn fatal in puppies if left untreated.

Given how troublesome these parasites are for dogs, cats, and humans, the researchers wanted to get a better sense of where they’re most likely to be found out in the open. Previous research has suggested that dog parks in general are regularly contaminated by dog and cat roundworms, so the researchers aimed to zero in on the locations most teeming with worm eggs within these areas.

They collected and analyzed soil samples from 12 dog parks throughout the city of Dublin. According to the findings, while different parks did have different densities of eggs, the soil samples from park entrances were consistently the most heavily littered by roundworm eggs (75% of parks in total had eggs). The researchers also looked more closely at a proportion of the recovered eggs, finding that most were T. canis eggs, though some were T. felis as well.

“In Ireland and around the world, the widespread contamination of public places with the eggs of Toxocara spp. represents a potential risk to public health,” the study researchers wrote.

The findings are limited to parks in Dublin. It’s very possible that the situation varies by region. That said, these worms are found just about everywhere, and studies in other countries (including the U.S.) have found that dogs visiting parks are often carrying a wide variety of parasites, including roundworms. The researchers also note that owners frequently report that their dogs will poop as soon as they get to the park, supporting the idea that entrances are likely to be the most contaminated areas.

Ideally, these findings should help researchers, park managers, and pet owners reduce the spread of these parasites. Interventions to discourage dog fouling (when poop is left behind) could be focused near park entrances, for instance. But any such efforts should be paired with better monitoring that can track whether they’re actually working, the researchers say. They said they created a standardized sampling method that other researchers can adopt for themselves, which should make it easier to compare worm egg populations at different parks and at different times.

“Interventions designed to reduce dog fouling and prevent egg excretion through regular deworming of pet dogs and cats are required,” they wrote. “However, these interventions need to be coupled with studies measuring the level of dog fouling and environmental contamination with Toxocara eggs, to ensure that they are having the desired effect.”",gizmodo

But I know what you’re thinking: Since when can we bring life back from the dead?

The phytoplankton—tiny photosynthetic marine algae—weren’t dead, but in a deep “sleep mode” known as dormancy. As detailed in a study published in early January in The ISME Journal, an international team of scientists successfully revived dormant algae—some thousands of years old—from the bottom of the Baltic Sea, bringing them back to full viability. Their work has, quite literally, brought to life a snapshot of ancient Baltic Sea ecology.

Many life forms enter a dormant state with reduced metabolic activity to wait out periods of difficult environmental conditions. When phytoplankton become dormant, they sink to the bottom of their marine habitats where they become layered in sedimentary deposits.

“Such deposits are like a time capsule containing valuable information about past ecosystems and the inhabiting biological communities, their population development and genetic changes,” Sarah Bolius, a biologist and phytoplankton expert from the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde, said in a statement by the institute.

In 2021, Bolius and her colleagues collected the dormant phytoplankton from sediment samples extracted 787 feet (240 meters) below the surface of the Baltic Sea. They successfully collected and revived organisms from nine samples, some of which date back almost 7,000 years.

Skeletonema marinoi—a common phytoplankton species in the Baltic Sea—were the sole specimens that researchers were able to revive from every single sample, with the oldest going back around 6,871 years. The team claims their Skeletonema marinoi is one of the oldest organisms to have ever been revived from a state of dormancy, and the oldest known revived organism from aquatic sediments.

The team then analyzed the ancient phytoplankton and compared them to modern specimens. Their results revealed that the revived Skeletonema marinoi specimens performed their biological activities just as well as their modern counterparts, despite having been deprived of light and oxygen for thousands of years.

“It is remarkable that the resurrected algae have not only survived ‘just so’, but apparently have not lost any of their ‘fitness’, i. e. their biological performance ability: They grow, divide and photosynthesise like their modern descendants,” Bolius pointed out. Furthermore, the team documented the Skeletonema marinoi‘s genetic profiles, revealing that algae from different time periods formed genetic groups within the species. This indicates that the Baltic Sea’s Skeletonema marinoi genetically evolved over time.

In addition to the organisms themselves, other features of the sediment samples can also reveal ancient levels of oxygen, salt, and temperatures. “By combining all this information, we aim at better understanding how and why Baltic Sea phytoplankton have adapted genetically and functionally to environmental changes,” Bolius added.

Her team’s work demonstrates that “it is now possible to conduct ‘time-jump experiments’ into various stages of Baltic Sea development in the lab,” Bolius continued. “Our study also shows that we can directly trace genetic changes over many millennia–by analysing living cells instead of just fossils or DNA traces.”

It seems like Sleeping Beauty had nothing on Skeletonema marinoi.",gizmodo

But before you get your best, goopiest splatter on in theaters, you can keep the summer of toxicity going strong with Toxie’s latest comic book adventure.

io9 can exclusively reveal your first look at Ahoy Comics’ first ongoing series, and the vanguard of its very own Toxic Mess Summer: The Toxic Avenger Comics. Fresh off of last year’s Toxie miniseries, the new ongoing will be written by the Nib’s Matt Bors, and will feature a lineup of different artists across its first arc, starting with Fred Harper.

The reason for the rotating artistic talent? Each of the first five issues of the series will swap genres, with Harper’s #1 being a horror-themed story, with the next four issues dipping into the world of crime, sci-fi, romance, and fantasy. And, of course with Toxie, there’s gonna be a little bit of grossness to the proceedings already. Check out a few of the covers for the first issue below—also available will be a blank sketch variant, and an alternate of Harper’s cover to advertise an included, exclusive trading card.

“When I first approached Lloyd Kaufman and Troma about reviving the Toxic Avenger in comics, I wasn’t modest,” Bors said in a press release provided to io9. “I pitched a new origin, outrageous new characters, and a fully mapped-out, mopped-up, multi-year storyline. Now, Fred Harper and I have been given the green light to go fucking nuts.”

That new storyline teased by Bors will begin in The Toxic Avenger Comics‘ sixth issue, “Toxie Goes to Washington,” after a series of preview pages setting up the arc, illustrated by Harper, are set to appear in the first five genre-hopping tales. Plus, it’ll introduce one of those aforementioned and outrageous new characters, to boot!

The new ongoing series marks the high point of Ahoy’s Toxie-themed summer this year in celebration of the character’s big cinematic return. Things kick off in goopy earnest today, as Bors and Harper’s Toxic Avengers miniseries hits shelves in collected trade format. Then next month, as an amuse-bouche to his new series, Toxie will appear in The Toxic Avenger Pin-Up Special anthology, while June sees the release of Toxie Team-Up, a miniseries that will see Toxie meet a host of other Ahoy characters (including, of course, Jesus Christ from Second Coming), all climaxing with the release of The Toxic Avenger Comics #1 in July and the movie itself in August. There’s never been a better time to love the horrific outcomes of chemical waste accidents!

The Toxic Avenger Comics #1 hits shelves July 9, 2025—and the Toxic Avenger movie hits theaters August 29.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"The New Karate Kid Legends Trailer Teases Its Big, Ultimate Tournament",https://gizmodo.com/karate-kid-legends-trailer-jackie-chan-ralph-macchio-2000583313,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:15:51 GMT","If you’re a Karate Kid fan, you’ve probably been wondering, “Is Karate Kid Legends for me?” Well, its new trailer is here and you can finally start to see how things fit. Jackie Chan’s link to Ralph Macchio, Ben Wang’s ultimate goal, and how the three come together.

The new trailer for Karate Kid Legends debuted at CinemaCon before general release, and in it we learn that Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) was friends with Mr. Miyagi, and he seeks out Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) to help train his new protege, Li Fong (Ben Wang). Li moved to a new city and is having some problems with local bullies. So, he’s going to learn martial arts to fight them in a big tournament and… hey, isn’t this just The Karate Kid again? You bet your butt it is. Here’s the new trailer.

It’s a good trailer but as a Karate Kid and Cobra Kai superfan, I have to admit, I’m not quite sold. The Five Boroughs is not only just the All-Valley again, it’s basically the exact same phrasing. The idea of a kid moving to a new city, meeting a girl, being bullied by her ex, it’s all just 1984’s original Karate Kid again. And while we can buy Mr. Han having a connection to Mr. Miyagi, it feels a little weird that he’s so excited about Li when he spent all that time with Dre, played by Jaden Smith.

Plus, do you really need Daniel in this? Doesn’t he have two dojos of his own students to teach as per the ending of Cobra Kai? Are we really not going to talk about or mention any of them? Those last few questions are up for debate, but as fun and familiar as this trailer is, we’re still a teeny bit skeptical. How about you?

https://wired.com,The CDC Has Been Gutted,https://wired.com/story/cdc-gutted-rif/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:15:38 GMT","Thousands of federal employees at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were notified early Tuesday morning that they were subject to a reduction in force, or RIF, sources tell WIRED, shuttering programs that directly serve and inform the American public.

The effect was felt across the CDC, as workers in the Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice (DEHSP), the Division of Population Health, the Division of HIV Prevention, the Division of Reproductive Health, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control all received RIF notices today.

Dozens of other programs throughout the CDC’s national centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention; Environmental Health; Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; and the Global Health center were also impacted.

Multiple sources in the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that houses the CDC, say that RIF notices began going out around 5 am ET on Tuesday. Employees across HHS offices arrived at buildings only to discover that their badges no longer worked, sources tell WIRED.

“I regret to inform you that you are being affected by a reduction in force (RIF) action,” reads the email to affected employees. “This RIF does not reflect directly on your service, performance, or conduct. It is being taken solely for the reasons stated in the memorandum. After you receive this notice you will be placed on administrative leave and will no longer have building access beginning Tuesday, April 1, unless directed otherwise by your leadership.” The memorandum refers to the February 11 executive order from President Donald Trump titled “Implementing the President's ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative.”

“The cuts today at CDC targeted programs that address all aspects of American lives,” a source at the CDC tells WIRED. “This will lead to worse health outcomes, greater risks to the US public, and will contribute to the decline in US life expectancy … programs that were eliminated fund positions across the country, in red and blue districts.”

“There has been no effort in allowing staff to transfer projects, programs, or responsibilities,” says one CDC staffer.

These cuts will have immediate impact, experts say. At the Division for HIV Prevention, where the stated mission is “to promote health and quality of life by preventing HIV infection and reducing HIV-related illness and death in the United States,” at least half of the employees received RIF notices.

“We’re going to have patients die,” says Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Chicago who also specializes in HIV prevention. “Unnecessary, preventable death.”

Joseph Cherabie, a physician and assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis, says that these cuts will have devastating consequences for HIV patients around the country, especially in rural areas: “It will be catastrophic.”

Cherabie says that states relying heavily on federal funding for public health initiatives, like Missouri, where he works, will be hit especially hard. “We're still seeing young people coming in with new HIV diagnoses, sometimes advanced HIV,” says Cherabie.",wired
https://wired.com,"DOGE Is Trying to Gift Itself a $500 Million Building, Court Filings Show",https://wired.com/story/doge-takes-control-usip-office-building/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:06:27 GMT","The DOGE-affiliated acting president of the United States Institute of Peace, a Congressionally funded, independent think tank, has moved to transfer the agency’s $500 million headquarters building to the General Services Administration free of charge, according to court documents revealed in a recently filed lawsuit.

Tensions at USIP have been escalating for weeks, starting when the Trump administration fired the agency’s 10 voting board members on March 14 and USIP staffers denied DOGE representatives access at the front door. Three days later, DOGE employees made their way into the building, reportedly using a physical key from a former security contractor. The dramatic confrontations culminated in a full takeover, with former State Department official Kenneth Jackson assuming the role of president. As of this past Friday, most USIP staffers have received termination notices.

Former USIP officials have since filed a lawsuit against Jackson, DOGE, Donald Trump, and other members of the Trump administration, seeking an immediate intervention “to stop Defendants from completing the unlawful dismantling of the Institute,” according to the complaint. While US district judge Beryl Howell declined the USIP request for a temporary restraining order that would reinstate the institute’s board on March 19, she sharply criticized DOGE’s conquest in court.

Court documents filed by defendants on Monday reveal the next phase of DOGE’s plans for USIP. As of March 25, DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh—formerly installed at GSA—has replaced Jackson as the institute’s acting president, the documents show. They further state that Cavanaugh has been instructed to transfer USIP’s assets—including its real estate—to the GSA. The letter detailing those changes and instructions was signed by secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

Cavanaugh did not immediately respond to a request for comment by WIRED. The lead attorney for the Department of Justice in this case also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a separate undated letter, which was also included in the batch of documents filed with the court, Cavanaugh writes to GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian: “I have concluded that it is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States for USIP to transfer its real property located at 2301 Constitution Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20037, to GSA and to seek an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement for the building.”

Cavanaugh goes on to estimate that the building has a “fair market value” of $500 million.

In another letter included in the lawsuit’s docket dated March 29, Project 2025 architect and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought writes to Ehikian to approve his request “to set the amount of reimbursement at no cost for the transfer of the United States Institute of Peace’s (USIP) headquarters building.”

To state this plainly: DOGE forced out the directors and staff of a nonexecutive agency and installed one of its own GSA staffers as president, and that person is now attempting to hand the institute’s $500 million headquarters over to the agency he came from, at zero cost.

Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at barrett.64.

“The effort to transfer the building to GSA is part of the DOGE playbook to run agencies through a wood chipper. That’s what they’re trying to do,” claims George Foote, longtime outside general counsel to USIP. “They’re trying to kill the agency, which they have no right to do.”

Lawyers for the former USIP staff filed a motion Monday to prevent the transfer of assets. In an opposing court filing, government lawyers claim that “the Institute is an executive agency and has decided consistent with the Executive Order and its statutory authority to transfer its excess property to GSA,” referring to president Donald Trump's February EO that purportedly “reins in independent agencies.”

Judge Howell will decide whether to allow the transfer in court Tuesday; a broader ruling in the USIP case is expected by the end of the month.

https://wired.com,The DOGE Axe Comes for Libraries and Museums,https://wired.com/story/institute-museum-library-services-layoffs/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:29:52 GMT","The Trump administration, working in coordination with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has gutted a small federal agency that provides funding to libraries and museums nationwide. In communities across the US, the cuts threaten student field trips, classes for seniors, and access to popular digital services, such as the ebook app Libby.

On Monday, managers at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) informed 77 employees—virtually the agency’s entire staff—that they were immediately being put on paid administrative leave, according to one of the workers, who sought anonymity out of fear of retaliation from Trump officials. Several other sources confirmed the move, which came after President Donald Trump appointed Keith Sonderling, the deputy secretary of labor, as the acting director of IMLS less than two weeks ago.

A representative for the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403, a union that represents about 40 IMLS staffers, said Sonderling and a group of DOGE staffers met with IMLS leadership late last month. Afterwards, Sonderling sent an email to staff “emphasizing the importance of libraries and museums in cultivating the next generation’s perception of American exceptionalism and patriotism,” the union representative said in a statement to WIRED.

IMLS employees who showed up to work at the agency on Monday were asked to turn in their computers and lost access to their government email addresses before being ordered to head home for the day, the employee says. It’s unclear when, or if, staffers will ever return to work. “It’s heartbreaking on many levels,” the employee adds.

The White House and the Institute of Museum and Library Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

The annual budget of IMLS amounts to less than $1 per person in the US. Overall, the agency awarded over $269.5 million to library and museum systems last year, according to its grants database. Much of that money is paid out as reimbursements over time, the current IMLS employee says, but now there is no one around to cut checks for funds that have already been allocated.

“The status of previously awarded grants is unclear. Without staff to administer the programs, it is likely that most grants will be terminated,” the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403 union said in a statement.

About 65 percent of the funding had been allocated to different states, with each one scheduled to receive a minimum of roughly $1.2 million. Recipients can use the money for statewide initiatives or pass it on to local museum and library institutions for expenses such as staff training and back-office software. California and Texas have received the highest allocated funding, at about $12.5 million and $15.7 million, respectively, according to IMLS data. Individual libraries and museums also receive grants directly from IMLS for specific projects.

An art museum in Idaho expected to put $10,350 toward supporting student field trips, according to the IMLS grant database. A North Carolina museum was allotted $23,500 for weaving and fiber art workshops for seniors. And an indigenous community in California expected to put $10,000 toward purchasing books and electronic resources.",wired

Don't want to carry a wallet? Nomad’s Folio iPhone case doubles as one. The slim leather case has three card slots inside and a cash pouch. Its magnetic clasp ensures that it will stay shut to prevent your important belongings from falling out. The case also has built-in MagSafe, so you don't have to remove it to use a wireless charger.

We've crowned it “The Sturdiest Case” in our Best Apple Watch Accessories guide. It has a tough stainless steel body with a protective TPU lining and is fully waterproof. It's a great choice if you use your Apple Watch to log extreme sports or activities and need a durable case that can withstand all the elements. It's compatible with the 44/45 mm Series 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and SE.

Nomad Stand One MagSafe Charger Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

The Stand One is the top pick in our Best MagSafe Wireless Chargers guide. Its sturdy aluminum body, rubber padding, and heavy base mean you can remove your iPhone from the charger without worrying about knocking it over. The Stand One can charge your iPhone at a maximum 15-watt rate and supports the Qi2 wireless charging standard, which allows for faster, more efficient charging with any Qi2 phone.

I'm currently using this case with the M4-powered iPad Pro. The outside is made of full-grain leather while the interior has a microfiber lining to protect the display and back of the iPad. It connects magnetically, so there's no bumper around the screen. This technically means it offers less protection than previous versions, but it adds less bulk to an already lightweight and thin tablet. You can fold the cover into multiple kickstand angles, and the magnetic flap has room for your Apple Pencil.

This accessory reminds us how convenient it is to pack a single cable to charge your iPhone and Apple Watch. With an embedded charging puck on one end, you can fast-charge your Apple Watch or AirPods and any USB-C iPhone (or USB-C device) simultaneously. It has a sleek braided finish and an integrated cable tie. It's too expensive, but this sale makes it more wallet-friendly.

https://wired.com,"Best Graphics Cards (GPUs) for PC: Nvidia, AMD, Intel",https://wired.com/gallery/best-graphics-cards-gpu/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Previous-Generation Cards

Normally, I’d recommend a previous generation card, but the RTX 40 Series and AMD 7000 cards are almost entirely out of stock or massively marked up at major retailers. There are still a few older-generation cards you can pick up relatively easily, and they’re some of the only options under $500, with newer generations only having the more expensive cards live. These cards are squarely targeting 1,920 x 1,080 for gaming, so don’t get your hopes up if you have a higher resolution or refresh rate.

AMD

Before the 50 Series launch, I was using a Sapphire Pulse 7900 XT, a card I would love to recommend now, as it served me well for two years at 3,440 x 1,440 and was under $700 in June 2023. Unfortunately, it’s currently hard to find in stock, and restocks will slow down considerably now that the new AMD cards are on the market.

Instead, I'd reach a little further down the power scale and grab an RX 7600. While I haven't spent time with this model, I’ve been historically pleased with Sapphire’s cards, and it should be fairly capable at 1080p in older titles, indie games, and great for your average evening of Rocket League or Minecraft.

Again, this card isn’t going to push 1440p, especially in newer games, and it’s going to lack some of the features you’re seeing on the latest and greatest GPUs. It should get you down the road until things have hopefully calmed down a bit, though.

Nvidia

As of early April 2025, the only previous-generation card I can consistently find in stock from Nvidia is the RTX 4060, a GPU which is also approaching two years on the market. It was a capable card at 1080p, but it doesn't keep up quite as well with today’s games, and you'll have to turn the settings down to even consider 1440p.

Of the available picks, I like the MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ventus 2X Black, a compact card with a low power requirement that should fit into basically any modern system. MSI has a great track record for reliable, straightforward graphics cards, and this one is in stock and recently discounted.

Of the two, I think the AMD is a better buy, even though it’s performance is slightly less impressive on paper than the RTX 4060. At the sub-$500 price point, a $100 price difference can be massive, so keep an eye out for discounts to make sure you’re getting the best deal, especially as these generations begin to close out.

Buying Used

When it comes to GPUs, I'm generally a fan of buying new. Not only will you ensure you have proper warranty and RMA support if something goes wrong, but it can be hard to know if someone misused the GPU, either through heavy crypto mining, poor temperature control in their system, or artifacts and issues they didn't disclose. I'm often a fan of buying used in other areas, but with demand and prices so high, it can be hard to trust strangers.

If you do buy used, make sure to do your legwork. Local meetups via Craigslist or Reddit can have great deals and give you a chance to inspect the GPU, even if you can't make sure it boots up. You can also ask for video proof of the card running a game that also includes the serial number in one continuous shot. If you’re considering buying a used card online, make sure you’re aware of the marketplace and payment processors' return and dispute policies.

When you get the card home, inspect it immediately for any damage to the card, particularly on the PCIe fin and the power connectors. Once installed, a software tool called GPU-Z can verify the card’s hardware to make sure it matches the expected numbers for the model. Run some games on it right away, so that if anything is wrong you can reach out to the seller right away.",wired

How to Keep Your iPhone Updated These settings are based on the latest version of iOS 18, and should be applicable for most recent iPhones. Some settings may not be available on older devices or they may have different pathways depending on the model and the software version. Apple offers excellent software support for many years, so always make sure your device is up-to-date by heading to Settings > General > Software update. You can find the Settings app on your home screen.

Customize the Control Center

Swipe down from the top right of the screen to open the Control Center, and you’ll see it's more customizable than ever. You can tap the plus icon at the top left or tap and hold on an empty space to open the customization menu. Here you can move icons and widgets around, remove anything you don’t want, or tap Add a Control at the bottom for a searchable list of shortcut icons and widgets you can organize across multiple Control Center screens. You can also customize your home screen with iOS 18 to change the color and size of app icons, rearrange them, and more.

Change Your Lock Screen Buttons

You know those lock screen controls that default to flashlight on the bottom left and camera on the bottom right? You can change them. Press and hold on an empty space on the lock screen and tap Customize, then Lock Screen. Tap the minus icon to remove an existing shortcut, and tap the plus icon to add a new one. You can also change the weather and date widgets, the font and color for the time, and pick a wallpaper.

Extend Screen Time-Out

While it’s good to have your screen time out for battery saving and security purposes, I find it maddening when the screen goes off while I’m doing something. The default screen time-out is too short in my opinion, but thankfully, you can adjust it. Head into Settings, Display & Brightness, and select Auto-Lock to extend it. You have several options, including Never, which means you will have to manually push the power button to turn the screen off.

Turn Off Keyboard Sounds

The iPhone’s keyboard clicking sound when you type is extremely aggravating. Trust me, even if you don’t hate it, everyone in your vicinity when you type sure does. You can turn it off in Settings, Sound & Haptics by tapping Keyboard Feedback and toggling Sound off. I also advise toggling off the Lock Sound while you’re in Sound & Haptics.

Go Dark

Protect yourself from eye-searing glare with dark mode. Go to Settings, pick Display & Brightness, and tap Dark. You may prefer to toggle on Automatic and have it change with the sun setting, but I prefer to be in Dark mode all the time.

Change Your Battery Charge Level

If you’re determined to squeeze as many years out of your iPhone battery as possible, consider changing the charging limit. You can maximize your smartphone's battery health if you avoid charging it beyond 80 percent. The iPhone’s default is now Optimized Battery Charging, which waits at 80 percent and then aims to hit 100 percent when you are ready to go in the morning. But there’s a slider you can set to a hard 80 percent limit in Settings, under Battery, and Charging.

Set Up the Action Button

Folks with an iPhone 15 Pro model or any device in the iPhone 16 range have an Action Button instead of the old mute switch. By default, it will silence your iPhone when you press and hold it, but you can change what it does by going to Settings, then Action Button. You can swipe through various basic options from Camera and Flashlight to Visual Intelligence, but select Shortcuts if you want it to do something more interesting. If you’re unfamiliar, check out our guide on How to Use the Apple Shortcuts App.

Turn Off Apple Intelligence

Much vaunted but slightly underwhelming, Apple Intelligence isn’t fully baked yet, and we are still waiting for an improved Siri. If you prefer to opt out of certain features or opt out completely, go to Settings, Apple Intelligence & Siri, and tap on it to toggle Apple Intelligence off. If you prefer to keep select features on, you can find instructions in our How to Turn off Apple Intelligence guide.

Hide Sensitive Apps

Whether you are embarrassed by your Candy Crush addiction or risque photos, or perhaps you’ve been using the Notes app to plan your partner’s birthday party, you can hide them from prying eyes. I'm not here to judge. To protect an app, you have two options: tap and hold on the icon and select Require Face ID, then Require Face ID or Hide and Require Face ID. The first option leaves the app in place, but no one can access it without a Face ID check. If you prefer to hide the app, choose the second option and then Hide App, and it will be obscured inside a Hidden folder at the bottom of your App Library that requires a Face ID check to open.

Stop Videos Autoplaying or Looping

If you find it irritating that videos automatically play as you scroll through the Photos app, or it bugs you that they loop and repeat instead of stopping at the end, you can change that behavior. Tap Settings, Apps, then Photos, and scroll down to toggle Auto-Play Motion and Loop Videos off.

Enhance Speech in Movies and TV Shows

Screenshots courtesy of Simon Hill

It can be tough to make out the dialog in some TV shows and movies, but Apple has a fix for muffled speech on your iPhone. When you’re playing a video, tap the screen to bring up the menu and select the audio icon. You can select Enhance Dialogue and choose Enhance or Enhance More to make the voices louder and clearer.

Set Up Do Not Disturb





1 / 4 Chevron Chevron Screenshot courtesy of Simon Hill Screenshot

At an absolute minimum, you should shut up your iPhone at night so it doesn’t disturb your sleep, but Apple offers a wide range of tools to automate or schedule downtime to help you focus. Go to Settings, Focus, and choose Do Not Disturb to get started. You can turn off notifications but set up exceptions so that specific contacts or apps will get through. You can also go to Screen Time and Downtime to set a specific schedule for each day.

Change Your Default Apps





1 / 4 Chevron Chevron Screenshot courtesy of Simon Hill Screenshot

You don’t have to use Safari as your browser or Apple’s Mail app for emails. You can change the default apps on your iPhone by going to Settings, Apps, and Default Apps. If you have valid alternative apps installed for Email, Messaging, Browser, and a few other categories, you can select them instead of Apple’s apps.

Keep iCloud Files Local

Screenshots courtesy of Simon Hill

You can choose to keep certain files that you have synced with iCloud stored locally on your iPhone, which is handy if you want to access them when there’s no internet available. Open the Files app, go to the Browse tab, and choose iCloud Drive. You can tap and hold on any folder or file and select Keep Downloaded to keep a copy on your iPhone.

Limit App Permissions

Screenshots courtesy of Simon Hill

It’s worth reviewing your app permissions and limiting them. There are a few routes to do this, but Settings, then Privacy & Security, might be the easiest. There’s a lot here, but I advise looking at Location Services and removing or reducing permissions for apps you don’t think need them. You can toggle off Precise Location for many, since an approximate location is often enough for them to function the way you want. Other apps to keep an eye on are Contacts and Photos, as both now give you the option to allow limited access.

By the way, if you want to turn off Background App Refresh to stop apps sucking down data and draining the battery when you aren’t using them, go to Settings, Apps, and choose any you don’t need to refresh unless you open them to toggle it off.

Change Siri’s Voice

His later work Homo Deus then depicted the a future for mankind brought about by the emergence of superintelligence. His latest book, Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks From the Stone Age to AI, is a warning against the unparalleled threat of AI.

A rising trend of techno-fascism driven by populism and artificial intelligence has been visible since the US presidential election in November. Nexus, which was published just a few months earlier, is a timely explainer of the potential consequences of AI on democracy and totalitarianism. In the book, Harari does not just sound the alarm on singularity—the hypothetical future point at which technology, particularly AI, moves beyond human control and advances irreversibly on its own—but also on AI’s foreignness.

This interview was conducted by Michiaki Matsushima, editor in chief of WIRED Japan, and was also recorded for “The Big Interview” YouTube series for the Japanese edition of WIRED, scheduled to be released in April 2025. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.

WIRED: In the late ’90s, when the internet began to spread, there was a discourse that this would bring about world peace. It was thought that with more information reaching more people, everyone would know the truth, mutual understanding would be born, and humanity would become wiser. WIRED, which has been a voice of change and hope in the digital age, was part of that thinking at the time. In your new book, Nexus, you write that such a view of information is too naive. Can you explain this?

YUVAL NOAH HARARI: Information is not the same as truth. Most information is not an accurate representation of reality. The main role information plays is to connect many things, to connect people. Sometimes people are connected by truth, but often it is easier to use fiction or illusion.

The same is true of the natural world. Most of the information that exists in nature is not meant to tell the truth. We are told that the basic information underlying life is DNA, but is DNA true? No. DNA connects many cells together to make a body, but it does not tell us the truth about anything. Similarly, the Bible, one of the most important texts in human history, has connected millions of people together, but not necessarily by telling them the truth.

When information is in a complete free market, the vast majority of information becomes fiction, illusion, or lies. This is because there are three main difficulties with truth.

First of all, telling the truth is costly. On the other hand, creating fiction is inexpensive. If you want to write a truthful account of history, economics, physics, et cetera, you need to invest time, effort, and money in gathering evidence and fact-checking. With fiction, however, you can simply write whatever you want.",wired
https://wired.com,Can Donald Trump really get around the ban on the third term?,https://www.wired.it/article/donald-trump-terzo-mandato/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 14:46:18 GMT","Is a third term for Donald Trump really possible or not? There has been no mention of anything else since the President of the United States, over the weekend, issued some statements in an interview with the NBC where he specified that ""there would be a way"" to get around the 22nd amendment of the Constitution, ratified in 1951, which reads: ""Nobody can be elected president more than twice"". But is it really possible to avoid this stake as the tenant of the White House says?

Donald Trump, third mandate? The hypotheses on the table

A lot is discussing and the hypotheses, according to the experts in the sector, could be substantially three. The first sees the race for the presidency of J.D. Vance, with Trump as his deputy. In case of victory the first one should then discharge and the tycoon would take its place, thus becoming president by circumventing the word ""elected"". It would therefore become the number one to the White House passing from the office of deputy. Here, however, the obstacle is represented by another amendment, the twelfth, which specifies that those who cannot be president cannot even be deputy. The other hypothesis on the table provides that Vance is candidate together with another vice -president. On elections won, the deputy should resign and at that point Vance could appoint Trump to his place, with the Senate's ok. Here the possible unfavorable interpretations of the twelfth amendment would also be wandered.

The most difficult way would instead be that of the constitutional reform: ""It is not easy but not impossible - explains Marco Sioli, associate professor of American history and politics at the Milan state road and author of the book"" American Golem "" - should find the votes of two thirds of the Chambers and the assent of the 3/4 of the States. Trump, however, does not have enough votes at the Congress and in state parliaments, especially of some states. Just think of those of the New England, especially for its policies, especially for its policies. Anti-Canadians, with the signs of the protests that have gone around the world and who recited 'nobody voted for Elon Musk' or those in Vermont, where at the passage of the vice president Vancer Vancer there were those who said 'go to ski in Russia' "". It should be noted that Vermont is the state of the socialist senator Bernie Sanders, a bitter opponent of Trump.

Just a shot or a communication strategy?

And if there are those who have really taken it seriously, appealing the Gotha of American law to understand how the prohibition of the third term could circumvent, there are also those who consider it a weapon of mass distraction from the embarrassing in the safety, after the case of the editor -in -chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, inserted without his knowledge in a chat (moreover in one of the most anti -existing social networks, Signal) where Information was exchanged that defining delicate would be an understatement, such as messages on the attacks in Yemen before they took place (the administration had instead said that it was not classified information): ""He plays a lot to shift attention, pull the stone in the tin and then withdraw the hand - adds Sioli - carries on an extreme arrogant narrative, typical of businessmen, used to impose their own rules. Here the exaltation of the rich and the idea of ​​oligarchy, which passes through even the most unthinkable ideas. One above all, the proposal of a republican deputy of Florida, Anna Paulina Luna, who asks for Trump's face on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln is also sculpted.

A weapon of mass distraction that could be the symptom of fear of not being able to maintain the same consent in the Midterm elections: ""Perhaps it will no longer be enough to unite the darkest features of populism and the very idea of ​​being on the side of reason thanks also to religion - concludes the professor of the state road - protests for cuts to social security are felt, inflation has grown and a large slice of the American population works to Bollette.",wired
https://wired.com,"Neurodegenerative diseases, the algorithm that flashes toxic proteins arrives",https://www.wired.it/article/malattie-neurodegenerative-algoritmo-fiuta-proteine-tossiche-cervello-iit/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:28:26 GMT","He manages to find the harmful proteins for the brain that lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. This is the capacity of the Catgranule 2.0 Robot, a new Machine Learning algorithm just developed as part of the European IVBM-4PAP project, coordinated by the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT). Described in a study published in the Genome Biology magazine, the new algorithm studies the behavior of proteins inside the cells, managing to predict those that have the potential to unleash neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SLA), Parkinson and Alzheimer's. This is why it represents a precious tool to help us identify molecular targets for targeted therapies.

Neurodegenerative diseases

Only in Italy there are about one million people with neurodegenerative diseases, pathologies characterized by protein structures similar to balls (biomolecular condensed), such as the Parkinson's Lewy bodies, the accumulations of filaments in the ALS motorbike and the alzheimer's amyloid plaques. We know, in fact, that the ability of proteins to form balls, in conditions of good health, contributes to managing the production of other proteins and responding to situations of cell stress. But when this mechanism undergoes an alteration, this leads to the development of the disease, where protein balls are transformed into solid structures that accumulate (aggregates of solid matter) into the cells and lead them to death.

The algorithm

The new 2.0 robot Catgranule algorithm (acronym for rebonucleoprotein organization in Biocondensatestetes Types) is able to understand the link between the mutations present in the proteins and the formation of condensed, managing to trace potentially harmful proteins. ""The identification of biochemical characteristics related to neurodegenerative diseases is crucial to intervene early and slowing down cognitive decay,"" explained Gian Gaetano Tartaglia, who coordinated the study. ""We trained our system to recognize the formation of condensate, which in many cases is an initial step for the formation of toxic aggregates. A fundamental contribution to this event comes from the protein -na interaction"".

RNA-Protein interaction

Since the formation of the balls is also regulated by the EN, which interacts with proteins facilitating or inhibiting the chemical-physical mechanism which, in fact, leads to the formation of biomolecular condensed (separation of the liquid-liquid phase) the researchers have focused on the so-called RNA-Protein interaction, instructing the new algorithm so that you use this parameter as an indicator to determine if Biomolecular condensed has the potential to become toxic. While the algorithm analyzes the structure of a protein, considering its affinity for the RNA, the researchers can determine the propensity to suffer the phase separation and to create condensed. The robot method, explain the researchers, therefore allows you to study the influence of mutations on liquid-liquid separation: if they alter the protein -na interaction, it is likely that they also condition the formation of condensed, leading to pathological consequences.

New strategies

The Catgranule 2.0 Robot algorithm is part of the IVBM-4PAP international project, which aims to develop the microscope called In-Vivo Brillouin Microscope (IVBM), a tool that will serve to measure the properties of proteins and condensate within living cells, without external interventions. The integration between the computational work of the algorithm and the experimental activities of the microscope has the potential to identify early pathological signals and develop new therapeutic strategies that slow down the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, thus reducing their long -term impacts.",wired
https://wired.com,"Grok, Elon Musk has ""stolen"" the name of his chatbot?",https://www.wired.it/article/grok-elon-musk-nome-rubato-marchio-commerciale/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:24:00 GMT","The artificial intelligence company of Elon Musk, Xai, risks being involved in a dispute linked to the name of its chatbot, Grok. The United States brands and patents office (USPTO) has in fact suspended the application for registration of the trademark presented by the company, claiming that the name of the system could be confused with that of two other companies, the chip manufacturer to the Grq and the Grokstream software provider. And to make matters worse, now a third technological startup, Bizly, claims to be the owner of the rights associated with the term ""Grok"".

It is not the first time that Musk chooses for its products a name that other companies claim to have already recorded. Last month, the entrepreneur's social media platform resolved with an agreement a cause intended by a marketing company that claimed to have the exclusive rights on the name X.

The dispute around the name of Grok

Bizly and Xai seem to have come to the name Grok independently. Ron Shah, founder of the company, says he had the idea during a brainstorming session with a colleague, who had the habit of using the word as a verb (in the technological environments ""to Grok"" is often used as a synonym to ""understand""). ""I thought: 'It's just the right name' - Shah says to Wired US -. We got excited and we gave ourselves the five: it was the right name!"".

For his part, Musk said that the inspiration for the name of his chatbot came from the 1961 science fiction novel in foreign land, by Robert A. Heinlein, as reported by the Times of India. In the book Grok was a word of a Martian language, always translatable as ""understanding"".

Shah claims to have submitted the application to record the commercial name in 2021. Two years later, when he was on the verge of launching an app for asynchronous meetings renamed Grok, Musk announced an homonymous chatbot. ""It was a day that I will never forget - comments Shah -. I woke up and looked at my phone; there were a lot of messages from friends who said 'you were acquired by Elon? Congratulations!'. For me it was an absolute shock"".

Things say the American rules

Shah is convinced that Xai has violated his commercial brand. In the United States, however, the laws on the subject are first designed to protect consumers rather than companies, says Josh Gerben, founder of Gerben IP, a law firm that deals exclusively with brands. ""The goal is not to create confusion about those who hide a product or service,"" he explains.",wired

The plan, communicated by the regional councilor for the Jean-Pirre Guichardaz educational system, is now to extend the service of the tampons boxes also to middle schools.

""Too often menstruation are still considered a taboo thus uncomfortable the girls - explained the commissioner - and this must not happen. School is a space where nobody must feel out of place. The next step will be to extend the psychological desk to all superiors"".

This is the first region in Italy to introduce this service in a widespread way, in the wake of numerous European schools, as in the cases of Scotland, France and Denmark.

The request of the students

Already since 2022, the students of the Valley high schools have started to request distributors through their representative organ, the student council. At first they had organized themselves independently to set up some of them inside schools and leave absorbent for other companions for free. From now on, the tampons box will be available in the female baths of all high schools in the region.

The distributors were advertised with the slogan ""The cycle is not a choice"", to raise awareness of all the boys on the theme and decrease taboos and difficulties related to menstruation.

The Minister of Transport, during the umpteenth black day for the railways, with numerous cancellations and monstrous delays accumulated by the trains for a breakdown on the Rome - Naples line, did not want to miss his support for the American friend. ""Too much hatred unjustified against the Tesla car manufacturer,"" he wrote on X, and then adds: ""The season of hatred and conflict must end as soon as possible. My solidarity goes to Elon Musk and to all the workers who have been threatened and attacked"".

Elon Musk's descent in the field is damaging Tesla

An action, that conducted in Rome against the electric cars produced by the American magnate, which could remember (with due proportions) the boycott actions that were organized against supermarkets owned by the deceased former premier Silvio Berlusconi at the time of his descent on the field: ""They are actions that always come from the left"", comments Claudio Borghi who raises the dose: ""Every time there is someone who does not like, damage, smear, criminal actions and things of this type.

Donald Trump will pursue attacks on Tesla dealerships as acts of terrorism, the President of the United States officially takes the defenses of Elon Musk against vandalism

Obviously starting from the assumption that boycott a company is an absolutely lawful action, while setting fire to cars is a crime, it is a fact that the descent into the field of Elon Musk and its support for the far right of the whole planet has attracted the attacks of organized groups on Tesla both in Europe and in the United States, where the general prosecutor Pam Bondi launched a very hard warning on TV against the numerous damage that occurred US dealerships, which will be pursued by the USA administration as ""Terrorism Acts"", as announced by Donald Trump: ""Whoever will take part in this wave of internal terrorism - he said - will be taken and arrested"". And again: ""These episodes are a serious threat to national security for which we will not discounts. You can escape, but do not hide. Justice is coming"".

The drop in the stock exchange and in the sales of Tesla is not only the fault of the descent in Musk's politics The entrepreneur's exits and the friendship with Trump do not explain everything

Criminal actions aside, the reaction of public opinion to the political positioning of Elon Musk, the advance of the Chinese brands and the flop of the cybertruck, are damaging Tesla producing a conspicuous collapse of sales and actions: in the last two months the title has lost 40% of its value and does not mention ""rebounds"". We are talking about vehicles that turn to a medium-high-end audience and this hiring, combined with the aversion of the right against electric cars, misalign (and much) the brand's reference target from the political positions of its owner. In essence, with the exception of the Fratoianni family, at the center of a surreal controversy for the purchase of a Tesla by Elisabetta Piccotti, wife and colleague of the leader of the Italian left, the progressive voter who aims at ""zero emissions"" chooses to buy cars that do not finance what is in all respects an ultra -right leader today, while the average voter of the right parties does not use electric cars, which never so expensive. In short, net of increasingly widespread vandalism, Tesla is now unveiled quite transversally: a beautiful problem for Donald Trump's right arm.",wired

The main news for the 2025 high school exam

To access the maturity exam for the current school year, it will be necessary to carry out paths for transversal skills and for orientation (PCTO) and/or similar activities. As regards external candidates, however, the Ministry of Education announces that ""the activities similar to PCTOs are ascertained and evaluated by the Council of the class of the educational, state or equal institution"".

With the new highway code, record increase in retreat of the driving license (even grew by 73%): however, they do not quickly drop road accidents. Or, at least, not in all cities of Italy. Three months after the controversial reform, strongly desired by the Minister of Transport Matteo Salvini and entered into force on December 14, 2024, this is the first budget on the basis of the data of the traffic police, analyzed by the Sole 24 Ore.

Withdrawal and suspension, the numbers

The interventions of the police have definitely grown, from North to Southern Italy: between mid -December 2024 and mid -March 2025, the licenses withdrawn by suspension or revocation were 16,432, against 10,620 of the same period of the previous year. An increase that must be attributed mainly to two sizes introduced with the reform of the highway code: the strictest penalties for those who use the mobile phone behind the wheel and the so -called short suspension, penalties that suspend the license from 7 to 15 days for some infringements, depending on the number of points that the driver has on the document.

Not in all the cities of Italy, however, the result is the same: at the top of the group of those who have tightened checks and penalties there are Milan, with 647 retreats against only 183 of the previous year (+253.6 percent at two and a half months from the reform), followed by Bari, with 103 retreats against 34 of the previous year (+202.9 percent) and Palermo, with 267 retreats against the previous year (+214.1 for hundred). Then Turin, with 546 retreats against 160 of the previous year (+241.3 percent), Rome, where from 1 January to 20 March 2025 530 licenses were withdrawn against the 300 of the previous year (+76.7 percent). Again, Florence from 124 to 174 (+40%), Genoa, from the 366 acts sent to the Prefecture between 1 January and 26 March 2024 to 746 of the period 1 January - 26 March 2025.

The reason for the Salvini reform

The Salvini reform of the Highway Code was born from the alarm for road mortality in Italy: in 2023 there were over 3,000 victims of road accidents, positioning Italy at the bottom of the ranking of the European Union countries. A primacy that imposed an intervention.

Licenses with withdrawn and suspended but the accidents drop slightly

But what efficacy have the penalties have, which are also putting the municipal offices of the whole of Italy to the test with a not indifferent administrative load, on road accidents? For now they have decreased, but not decisively. Not only that: the data are not homogeneous in the cities of Italy and, above all, seem to be in line with the overall trend underway in recent years.

According to the data published by the Sole 24 Ore, in these first three months of 2025 there were 11,568 accidents, with a drop of 5.1 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, while compared to the same period of 2023 the accidents decreased by 1.6 percent. The cities with the most visible results are Naples (-25.5 percent), Florence (-20.7 percent), Bologna (-13.8 percent) where, however, the ""City 30"" project must also be considered, wanted by the center-left junta, which introduced the limit of 30 kilometers per hour in the major roads. A project, however, strongly opposed by Salvini himself. Rome follows (-6.4 percent).",wired

https://wired.com,The intermittent fasting could be a solution to the drop in sexual desire,https://www.wired.it/article/digiuno-intermittente-effetti-aumento-libido-triptofano/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:22:30 GMT","In addition to weight loss, intermittent fasting has a wide range of effects on our body. Among these, now, there could also be the increase in sexual desire. This was reported by researchers from the German center for neuro-degenerative Dzne diseases who, together with a team from the Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, have shown, so far only in mice, as fasting lower the concentration of serotonin in the brain, consequently increasing libido. A mechanism that hypothesize researchers in their study published on Cell Metabolism, could be similar in human beings and therefore represent a potential approach to treat the unwanted drop in libido.

Intermittent fasting

The initial purpose of the researchers was to understand the effects of intermittent fasting on aging. ""Using mice as a model, we study the underlying biological mechanisms,"" explained Dan Ehninger, among the authors of the study. ""Our goal is to obtain information that could also be relevant for humans."" In particular, the study involved a group of male mice, starting from 2 months of age, subjected to a specific intermittent fasting model: they were allowed to feed for 24 hours, then followed by another 24 hours in which they had access only to the water. Only at the end of the fasting regime, for a group that lasted 22 months, for another 6 months and for another even a few weeks, male mice came into contact with females.

The increase in libido

From the subsequent experiments, the team observed that the older male mice had a particularly large number of offspring. ""It's a matter of behavior,"" said the expert. ""In other words, these animals had an unusually high frequency of coupling and, consequently, an unusually high number of offspring for their age. Their mating behavior compensated more than widely the physiological limitations related to age."" The greatest sexual activity was also observed in younger male mice, which had followed fasting for 6 months, but was completely absent in other groups of mice, both young and old, who had followed him for a few weeks. ""In order for intermittent fasting to increase Libido, it takes some time,"" explained the co-author Yu Zhou. ""Based on our experiments, the minimum duration seems to be between 6 weeks and 6 months"".

Low serotonin levels

Contrary to the initial hypothesis that this phenomenon was due to the effects of intermittent fasting on the reproductive organs, the authors showed how this greater libido would actually be linked to the deficiency induced by the tryptophan diet, an essential amino acid (i.e. neither mice nor human beings can summarize it alone, but that it must be taken through food). Triptofano is responsible for production in the brain of serotonin, neurotransmitter generally associated with inhibitory effects, which was present in male mice at unusually low levels. ""The mice were, so to speak, sexually uninhibited,"" commented Ehninger. ""The lack of serotonin was clearly the result of fasting."" At the moment, however, ""it is not clear whether the reduction of serotonin levels is connected to our specific diet or would also occur with other types of fasting"", added Zhou, suggesting that the effect could also occur in a diet where food is always available, but in reduced quantities.

Is the same for us?

We also know that chemical messengers play an important role in regulating sexual behavior also in human beings. ""This applies in particular for serotonin,"" explained Ehninger. ""I consider it very plausible that sexual desire in humans can be influenced by fasting, perhaps not only in men, but also in women, since serotonin also affects their libido"", concluded the expert, according to which, although they serve further research, intermittent fasting could potentially be added to the treatments already available to treat the unwanted drop in libido.",wired

https://cnet.com,What time will Nintendo announce the Switch 2? The key points to be noted,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231223/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 14:19:00 GMT","The Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, scheduled for April 2nd, could be the biggest news in the gaming space of 2025. Nintendo, which surprised people by releasing a preview for Switch 2 in January, is expected to release more detailed information, including the price of Switch 2, the games to be released, and the release date.

The company has not yet revealed details about the Switch 2 since January. What we know is that it will adopt the new ""Joy-Con"" and also play games from the original Switch. Additionally, the console is larger than the original Switch, and it is expected to improve graphics performance. The mysterious ""C"" button is also a big question. More information will be revealed on the 2nd.

Here's what we know about Nintendo's video streaming ""Nintendo Direct,"" which is scheduled to be announced for Switch 2:

What time will Nintendo Direct start?

According to Nintendo, Nintendo Direct will be streaming on Wednesday, April 2nd from 10pm.

Where can I watch it?

Just like previous Nintendo Direct, it will be streamed on Nintendo's YouTube channel and Twitch channel.

What will be announced?

The biggest announcement is the release date and price of the Switch 2. The Switch 2 trial session will continue until June 1st, so it is likely that it will be released in June. According to a recent leak, US retailers will begin accepting reservations for Switch 2 on April 9th.

As for the price, it could be the same as the original Switch (32,978 yen including tax in Japan), but you shouldn't expect too much. The OLED model Switch costs $350 (37,980 yen), and considering that it has already been around eight years since the first Switch was released, it's no surprise that the Switch 2 will be released for $400.

The next thing to notice is the game. So far, Nintendo has only revealed a new Mario Kart game in its Switch 2 trailer. When the company releases new consoles, it often offers titles from the big-scale series, so it is possible that other Mario series and new works from ""Zelda"" will appear at the time of release or immediately after that. The 2025 titles are also expected to include ""Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition,"" ""Pokemon LEGENDS Z-A,"" and ""Metroid Prime 4 Beyond.""

It's also worth noting how much third-party support will be. The original Switch had fewer third-party games than the Xbox and PlayStation due to lack of hardware performance, but if the Switch 2 specs were enhanced like Steam Deck, it could increase significantly.

Technical specifications will also be featured heavily in Nintendo Direct. Those considering purchasing are interested in how much graphics performance will improve on the Switch 2 and how long the battery lasts.

The new Joy-Con is also a concern. The released footage shows it moving like a PC mouse, which seems to be an interesting use in some PC games.

The only major feature that Nintendo has officially revealed at this point is that it can also play games from the original Switch. However, there seem to be some exceptions.

According to Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the initiative is known as ""Project Mulberry,"" and could be released as early as 2026 in a future version of iOS. It provides advice on eating habits and exercise methods, and is said to utilize data collected from iPhones and Apple Watches.

It is already known that Apple CEO Tim Cook is aiming to strengthen its healthcare-related technology.

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It is not clear whether the company's efforts will become a medical resource with diagnostic capabilities, as Bloomberg reports suggests, or it will be positioned as a virtual advisor to health and wellness. According to Bloomberg, the AI ​​agent is trained with data from real physicians and could include content from doctors and health experts.

As Mayo Clinic reports, combining AI with healthcare has great potential, especially in terms of preventive medicine and risk assessment, but risks have also been pointed out.

In December 2024, ECRI, a non-profit medical research organization, published a report cited AI as the biggest risk factor for healthcare in 2025. The report acknowledges that AI could change healthcare for the better, but warns that inaccurate or misleading AI responses and AI products that do not work as expected can be potentially dangerous to the healthcare industry.

https://cnet.com,"A genuine review of Xiaomi's ""POCO F7 Ultra"" with Snadra 8 Elite for less than 100,000 yen.",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231168/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:30:00 GMT","筆者がディナーパーティで写真を撮ろうとしていると、友人が「またそのスポンジ・ボブみたいなスマホを持ってきたの？」と話しかけてきた。私はそれに、「どちらかと言えばミニオンっぽいと思ってるんだけど、その例えもなかなかいいね」と笑顔で応じた。

友人が話題にしたのは、小米科技（シャオミ）のサブブランドであるPOCOが最近発売した、鮮やかなイエローのミッドレンジスマートフォン「POCO F7 Ultra」のことだ。POCO F7 Ultraは、最小構成の価格が649ドル（日本では税込9万9800円）のモデルだが、その中身は見た目以上に尖っている。プロセッサーはQualcommの「Snapdragon 8 Elite」、バッテリー容量も5300mAhと大容量で、さらにInstagramへの投稿にも使える高品質な写真が撮れるトリプルリアカメラシステムを備えている。

そのスペックは、それだけでも十分に特筆に値するものだ。特にSnapdragon 8 Eliteを搭載しているという点では、サムスンの「Galaxy S25」シリーズや「OnePlus 13」、「Xiaomi 15 Ultra」などのハイエンドモデルと肩を並べている。では、F7 Ultraの性能はそれらのお高いモデルに匹敵するものなのだろうか。それとも、その安さには大いなる妥協が伴うのだろうか。

筆者は、実際にF7 Ultraを2週間ほど使って、その使い勝手を確かめてみた。その間、友人や花の写真を撮ったり、テレビ番組をストリーミングしたりしただけでなく、逆ワイヤレス充電機能で外出中にiPhoneの充電に使ったりもした（この見た目が印象的なスマートフォンは、この機能のおかげで頼れる相棒になってくれた）。

POCO F7 Ultra本体とディスプレイ

全体として言えば、POCO F7 Ultraは丸い角とフレームギリギリまで広がるディスプレイを持つ、なめらかな仕上げの洗練されたスマートフォンだ。そのサイズは「iPhone 16 Pro Max」と同じくらい（それよりはやや小さいが）で、筆者の手の大きさにぴったりだった。

画面はサイズが6.67インチで120MHzのAMOLEDディスプレイで、ピーク輝度は3200ニトとなっている。この数字は、iPhone 16シリーズの2000ニトやGalaxy S25の2600ニトは上回っているが、OnePlus 13の4500ニトには及ばない。屋内ではPOCOとサムスンのディスプレイは同じくらい鮮明に見えるが、明るい日差しの下ではF7 Ultraの明るさが際立つ。また、POCO F7 Ultraのディスプレイは、他社のフラッグシップモデルと同じように常時点灯しているため、いつでも時刻や通知を盗み見ることができる。

筆者が特に嬉しく感じたのは、F7 Ultraのベゼルが細く、ストリーミングやソーシャルメディアを楽しむ時の没入感が高いことだ。動画の色彩はiPhoneやGalaxyシリーズよりも抑えめになっており、そこに映る物体や人物の顔はやや色温度が高く、鮮やかさに欠ける。しかし、映像のシャープさに不足はない。

重量は212gと若干重めだが、それがかえって、しっかりと作られたプレミアムなデバイスだと感じさせる要因になっている（F7 Ultraの重量はOnePlus 13とほぼ同じで、Galaxy S25 Ultra、iPhone 16 Pro Maxよりも軽い）。ガラス製の背面カバーと金属の側面フレームは、高級感のあるマットな仕上げになっており、滑りにくい。アルミ製のリングで囲まれたカメラモジュールは背面から出っ張っているが、邪魔に感じるほどではなく、ケースを付けずに机の上に置いてもそれほどがたつかない。

また同社によれば、デバイスの前面は強固な画面保護ガラスである「POCO Shield Glass」で覆われている。実際にディスプレイをタップしたり押したりした際にも、頑丈さが感じられた。幸いなことに、これまでのところ、デバイスを落としてしまった場合にこの保護ガラスがどうなるかをテストする機会はなかった。少なくとも、このデバイスをケースや画面保護フィルムを付けずに何日もバックパックに放り込んで使っていても、傷一つ付かなかった。POCO F7 UltraはIP68等級の防塵・防水性能を備えているが、幸運にも、まだその性能を試すような事態には遭遇していない。

POCO F7 Ultraのカラーバリエーションには、イエロー以外に、もっと落ち着いたブラックも存在する。筆者が個人的に選ぶとすればブラックだが、大胆なデザインが好きで、イエローの方が好みだという人もいるだろう。

POCO F7 Ultraの性能とバッテリー

POCO F7 Ultraの最大の特徴はSnapdragon 8 Eliteを搭載していることであり、その価格に期待される水準を大幅に上回る、目覚ましい性能を発揮する。このプロセッサーは、F7 Ultraよりもずっと高価なGalaxy S25シリーズやOnePlus 13、「Oppo Find N5」などにも採用されており、それらのモデルの性能を大きく引き上げた。

F7 Ultraでアプリをスワイプして切り替えるときの感触は快適かつスムーズだ。ディスプレイに内蔵されている超音波指紋センサーを使ったロック解除も速やかで、ラグはまったく感じないし、カメラもほぼ瞬時に起動できる。ただし、動画をストリーミングする際や、横方向から縦方向、あるいはその逆に画面の向きを切り替える際には若干のラグが生じるし、YouTubeやNetflixをスワイプしてピクチャー・イン・ピクチャーモードに切り替えたりするのにも若干時間がかかる。それを除けば、マルチタスクはスムーズに行える。

GPUとマルチコアCPUのベンチマークテストである「Geekbench 6」では、POCO F7 Ultraは「Galaxy S24 Ultra」や「POCO X6 Pro」よりも上だ。「3DMark Wild Life Extreme」を使ったグラフィックスのテストでも、iPhone 15 Pro、Galaxy S24 Ultra、「Xiaomi 14」を上回った。詳しいデータについては以下のグラフを見てほしい。

F7 Ultraのもう1つの大きな特徴は、5300mAhのバッテリーを積んでおり、120Wの超高速充電と50Wのワイヤレス充電に対応していることだ。これだけ容量があれば、1回の充電で1日中使ってもおつりが来る。また、ワイヤレス逆充電（ワイヤレス充電対応のデバイスをPOCO F7 Ultraから充電できる機能）は非常にありがたい機能で、筆者の場合、外出先で他のスマートフォンを充電する必要ができた時に（移動が多い記者にはよく起きる問題だ）助けられた。

ストリーミング、ソーシャルメディアの閲覧、ビデオ通話への参加、ゲームなどを組み合わせた45分間の耐久テストでは、バッテリーが満充電から97％まで低下した。これは「OnePlus 13R」と同じ成績で、2025年に入ってから最高の結果だ。YouTubeの動画を全画面モードで、最大輝度にしてWi-Fi経由で再生する3時間のストリーミングテストでは、バッテリーは100％から87％に低下した。また充電テストでは、なんと30分間で0％から90％まで充電でき、満充電までにかかった時間はわずか35分強だった。

POCO F7 UltraにはAndroid 15が搭載されており、RAMが12GB、内蔵ストレージが256GBのモデルが649ドル（日本では9万9980円）、RAMが16GB、ストレージが512GBのモデルが699ドル（同10万9800円）となっている。

POCO F7 Ultraのカメラ

続いて、スマートフォンを購入する人の多くが重視しているカメラに話を移そう。POCO F7 Ultraには、5000万画素のメインカメラ、5000万画素の2.5倍望遠カメラ、3200万画素の超広角カメラ、そして3200万画素の前面カメラが搭載されている。

一般に、F7 Ultraの写真は色が柔らかで、色調は抑えめになる。友人のDanaをポートレートモードで撮った以下の写真がその好例だ。全体的にベージュがかった色調が彼女の衣装を引き立て、写真全体に落ち着いた印象を与えている。筆者は、前面の友人が非常に鮮明に写っており、背景に穏やかなボケ効果が入っているところが気に入っている。

自撮り写真も同じように色調はソフトで落ち着いた感じになるが、その代わり肌が美しく滑らかに見える。それはポートレートモードで撮った自撮り写真についても同じで、こちらもしっかり被写体にピントが合っている。

筆者はもう少し色彩が鮮やかな写真が好みなのだが、特に屋外では、F7 Ultraのカメラでもそのような写真が撮れる場合がある。小鳥用の水盤を写した以下の写真では、石材の色や、花びらの明るいピンクや、背景の鮮やかな緑が織り成す幅広い色相が、よりパンチの効いた色合いで表現されている。白い花の花びらは少しぼやけて境界が分かりにくくなってしまっているが、それ以外の部分は、石もレンガもくっきりと写っていることが分かるだろう。

F7 Ultraの5倍ズームでは、シャープネスと鮮明さがしっかりと保たれている。次のチューリップの画像を見てもらえば、花びら一枚一枚に入っている細い線などの細かい部分まではっきり写っていることが見て取れるはずだ。この写真の色彩は特に鮮やかだが、その代償として背景の陰影も強くなってしまっている。ユーザーは、そうした欠点も含めて、どちらの色調がいいかを自分で選択するしかない。

F7 Ultraのカメラが苦手とする場面もある。例えば、昼下がりに強い日差しの中で撮影した次の写真は、かなり白飛びしてしまっている。ただし幸いなことに、これは例外的なケースだった。

筆者が特に感心したのは夜の写真だ。このトルコランプの写真は、真っ暗闇に近い中で撮影したものだが、鮮明でクリアに写っており、模様の色の違いも判別できる。

AIで写真から不要なもの削除する機能を使えば、タップ2回で邪魔なものを消すことができるのだが、この機能は完璧ではない（これは、他社の同様の機能にも言えることだ）。何かを消す処理に数秒間かかるだけでなく、以下の写真で「人間を消す」オプションを選んだケースでは、人間が立っていた部分がぼやけた感じになった。トートバッグの残骸も残っており、筆者は再度これを手動で消す必要があった。

総じて言えば、これらの写真のほとんどはソーシャルメディアへの投稿に相応しいものだった。これは、筆者としてはかなり高い評価のつもりだ。

POCO F7 Ultraはどんな人向け？

POCO F7 Ultraは、価格の割には機能が充実したスマートフォンで、処理性能が非常に高く、充電速度も驚異的で、総合的なプレミアム感も備えている。これらの特徴は、同価格帯の「Galaxy S24 FE」やOnePlus 13Rなどとは一線を画すものだ。ディスプレイのシャープさや、一般的なラグや、一部のカメラ機能に多少の弱点があるが、長所が短所を大きく上回っている（重量に関してはもう少し軽ければよいとは思うが、購入をためらうほどの問題ではない）。

大金を払うことはできないが、処理能力、バッテリー容量、カメラが優れているスマートフォンを探しているという人なら、POCO F7 Ultraは魅力的な選択肢に感じられるだろう。

It's difficult to plug and unplug the outlet with a cable box, but if you place a power strip on the floor, it's easy to look sloppy...

So, I introduced this to add it to the power strip I'm currently using, and was able to secure the power strip in its fixed position.

I was able to secure the power strip in its fixed position for around 300 yen.

Ohm ""Magnetic taps with hook hole"" 364 yen (tax included) *Amazon sales price

That's an item called ""magnet for taps with hook holes.""

It came out on Amazon as a recommendation, attracted by the low price of around 300 yen, so I bought it, and then it was more convenient than the price, so I bought it with every new power strip.

As the name suggests, this item can be used to secure the power strip using the ""hook hole"" on the back of the power strip.

You can attach a magnet to the back of the power strip

You can fix it wherever you like because this item itself is a magnet.

You can secure the power strip anywhere that has a magnet, such as desk legs or stainless steel shelves.

To install it, simply insert the main unit into the hook hole on the back of the power strip.

Insert the head of the screw into the hook hole and place it in place by shifting it to the narrower hook hole.

In this way, narrow the head of the screw little by little and adjust the tightening to exactly how it fits with the hook hole.

This will make you really hooked and you can attach a magnet to your power strip.

The fact that I can keep the power strip I'm using now is convenient, which is great because it keeps costs down.

I was able to hide the power strip without putting it away!

This way, you won't have to store the power strip, so it's very easy to plug and unplug the outlet.

With a cable box, it's nice that you can hide the power strip and excess cords, but the inside tends to be cluttered and it's difficult to insert and remove.

This allowed me to hide the power strip while still having good access to the outlet.

The ""power strip slips off the platform"" phenomenon was also solved

The power strip can be fixed with a magnet, so it is also convenient that it can be fixed to the base like this on a stainless steel shelf.

This can be attached with a strong magnet, so the weight of the excess cable can prevent the power strip from slipping off the stand or table.

This made it very convenient because of course it didn't slip from here and you could plug and unplug the outlet with one hand.

A ""magnet for taps with hook holes"" that allows you to secure the power strip you are currently using in any position you like.

If it would be so convenient for around 300 yen, I would have liked to find it sooner.

https://cnet.com,"Why is ""an external thermal camera that can be attached to Android"" a must-have for everyday use? -- Explaining the use [Review]",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231230/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:01:00 GMT","I love Android smartphones with built-in thermal (thermo) cameras, such as the Ulefone Power Armor 18. However, buying a new smartphone just for thermal cameras is a huge burden.

That's where I found the best product. It's the InfiRay P2 Pro, which can be externally attached to the USB-C port of an Android smartphone.

The price is around $250 (39,000 yen including tax in Japan), but it's well worth the purchase. If you take a picture of the device when it is operating normally with a thermal camera, you can understand the ""normal state"", which makes it easier to spot the defective location in the event of an abnormality.

●What is InfiRay P2 Pro?

The InfiRay P2 Pro is a product that comes with an ultra-compact thermal camera and a magnetic macro lens. It measures 27 x 18 x 9.8 mm and weighs only 9 g.

InfiRay P2 Pro (check price on Amazon)



The installation method is extremely simple, just plug it directly into the USB-C terminal on your smartphone. However, if you have a thick case attached or a smartphone with a highly durable and thick housing, the terminal may not reach. In that case, use a USB-C extension adapter to make sure there is no problem. All you have to do is freely scan the surroundings with a thermographic scan.

Once it's on, all you have to do is look at your smartphone screen.

What I particularly liked was that not only crosshairs are displayed in the center of the app screen, but markers are automatically displayed in the ""hottest part"" and ""hottest part.""

Furthermore, the included macro lens is convenient, allowing you to take photos from quite a close distance just by clicking on it, allowing you to clearly check the temperature difference in small areas.

While software has a lot of customization items, it is not difficult to handle because it has too many features. The advantage is that it is well balanced.

●Many uses in everyday life

I've reviewed a variety of maniacal gadgets, but it's rare to find a thermal camera that's as good as this price range. For those who don't know what to use, here are some examples of use.

- Abnormal heat generation in the electrical system (components that are about to break down are more likely to have heat than normal)

- Discovering problems related to air conditioning (HVAC) such as heat leaks in windows and impaired heating and cooling

- Discovering an overheated rechargeable battery

・ Understanding the location of under-floor pipes (radiator pipes, etc.)

・Check abnormal heat generation in the power cable

・Discover cooling problems with desktop PCs and laptops

Check if the brakes of the car are dragging

The trick to using it in everyday life is to check the condition of the device properly with a thermal camera in advance. If you know which parts generate how much heat, you will be able to notice any abnormalities immediately when a malfunction occurs.

In fact, I use thermal cameras frequently. I just wanted to check if a certain electrical device was connected to a power source. Normally, a multimeter would be used, but I was able to check that the internal parts were warmed with the camera and find out whether the power supply circuit was operating properly, which was helpful.

●Overall review

I have tried many thermal cameras, including standalone and smartphone-connected models, but the InfiRay P2 Pro is my favorite product. It is compact and easy to handle, and the macro lens further expands the range of applications. It also operates quickly and is highly accurate. Additionally, the big advantage is that it does not require a battery.

●Main specifications of InfiRay P2 Pro>

RCS is, so to speak, an enhanced version of SMS. You can exchange large-capacity content such as photos and videos using just your phone number.

To use it, you will need to update to iOS 18.4, turn on the RCS switch and apply for the RCS option.

RCS is a globally standardized messaging service by GSMA, an industry association for mobile communications operators, and can also send and receive large files between Android and iPhone.

Meanwhile, carriers are required to use it on iPhones, and KDDI is the first domestic carrier to start offering RCS on iPhones. However, if other carriers do not respond, it will not become a general messaging service, so trends in other carriers are also being watched.

Matsuda Hiroji, CEO and CEO of KDDI, commented, ""KDDI supports efforts to expand the spread of RCS and will further promote the appeal of messaging services. GSMA is working with domestic and international partners to promote standardized RCS specifications globally.""

https://cnet.com,"OpenAI releases new ""openweight language model"" -- in the coming months",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231205/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:10:00 GMT","OpenAI, the creator of the popular interactive AI ""ChatGPT,"" is building a new AI model. The model will become an ""openweight"" language model with inference capabilities, CEO Sam Altman revealed on social media X. It is expected to be released in the next few months.

Openweight AI models seem to be somewhere between open source and closed source. The weights, which are coefficients of AI models, are published, so they can be modified without retraining using new data.

These models are often relatively inexpensive and are available to companies, providing a high degree of freedom in customization. For example, if a company uploads its internal documents to an existing open weight model, the information can be reflected in the results without having to recreate the entire model from scratch.

However, the open weight model and the ""open source"" model are not the same. As the name suggests, open source models also reveal the source code, as well as how the models are learned and how their weights are set. On the other hand, although the weights of the open weight model are public, source code and training data are not normally public. Considering that OpenAI has not previously published the data used to learn ChatGPT, it is likely that even this new open weight model will only contain some of the information published.

OpenAI is looking for developer feedback to make the new open-weight model maximally useful. Interested people can apply to participate in a feedback session using the form on the OpenAI website.

By combining avatars and LLM, we aim to streamline security operations and reduce the number of required personnel. The two companies announced this on April 1st.

According to both companies, in recent years, the security industry, like most industries, has become a serious labor shortage. Therefore, there is a need to utilize avatars and AI to improve business efficiency. However, the information handled in security services is much of the information that cannot be leaked to the outside world from the perspective of security and privacy, and there are restrictions on using cloud services. Additionally, there was a challenge in dealing with highly specialized security services, which involves a huge cost to learn and adjust AI.

Therefore, by utilizing tsuzumi, an industry-specific and lightweight LLM that can be used in a closed environment, we aim to operate an avatar that combines security and efficiency. By operating in a closed environment provided by NTT Com, visitors can safely handle information that is highly privacy and confidential.

Specifically, three avatars will be installed at the pavilion ""The Future of Life"" at the Osaka-Kansai Expo, to respond to inquiries from visitors and provide information on areas off-limits. If you have difficult questions with an avatar, switch to an ALSOK operator. The avatar is AVITA's ""AVACOM.""

In addition, by summarizing the conversations between visitors and avatars in tsuzumi, it is possible to streamline the analysis of inquiry trends and report creation. We aim to improve the efficiency of the overall guidance work by adjusting the avatar based on the analysis results and increasing the number of cases where avatars can be handled with only avatars.

The implementation period is from April 1st to October 13th. ALSOK will be responsible for central management, avatar management, and manned operators, while NTT Com will build a summary system and provide reports using tsuzumi.

If the two companies can confirm the effectiveness of this initiative, they plan to apply tsuzumi to various fields of security work and promote business efficiency for the entire security industry.",cnet

https://cnet.com,Local account creation methods are unavailable in Windows 11 -- another workaround remains,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231204/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:22:00 GMT","Microsoft has announced that it will remove the script ""bypassnro.cmd"" in its Insider build of Windows 11. This was one way to sign in without a Microsoft account.

Here's how I explained in my previous article: First, before the account screen appears in the initial setup, press ""Shift"" + ""F10"" to open the command prompt. Next, enter ""oobe\bypassnro"" at the command prompt. This will restart your PC and return to the Windows 11 setup screen. Restart work where you left off and make sure your internet connection is disconnected. This will prompt you to enter a name to create a local account on the account screen.

Currently, this workaround is only removed in Insider builds, but will soon be applicable to the Windows 11 production version as well. Microsoft emphasized this as a positive approach, claiming it would ""improve Windows 11 security and user experience."" It also states that the change will allow ""all users with internet connections and Microsoft accounts to complete the setup.""

I wonder if I'll have no choice other than choosing a Microsoft account when installing or updating Windows? There are still several workarounds left.

According to Windows Central, a user suggests the following steps: First, during setup, press ""Shift"" + ""F10"" to open the command prompt. Next, enter ""start ms-cxh:localonly"" at the command prompt. You will then see a Windows 10 style interface that lets you create a username and password for your local account.

Windows Central has confirmed that this workaround is effective, but Microsoft may block this method in the future.

Another option is to set up Windows 11 with a Microsoft account and then switch to a local account later. Go to Settings > Accounts > User Information, click Switch to Sign in with a Local Account and follow the instructions.

Additionally, there is a way to use the free third-party tool, Rufus. Rufus can remove Microsoft account requirements when installing Windows from an ISO image file and automatically create a local account with a specific username.

Exchanges between Microsoft and local accounts have been going on for years, and there has been a never-ending battle in which someone will find a new workaround and the company will ban it if Microsoft removes it.

So why does the company strongly recommend using a Microsoft account instead of a local account? This is because it is convenient for Windows users. The claim is that it can use the same authentication information on multiple products, access services such as ""OneDrive,"" and sync settings between different PCs.

However, Microsoft accounts have privacy and security concerns. Microsoft is using this account to monitor users' activities and market their products and services. That's why they're trying to get them to use a Microsoft account instead of a local account.

In the long run, there should be no fights between Microsoft and its customers. Local accounts are a valid option and should be left to the user to decide. However, the company always prioritizes its profits.",cnet
https://techcrunch.com,Researchers suggest OpenAI trained AI models on paywalled O’Reilly books,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/researchers-suggest-openai-trained-ai-models-on-paywalled-oreilly-books/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","OpenAI has been accused by many parties of training its AI on copyrighted content sans permission. Now a new paper by an AI watchdog organization makes the serious accusation that the company increasingly relied on nonpublic books it didn’t license to train more sophisticated AI models.

AI models are essentially complex prediction engines. Trained on a lot of data — books, movies, TV shows, and so on — they learn patterns and novel ways to extrapolate from a simple prompt. When a model “writes” an essay on a Greek tragedy or “draws” Ghibli-style images, it’s simply pulling from its vast knowledge to approximate. It isn’t arriving at anything new.

While a number of AI labs, including OpenAI, have begun embracing AI-generated data to train AI as they exhaust real-world sources (mainly the public web), few have eschewed real-world data entirely. That’s likely because training on purely synthetic data comes with risks, like worsening a model’s performance.

The new paper, out of the AI Disclosures Project, a nonprofit co-founded in 2024 by media mogul Tim O’Reilly and economist Ilan Strauss, draws the conclusion that OpenAI likely trained its GPT-4o model on paywalled books from O’Reilly Media. (O’Reilly is the CEO of O’Reilly Media.)

In ChatGPT, GPT-4o is the default model. O’Reilly doesn’t have a licensing agreement with OpenAI, the paper says.

“GPT-4o, OpenAI’s more recent and capable model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O’Reilly book content … compared to OpenAI’s earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo,” wrote the co-authors of the paper. “In contrast, GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible O’Reilly book samples.”

The paper used a method called DE-COP, first introduced in an academic paper in 2024, designed to detect copyrighted content in language models’ training data. Also known as a “membership inference attack,” the method tests whether a model can reliably distinguish human-authored texts from paraphrased, AI-generated versions of the same text. If it can, it suggests that the model might have prior knowledge of the text from its training data.

The co-authors of the paper — O’Reilly, Strauss, and AI researcher Sruly Rosenblat — say that they probed GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and other OpenAI models’ knowledge of O’Reilly Media books published before and after their training cutoff dates. They used 13,962 paragraph excerpts from 34 O’Reilly books to estimate the probability that a particular excerpt had been included in a model’s training dataset.

According to the results of the paper, GPT-4o “recognized” far more paywalled O’Reilly book content than OpenAI’s older models, including GPT-3.5 Turbo. That’s even after accounting for potential confounding factors, the authors said, like improvements in newer models’ ability to figure out whether text was human-authored.

“GPT-4o [likely] recognizes, and so has prior knowledge of, many non-public O’Reilly books published prior to its training cutoff date,” wrote the co-authors.

It isn’t a smoking gun, the co-authors are careful to note. They acknowledge that their experimental method isn’t foolproof and that OpenAI might’ve collected the paywalled book excerpts from users copying and pasting it into ChatGPT.

Muddying the waters further, the co-authors didn’t evaluate OpenAI’s most recent collection of models, which includes GPT-4.5 and “reasoning” models such as o3-mini and o1. It’s possible that these models weren’t trained on paywalled O’Reilly book data or were trained on a lesser amount than GPT-4o.

That being said, it’s no secret that OpenAI, which has advocated for looser restrictions around developing models using copyrighted data, has been seeking higher-quality training data for some time. The company has gone so far as to hire journalists to help fine-tune its models’ outputs. That’s a trend across the broader industry: AI companies recruiting experts in domains like science and physics to effectively have these experts feed their knowledge into AI systems.

It should be noted that OpenAI pays for at least some of its training data. The company has licensing deals in place with news publishers, social networks, stock media libraries, and others. OpenAI also offers opt-out mechanisms — albeit imperfect ones — that allow copyright owners to flag content they’d prefer the company not use for training purposes.

Still, as OpenAI battles several suits over its training data practices and treatment of copyright law in U.S. courts, the O’Reilly paper isn’t the most flattering look.

Meet PokéTax, a game that helps make tax filing quite fun. Instead of tax forms, users take on Tax Trainers — gym leaders — representing different parts of a tax form, such as income, deductions, and credits. Each leader asks questions that help players complete their tax forms.

“Once you finish your PokéTax run, we guide you to the IRS Direct File site to officially submit,” Open Ledger co-founder Pryce Adade-Yebesi told TechCrunch. The game is an adaptation of the open source Pokémon game called Pokémon Showdown, and he promised this was not an April Fool’s joke.

“This is real; it works. Tax fraud isn’t funny — and neither is the IRS,” he said.

Adade-Yebesi and Ashtyn Bell launched Open Ledger earlier this year and raised a $3 million round led by Kindred Ventures and Black Ventures. Adade-Yebesi said his team first built this product, which is open source, as a joke. “Could we actually pull this off?” he and his team pondered. The answer was clearly yes.

The game has an AI assistant that helps organize users’ responses, and players can win badges — discover new deductions — as they take on the Tax Trainers.

Taxes are such an unloved part of being a good citizen that few founders think of turning the process into a game. Notably, in 2023, there was the dating-style game Tax Heaven 3000, where users went on a date with an avatar named Iris who asked questions to help complete a tax form. But that was only for the 2022 tax filing year.

Adade-Yebesi hopes that by adding fun to such financial processes, they will be “more engaging and way less soul-sucking.”

The app, which is backed by Mark Cuban and others, is now one of many to build on top of the AT Protocol — the same technology that underpins the social network Bluesky and a growing number of other apps.

Developed by co-founders Tori White (CEO) and Reed Hermeyer (CTO), Skylight offers a short-form video app experience with many familiar features, including an in-app video editor; the ability to comment, like, and share videos; set up your own user profile; and follow others.

Because it’s also built on the AT Protocol (or “ATProto” for short), users will immediately be tapped into Bluesky’s network of over 33.8 million users. That means videos posted on Skylight can be seen and engaged with by users on Bluesky and other ATProto-based apps, like the more photo-centric app Flashes, for example.

Image Credits:Skylight Social

The company is funded by a pre-seed round from Cuban, who said earlier this year that he wanted to fund a TikTok alternative built on the AT Protocol. Leslie Feinzaig’s Graham & Walker Venture Fund also invested.

White, who used to be a travel influencer and is now a self-taught software developer living in Seattle, says she and co-founder Hermeyer were inspired to create Skylight when they first heard that TikTok was getting banned in the U.S.

In preparation for the ban, which is currently on pause, White had backed up her TikTok videos. But she still worried about losing access to her community and comments. She and Hermeyer had already been playing around with ATProto and saw the potential.

Image Credits:Skylight Social

“The first thing that interested us about ATProto was that Bluesky was not failing,” Hermeyer told TechCrunch at the ATmosphere Conference in Seattle in March. “We didn’t see the ‘fail whale,’” he said, a reference to the graphic that appeared in Twitter’s early days when the app was constantly crashing. “That made us feel comfortable about the underlying technology.”

Hermeyer and White soon realized this was an ideal time to build a new social app on the protocol that could be “ban-proof.”

Tapping into her influencer background, White began documenting Skylight’s development on TikTok, which helped bring exposure to the product and build a following of potentially interested users.

“We started with distribution,” White explained. “I actually made a video before we ever wrote a line of code for this … [so] everyone can follow our journey as we build,” she told TechCrunch at the conference. “We were like, oh my gosh, we are building this thing that we think is so cool, but no one cares yet. So we have to build a way to tell people about it so that they would care, because we know people need it,” she said.

Today, White’s @buildwithtori TikTok profile has nearly 50,000 followers, many of which turned into early testers.

Like Bluesky, Skylight supports video uploads of up to three minutes in length, a recent increase from the one-minute-long videos supported previously. But White sees Skylight becoming more than just a decentralized TikTok clone.

She hints that Skylight in the future will allow users to customize their feed, including by utilizing new gestures beyond swiping and scrolling.

Other features in the works include support for sounds, duets, stitching, bookmarks, and playlists.

“We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” Altman wrote. “Working as fast we can to really get stuff humming.”

OpenAI’s new image-generation capability arrived with much fanfare — and controversy — for its impressive ability to recreate styles like Studio Ghibli’s hand-drawn animation. Over the weekend, Altman said in posts on X that the company “hasn’t been able to catch up” since launch and that staff have worked late nights and through the weekend to “keep the service up.”

In a single hour on Monday, ChatGPT added a million new users, Altman claimed in a post. ChatGPT now has 500 million weekly users and 20 million paying subscribers, up from 300 million users and 15.5 million subscribers at the end of 2024.

In an effort to ease its capacity issues, OpenAI delayed the release of the image-generation tool for free ChatGPT users and temporarily disabled video generation for new users of Sora, the company’s suite of generative AI media tools.

In that letter, also cited by Puck, the board is alleging that Hunsicker misled at least some of the company’s investors about financial performance, and about the company’s capital and outstanding shares, including two “falsified” audit opinions.

Both Axios and Puck have reported that days before Hunsicker exited the company, she was out fundraising, and making claims about the company’s healthy finances.

Axios has noted that if the board’s allegations lead to a case of fraud made against the founder, this would be one of the largest such cases ever.

Last week, Charlie Javice, the founder of student loan application startup Frank, which was purchased by JPMorgan for $175 million, was found guilty of defrauding the bank. The bank claimed Javice inflated the customer count. But the investment numbers for CaaStle are three times as large.

This news might be alarming if you’re one of the over 150 million customers in the U.S. who use Zelle for person-to-person payments. But only about 2% of transactions take place via Zelle’s app, which is why the company is discontinuing its stand-alone app.

Most consumers access Zelle via their bank, which then allows them to send money to their phone contacts. Zelle users who relied on the stand-alone app will have to re-enroll in the service through another financial institution.

Given the small user base of the Zelle app, it makes sense why the company would decide to get rid of it — maintaining an app takes time and money, especially one where people’s financial information is involved.

Zelle launched in 2017 with backing from 30 banks to be a more efficient alternative to Venmo. On Venmo, users can receive payments into their own Venmo wallet, which they can then deposit into their actual bank account — but if you don’t want to wait a few days for the deposit to process, you’ll have to pay a fee for an instant transfer. Because of Zelle’s connections with banks, it’s able to offer instant transfers without charging additional fees.

Zelle said that in 2024, users sent $1 trillion in payments, breaking the record of any other payment app. This might be the case because consumers tend to use Zelle for larger payments like rent. Venmo, on the other hand, is designed for more social use, like reimbursing a friend for dinner.",techcrunch

Similarweb, which estimates traffic to websites, including chatbot web apps, has recorded healthy recent upticks in usage across bots like Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s OpenAI-powered Copilot. Gemini’s web traffic grew to 10.9 million average daily visits worldwide in March, up 7.4% month-over-month, while daily visits to Copilot increased to 2.4 million — up 2.1% from February.

Similarweb reports that Anthropic’s Claude reached 3.3 million average daily visits in March, and Chinese AI lab DeepSeek’s chatbot eclipsed 16.5 million visits that same month. Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok, which only gained a web app several months ago, averaged the same number of daily web visits as DeepSeek’s chatbot: 16.5 million.

The numbers pale in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in late March. Yet David Carr, editor at Similarweb, noted that there’s fierce competition for the No. 2 chatbot spot.

“[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” Carr told TechCrunch. “China’s DeepSeek came out of nowhere in January, but the AI platform with the greatest momentum at the moment is Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI, with traffic up nearly 800% month-over-month.”

AI companies’ mobile chatbot apps have been growing their user bases, too, perhaps fueled by recent AI model releases.

According to metrics from app data analysis company Sensor Tower, the Claude app saw a 21% week-over-week increase in weekly active users during the week of February 24, when Anthropic released its latest flagship AI model Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Two weeks prior, shortly after Google made its Gemini 2.0 Flash model generally available, the number of Gemini app weekly active users grew by 42%.

Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, attributed the rising tides not only to new models, but also to new capabilities. Just this past month, Google brought a “canvas” feature to Gemini that lets users preview the output of coding projects, and Anthropic has steadily added tools to its Claude client.

“The rollout of popular new AI models, heightened consumer interest in the space, the introduction of various new features and functions, and the growing number of unique use cases has propelled user growth for AI chatbot apps,” Yousef told TechCrunch.

But OpenAI probably isn’t panicking yet. Yousef pointed out that ChatGPT had 10x mobile app weekly active users compared to Gemini and Claude combined as of March.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,"Who are climate-conscious consumers? Not who you’d expect, says Northwind Climate",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/who-are-climate-conscious-consumers-not-who-youd-expect-says-northwind-climate/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Sometimes, surprises are lurking in everyday data.

Take a category of consumers that Doug Rubin’s startup, Northwind Climate, calls “climate doers.” They’re concerned about climate change and tend to prioritize climate-friendly purchases, the sort of identifiers who might be stereotypically associated with things like buying organic foods or prioritizing local businesses.

“Turns out that the climate doers category actually are the consumers who most frequent fast-food restaurants,” Rubin told TechCrunch. What’s more, some 30% of climate doers are Republicans, he added.

Northwind Climate evolved from Rubin’s work in the political world, where surveys are vital to understanding shifts in public sentiment and identifying likely voters. The startup has raised a $1.05 million pre-seed round, it exclusively told TechCrunch, with participation from angel investors, including Tom Steyer, former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, and Alexander Hoffmann of Susty Ventures.

Rather than divide people into demographic buckets that might segment along political, generational, or regional lines, Northwind Climate analyzes survey responses for behavioral clues that can be used to classify consumers.

In addition to climate doers, who comprise about 15% of all U.S. consumers, Northwind Climate has identified four other behavioral groups, ranging from “climate distressed,” or people who are slightly less concerned about climate change and aren’t as financially secure as the climate doers, to the climate deniers, who tend to be retirees who think the media is exaggerating the problem.

But, Rubin adds, “even in that [climate deniers] bucket, there are messages and ways that work with them.”

Northwind Climate has found five discrete segments that describe consumers’ views on climate change. Image Credits:Northwind Climate

Take some analysis Northwind did on electric vehicles. For climate doers and “climate distressed,” two categories of consumers who are most likely to buy an EV, the startup suggests that automakers frame the cars as matter of choice. “We’re providing choices for those who care about reducing pollution, saving money on gas, and helping address climate change,” reads one of Northwind’s suggested pitches.

But for climate doubters and deniers, who are less likely to buy one, the focus of the pitch shifts from choice to freedom: “Americans should have the freedom to drive what they want. We want to make electric vehicles clean, affordable, and practical for the millions of Americans who want one.”

The startup has built a database that consists of 20,000 survey respondents across eight surveys, and Rubin says it’s growing by 2,500 respondents per month. Every three months, Northwind also runs an industry-specific survey to capture deeper insights for different customers.

Companies that subscribe to the service, which costs $10,000 per quarter or $40,000 per year for a typical customer, can add up to four of their own questions every quarter, which Rubin said is less than what they’d shell out for one annual survey.

Within the platform, customers get access to the data Northwind has collected, questions it has asked, and some basic analyses like cross tabulations. The startup is building a chatbot to allow users to ask for more specific analyses using plain language queries.

Concerned consumers might cast a wary eye on such a platform, worried that it might help companies greenwash their businesses. But Rubin isn’t concerned, saying surveys have shown that consumers are pretty savvy. “Our data shows there is a clear risk to brands and their reputations from making claims that are exaggerated or otherwise untrue,” Rubin said.

Rubin said that Northwind is also developing what he calls a virtual focus group. It’s essentially an AI model, trained on survey responses, that can analyze a company’s marketing materials like TV spots or social media ads and provide feedback, just like a human focus group would. The startup hopes to have it available in the next four to five months, Rubin said, though it will use new data to continually refine the model.

Rubin is convinced that companies have been missing opportunities to connect with climate-conscious consumers. “If you look at the data and where consumers are — and it’s across the board, it’s not just Democrats or Independents — they really want this, and they will reward companies who are willing to be smart about it,” he said.",techcrunch

https://techcrunch.com,TikTok is shutting down its Instagram competitor TikTok Notes,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/tiktok-is-shutting-down-its-instagram-competitor-tiktok-notes/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","TikTok is shutting down its Instagram competitor, TikTok Notes, on May 8. The photo-sharing app launched in testing in Canada, Australia, and Vietnam last year.

The company is notifying TikTok Notes users of its decision to retire the app and is directing them to ByteDance-owned Lemon8, which isn’t surprising given that the apps are quite similar and offer the same sort of functionality.

“We’re excited to bring the feedback from TikTok Notes to Lemon8 as we continue building a dedicated space for our community to share and experience photo content, designed to complement and enhance the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.

While TikTok didn’t provide a specific reason for shutting down the app, it’s likely that the company didn’t see much adoption for TikTok Notes and is deciding to instead push Lemon8, which had around 12.5 million global monthly active users as of December 2024.

In a notice to TikTok Notes users, TikTok says the decision to shut down the app “was not made lightly.” The notice encourages users to download and save their TikTok Notes data and “continue sharing your creativity on Lemon8.” TikTok says that “Lemon8 is a lifestyle app that offers a similar experience to TikTok Notes” but with “even more features.”

Lemon8 launched in Japan in 2020 and later expanded to markets across the U.S. and Southeast Asia. The app is similar to Instagram and Pinterest, as it lets users share slideshows and photo collections and browse content through “Following” and “For You” feeds. Lemon8 offers users access to creative tools, filters, effects, stickers, text templates, and more.

While TikTok is pushing Lemon8 as an alternative to TikTok Notes, ByteDance has also tried to position the app as an alternative to TikTok itself in the face of a potential U.S. ban.

Last November, the company made it possible for users to directly access Lemon8 with their TikTok accounts and rolled out the ability for users to cross-share photo content between the apps. The move was seen as a way for ByteDance to move creators onto the new platform without having to get them to sign up for it separately in case TikTok were to go away.

Fast-forward to today, and TikTok continues to promote Lemon8 in its app as it faces a new ban deadline of April 5.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,"Meet Ponte Labor, a startup matching Hispanic immigrants to jobs using WhatsApp",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/meet-ponte-labor-a-startup-matching-hispanic-immigrants-to-jobs-using-whatsapp/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","While working on their MBAs at Harvard Business School, Colombian immigrants Stephanie Murra and Lorenza Vélez noticed that most of the workers in the cafeteria were Hispanic. In conversations with them, a common theme kept coming up: how difficult it was for people who legally moved to the U.S. from Spanish-speaking countries to find their first jobs in the United States. Not speaking English well or at all, unsurprisingly, was the biggest challenge.

“But then we’re looking at the news and seeing that the U.S. is actually facing an unprecedented labor shortage, especially for these types of positions where you would usually see low-skilled immigrant workers,” Murra told TechCrunch in an interview. “So we were like, ‘Ok, there’s definitely an issue here.’”

The roommates began doing research and realized that many potential employers would use traditional job boards like Indeed, which is “not meant for Hispanic immigrants,” Murra said.

“These workers, many of whom don’t speak English and are not really good with technology, are used to finding jobs through friends,” she explained. Further, they are often confused by online applications and get intimidated by the idea of someone interviewing them in English.

The idea for Ponte Labor was born. The duo — who had previously worked together for two years at Colombian fintech Addi — founded the Miami-based company in April 2023, during their final semester at Harvard.

“Employers in hospitality, construction, retail, and other blue-collar industries really struggle to fill hourly roles while millions of work-authorized Hispanic immigrants struggle to find stable jobs due to language and cultural barriers,” said Vélez.

“We know where to find the workers, speak their language and communicate with them via their preferred channel, WhatsApp. So we built Ponte to bridge this gap,” Vélez added.

The founders claim that their hiring platform pre-vets, matches, and onboards legally authorized hourly workers “faster and more efficiently than traditional methods.”

Workers are hired directly by employers rather than through staffing agencies, which they say not only saves employers money, but gives them a larger pool of potential employees to choose from. On the flip side, “workers gain access to incredible job opportunities that are difficult for them to access otherwise,” Vélez added.

Ponte only works with documented immigrants: every candidate is pre-vetted for legal work authorization before reaching an employer.

The startup has built an in-house AI recruiter which pre-vets candidates through WhatsApp and voice-based AI interviews. For now, it is only focused on the hospitality industry but plans to expand into other sectors such as construction or elder care in the future.

Fast growth

Ponte has been steadily growing since Murra and Vélez formally launched the platform in November 2023, onboarding over 60,000 candidates and placing nearly 800 workers in hospitality roles. Its annualized net revenue has grown from $70,000 in February of 2024 to $550,000 today. It is not yet profitable, but the pair say they operate with high contribution margins, so their model is more scalable. To date, they say they’ve burned less than $1 million.

Today, Ponte is working with 14 employers using its platform to hire workers, like Omni Hotels & Resorts, as well as large hotel management companies such as Pyramid Global, Peachtree Hotel Group, and Atrium Hospitality.

The startup recently raised a $3 million seed round led by Harlem Capital at a $15 million valuation, it told TechCrunch exclusively. Better Tomorrow Ventures, The 81 Collection, and Wischoff Ventures also participated in the financing. Ponte previously raised another $1.5 million combined from Better Tomorrow Ventures’ The Mint accelerator, NFX’s FAST Competition and The 81 Collection.

The company’s revenue model is success-based. Ponte charges a monthly fee equivalent to 10% of a worker’s monthly salary for up to 12 months. Because it’s a high turnover industry, if the worker leaves within the first month, the hotel pays nothing.

Presently, the startup has 15 full-time employees.

Because Ponte’s social media and recruiting channels are in Spanish, over 95% of its candidates are Hispanic immigrants, noted Murra. Besides using WhatsApp, it also places ads on Facebook and Instagram.

“That focus has helped us build deep trust with the community and tailor our approach to their specific needs,” she said. “But we’re building tools that are language-agnostic and could easily be adapted to serve other immigrant communities, including Portuguese-speaking Brazilians, in the future.”

And, she added, the startup has even supported native English speakers who found Ponte, which was named after the word in Portuguese meaning “bridge.”

Looking ahead, the founders say Ponte’s goal is to “create a place to help Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. achieve their professional goals.”

“So that’s not just helping them find an entry level job. We also want to help them grow within those jobs,” Vélez said. “We see one of the biggest opportunities in helping the candidates learn English, because that’s where they get stuck between where they are right now and getting a promotion for their next job.”

Henri Pierre-Jacques, managing partner of Harlem Capital, said he’d been tracking the founders from Ponte’s pre-seed days.

“I loved that Lorenza and Stephanie were former colleagues at Addi…and then roommates at HBS together before starting Ponte,” he told TechCrunch. “We received very positive references from customers who raved about their product. They have managed to see strong traction in little time. It was obvious that Stephanie and Lorenza could do a lot with very little.”

Pierre-Jacques also believes that Ponte’s focus on Hispanic hospitality workers is “a huge differentiator.”

Indeed, Hispanics accounted for nearly one-half, or 47.6%, of the foreign-born labor force in 2023 in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

“With talent marketplaces we are always thinking about how our founders manage the supply side,” he said. “We have seen the power of WhatsApp within this community and Stephanie and Lorenza understood integrating the recruiting workflow through WhatsApp was the best channel to find their workers.”",techcrunch

In a blog post, openSNP’s Greshake Tzovaras attributed the decision to shutter the site due to concerns of data privacy following the financial collapse of 23andMe and the rise in authoritarian governments around the world.

Founded in 2011 by Greshake Tzovaras, along with Philipp Bayer and Helge Rausch, openSNP became an open and public repository for customers of commercial genetic testing kits, including 23andMe, to upload their test results and find others with similar genetic variations. The site had close to 13,000 users at the time of its closure announcement, making it one of the largest public repositories of genetic data. Since its founding, openSNP has touted its contributions to academic and scientific research, and identified more than 7,500 genomes.

News of openSNP’s shutdown comes in the wake of 23andMe filing for bankruptcy protection, intensifying concerns that the company’s vast banks of customers’ sensitive genetic data will be sold to the highest bidder, who may not adhere to 23andMe’s privacy commitments. The attorneys general for the states of California and New York, among others, have warned 23andMe customers to delete their data ahead of the court-approved selloff later this year.

Greshake Tzovaras also said a contributing factor in shutting down openSNP was the “rise in far-right and other authoritarian governments,” citing the removal of public data from the U.S. government’s websites soon after President Trump returned to power.

“The risk/benefit calculus of providing free and open access to individual genetic data in 2025 is very different compared to 14 years ago,” wrote Greshake Tzovaras. “Sunsetting openSNP — along with deleting the data stored within it — feels like it is the most responsible act of stewardship for these data today.”

“Always been a balancing act”

When reached by TechCrunch, Greshake Tzovaras was blunt in his decision to shut down openSNP now and not sooner.

“The ‘why now’ to me is ultimately down to there being what counts for a fascist coup in the U.S.,” Greshake Tzovaras told TechCrunch, a native of Germany.

“Seeing people being disappeared from the streets under the most dubious pretexts really can’t be called anything else,” he said, referring to the recent reports of people living in the United States, including U.S. citizens, who have been arrested in immigration raids, some whose whereabouts remain unknown.

Greshake Tzovaras said the “wholesale dismantling of scientific institutions and science itself” since January — the beginning of the second Trump administration — was a factor in the shutdown of openSNP.

“I don’t think it’s a stretch to worry about how genetic data might be soon abused to make false claims about a variety of topics, effectively bringing back a darker eugenics age,” he said.

Greshake Tzovaras said openSNP has “always been a balancing act” between its potential uses and risks, and that the site’s existence has been an “ongoing thought of whether the benefits can outweigh the risks.”

In one historical example he gave — when law enforcement used genetic data from genealogy site GEDmatch in 2018 to identify a notorious serial killer — Greshake Tzovaras said openSNP seemed at the time like it was less relevant or at risk for use by law enforcement compared to larger ancestry-specific databases. (Greshake Tzovaras confirmed to TechCrunch that notwithstanding the open and public nature of the data it stores, openSNP has never received a law enforcement request for any genetic or user data.)

Greshake Tzovaras said that compared to the first Trump administration, “the misuse of science was both qualitatively and quantitatively very different than what we see today.”

“Alongside the larger conversation about the impact of genetic data in the context of 23andMe’s bankruptcy, we decided that it’s time to pull the plug,” Greshake Tzovaras told TechCrunch.

Greshake Tzovaras also told TechCrunch that on a positive reflection, keeping openSNP running for 14 years may be his “biggest achievement.” He said openSNP ran on about $100 per month, in the face of commercial startups that have worked to monetize people’s data yet ultimately failed. Greshake Tzovaras said that in that sense, openSNP “feels like a testament to the power of open source/culture.”

The site has also contributed to research and publications “across a wide range of disciplines — from infosec/privacy all the way to biomedical studies,” said Greshake Tzovaras. Many undergraduates also benefited from having access to real-world data hosted by openSNP, he said.

“In that sense, I think our hope of ‘democratizing’ access to genomics was at least partially successful,” said Greshake Tzovaras.

Someone is making precisely that tantalizing, bizarre, and clearly sketchy job offer. The person is using what looks like a series of fake accounts with avatars displaying photos of attractive women and sliding into the direct messages of several cybersecurity professionals and researchers on X in the last couple of weeks.

“We are recruiting webshell engineers and teams to penetrate Chinese websites worldwide, with a monthly salary of up to $100,000. If you are interested, you can join our channel first,” read the message, which included a link to a Telegram channel.

For some reason, I also received this message from an X account named “Look at my homepage,” which had a username, @JerelLayce88010, that looked like it was randomly generated.

When I followed the link, I was able to see the admin of the channel, someone who goes by the name “Jack” and has an AI-generated avatar of a pirate.

“Are you proficient in penetration technology?” Jack asked me.

I am not, but I asked Jack to tell me more about their goals.

“Get webshells from Chinese registered domains. There is no specific target. As long as the domain is registered in China, it is our target range,” said Jack, referring to web shells, programs or scripts that hackers can use to control hacked web servers. “You need to understand China’s CMS” — referring to content management systems, the software that runs the backends of websites — “find loopholes, and be able to obtain webshells in batches. There is no upper limit to the number we need. The more the better. This is a long-term job. We can establish long-term cooperation.”

Yes, but crucially, why?

“What I need is China’s traffic,” Jack said, perhaps losing patience with my questions.

OK, but for what?

At this point, Jack definitely got tired of my questions and gave me an assignment: Get me three web shells on any domain registered in China so I know you have the skills. Generously, Jack offered me $100 for each hacked domain.

Alas, I still don’t have the skills to do that, nor the willingness to break the law. Instead I kept asking questions, including who Jack was working for. “Indian government,” Jack responded, although in a subsequent chat Jack contradicted that, blaming automatic translation, which they said they were using because Chinese is their first language.

I spoke to some of the researchers who got Jack’s strange job offer, and they were also puzzled. Nobody said they have gotten a malicious link, for example, or suspicious questions that would indicate some sort of doxing or scam campaign.

“I am guessing it’s a troll [rather] than some serious threat actor,” said s1r1us, a security researcher who received a DM from one of Jack’s sockpuppet accounts on X. “If they want to hire top talent this is not definitely the way.”

The Grugq, a well-known cybersecurity expert, told TechCrunch that he has never seen anything like this recruiting campaign. “I have seen [people] asking dumb questions and spamming for various cybersecurity-related things,” he said. “But never anything like the persistent, widespread, bizarre s— from this guy.”

According to The Grugq, perhaps the goal is to infect people inside China with malware, as it doesn’t make sense to use Chinese domains to launch DDoS attacks or spam, because that wouldn’t justify the high payment.

“I really can’t think of wtf they’re doing,” The Grugq concluded. “It makes no sense.”

And neither can anyone else, apparently. Godspeed, Jack, in whatever adventure you are embarking on.",techcrunch

Intel will also launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers, Tan added. But he made no mention of breaking up the company, according to Bloomberg, which was a potential turnaround strategy floated in recent months.

Tan was named Intel’s CEO on March 12 and assumed the role on March 18, a little over three months after former CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced out of the role on December 1. Previously, Tan was a member of the company’s board of directors before resigning late last August.

That means marketers who want to reach the younger Gen Z audience that dominates the platform will be able to use Google Ad Manager to place their video ad buys, including the Rewarded Video format, Roblox says.

The latter can be purchased both directly and programmatically, allowing brands and agencies to reach Roblox’s “tens of millions” of Gen Z users who are active daily on the service.

For Roblox, the partnership offers more ways for game creators to monetize their efforts while also offering their players other ways to earn benefits inside their games. With the Rewarded Video ads, Roblox users watch up to 30 seconds of full-screen video ads in the Roblox games and online experience to receive the perks the game creator chooses to make available. The company says that tests of these ads saw completion rates of over 80%.

Roblox also announced other partnerships in the industry, including with Cint, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science (IAS), Kantar, and Nielsen to help advertisers measure the impact of their ad buys.",techcrunch

NaNoWriMo — an abbreviation of National Novel Writing Month — is an annual challenge for writers to complete a rough draft of a novel during the month of November. After starting as a Yahoo! mailing list in 1999, the project grew into a self-described “internet-famous” writing challenge with hundreds of thousands of participants over more than two decades.

The organization says it has had longstanding financial issues that have made it difficult to operate, but its other problems became more public last year.

NaNoWriMo lost significant community support when it took a stand in favor of the use of artificial intelligence in creative writing.

New York Times bestselling authors Maureen Johnson and Daniel José Older resigned from the nonprofit’s board in response, reflecting a growing concern among writers about how their work is being stolen to train the very AI models that threaten their livelihoods.

Around the same time, the nonprofit was also lambasted for inconsistent moderation on its all-ages forums, which created an unsafe environment for teenage writers, community members claimed.

According to NaNoWriMo, these controversies over content moderation and AI did not directly lead to the organization’s demise. But they certainly didn’t help.

“To blame NaNoWriMo’s demise on the events of the last year does a disservice to all struggling nonprofits,” a NaNoWriMo spokesperson, Kilby, stated in a YouTube video. “Too many members of a very large, very engaged community let themselves believe the service to be provided was free.”",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Beagle has a new long-range drone with more than one application,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/the-beagle-is-a-new-long-range-drone-with-more-than-one-application/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","When there are damages to energy infrastructure, such as electricity pylons or gas pipelines, expensive helicopters are frequently used to inspect them. Drones have begun to replace some of those inspections, but the flight-time for these can be limited. Now a new company has produced a drone with a very long range to fill this task, and, while the company demurred over any “dual-use” application, it’s clear that it could be used in a civilian setting to inspect infrastructure damaged by warfare.

Hamburg, Germany-based Beagle uses long-range drones to capture data about energy infrastructure. It has now raised a €5 million seed round co-led by AENU (via partner Fabian Heilemann) and PT1 (via partner Nikolas Samios). Prior to this it had raised €1.9 million in pre-seed funding, plus €2 million in grants and subsidies.

Co-founder Oliver Lichtenstein says he and his team spent five years developing what they dub a “computer with wings” that complies with strict EU airspace regulations for long-range flights, and with no personnel on site — the drone literally rises from its housing unaided.

“Our customers pay us for the data by the kilometer of pipeline. We’re cashflow positive in Germany with the current team and operations,” he said over email. “We plan to use this venture funding to accelerate growth.”

Here’s how it works: An operator sends geo data of their grid to Beagle and gets a quote based on the per-kilometer price for one or both of Beagle’s products (methane detection or hazard detection).

Admittedly Beagle does have competitors, including Intero, the Adlares CHARM helicopter (which detects methane emissions), as well as local helicopter or small airplane services. Plus, Nearmap (U.S.) is similar in terms of business model.

However, Beagle claims to have 75 times the resolution of satellites, is cheaper, has lower emissions than planes, and is permitted to fly long-range repeatedly.

The “Fully EU” (“Made in Germany”) solution also means it has full control over the data and software, something of an advantage in today’s world where systems made outside the EU may come up against geopolitical headwinds.

Furthermore, Lichtenstein said: “We have Operational Approval for flights in EU airspace and can currently cover 80% of the EU area, apart from densely populated areas.”

The market it’s addressing is admittedly big. In the EU it’s worth €2 billion alone, given EU methane regulation requires methane emission tracking, and the U.S. plans to follow the same path.

But while the company is limiting its drones to civilian applications for now, Nikolas Samios, managing partner at PT1, commented that it could be used in other scenarios: “In a world where critical infrastructure is being attacked, it has never been more important to have real-time surveillance for critical infrastructure — from energy lines to telecommunications… so the potential applications of this tech are very broad.”

Lichtenstein was formerly with the drone advisory board in the German Ministry of Transport, and is now also deputy chairman of UAV DACH. He’s joined by Jerry Tang (robotics engineer), Mitja Wittersheim, and Bendix Böttger (former head of Sales DACH for Trustpilot).

While at the Federal Ministry of Transport working on implementing the EU drone regulation, Lichtenstein met Tang and spun up the idea for the company.",techcrunch
https://tomshardware.com,Intel announces 18A process node has entered risk production — crucial milestone comes as company ramps to Panther Lake chips,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-18a-process-node-has-entered-risk-production-crucial-milestone-comes-as-company-ramps-to-panther-lake-chips,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:13:14 GMT","At its Vision 2025 conference, Intel announced today that it has entered risk production of its 18A process node, a crucial production milestone signifying that the node is now in the early stages of low-volume test manufacturing runs.

Intel's Kevin O'Buckley, the Senior Vice President of Foundry Services, made the announcement as Intel nears the full completion of its ""five nodes in four years"" (5N4Y) plan, which was originally set in motion by ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger as part of the company's quest to retake the semiconductor crown from rival TSMC. The conference also marks the first time that new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has taken to the stage as the new leader of Intel.



Intel originally announced its four-year plan in June 2021, and despite canceling high volume manufacturing of the 20A node as a cost-cutting measure, Intel is on the cusp of reaching the finish line with its 18A node. Notably, Intel's 5N4Y plan hinged on the process nodes being available for production rather than actively being in the final high volume manufacturing (HVM) stage.



""Risk production, while it sounds scary, is actually an industry standard terminology, and the importance of risk production is we've gotten the technology to a point where we're freezing it,"" O'Buckley explained. ""Our customers have validated that, 'Yep, 18 A is good enough for my product.' And we have to now do the 'risk' part, which is to scale it from making hundreds of units per day to thousands, tens of thousands, and then hundreds of thousands. So risk production [..] is scaling our manufacturing up and ensuring that we can meet not just the capabilities of the technology, but the capabilities at scale.""



Risk production is one of many steps on the long road to fielding a new process node and indicates that the company believes the node is nearly ready for HVM. Intel has already produced plenty of 18A test chips/shuttles, typically wherein multiple different designs are prototyped on a single wafer.

In contrast, risk production consists of pressing full wafers of chip designs into low-volume manufacturing as the company tweaks its manufacturing flow and qualifies the node and Process Design Kit (PDK) in real-world production runs. Intel will then scale production up to higher levels in the second half of the year. This step of bringing up a semiconductor process comes after the R&D, design, and prototyping stages of development.



There is some 'risk' to risk production, though, as yields and functionality (parametric yields, etc.) can be sub-par as the company refines its manufacturing techniques and optimizes its tooling as it works up the learning curve. As such, customers typically use risk production to manufacture qualification or engineering samples, and the customers aren't given as stringent yield targets/guarantees as they are with nodes fully qualified for HVM.

However, some customers are willing to assume those risks to get the payoff of gaining significant time-to-market advantages through early access to the node, which then allows them to adjust and perfect their designs before competitors even begin production.



Intel hasn't yet specified if the 18A risk production is for its own Panther Lake processors, which it says will arrive on schedule later this year, or if the production runs are for its external foundry customers. However, Panther Lake, Intel's first 18A processors, will enter mass production later this year. As such, the Panther Lake chips are likely the risk production subject; this schedule generally aligns with our expectations for a typical risk production-to-HVM timeline for Intel.



Although Intel pioneered several new technologies on its cancelled 20A node, the 18A (1.8nm) chips will be the first productized chips with both PowerVia backside power delivery and RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors. PowerVia provides optimized power routing to improve performance and transistor density, and RibbonFET also provides better transistor density along with faster transistor switching, but in a smaller area.



Intel also continues to work on its broader foundry roadmap, which includes the follow-on 14A node, Intel's first to utilize High-NA EUV lithography. Numerous node extensions to other nodes will further expand Intel Foundry Services' portfolio to a broader range of applications.



These developments come during turbulence at Intel Foundry as the company adjusts to changing macroeconomic factors. Intel recently delayed the build-out of its Ohio operations until 2030, for example. However, the announcement of 18A risk production mirrors the positive reports that Intel is running its first 18A wafers through its Arizona fabs.

https://tomshardware.com,Lip-Bu Tan's first speech as Intel CEO focuses on innovation and working with foundry customers,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/lip-bu-tans-first-speech-as-intel-ceo-focuses-on-innovation-and-working-with-foundry-customers,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 19:39:31 GMT","Recently appointed Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan made his first keynote at Intel Vision 2025, where he said he will focus on earning customer trust and catering to their needs and demands. This change in the chipmaking giant’s mindset began with former CEO Pat Gelsinger’s IDM 2.0 plan, and Mr. Tan is apparently pushing this agenda harder with support from his predecessor.



Intel needs to do this, especially as TSMC founder Morris Chang said that Tim Cook told him in 2011 that Intel didn’t know how to be a foundry. It was thought that Team Blue could not accommodate the changes external chip customers required, making it a poor fit for manufacturing the highly customized chips that different devices necessitate.

Vision Opening Keynote | Lip-Bu Tan | Intel Business - YouTube Watch On

“Foundry is a service business, and that is built on the foundational principle of trust — that is very important,” said Mr. Tan. “And also realize that every foundry customer has their own unique design methodology and style of design. That I part I learned from my Cadence days, and it is something that we need to learn and how to adopt [to] each different customer.”



Flexibility allowed TSMC to surpass Intel in the semiconductor industry, especially as this characteristic enabled the company to land Apple as its exclusive chip supplier. Having a huge cash cow like that allowed the company to invest more into research and development, which is likely why TSMC is the leading semiconductor company today.



But Intel isn’t just giving up the fight, especially with the pending arrival of its Intel 18A process node. Mr. Tan said that he’s looking forward to shipping Panther Lake on 18A later this year, especially as it begins high-volume production. Beyond that, he also mentioned the company is continuing work on the more advanced 14A node.



To drive this innovation, Lip-Bu Tan said, “Under my leadership, Intel will be an engineering-focused company. One of my top priorities is to retain and recruit top talent — engineering — and empower innovation and growth.” He also added, “I believe Intel has lost some of this talent over the years; I want to create a culture of innovation empowerment.”



Before Mr. Tan came on board as the company CEO, there was speculation on whether the next CEO should spin off Intel’s foundry business, and if they should slash more jobs to help with profitability. After his speech, it now seems that the path he’ll take for Intel is to keep the foundry and win more customers. Furthermore, Lip-Bu Tan is apparently trying to hire more engineers and other talents the company needs to advance innovation.



The Intel CEO’s keynote address at Vision 2025 sheds light on the path that Intel will take in the coming years. It will take a much longer time to rehabilitate the entire company, but Lip-Bu Tan’s direction aims to pull the company back from the brink.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Open-source tool designed to throttle PC and server performance based on electricity pricing — lightweight CLI will automatically limit clocks during peak hours,https://www.tomshardware.com/software/applications/open-source-tool-designed-to-throttle-pc-and-server-performance-based-on-electricity-pricing-lightweight-cli-can-automatically-limit-clocks-during-peak-hours,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 19:07:51 GMT","A robotics and machine learning engineer has developed a command-line interface tool that monitors power use from a smart plug and then tunes system performance based on electricity pricing. The simple program, called WattWise, came about when Naveen built a dual-socket EPYC workstation with plans to add four GPUs. It's a power-intensive setup, so he wanted a way to monitor its power consumption using a Kasa smart plug. The enthusiast has released the monitoring portion of the project to the public now, but the portion that manages clocks and power will be released later.



Unfortunately, the Kasa Smart app and the Home Assistant dashboard was inconvenient and couldn't do everything he desired. He already had a terminal window running monitoring tools like htop, nvtop, and nload, and decided to take matters into his own hands rather than dealing with yet another app.



Naveen built a terminal-based UI that shows power consumption data through Home Assistant and the TP-Link integration. The app monitors real-time power use, showing wattage and current, as well as providing historical consumption charts. More importantly, it is designed to automatically throttle CPU and GPU performance.



Naveen’s power provider uses Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing, so using a lot of power during peak hours can cost significantly more. The workstation can draw as much as 1400 watts at full load, but by reducing the CPU frequency from 3.7 GHz to 1.5 GHz, he's able to reduce consumption by about 225 watts. (No mention is made of GPU throttling, which could potentially allow for even higher power savings with a quad-GPU setup.)



Results will vary based on the hardware being used, naturally, and servers can pull far more power than a typical desktop — even one designed and used for gaming.

WattWise optimizes the system’s clock speed based on the current system load, power consumption as reported by the smart plug, and the time — with the latter factoring in peak pricing. From there, it uses a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to manage the power and adapts system parameters based on the three variables.



At the moment, the app only supports one smart plug at a time and only works with the Kasa brand. However, Naveem says there are plans to add support for multiple plugs, more smart plug brands, integration with other power management tools, and other features. The app in its current form is a pretty simple tool, but sometimes simple is all you need to solve a problem.



Naveen made WattWise open source under the MIT license, and you can download it directly from GitHub. If you’re interested, you can leave feedback and contributions, or you can fork it and adapt it for other systems. Note that the current version only contains the dashboard, not the actual power optimizer, which still needs further work.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Rapidus to begin trial production of its 2nm process this month — Japan gets closer to cutting-edge silicon manufacturing,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/rapidus-to-begin-trial-production-of-its-2nm-process-this-month-japan-gets-closer-to-cutting-edge-silicon-manufacturing,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:54:16 GMT","Japan's government-backed chipmaker Rapidus has begun adjusting equipment in order to start test production of wafers later this month. The company, which aims to begin high-volume production on its 2nm-class process technology by 2027, plans to complete the first test wafers by July, according to Bloomberg. After that, the company intends to release process design kits (PDKs) to early customers and offer them an opportunity to prototype their designs.



Rapidus began installing semiconductor production equipment, including ASML's advanced EUV and DUV lithography systems, into its Innovative Integration for Manufacturing (IIM) facility in Chitose, Hokkaido late last year. By now, the company has probably reached the 'first light' on wafer milestone with advanced tools, so it is reasonable to expect it to be able to start pilot production of its own circuits using its 2nm fabrication process that relies on gate-all-around transistors.



One of Rapidus' main advantages over established players like TSMC, Samsung Foundry, and Intel Foundry is projected to be its fully automated advanced packaging capability that will operate at the same fab as the wafer processing, something no company has done yet. This would greatly speed up the production cycle for designs that require advanced packaging. However, for now, Rapidus will only offer pilot production of semiconductor wafers themselves and will not offer test packaging services.



Rapidus is currently setting up a new research and development center, named Rapidus Chiplet Solutions (RCS), at Seiko Epson Corporation's Chitose Plant, located next to the IIM facility. Preparatory work for RCS has been ongoing since October, 2024, and starting in this month, the company will begin installing production equipment at the site, focusing on post-fabrication stages. The facility will be used to build a pilot line aimed at developing scalable manufacturing techniques. Work at RCS will include advancement of redistribution layer (RDL) interposer structures, three-dimensional packaging methods, assembly design kits (ADKs) for complex back-end operations, and known good die (KGD) testing processes.



""The construction of the IIM manufacturing facility at Rapidus has progressed smoothly, and by the end of last fiscal year we had completed the installation of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment necessary for the start of pilot operations,"" said Dr. Atsuyoshi Koike, representative director and CEO of Rapidus. […] ""With the approval of the NEDO project plan and budget, we will start up the pilot line in April, which will steadily lead to the start of mass production targeted for 2027.""

The smaller P310 M.2 2230 is one of the best SSDs for the Steam Deck and other Windows gaming handhelds, and this larger 2280 version of the P310 is just an updated version of the same drive with a larger form factor. So, if you want an inexpensive solution for the shrinking SSD space of your game library, the Crucial P310 could be the answer. This version also includes a heatsink for additional cooling.

If you want to get your hands on one of these drives, pick up the Crucial P310 (1TB) with heatsink for just $74 - its lowest-ever price on Amazon. If you'd like more detailed information on this Gen 4 SSD, look at our review of Crucial's P310 M.2 2280 SSD.

This heatsink version of the P310 from Crucial is the 2280 form-factor variant. Although the standard P310 is perfect for popping into a laptop, thanks to its excellent power efficiency, this version is not advised due to its height and space constraints in most laptop drive bays. The Crucial P310 on sale has a 1TB capacity and uses Micron's 232-layer QLC NAND flash memory. The controller used is the Phison E27T, which helps to get the P310 to run with sequential read/write speeds of 7,100/6,000 MB/s.

Crucial P310 1TB with Heatsink: now $74 at Amazon (was $95)



The Crucial P310 M.2-2280 is the recently released upgrade to the smaller P310 M.2-2230 SSD. This 1TB version features a heatsink for improved cooling. Using a Phison E27T controller and 232-Layer Micron QLC NAND-flash memory, the P310 has sequential read/write speeds of 7,100/6,000 MB/s and 1,000K/1,200K IOPS with an endurance TBW of 220TB. See our review of the Crucial P310 M.2-2280 for more information.

Even though the P310 has excellent performance, rivaling the speeds of many of the top Gen 4 SSDs, the sustained performance of the P310 isn't the best because of its use of QLC NAND instead of TLC. The less available space on the drive, the quicker the performance deteriorates. However, as long as you can find this drive at the right price, the performance of the P310 outweighs its use of QLC. It's not worth it if you can find a TLC drive with a heatsink for less money and better performance.

https://tomshardware.com,Retailer clarifies RTX 5090 'B-stock' listing with missing ROPs was a system error,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/retailer-clarifies-rtx-5090-b-stock-listing-with-missing-rops-was-a-system-error,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:13:17 GMT","German tech retailer Alternate has explained a controversial recent listing on its website for an RTX 5090 with missing ROPs. On the site it was classified as ""B-stock"" that, despite the apparent defect, was being sold for more than the graphic card model's MSRP. The online store confirmed has now that this GPU was part of a customer return and was never intended for sale (via ComputerBase).

The first case of an RTX 50 series GPU with missing ROP units dates back to late February, with many subsequent reports to follow as awareness increased. ROPs are hardware units on your GPU responsible for pixel processing, blending, anti-aliasing, and writing to the frame buffer. All displayed pixel data must go through the ROP units before it can be written to the GPU's memory.

Nvidia later issued a clarification asserting only 0.5% of produced RTX 5090s and RTX 5070 Tis were impacted, asking affected customers to push their respective board partners for a replacement. After it was revealed that this manufacturing defect extended to the RTX 5080 as well, testing by Gamer's Nexus showed that GPUs with a missing ROP cluster take an up to 11% performance hit while gaming.

Considering the broad Blackwell shortage, retailers selling defective units with missing ROPs at a discount wouldn't be surprising. Last week, Alternate listed a ""B-stock"" RTX 5090 with 168 (out of 176 advertised) ROPs for €2,899 ($3,100), a price that's comparable to fully functional models. After the news emerged, the German store contacted ComputerBase, explaining that the listed GPU was the consequence of an internal system error and was never intended to be sold.

B-stock typically refers to products that are no longer considered new due to issues like cosmetic flaws or customer returns. Based on the extent of these issues, retailers then establish a reasonable price tag for these items. The defective RTX 5090 at Alternative was likely misclassified as B-stock in their database due to a part defect: the missing ROP units. Moreover, the system defaulted to the cost of a brand-new RTX 5090, as it was probably not designed to price GPUs with missing ROPs in the first place.

“We have of course removed the said graphics card from the sale... Some internal processes run automatically where errors can happen.” Alternate to ComputerBase

The GPU has now been delisted from the website, and it was apparently a customer return, likely intended for replacement. Blackwell supply is gradually improving but the same cannot be said for the prices.

Even though street prices barely adhere to the MSRP, AIBs are continuing to increase them as we move into April. The average selling price of an RTX 5090 Founders Edition at eBay has stabilized at $4,000 but we're still likely months away from normality. Sadly, this trend continues to plague both current-gen and last-gen GPUs, not just from Nvidia, but from all three vendors.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Asus drops teaser for Xbox 'Kennan' handheld — reveals sneak peek days before Switch 2 launch,https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/asus-drops-teaser-for-xbox-keenan-handheld-reveals-sneak-peek-days-before-switch-2-launch,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:52:41 GMT","Rumors about an Xbox handheld have been flying around, and Asus just fanned the flames by dropping a teaser on its X (formerly Twitter) account.

The video shows an animated robot programming improvements on a terminal for itself. Just as it was about to implement the changes, a device that looks like an ROG Ally X gaming console and an ROG Raikiri Pro controller fell in with the character. After the dust settles, the robot apparently turns into a gaming console that looks vaguely similar to the company’s current top-end handheld.

What made this social media posting even more interesting was that the official Xbox account replied with the side-eye meme. Nothing official has been announced yet, by any means, but Microsoft’s response likely refers to Project Kennan — the gaming handheld it’s developing with Asus that’s designed to unify Xbox and Windows as one platform.

While neither party has revealed anything specific, the video gave us a preview of what to expect from this planned Xbox handheld. This includes a longer battery life, better performance, and bigger storage, alongside a new look for this handheld.

Asus posted the video on March 31, 2025, at 2 pm EST. The company likely did this to avoid the teaser from being misconstrued as an April Fool’s prank, especially as many other tech companies are posting jokes of their own. However, just like its April 1 ROG Ally reveal a couple of years ago, it seems that this teased Xbox console is legit.

Another thing we should note is that the much-anticipated Switch 2 is set to be announced at Nintendo Direct on April 2. This Asus reveal could therefore be an attempt to steal Nintendo’s thunder — and while it did not have much information, it likely caused a stir among PC gamers and handheld gaming enthusiasts. It still probably won’t sway hardcore Nintendo enthusiasts, though.

We’re not expecting a new Xbox console until 2027, but the arrival of an 'Xbox handheld' will certainly be most welcome. We just hope that this will run Xbox games natively, and not just be a Windows 11 device with an Xbox skin on top of it.",tomshardware

On Monday it began its expanded roll-out of features like Live Captions, Cocreator, Restyle Image, and Image Creator – so they will be available on modern AMD and Intel systems, as well as PCs packing Qualcomm Snapdragon X (SDX) series processors.

Live Captions will also translate from 27 languages into Simplified Chinese (Image credit: Microsoft)

One of the most welcome additions to Windows 11 for those embraced by the expanded Copilot+ feature compatibility is probably Live Captions. Microsoft says that this feature “offers real-time translations in English for audio and video content during virtual meetings, podcasts, or video playback.” This feature, which Microsoft claims can live translate from 40 languages to English, has been around a while for SDX PCs, and is “coming soon” for those with a Ryzen AI 300 or Ultra 200V PC.

Another new Copilot+ addition which Microsoft characterizes as an accessibility feature is rolling out to Qualcomm SDX machines soon. Voice Access delivers better descriptive and flexible language interaction with Windows. AMD and Intel system owners with NPUs will have to wait until “later this year” for this one, though.

Cocreator in Paint is now ready for modern AMD and Intel processor owners. Here, Microsoft’s AI can help you create imagery from prompts or analyzing and improving on your badly drawn scrawl.

With Copilot+ smarts introduced to Microsoft’s Photos app, Windows 11 users with the requisite AMD and Intel chips get two ‘AI’ features to play with. Restyle Image is an AI-driven photo-filter style feature which can make existing works look something like an oil painting, sketch, or so on. Image Creator does what it says from your simple, or complex, text prompts.

Microsoft says to make sure you switch on ‘Get the latest updates as soon as they’re available’ in your updates control panel. If you are eager to try some of the features outlined above, that unfortunately means opting to install the March non-security preview release. You must also ensure the host apps (Paint, Photos etc) are up-to-date via the Microsoft Store. Remember, the expanded feature rollout availability will also vary based on your location and language selection.

Considering x86 PCs with NPU-packing processors have been available for months, Microsoft has been rather tardy in breaking its most attractive Copilot+ features out from their Qualcomm-only rut.

https://tomshardware.com,GlobalFoundries mulls UMC takeover in effort dubbed 'Project Ultron',https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/globalfoundries-mulls-umc-takeover-in-effort-dubbed-project-ultron,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:36:37 GMT","GlobalFoundries is mulling a possible merger with Taiwanese semiconductor producer United Microelectronics Corp. to strengthen their shared role in making chips using mature and specialty process technologies, according to an assessment document reviewed by Tom's Hardware.

The document outlines plans for 'Project Ultron,' which is meant to create a powerhouse controlling a significant share of the global production of chips. However, the plan will likely face major financial, political, and regulatory challenges. Nikkei has also reported on the matter, citing that it has reviewed an assessment plan. UMC has denied involvement, saying it is not currently conducting a merger.

After ceasing to develop leading-edge process technologies in the late 2010s, GlobalFoundries and UMC focused on specialty and mature process technologies. Avoiding competition with TSMC, Intel, and Samsung Foundry enabled the companies to focus on profitability and growth.

The semiconductor market in general, and the foundry market in particular, have changed significantly in recent years, however. SMIC has become a much bigger competitor than it was seven or eight years ago, and China has invested tens of billions of dollars into fabs that use mature process technologies. By contrast, GlobalFoundries's revenue has declined since 2022, whereas UMC's revenue has stagnated in recent years after peaking in 2022.

Tim Breen, named GlobalFoundries's next chief executive in February, will take over in April and is considering acquiring UMC, one of GF's main rivals. Combining two major foundries would create a stronger competitor in the mature-node segment (e.g., 28nm and above), essential for automotive, industrial, and legacy applications.

The combined company is expected to control around 28% of the mainstream node foundry revenue, and a greater scale would enable better pricing power, operational efficiency, and stronger negotiating leverage with customers. The GF-UMC, if combined, will still be smaller than TSMC, which controls 44% of the mainstream node share.

There is a rationale for GlobalFoundries to buy its rival and for UMC to become a part of GF. The mature-node segment is increasingly threatened by low-cost Chinese fabs, and a combined GF-UMC entity could consolidate global capacity and better compete on cost, scale, and reliability. Also, UMC and GF have different but complementary customer sets, so a merger could enable cross-selling, better utilization of fabs, and more diversified revenue streams, reducing business risks.

Also, UMC is heavily concentrated in Taiwan, while GF operates fabs in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore, so a merger would spread geographic risk, reduce reliance on Taiwan, and appeal to customers and governments looking for supply chain resilience. Taiwan would still lead with 40% of capacity (UMC), followed by Singapore with 25% (shared by both), and smaller shares in China (11%), Germany (9%), the USA (9%), and Japan (6%). Growth is expected in the USA, Germany, and Singapore, while capacity in China and Taiwan is projected to decline.

Last but not least, GlobalFoundries – UMC will have the scale to develop new 'single-digit nanometer' process technologies, which will open doors to new applications and design wins for the combined company, according to the document. However, it remains to be seen whether it will invest in sub-10nm process technologies to compete against TSMC, Intel, and Samsung Foundry.

While the idea for GlobalFoundries to acquire UMC is an ambitious project that has a lot of rationale, it will be hard to accomplish. The market capitalization of GlobalFoundries is $20.41 billion, whereas the market capitalization of UMC is $16.86 billion. GF does not have the cash to acquire UMC now, so it will either have to take on debt, issue more shares, or ask its main investor, Mubadala, for cash.

However, even if funding is secured, regulatory barriers could prevent the transaction from happening. If GlobalFoundries were to take control after a deal, that outcome would likely be opposed by the Taiwanese government. Chinese approval could be hard to obtain too as the new entity will be a tough rival for Chinese mature nodes fabs. However, if the merged company commits to build additional capacity in China, this could change the mind of regulatory organizations in the People's Republic.",tomshardware
https://zdnet.com,The OnePlus 12 is still a powerhouse in 2025 - and it's on sale for a limited time,https://zdnet.com/article/the-oneplus-12-is-still-a-powerhouse-in-2025-and-its-on-sale-for-a-limited-time/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","ZDNET's key takeaways The OnePlus 12 typically sells for a starting price of $799.

It was the company's most complete handset in 2024, with the fastest charging speeds on the market (both wired and wireless), a flagship camera system, premium build quality, and reliable performance.

The lack of generative AI features is felt, but for many, that may not be a problem. View now at OnePlus View now at Amazon View now at Best Buy more buying choices

OnePlus is holding a new promotion for its old flagship phone. By entering the promo code ""SPRING25"" at checkout, you shave $150 off the OnePlus 12's price tag. Be aware that this deal only applies to the $900 model, which has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.

While last year's focus for smartphone makers was unquestionably on AI -- it was the mobile trend of the year -- the OnePlus 12 is unabashedly a phone first, AI companion second kind of device. Instead of prematurely jumping onto the AI bandwagon, promoting its phones with features that aren't readily available, the Shenzhen manufacturer prioritized aspects that mattered more, such as charging tech, battery life, and performance.

Also: Amazon's Spring Sale is over, but this Google Pixel 9 offer at Target is still my favorite spring phone deal live now

The result? A smartphone that excels at the things you actually want and need. I find it very difficult to recommend any other mobile device in 2025.

My fondness for the OnePlus 12 is part of a bigger story. The device is the most complete handset from a company notorious for settling in small but invaluable areas -- whether it's the omission of wireless charging, a better low-light camera, or an official IP rating. The OnePlus 12 has all three of those features and a very competitive price, especially in today's market. Prices start at $799 (sans deals).

While that price is a $100 jump from the older OnePlus 11, the difference in user experience is very noticeable, from the feel and polish of the marble-like Flowy Emerald finish to the way the device optimizes its RAM, of which it has plenty of (up to 16GB). The OnePlus 12 looks and feels better to me than the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro, for example. The device's edges are curved to make it sit smoothly in my hand, and I don't struggle to press any of the buttons.

Also: 12 Android phone settings you should change to dramatically increase battery life

Correction: I don't struggle to press any of the buttons except for the alert slider, which has now been moved to the upper left side of the phone. For something that requires a toggle instead of a press, physically switching from ""Ring"" to ""Vibrate"" to ""Silent"" feels more cumbersome than it should. Otherwise, I'm a fan of OnePlus' industrial design, which is a little more distinct now that both Samsung and Google have officially ditched the curved glass form factor.

The OnePlus 12 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which brings improved day-to-day performance and better efficiency of on-device AI applications. I've had no problem putting the phone through its paces, whether it's editing videos on Premiere Rush, playing demanding games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact, or multitasking with a PiP (Picture-in-Picture) video playing. While the marketed peak brightness of 4,500 nits puts even the Galaxy S24's 2,600 value to shame, I only found it to be slightly brighter when outdoors.

Here is the OnePlus 12 (left) next to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus (right). Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Aside from Google's stock AI features, such as Magic Compose and Photomoji, this model has no killer generative AI service, as I alluded to in the introduction. That's not a bad thing, especially if you don't factor generative AI into your lifestyle anyway. Having cycled between the OnePlus and Samsung's AI-heavy Galaxy S24 series, I haven't found myself missing the assisted features much.

Also: 5 tools I trust to keep my online conversations private and anonymous

That said, the latest Android 15 update for the OnePlus 12 introduces some familiar generative AI tools that put the device closer to its competitors, such as Circle to Search, AI Unblur, AI Assistant for Notes, and more. The new software version also brings Open Canvas to the phone, a multitasking feature that deploys floating windows for quicker navigation between apps.

The OnePlus 12 features a 50MP wide camera, a 64MP 3x periscope telephoto, and a 48MP ultra-wide. Kerry Wan/ZDNET

One area that I do wish OnePlus flexed its machine-learning muscles more is with the cameras -- specifically, the telephoto lens. While the Sony LYT-808-backed, 50MP main camera does a fantastic (and reliable) job of reproducing lighting and colors in a very natural tone, the telephoto lens falls short for me in two ways: distance and edge detection.

Also: This Anker power bank is on sale and it's my everyday carry - Here's why

Because the telephoto lens is capped to 3x optical zoom, shooting subjects that are further away tends to produce pictures that appear more washed out and lacking in detail. You can view some of my camera samples here.

For images captured with Hasselblad Portrait Mode, the phone can struggle to apply a bokeh effect behind people with fuzzy and springy hairstyles. In both cases, a visual engine that can help amplify or better detect subjects would be immensely helpful.

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Ultimately, one of the most compelling reasons to buy a OnePlus phone is its battery life and charging speed. For the former, the OnePlus fields a 5,400mAh battery, the biggest on a mainstream smartphone. I've comfortably gotten a good day and a half's worth of usage before needing to charge the device.

Also: I finally found the ultimate car charger for my iPhone - and it's on sale for $25

For the latter, the OnePlus 12 is the fastest in its class, both wired and wireless. The 80W charger that's included in the box has spoiled me, and the 50W wireless charging support -- which only works with OnePlus' first-party dock, to be clear -- outpaces the wired charging rate of competing flagship phones.

ZDNET's buying advice

At a starting price of $550, the OnePlus 12 is the best phone at its price point. It has the most well-rounded feature set ever, 5G support for every major carrier (Verizon included), the fastest charging on the market, and an industrial design that screams premium. It's also a great phone for users who aren't fully bought into the AI craze.

The trade-offs are more of a blur this time around, but from my months of usage, I'd still list the subpar telephoto lens and IP65 rating -- which just misses the mark for the industry standard for water and dust resistance -- as the most notable reasons to think twice about the device. If you can shoulder the compromises, which are more subtle than ever, then I have no problem recommending the latest phone from OnePlus, especially at its Black Friday price.

When will this deal expire? As per OnePlus, this deal will end on April 13, 2025.

They prevent phishing, the disclosure of confidential data and code execution outside the app sandbox.

Apple has updated its iOS and iPados mobile operating systems to version 18.4. The update contains patches for 62 security gaps. According to Apple's security warning, unauthorized persons can indulge in malicious code.

This applies to a weak point in the component audio. Here an specially designed audio file can trigger an undesirable code version. Also particularly serious should also be classified in the component calendar and power services as well as the library libxPC. As a result, apps could possibly leave their sandbox.

https://zdnet.com,Phone tracking: valuable and at the same time risky,https://www.zdnet.de/88421299/phone-tracking-wertvoll-und-zugleich-riskant/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:57:09 GMT","With a few tricks, the phone tracking can be limited to a minimum.

App permissions

The authorizations can be checked and changed via the control control of the mobile device. For example, iPhone users can click on the ""Data Protection & Security"" tab and then go to the location services. The location settings of the individual apps are stored here. It is best to configure the apps so that they have to ask first before you can use a location or that the location may only be used while the app is open. It is a little different with Android phones. As a rule, however, the location symbol can be typed in the settings and switched on or off for all or individual apps. The options are similar to iOS at the various manufacturers.

iPhone data protection

Apple also has further options to reduce tracking by third -party providers. In the ""Data Protection & Security"" setting, there is a switch on the ""Tracking"" tab that can be used to allow or reject the request for tracking. If this option is deactivated, new app requests are automatically rejected.

Personalized advertising

Data protection experts recommend blocking the internal ad identification of Google or Apple devices. This can be done on the iPhone under the data protection setting. Here you scroll for Apple Advertising and deactivated personalized advertising. On newer Android smartphones you also go to the data protection settings and then to advertisements where you should delete the advertising ID.

Precise location

Regardless of whether it is an Android or Apple device, both have the possibility to be able to precisely determine the location of the device. This works via the signals and data integrated sensors such as the barometer or accelerometer. This means that the mobile device can precisely determine the location-even if, for example, there is no GPS signal within a building. If you don't want an app to access this information, you should only release the general location information. To do this, the setting ""location accuracy"" is deactivated on Android smartphones and on the iPhone you switch on or off this feature for each individual app.

Google account

In addition to the app permissions, the authorizations for the Google account should also be checked. On the Google account you go to the section ""Data & Data Protection"", where the controls are located for the course of the location. In the last changes, the course will be deleted after three months - however, this can be changed individually in the default settings.

Browser

Popular smartphone browsers such as Safari or Chrome can also reveal the location of a mobile phone. This can be avoided by using other browsers such as Duckduckgo, Firefox Focus or Ecosia. In the event that you have to access the location via an IP address, these data protection-oriented browsers will request a location approval and do not fall back on it.

Find my device

Telefone or tablets can be searched for with the functions ""Find My"" by Apple or ""Find My Device"" from Google. This function can also be deactivated if necessary, if necessary, if there is a suspicion that someone has accessed their own Apple or Google account.",zdnet

Microsoft testet den neuen Blue Screen of Death derzeit für Windows 11 im Insider-Programm.

Microsoft hat eine Funktion seines Betriebssystems überarbeitet, die Anwender in der Regel nicht nutzen möchten: den Blue Screen of Death. Die Anzeige, die bei Abstürzen beziehungsweise unerwarteten Neustarts von Windows präsentiert wird, soll vor allem einfacher und übersichtlicher werden.

Die Änderungen stehen derzeit Teilnehmern des Windows-Insider-Programms für Windows 11 zur Verfügung. Microsoft zufolge werden Nutzer künftig die gleichen Informationen sehen wie bisher, aber in einem neuen Design – das zudem auf die namensgebende blaue Farbe verzichtet.

„Wir stellen eine neue, schlankere Benutzeroberfläche für unerwartete Neustarts vor, die besser mit den Designprinzipien von Windows 11 übereinstimmt und unser Ziel unterstützt, die Benutzer so schnell wie möglich wieder produktiv zu machen“, so Microsoft in einer Ankündigung zum neuesten Windows 11 Insider-Build.

Ein Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) wird als Reaktion auf einen schwerwiegenden Systemfehler oder -absturz ausgelöst, der häufig auf einen Hardware- oder Treiberkonflikt zurückzuführen ist. Windows kann sich von dieser Art von Fehler nicht erholen, so dass ein Computer neu gestartet werden muss, um sich selbst zu bereinigen. Der typische BSOD teilt Nutzern mit, dass auf ihrem PC ein Problem aufgetreten ist, identifiziert oft die Quelle des Konflikts und bietet einen QR-Code mit Details zur Problembehandlung.

Das neue Design verzichtet laut Windows Latest auf den QR-Code und ein Smiley mit stirnrunzelndem Gesicht. Zudem soll der Hintergrund nun schwarz sein, wie während der Installation von Windows-Updates. In der Vorschau für Windows-Insider ist der Hintergrund indes grün. Es bleibt also abzuwarten, für welche Farbe sich Microsoft entscheidet, sobald die Funktion für die Allgemeinheit ausgerollt wird.",zdnet

https://zdnet.com,"Investment in Generated AI by Companies, with more investments in 2025 - Gartner forecast",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231203/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 09:32:00 GMT","As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly essential for business operations and consumer products, businesses are expected to spend significantly on artificial AI. Gartner's latest forecasts show that this high-profile AI sector spending totaled $644 billion worldwide in 2025, an increase of 76.4% compared to 2024.

However, the current generation AI is still in its early stages and suffers from the problems of many defects and errors. A classic example is that AI tends to cause halcinations and generate inaccurate, inappropriate, or misleading answers. As a result, many chief information officers and technology executives are disappointed by the high frequency of AI making mistakes.

Still, the future prospects of generating AI means AI providers and other companies continue to invest huge amounts in the technology. The aim is to address current weaknesses through enhancing and improving the scale, performance and reliability of AI models.

Due to the current limitations of generator AI, 2025 will result in a rigorous scrutiny of corporate projects, said John-David Lovelock, Vice President of Distinguished at Gartner. So where do businesses put their time, effort and money?

""As 2024 ambitious internal projects will be rigorously vetted in 2025, as CIOs will choose commercial off-the-shelf solutions for feasibility and high business value,"" he said, ""Even as models continue to improve, CIOs will be able to reduce proof of concept (PoC) and in-house development efforts, and instead focus on the capabilities of the generated AI provided by existing software providers.""

Approximately 80% of the expected increase in AI-related spending will be spent exclusively on incorporating AI into existing hardware such as servers, PCs and smartphones. However, businesses' spending on AI software and AI services should also skyrocket. Looking at Gartner's forecasts, companies are expected to spend $27.8 billion on services, $37.2 billion on software, $180.6 billion on servers, and $398.3 billion on devices. Both have been a significant increase compared to 2024.

Gartner also mentions the further distant future, saying manufacturers will be able to incorporate AI capabilities into more and more devices. Whether or not consumers want such a feature.

""Whether or not the market will get back on track will depend heavily on the increasing adoption of AI-enabled devices, and by 2028, AI-enabled devices will likely be able to make almost all of the consumer device market,"" Lovelock said, noting that ""but consumers aren't looking for these features. If manufacturers incorporate AI as a standard feature for consumer devices, consumers should be forced to purchase such devices.""",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Should I be a science and engineering background in order to become an engineer?,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230801/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:00:00 GMT","I think many people have taken a step as new employees as they enter the new year as April begins. I think most readers of this series are accepting new employees. In any case, I told you last time that if you can use new encounters as a species of serendipity, you won't have to worry about your job being taken away by AI. I myself have been working on a new job since April in search of serendipity. I look forward to all sorts of coincidences.

Now, what should new employees who have begun their careers as engineers or students aiming for a career as engineers should learn is a profound topic. To put it more straightforwardly, I would like to think about the topic of ""Do engineers have to graduate from the Faculty of Science and Technology?""

Over 90% of the engineers I have worked with have graduated from the university's Faculty of Science and Technology. It is in particular true that many people graduated from departments in electrical, electronic, information and communications. However, even in science and engineering, there are many cases where people majored in mechanical engineering, physics, mathematics, etc., while many people from so-called liberal arts faculties such as economics, law, and literature have been active as engineers.

""Dialect"" too

Telecommunications carrier engineers often do not engage in tasks like device development or program coding. Of course, there is no way telecommunications carrier engineers are involved in device development or coding. However, it is safe to say that telecommunications companies often decide specifications, order them from manufacturers or system integrators, and have them develop and manufacture them.

In practice, we purchase commercially available communication devices and servers, connect them to media such as optical fiber, and provide services with appropriate settings. Therefore, it is important to obtain and organize information on what kind of equipment is being developed, manufactured and sold by various manufacturers, and compare and consider it.

Furthermore, for devices that have been chosen to adopt, it is necessary to memorize many commands*1 and be able to quickly and accurately set up the configuration.

*1: Most of the current devices can be set using the Graphical User Interface (GUI), but many engineers often use the Command Line Interface (CLI).

It is also important to decide and coordinate what protocols to use when connecting with other telecommunications carriers and users. Therefore, we are committed to understanding the protocol and how to adjust which parameters and how to provide the best network service.

Selecting equipment, connecting to networks such as optical fibers, introducing configurations, and understanding and using protocols - if you write this, once you set it optimally, you may think that the machine will move on its own.

However, the device may be hardware malfunctioning, and software may contain bugs. Also, optical fiber buried underground can be cut off by road construction, and protocols can be dialects and versions, so it is usually not easy*2.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"Inns where IT specialists are not available, DX in the tourism industry - Learn about using the web from Fukushima City",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230885/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:00:00 GMT","地域活性化が叫ばれて久しいが、その軸の一つとなるのがシステム全般のデジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）だ。福島市の観光地域づくりを推進している法人（DMO）福島市観光コンベンション協会（福島市）も、DXに取り組みながら観光ウェブメディア「福島市観光ノート」などを展開しているが、その実情はどうなっているのだろうか。本稿では、宿泊施設向けITソリューションを展開するtripla（トリプラ）の代表取締役CEOの高橋和久が、地方都市の観光業におけるDXについて解説する。

triplaではホテル予約エンジンやAIチャットボットなどを提供しており、企業が抱えるさまざまな課題解決をサポートしている。当社がサポートしている福島市観光コンベンション協会の場合、運営しているメディア福島市観光ノートのアクセス数をアップさせられても、観光スポットや宿泊施設の紹介コンテンツと化し、宿泊予約に関しては、オンライン旅行代理店（OTA）頼みになり、シームレスな予約導線を確保できていなかったことが課題となっていた。



「福島市観光ノート」 「福島市観光ノート」

福島市観光コンベンション協会 データサイエンティスト コンテンツマーケターの三宅晃司氏は「民間のOTAは、集客効果はあるものの、どうしても手数料がかさむ。また継続的に利用することで地域外にお金が流れてしまう。そこで自社で予約システムを確立し、地域にお金を再還元する流れを作ることにつながっていく」と明かしているが、実はほかにも課題があった。

同協会では福島市の宿泊施設の利用者に対するアンケートやふるさと納税制度の利用者のデータを保有しており、顧客情報やマーケティング材料となる膨大なデータを蓄積していたものの、有効活用ができていなかったという。

そもそも福島市観光コンベンション協会は、福島市観光ノートの運用のほか、福島市へのふるさと納税の事務局全般や、福島市内の宿泊施設の利用者に対するアンケートを実施している。いうなれば、宿泊施設の利用者のみならず、ふるさと納税制度の利用者など福島市に興味関心がある層のデータを持ち、「デスティネーション（旅行の目的地）マーケティング」に有効活用できる材料を持ち合わせている状態だった。

そのため、福島市観光コンベンション協会では、福島市観光ノートの発信力や、保有する顧客データを活用し、福島市観光ノート上で宿泊予約であったり、一人ひとりに応じたレコメンドを掲出したりできる、DMO版のOTAの構築を目指した。

データ取得からOTA事業までを担うDMOとは

同協会がこれらのデータを所持しているのは、DMOであるからだ。DMOは観光庁から情報や人材、財源などさまざまな支援を受けられ、OTA機能も観光庁の調査事業に協力するという意味合いから保持している。そうした取り組みについて、三宅氏は次のように説明した。

「今回のDMO版OTA事業は、国と福島市がやりたいと思っていたマーケティング強化の方向性が合致して実現に至った。DMO版OTAをはじめとした事業の根底には、観光産業のDX推進に関わるマーケティング強化があって、例えば観光庁が課題を提示して、どう解決していくかされわれがアイデアを出すケースもある」

なお、今回活用した観光庁の調査事業において重視する項目の一つに「汎用（はんよう）性」があったというが、三宅氏は「我々がトリプラとともに作り上げたDMO版OTAが、ほかのDMOでも使えるような汎用性があることがポイントになると考えた。それがやがて業界全体、そして日本のためになっていく。それこそが国が求める汎用性なのではないか」と解釈したという。

今後はOTAなどで集めたデータを基に、「福島が好きな人」に対して的確にアプローチしていく予定だという。クーポンの配布や観光に関するおすすめ情報の提供のほか、宿泊施設を予約する時に、通常予約に加えてふるさと納税制度を活用する選択肢も設け、宿泊代金の一部をふるさと納税制度でまかなうような形も検討中で、観光業の活性化と地域貢献の両立を目指している。

今回のDMO版OTAの構築に当たり、同協会が地域の宿泊施設とコミュニケーションをとる中で、大きく分けて3つのマーケティング傾向があると感じたそうだ。

「1つ目は、ある程度の規模がある大きな旅館などにはマーケティング担当者がいて、担当者が自分でシステムの管理や設定ができるレベルのITリテラシーを持っているため、比較的スムーズにマーケティング戦略やDXを進められているケース。2つ目は、代表者がマーケティングも担当していて、ほかの業務が忙しいためにマーケティングにまで手が回らず、繁忙期または閑散期でも適切な値段設定ができていないため、顧客へのアプローチなども後回しになっているケース。3つ目はマーケティングに対する知識が全くないという理由から、すべて外注しているケース。この場合はプロに任せられるものの、手数料がかさんでしまいがちで、自社でやろうと考えてもスイッチングコストがかかったり、契約期間の縛りがあったりして、やめにくいというデメリットがある」

同協会では特に2つ目、3つ目のケースに対して、宿泊施設側にDX推進のためのシステム導入などもサポートしており、福島市観光ノートをOTAとして活用することを提案している。

同メディアを通して予約を受けることによって予約情報が福島市のデータとして蓄積され、さらに宿泊施設はこれまで他社のOTAに支払っていた費用が抑えられ、余った費用を広告費などに充てられ、集客につなげられる。地域と宿泊施設の双方にとっての好循環となっていくだろう。

「お客さまを呼んでくれる」ではだめ、宿泊施設に求められる意識改革

とはいえその道のりは簡単ではない。宿泊施設が、同協会のような観光協会に対してネガティブなイメージを持っていたり、そもそも外部からのアドバイスに抵抗を感じたりする場合もある。

福島市のみならず、その地方ならではの商慣習から抜け出すことは難しく、新しいものを取り入れるのが難しいという例は珍しくないと、三宅氏は明かす。

「自分たちで集客するよりも、OTAや旅行会社がお客さまを呼んでくれるという認識を持っている宿泊施設はいまだに存在する。その場合、顧客ターゲットやペルソナがそもそも定まっておらず、カスタマージャーニーマップもまとまっていないため、ゆえに客層に合わせたマーケティングもできない。ただ単にお客さまが宿泊して終わりではなく、宿泊施設として今後どうなっていきたいか、そのためにどんな施策が必要なのかを自分たちで考えなければならないという意識を持つことで、DXの必要性やマーケティング戦略の重要性を実感することにも結びついていくかもしれない」

なお、福島市観光ノートは年間400万PVという実績があり、広告プラットフォームとしての基盤は十分。OTAとしての機能のほか、観光にまつわる情報、ふるさと納税制度の返礼品といった地域の名産品にかかわる情報などを網羅的に発信することにより、地域の観光業、ひいては地域全体を盛り上げることになっていくだろう。

同協会では、これからも福島市との連携により力を入れ、市が行うキャンペーンやイベントとの連動企画や、キャンペーンやイベント参加者のデータを宿泊施設のマーケティングに生かすことなども考えているという。地域経済の持続的な発展のキーワードとなっている「官民連携」と「DX」だが、同協会が旅行業界におけるモデルケースを提示してくれる日が待ち遠しい。",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,The future of B2B marketing and the evolution of ABM with intent AI,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230595/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:00:00 GMT","ABM history is the beginning of precision targeting

Account-based marketing (ABM) emerged in the 1990s as a strategy for business (B2B) marketing with corporate customers. Unlike traditional mass marketing, ABM was initially established as an approach to developing individual marketing initiatives, focusing on specific companies (accounts), and attracted attention as a method that allows for high return on investment (ROI) by sending customized messages to target accounts.

This marketing method is known as ""precision targeting"" (hyperprecision targeting), and has begun the method of delivering the most suitable advertising and promotions to the target audience. Precision targeting improves advertising click-through rates and conversion rates, contributes to customer re-engagement, increases engagement and lifetime value, and enables marketing to be more efficient.

As the 2000s began, ABM became even more refined with the evolution of customer relationship management (CRM) systems and marketing automation (MA) tools. Companies will be able to integrate customer data and adopt a more personalized approach.

However, in reality, despite its ideal, a packaged CRM requires the support of a large consultant, or it is not easy to meet the needs of individual companies due to packaging constraints, and sometimes the development of scratch costs can be incurred, resulting in many manual processes, making it extremely difficult to deploy large scale.

The transition and challenges to data-driven marketing

Currently, ABM is becoming more advanced with advances in digital technology. With the use of AI and big data analytics, businesses can understand intent data that indicates potential customers' purchasing intentions and take a more precise approach. On the other hand, there are several challenges when looking ahead to ABM.",zdnet

https://zdnet.com,"ALSOK and NTT Com to streamline avatar support at Osaka and Kansai Expo -- Utilizing LLM ""tsuzumi""",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231227/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:40:00 GMT","At the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo, Integrated Security Security (ALSOK) and NTT Communications (NTT Com) will conduct a demonstration experiment using NTT Com's large-scale language model (LLM) ""tsuzumi,"" in order to improve the accuracy of attendance using avatars and improve operational efficiency. By combining avatars and LLM, we aim to streamline security operations and reduce the number of required personnel. The two companies announced this on April 1st.

According to both companies, in recent years, the security industry, like most industries, has become a serious labor shortage. Therefore, there is a need to utilize avatars and AI to improve business efficiency. However, the information handled in security services is much of the information that cannot be leaked to the outside world from the perspective of security and privacy, and there are restrictions on using cloud services. Additionally, there was a challenge in dealing with highly specialized security services, which involves a huge cost to learn and adjust AI.

Therefore, by utilizing tsuzumi, an industry-specific and lightweight LLM that can be used in a closed environment, we aim to operate an avatar that combines security and efficiency. By operating in a closed environment provided by NTT Com, visitors can safely handle information that is highly privacy and confidential.

Specifically, three avatars will be installed at the pavilion ""The Future of Life"" at the Osaka-Kansai Expo, to respond to inquiries from visitors and provide information on areas off-limits. If you have difficult questions with an avatar, switch to an ALSOK operator. The avatar is AVITA's ""AVACOM.""

In addition, by summarizing the conversations between visitors and avatars in tsuzumi, it is possible to streamline the analysis of inquiry trends and report creation. We aim to improve the efficiency of the overall guidance work by adjusting the avatar based on the analysis results and increasing the number of cases where avatars can be handled with only avatars.

The implementation period is from April 1st to October 13th. ALSOK will be responsible for central management, avatar management, and manned operators, while NTT Com will build a summary system and provide reports using tsuzumi.

If the two companies can confirm the effectiveness of this initiative, they plan to apply tsuzumi to various fields of security work and promote business efficiency for the entire security industry.",zdnet

LINE WORKS, a business communication tool developed by LINE WORKS, was used by 520,000 companies and approximately 5.2 million users as of January 2025. In April 2023, the company integrated the AI ​​business of LINE (now LINE Yahoo) and has also launched multiple products that utilize AI. Due to this expansion of business and increased personnel, the company moved its head office to Shibuya Sakura Stage in November 2024.

https://zdnet.com,Local account creation methods are unavailable in Windows 11 -- another workaround remains,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231204/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:22:00 GMT","Microsoft has announced that it will remove the script ""bypassnro.cmd"" in its Insider build of Windows 11. This was one way to sign in without a Microsoft account.

Here's how I explained in my previous article: First, before the account screen appears in the initial setup, press ""Shift"" + ""F10"" to open the command prompt. Next, enter ""oobe\bypassnro"" at the command prompt. This will restart your PC and return to the Windows 11 setup screen. Restart work where you left off and make sure your internet connection is disconnected. This will prompt you to enter a name to create a local account on the account screen.

Currently, this workaround is only removed in Insider builds, but will soon be applicable to the Windows 11 production version as well. Microsoft emphasized this as a positive approach, claiming it would ""improve Windows 11 security and user experience."" It also states that the change will allow ""all users with internet connections and Microsoft accounts to complete the setup.""

I wonder if I'll have no choice other than choosing a Microsoft account when installing or updating Windows? There are still several workarounds left.

According to Windows Central, a user suggests the following steps: First, during setup, press ""Shift"" + ""F10"" to open the command prompt. Next, enter ""start ms-cxh:localonly"" at the command prompt. You will then see a Windows 10 style interface that lets you create a username and password for your local account.

Windows Central has confirmed that this workaround is effective, but Microsoft may block this method in the future.

Another option is to set up Windows 11 with a Microsoft account and then switch to a local account later. Go to Settings > Accounts > User Information, click Switch to Sign in with a Local Account and follow the instructions.

Additionally, there is a way to use the free third-party tool, Rufus. Rufus can remove Microsoft account requirements when installing Windows from an ISO image file and automatically create a local account with a specific username.

Exchanges between Microsoft and local accounts have been going on for years, and there has been a never-ending battle in which someone will find a new workaround and the company will ban it if Microsoft removes it.

So why does the company strongly recommend using a Microsoft account instead of a local account? This is because it is convenient for Windows users. The claim is that it can use the same authentication information on multiple products, access services such as ""OneDrive,"" and sync settings between different PCs.

However, Microsoft accounts have privacy and security concerns. Microsoft is using this account to monitor users' activities and market their products and services. That's why they're trying to get them to use a Microsoft account instead of a local account.

In the long run, there should be no fights between Microsoft and its customers. Local accounts are a valid option and should be left to the user to decide. However, the company always prioritizes its profits.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Microsoft reviews blue screen display for Windows 11--Insider build,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231200/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 08:28:00 GMT","It's not a good thing to see a Blue Screen (BSOD) error on Windows. But Microsoft is at least trying to make the screen look better.

The changes currently being deployed for Windows 11 Insiders make the BSOD error screen simpler and more refined. The same technical information as before is displayed, but the design has been completely redesigned.

In an announcement regarding the latest Windows 11 Insider build, the company states: ""We're previewing a new, simpler UI for unexpected reboots. It follows Windows 11 design principles and aims to help users get back to work quickly.""

BSOD errors are caused by fatal system errors or crashes, often due to hardware or driver conflicts. Windows cannot recover from this error, so the computer restarts to fix the problem. A typical BSOD error will tell your PC that there is a problem and present two-dimensional code that identifies the cause of the conflict and shows you how to troubleshoot the problem. Windows's grumpy faces are also displayed.

The new designs have abolished the traditional blue screen, a grumpy look and two-dimensional code. According to Windows Latest analysis, the new screen is based on the black color that is seen when updating Windows. The screen previewed by Windows Insider is green. I'll be looking forward to seeing which colour will be adopted in the end.

Recently, Microsoft has been focusing on making various screens look simpler and more unified. The company has also reviewed the sign-in screen completely based on the ""Fluent Design System"" to create a more streamlined and unified look.

Most of the design changes have been deployed to Windows Insiders using Windows 11 24H2 on the Beta, Dev and Canary channels. Microsoft has not stated when these changes will be applied to the Windows 11 production version. Some may be gradually rolled out over several months, but it may not be applicable until the official release of Windows 11 25H2 in the second half of 2025.",zdnet

Gemini 2.5 is a thinking model that allows you to infer through thought before responding, following the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model that appeared in December.

Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) is ""Humanity's Last Exam"" (HLE), surpassing OpenAI's ""OpenAI o3-mini"" and Anthropic's ""Claude 3.7 Sonnet."" HLE is a benchmark test recently developed to address ""benchmark saturation,"" which makes industry testing problems too easy for fast-evolving models.

https://zdnet.com,Microsoft realizes a passwordless world ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231182/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:00:00 GMT","Microsoft is completely reviewing its sign-in screen to make it easier to authenticate your account using passwordless methods, including passkeys. Robin Goldstein, partner director of product management for the cloud identity service Microsoft Identity, explained in a blog post dated March 27th, that the new sign-in process will be displayed on services such as Outlook, Xbox, Windows, and Microsoft 365.

The new screen will start to appear on Xbox in March and will be rolled out sequentially until the end of April. At that point, over 3 billion Microsoft users around the world will see improved processes when logging in to Windows on PCs and Microsoft services on the web.

Streamline UX in Authentication

One of the main objectives of the new process is to make passwordless options like passkey, face recognition, and fingerprint authentication easy to use. The current sign-in screen uses a password as the default login method. Considering the transition to a more simple and secure authentication format, it was necessary to change.

""By streamlining the UX (user experience) design for authentication, we were able to rethink the default sign-in experience and place even more emphasis on ease of use and safety,"" Goldstein said. ""In recent years, we've made several enhancements, including the ability to completely remove passwords from accounts and the ability to sign in using a passkey instead of a password. Our new UX has been optimized for passwordless passkey preferences.""

A new experience begins with the sign-up process. If you sign up for Microsoft services with an existing email address, you will not be asked to create a password. Instead, the one-time security code required to obtain access rights will be sent by email. Once you log in, you will be asked to create a passkey. Once a passkey is created, it becomes the default sign-in option whenever possible.

""Subscribe a user's email address to a new Microsoft account so you can start from a recoverable state and no need to create a new Microsoft password. There is a risk that your password could be forgotten or guessed by an attacker,"" Goldstein explained.

""All you need is to authenticate your email with one-time code. This will be the default credentials for your new account and you can start without a password. In addition, you can now link your account with an email address in case you want to restore your account or start on a new device.""

Microsoft is also revamping the flow of the sign-in screen. Depending on your current login method, multiple screens may be displayed, each of which may offer different options. This can make the entire UX more complicated and complicated. The new process is expected to make the overall flow smoother by reconfiguring the screen in a more intuitive way and simplifying each screen.

The Aesthetics of Fluent Design System

Next, we will introduce the appearance and operational feel of the new sign-in screen. Microsoft has redesigned the sign-in screen with its design concept, ""Fluent Design System,"" to achieve an orderly, unified look. The screen is placed more centrally so that users can concentrate without being distracted. Plus, it is displayed properly on any device, from smartphones to desktop monitors.

One of the features that was often requested by user feedback was support for dark mode. Users can select the Light/Dark mode according to their preference. The selected mode will be automatically enabled each time you sign in.

When I tried out a new sign-in screen on Xbox, the login experience was improved. I usually use an authentication app to authenticate my Microsoft account. In addition to enhancing this approach, the new experience also offers other passwordless authentication methods.

How to try a new process now

The new screen will first be adopted in web/mobile applications. Support for Windows and Windows applications follows. To see how the new process feels, try it on the Xbox website. Otherwise, you can check the overall operation by waiting until the end of April.",zdnet
