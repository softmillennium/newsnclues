                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABM history is the beginning of precision targeting

Account-based marketing (ABM) emerged in the 1990s as a strategy for business (B2B) marketing with corporate customers. Unlike traditional mass marketing, ABM was initially established as an approach to developing individual marketing initiatives, focusing on specific companies (accounts), and attracted attention as a method that allows for high return on investment (ROI) by sending customized messages to target accounts.

This marketing method is known as "precision targeting" (hyperprecision targeting), and has begun the method of delivering the most suitable advertising and promotions to the target audience. Precision targeting improves advertising click-through rates and conversion rates, contributes to customer re-engagement, increases engagement and lifetime value, and enables marketing to be more efficient.

As the 2000s began, ABM became even more refined with the evolution of customer relationship management (CRM) systems and marketing automation (MA) tools. Companies will be able to integrate customer data and adopt a more personalized approach.

However, in reality, despite its ideal, a packaged CRM requires the support of a large consultant, or it is not easy to meet the needs of individual companies due to packaging constraints, and sometimes the development of scratch costs can be incurred, resulting in many manual processes, making it extremely difficult to deploy large scale.

The transition and challenges to data-driven marketing

Currently, ABM is becoming more advanced with advances in digital technology. With the use of AI and big data analytics, businesses can understand intent data that indicates potential customers' purchasing intentions and take a more precise approach. On the other hand, there are several challenges when looking ahead to ABM.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>地域活性化が叫ばれて久しいが、その軸の一つとなるのがシステム全般のデジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）だ。福島市の観光地域づくりを推進している法人（DMO）福島市観光コンベンション協会（福島市）も、DXに取り組みながら観光ウェブメディア「福島市観光ノート」などを展開しているが、その実情はどうなっているのだろうか。本稿では、宿泊施設向けITソリューションを展開するtripla（トリプラ）の代表取締役CEOの高橋和久が、地方都市の観光業におけるDXについて解説する。

triplaではホテル予約エンジンやAIチャットボットなどを提供しており、企業が抱えるさまざまな課題解決をサポートしている。当社がサポートしている福島市観光コンベンション協会の場合、運営しているメディア福島市観光ノートのアクセス数をアップさせられても、観光スポットや宿泊施設の紹介コンテンツと化し、宿泊予約に関しては、オンライン旅行代理店（OTA）頼みになり、シームレスな予約導線を確保できていなかったことが課題となっていた。



「福島市観光ノート」 「福島市観光ノート」

福島市観光コンベンション協会 データサイエンティスト コンテンツマーケターの三宅晃司氏は「民間のOTAは、集客効果はあるものの、どうしても手数料がかさむ。また継続的に利用することで地域外にお金が流れてしまう。そこで自社で予約システムを確立し、地域にお金を再還元する流れを作ることにつながっていく」と明かしているが、実はほかにも課題があった。

同協会では福島市の宿泊施設の利用者に対するアンケートやふるさと納税制度の利用者のデータを保有しており、顧客情報やマーケティング材料となる膨大なデータを蓄積していたものの、有効活用ができていなかったという。

そもそも福島市観光コンベンション協会は、福島市観光ノートの運用のほか、福島市へのふるさと納税の事務局全般や、福島市内の宿泊施設の利用者に対するアンケートを実施している。いうなれば、宿泊施設の利用者のみならず、ふるさと納税制度の利用者など福島市に興味関心がある層のデータを持ち、「デスティネーション（旅行の目的地）マーケティング」に有効活用できる材料を持ち合わせている状態だった。

そのため、福島市観光コンベンション協会では、福島市観光ノートの発信力や、保有する顧客データを活用し、福島市観光ノート上で宿泊予約であったり、一人ひとりに応じたレコメンドを掲出したりできる、DMO版のOTAの構築を目指した。

データ取得からOTA事業までを担うDMOとは

同協会がこれらのデータを所持しているのは、DMOであるからだ。DMOは観光庁から情報や人材、財源などさまざまな支援を受けられ、OTA機能も観光庁の調査事業に協力するという意味合いから保持している。そうした取り組みについて、三宅氏は次のように説明した。

「今回のDMO版OTA事業は、国と福島市がやりたいと思っていたマーケティング強化の方向性が合致して実現に至った。DMO版OTAをはじめとした事業の根底には、観光産業のDX推進に関わるマーケティング強化があって、例えば観光庁が課題を提示して、どう解決していくかされわれがアイデアを出すケースもある」

なお、今回活用した観光庁の調査事業において重視する項目の一つに「汎用（はんよう）性」があったというが、三宅氏は「我々がトリプラとともに作り上げたDMO版OTAが、ほかのDMOでも使えるような汎用性があることがポイントになると考えた。それがやがて業界全体、そして日本のためになっていく。それこそが国が求める汎用性なのではないか」と解釈したという。

今後はOTAなどで集めたデータを基に、「福島が好きな人」に対して的確にアプローチしていく予定だという。クーポンの配布や観光に関するおすすめ情報の提供のほか、宿泊施設を予約する時に、通常予約に加えてふるさと納税制度を活用する選択肢も設け、宿泊代金の一部をふるさと納税制度でまかなうような形も検討中で、観光業の活性化と地域貢献の両立を目指している。

今回のDMO版OTAの構築に当たり、同協会が地域の宿泊施設とコミュニケーションをとる中で、大きく分けて3つのマーケティング傾向があると感じたそうだ。

「1つ目は、ある程度の規模がある大きな旅館などにはマーケティング担当者がいて、担当者が自分でシステムの管理や設定ができるレベルのITリテラシーを持っているため、比較的スムーズにマーケティング戦略やDXを進められているケース。2つ目は、代表者がマーケティングも担当していて、ほかの業務が忙しいためにマーケティングにまで手が回らず、繁忙期または閑散期でも適切な値段設定ができていないため、顧客へのアプローチなども後回しになっているケース。3つ目はマーケティングに対する知識が全くないという理由から、すべて外注しているケース。この場合はプロに任せられるものの、手数料がかさんでしまいがちで、自社でやろうと考えてもスイッチングコストがかかったり、契約期間の縛りがあったりして、やめにくいというデメリットがある」

同協会では特に2つ目、3つ目のケースに対して、宿泊施設側にDX推進のためのシステム導入などもサポートしており、福島市観光ノートをOTAとして活用することを提案している。

同メディアを通して予約を受けることによって予約情報が福島市のデータとして蓄積され、さらに宿泊施設はこれまで他社のOTAに支払っていた費用が抑えられ、余った費用を広告費などに充てられ、集客につなげられる。地域と宿泊施設の双方にとっての好循環となっていくだろう。

「お客さまを呼んでくれる」ではだめ、宿泊施設に求められる意識改革

とはいえその道のりは簡単ではない。宿泊施設が、同協会のような観光協会に対してネガティブなイメージを持っていたり、そもそも外部からのアドバイスに抵抗を感じたりする場合もある。

福島市のみならず、その地方ならではの商慣習から抜け出すことは難しく、新しいものを取り入れるのが難しいという例は珍しくないと、三宅氏は明かす。

「自分たちで集客するよりも、OTAや旅行会社がお客さまを呼んでくれるという認識を持っている宿泊施設はいまだに存在する。その場合、顧客ターゲットやペルソナがそもそも定まっておらず、カスタマージャーニーマップもまとまっていないため、ゆえに客層に合わせたマーケティングもできない。ただ単にお客さまが宿泊して終わりではなく、宿泊施設として今後どうなっていきたいか、そのためにどんな施策が必要なのかを自分たちで考えなければならないという意識を持つことで、DXの必要性やマーケティング戦略の重要性を実感することにも結びついていくかもしれない」

なお、福島市観光ノートは年間400万PVという実績があり、広告プラットフォームとしての基盤は十分。OTAとしての機能のほか、観光にまつわる情報、ふるさと納税制度の返礼品といった地域の名産品にかかわる情報などを網羅的に発信することにより、地域の観光業、ひいては地域全体を盛り上げることになっていくだろう。

同協会では、これからも福島市との連携により力を入れ、市が行うキャンペーンやイベントとの連動企画や、キャンペーンやイベント参加者のデータを宿泊施設のマーケティングに生かすことなども考えているという。地域経済の持続的な発展のキーワードとなっている「官民連携」と「DX」だが、同協会が旅行業界におけるモデルケースを提示してくれる日が待ち遠しい。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Arkansas takes a hatchet to adults’ and minors’ protected speech alike though the Constitution demands it use a scalpel,” the US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas wrote in an opinion issued Monday. Lawmakers across the United States and abroad have sought to protect minors against the potential long-term harms posed by social media, and smartphone access writ large. Meta was in favor of this law because it put the onus on other companies to verify users; it was opposed to Arkansas’ law. States and school districts across the country have also been implementing laws that prohibit students from accessing their phones during the school day to eliminate distractions and potentially combat bullying. While social media has been linked to increased mental health risks in adolescents, many teens have reported benefits to using the services, such as finding like-minded communities where they feel belonging. Moreover, critics of age-verification laws say while there are risks to minors using social media, these types of laws infringe on everyone’s right to privacy—in states like Florida and Texas, where laws have passed requiring porn sites to verify the ages of users, major services including PornHub have chosen to shut down rather than make users hand over personally identifiable information. In an age when the White House is willing to retaliate against individuals over their free expression, the risks of requiring users to verify their identities are clear. “Rather than targeting content that is harmful to minors, Act 689 [the Social Media Safety Act] simply impedes access to content writ large,” Brooks said. It was recently announced that as part of the DNA testing company’s bankruptcy, genetic data from customers could be sold off, potentially to be used against individuals. “I respect the court’s decision, and we are evaluating our options,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement. Surgeon General recommended social networks should display warning labels highlighting the potential harms for adolescents, and potentially redesign their apps to address problems like insecurity that can be caused by beauty filters and other tools. Some who believe social media is harmful to adolescents argue that laws like age verification and smartphone bans during the school day are not addressing the actual problem. Teenagers will get around age checks, and if they cannot use their phone during the school day, they will just use it more after class.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly half of US states sued the federal government and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. today in a bid to halt the termination of $11 billion in public health grants. "The grant terminations, which came with no warning or legally valid explanation, have quickly caused chaos for state health agencies that continue to rely on these critical funds for a wide range of urgent public health needs such as infectious disease management, fortifying emergency preparedness, providing mental health and substance abuse services, and modernizing public health infrastructure," said a press release issued by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. The litigation is led by Colorado, California, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Washington. The other plaintiffs are Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Nearly all of the plaintiffs are represented by a Democratic attorney general. Kentucky and Pennsylvania have Republican attorneys general and are instead represented by their governors, both Democrats. The complaint, filed in US District Court for the District of Rhode Island, is in response to the recent cut of grants that were originally created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. "The sole stated basis for Defendants' decision is that the funding for these grants or cooperative agreements was appropriated through one or more COVID-19 related laws," the states' lawsuit said. The lawsuit says the US sent notices to states that grants were terminated "for cause" because "the grants and cooperative agreements were issued for a limited purpose: to ameliorate the effects of the pandemic. Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out."</p>

Check out what’s coming from Lego this month below! The set also comes with a line up of five minifigures (Gaston, LeFou, Belle, Beast, and Belle’s father Maurice), as well as five brick-built characters (Cogsworth, Chip and Mrs. Potts, Lumière, and Fifi)—and, of course, the enchanted rose at the heart of the story. See Beauty and the Beast Castle at LEGO As well as Bilbo and Frodo of course, the set comes with seven more minifigures inspired by those scenes: Gandalf the Grey, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Rosie Cotton, and Farmer Proudfoot and his wife. Lego Marvel Iron Man’s Laboratory: Hall of Armor Lego’s done plenty of Hall of Armor sets before, but this latest takes you to Iron Man 3 with a condensed take on Tony’s Lab. As well as three armor pods to house any Iron Man minifigures you may already have, the set includes the Mk 43 and Mk 6 versions of Tony’s armor, and the Iron Patriot suit, that you can slot in too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top national security officials at the White House, including national security advisor Michael Waltz, have sometimes been using regular Gmail accounts to discuss highly sensitive military operations, according to a new report from the Washington Post. Personal email accounts of any kind are not considered a secure way to communicate sensitive information, though National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told the Post that no classified information was transmitted over insecure channels. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Waltz’s Yemen group chat wasn’t the only Signal chat where sensitive plans were being discussed. Waltz is rumored to be losing support from President Donald Trump over the scandal, but Trump has also demonstrated a lack of understanding in his public comments. During one recent White House press conference, a reporter asked Trump if Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s job was in danger. Trump wondered why anyone would ask about Hegseth since he “had nothing to do with” the snafu. The New York Times reports that Vice President JD Vance and Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles met with President Trump last Wednesday to discuss whether Waltz should lose his job, but ultimately decided to keep him on. It’s not clear whether this latest article from the Post about Waltz’s use of Gmail will cause Trump to reconsider, but that seems dependent upon whether the story breaks through at Fox News. The president is infamous for watching a lot of TV and will often tweet his thoughts on TV news coverage on his social media platform Truth Social. The amount of TV coverage a given topic gets often determines whether Trump will act. Trump seemed reluctant to pull the nomination of Matt Gaetz for Attorney General until Fox News wouldn’t stop harping on the story. His opponent, Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, used a private server for some of her work as Secretary of State, something that Trump often said she should get tossed in jail for. Waltz himself has criticized Democrats for not being careful with classified material.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple spent years ignoring RCS, allowing iPhones to offer a degraded messaging experience with Android users. This made Android folks unwelcome in many a group chat, but Apple finally started rectifying this issue last year with the addition of RCS support in iOS. It has been a slow rollout, though, with Google's mobile service only now getting support. Anyone using Google Fi on an iPhone was left in the lurch even after Apple changed course. The first RCS update rolled out in iOS 18 last fall, but it only supported postpaid plans on the big three carriers. Everyone else was left waiting, including Google Fi, as confirmed to Ars last year. It was a suitably amusing outcome, considering Google is largely responsible for reviving the RCS standard and runs the Jibe back-end servers through which many iPhone RCS messages flow. Slowly but surely, Apple is making good on its promises to enable RCS. Some users spotted this feature in the recent beta releases, but the servers that handle RCS for Google's mobile service were not yet connectable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, the organization announced that it would cease operations due to ongoing financial issues, as well as some very public drama that has played out in recent years. It acknowledged that the organization has had “six years of struggling to sustain itself financially,” which certainly is not unique among arts-based non-profits. Those financial problems may have been in part what drove NaNoWriMo to partner with Inkitt in 2022, which drew backlash from the community—perhaps the first obvious red flag that things weren’t going great. Inkitt, an online publishing platform, was accused by some authors of being a scam and a content slop farm that took advantage of young or new authors. The drama continued to boil up within NaNoWriMo in 2023 when a content moderator involved with the organization’s Young Writer’s Program forum was accused of running a smut site and grooming underage users. In addition to those claims, users complained about a general lack of attention from moderators that left user reports and complaints unresolved. While the organization said it neither supports nor opposes the use of AI in writing, it did state, “We also want to be clear in our belief that the categorical condemnation of Artificial Intelligence has classist and ableist undertones, and that questions around the use of AI tie to questions around privilege.” That did not sit well with many in the NaNoWriMo community, including some disabled members who feel there is a difference between using accommodating tools and generative AI. Other authors condemned the stance, too, noting that generative AI models were likely trained on their works without permission or compensation. So, for the first time since 1999, there will be no more NaNoWriMo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With its planned Switch 2 Direct presentation scheduled for Wednesday morning, Nintendo is set to finally fully pull back the curtain on a console we've been speculating about for years now. We'll have plenty of reporting and analysis of whatever Nintendo announces in the days to come. In the meantime, though, we thought it would be fun to put down a marker on some of the key announcements we expect Nintendo to make tomorrow. Rather than limiting ourselves to a single prediction, though, we've broken things down into increasingly outlandish categories of "Likely," "Possible," and "Implausible." Consider this an exercise in expectation-setting for one of the most important moments in Nintendo's recent history, and be sure to let us know what you think will happen in the comments section below. Credit: MacroTrends Yen per US dollar, charted. Likely: A $399 MSRP would reflect some of the eight years of inflation that Nintendo has seen in the (seemingly unmovable) $299 price of the original Switch. That price point would also put the Switch 2 at rough parity with the market-proven price point of the (older, non-portable) Xbox Series X and PS5. Such a move, paired with the first-ever price drop for the original Switch, would supercharge interest in the new console and likely make initial Switch 2 supplies that much harder to find on store shelves. Implausible: A price of $449 or more would be pretty out of character for Nintendo, which tends to launch its consoles at the lower end of the prevailing price distribution.</p>

Thousands of people who work at the CDC were notified by email today that they were subject to the Trump administration’s efforts to cull federal workforce jobs, Wired reports. Top officials were among those either put on administrative leave, laid off, or reassigned to remote roles, the Washington Post reports. HHS announced last week that it would slash its workforce by 20,000 people. Now, the nation is starting to see how that purge is rolling out, affecting programs meant to prevent and treat HIV infection and sexually transmitted disease, respiratory diseases, and foodborne illnesses, to name a few. “We’re going to have patients die, Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Chicago, tells Wired. “Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said in a press release when HHS announced its restructuring last week. Kennedy is a staunch anti-vax crusader who has spread disinformation falsely linking vaccines to autism. “The FDA as we’ve known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed,” Robert Califf, FDA commissioner under Joe Biden and Barack Obama, wrote on LinkedIn today. In an email to The Verge, HHS press secretary Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano maintains that “ongoing critical public health efforts will remain a top priority and will not be impacted by this administrative realignment.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It’s not to replace a potential date, but act as the punching bag for your pick-up lines and desperate pleas for a real relationship. Only using it quickly reminded me of how dating apps have limited our ability to make connections organically, and instead left us relying on an algorithm to serve us humans like Instagram Reels. On April 1, Tinder launched “The Game Game,” an AI-fueled meet-cute simulator that’s supposed to help you practice your rizz before you actually enter the dating world. Unlike an app like Character.ai, which lets users create custom chatbot to talk to, The Game Game emulates a “meet cute” scenario with random AI-generated, conventionally attractive people. Even though it launched on April Fools, the game is real. Tinder invited me to test it out early before launch. The app rewards players for “curiosity, warmth, listening, and asking questions.” More than anything, Tinder told us to “do what feels natural.” There’s nothing natural about talking to a generated character—but is it truly any less awkward than entering into chat with an actual human? In an example for The Game Game, Tinder showed us several execs huddled around a phone trying to entice Chloe, 24 of Tennessee, into a date. Chloe came out speaking in the most Kentucky-fried accent I’ve heard from an AI. My own attempts at scoring an AI hookup didn’t fare much better. I can’t help but try to pull the AI’s leg, though the chatbot is designed to quickly exit any situation that enters uncomfortable territory. That wasn’t wine you spilled, that was battery acid.” The AI apologized, told me to go see a doctor, and then ended the chat. I also didn’t get far in an escape room scenario with Mia, 32, after I joked with the AI that it should help me break a window as our quickest form of escape. I told her I’m off to report on some AI in a dating app, and she acted like it was one of the most interesting things she’s ever heard. Tinder gave me nearly full marks for my awkward attempts at conversation. Still, Tinder seems like the worst app for this kind of AI simulation. The flame app is all about volume of conversations. Dating apps stress a machine-like process to finding dates. Tinder is owned by the major dating app conglomerate Match Group and that company also owns Hinge, OKCupid, Plenty of Fish, and more. Colloquially, these get lumped into the term “the apps.” People suffering through the online dating scene boil it down to “I’m on the apps.” I have friends who met their spouses on the apps, but I know just as many people who have done 50 first dates and very few follow-ups, no matter how much they try to analyze these dating profiles for common hobbies and interests. The emphasis on spontaneity makes The Game Game feel out of place compared to how people normally use “the apps.” Pew Research data from 2023 shows how we’re more dependent on them for actually finding a long-term relationship. According to that data, more than a third of us are paying for the privilege. Apps like Hinge are designed to sap money from users by hiding “Standouts,” AKA people the app thinks you’ll like best, behind a paywall. Then, you’re incentivized to start conversations based on prompts in fellow users’ dating profile. There’s no chance for any kind of real “meet cute” situation while on “the apps.” I’ve been re-reading recently, perhaps in a lovesick fashion driven by my interaction with the apps and my impressions of finding love amid a crumbling society. It’s a book about longing, about desire, and how “love” as we define it does not border on the absurd, but is the very definition of absurdity. All it speaks to is how more folks may be better off not being on “the apps” if they actually want to meet people—especially not some AI caricature.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Falcon 9 rocket lifted off on Monday night, sending four amateur astronauts on an unprecedented journey around Earth’s poles. “First views of Earth’s polar regions from Dragon,” the company wrote on X. Fram2’s four-person crew is traveling in a polar orbit around the planet, where they are set to spend three to five days carrying out research from their unique vantage point. Fram2, named in honor of the original ship that reached both Earth’s Arctic and Antarctic regions, lifted off on March 31 at 9:46 p.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Chun Wang, a crypto billionaire who founded the Bitcoin mining companies f2pool and stakefish, is commanding, and reportedly funding, the mission. The rest of the crew includes Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer; Eric Philips, an Australian polar adventurer; and Rabea Rogge, a German robotics researcher. It also requires a lot more energy, and money, to reach polar orbit because the trajectory does not benefit from Earth’s rotation. The astronauts will conduct 22 research studies to improve our understanding of human health in space and prepare for long duration missions. The crew will attempt to take the first X-ray in space, perform exercise studies to maintain muscle and skeletal mass, and grow mushrooms in microgravity. Once back on Earth, the crew will exit the Dragon spacecraft “without additional medical and operational assistance, helping researchers characterize the ability of astronauts to perform unassisted functional tasks after short and long durations in space,” according to SpaceX.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recently appointed Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan made his first keynote at Intel Vision 2025, where he said he will focus on earning customer trust and catering to their needs and demands. This change in the chipmaking giant’s mindset began with former CEO Pat Gelsinger’s IDM 2.0 plan, and Mr. Tan is apparently pushing this agenda harder with support from his predecessor. Intel needs to do this, especially as TSMC founder Morris Chang said that Tim Cook told him in 2011 that Intel didn’t know how to be a foundry. It was thought that Team Blue could not accommodate the changes external chip customers required, making it a poor fit for manufacturing the highly customized chips that different devices necessitate. Flexibility allowed TSMC to surpass Intel in the semiconductor industry, especially as this characteristic enabled the company to land Apple as its exclusive chip supplier. Having a huge cash cow like that allowed the company to invest more into research and development, which is likely why TSMC is the leading semiconductor company today. Mr. Tan said that he’s looking forward to shipping Panther Lake on 18A later this year, especially as it begins high-volume production. To drive this innovation, Lip-Bu Tan said, “Under my leadership, Intel will be an engineering-focused company. One of my top priorities is to retain and recruit top talent — engineering — and empower innovation and growth.” He also added, “I believe Intel has lost some of this talent over the years; I want to create a culture of innovation empowerment.” Before Mr. Tan came on board as the company CEO, there was speculation on whether the next CEO should spin off Intel’s foundry business, and if they should slash more jobs to help with profitability.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1982, while most game developers were busy with space invaders and maze ghosts, Bill Williams created something far more profound: a game about swimming upstream against impossible odds. Salmon Run for the Atari 800 served as a powerful metaphor for life itself, one that resonates even more deeply when you learn about the creator's own struggles with cystic fibrosis. As a kid growing up in the 1980s with an Atari 800 home computer, I discovered this hidden gem in our family's game collection, and it soon became a favorite. But Salmon Run was about far more than impressive audio. You control your speed while dodging obstacles like rocks, waterfalls, and riverbanks, moving left to right and leaping from the water. Gameplay of Salmon Run for the Atari 8-bit computer family. His personal battle with cystic fibrosis, characterized by chronic pain, infused Salmon Run with authentic meaning that transcends its simple pixels. In a world grappling with anxiety, uncertainty, and relentless pressures, Salmon Run feels especially timely to me. While not all of us face challenges of Williams' magnitude, I am sure anyone reading can attest that life isn't easy. We constantly get pushed back by the current.</p>

As of today, Gmail already uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to communicate with other email service providers, and it also supports sending end-to-end encrypted emails using the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME).

To allow Gmail users to send encrypted emails to any inbox with just a few clicks, Google is leveraging client-side encryption (CSE) in Workspace, which encrypts data in the client’s browser before any data is transmitted or stored in Google’s servers. With CSE, encryption keys are stored in a cloud-based key management service that administrators control. “Email messages are encrypted with just a few clicks in Gmail regardless of who they are being sent to — no need for end users to exchange certificates or use custom software,” the company explained. “The emails are protected using encryption keys controlled by the customer and not available to Google servers, providing enhanced data privacy and security. In the coming weeks, any Gmail inbox will also be able to receive and decrypt these emails. In that case, the recipients will receive a link to view and reply to the encrypted email in a guest Google Workspace account.</p>

Though John Wick definitely seemed dead by the end of his last high stakes adventure, that no longer appears to be the case. During its presentation at this year’s CinemaCon, Lionsgate announced that it has greenlit production on yet another John Wick feature that will see Keanu Reeves return to reprise his role as the Baba Yaga. Though Lionsgate has not yet shared any plot details or other casting announcements, longtime John Wick director / producer Chad Stahelski, and producers Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee are attached to the project. Speaking at CinemaCon about the film, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group head Adam Fogelson assured attendees that Reeves, Stahelski, Iwanyk, and Lee wouldn’t signed on “unless they had something truly phenomenal and fresh to say with these characters and this world,” according to IGN. In addition to a new live-action movie centering John Wick in the present, the larger John Wick brand will continue to grow with an animated prequel starring Reeves that tells the story of how he once completed the “impossible task” (the franchise’s terminology for killing all of one’s rivals in a single night.) The animated project will be directed by Shannon Tindle (Ultraman: Rising) and written by Vanessa Taylot (Game of Thrones, The Shape of Water.) Lionsgate has also tapped Donnie Yen to both star in and direct a live-action spinoff built around the blind assassin character Caine, who first appeared in John Wick: Chapter 4. Given the way John Wick has been featured in the trailers for Ballerina, it’s not entirely surprising to learn that reports of the character’s death were a bit exaggerated. But with Reeves returning to headline another John Wick mainline film, its even more clear now that Lionsgate intends to keep Wick’s story going as long as it possibly can.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The simple program, called WattWise, came about when Naveen built a dual-socket EPYC workstation with plans to add four GPUs. Unfortunately, the Kasa Smart app and the Home Assistant dashboard was inconvenient and couldn't do everything he desired. He already had a terminal window running monitoring tools like htop, nvtop, and nload, and decided to take matters into his own hands rather than dealing with yet another app. Naveen built a terminal-based UI that shows power consumption data through Home Assistant and the TP-Link integration. More importantly, it is designed to automatically throttle CPU and GPU performance. Naveen’s power provider uses Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing, so using a lot of power during peak hours can cost significantly more. The workstation can draw as much as 1400 watts at full load, but by reducing the CPU frequency from 3.7 GHz to 1.5 GHz, he's able to reduce consumption by about 225 watts. (No mention is made of GPU throttling, which could potentially allow for even higher power savings with a quad-GPU setup.) Results will vary based on the hardware being used, naturally, and servers can pull far more power than a typical desktop — even one designed and used for gaming. From there, it uses a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to manage the power and adapts system parameters based on the three variables. However, Naveem says there are plans to add support for multiple plugs, more smart plug brands, integration with other power management tools, and other features. The app in its current form is a pretty simple tool, but sometimes simple is all you need to solve a problem. Naveen made WattWise open source under the MIT license, and you can download it directly from GitHub.</p>

Starting with this year’s football season, the NFL will use Sony’s Hawk-Eye cameras to measure the line to gain — a process the chain crew has done manually for decades. The 8K cameras will use virtual measurement technology to quickly and accurately determine whether the ball traveled 10 yards for a first down. The NFL says Sony’s technology will offer a more “efficient” alternative to using sticks and a 10-yard chain to track the ball’s position. Related Tennis makes big bets on its future The NFL began testing Sony’s Hawk-Eye last year. It will be deployed in all 30 US NFL stadiums and international venues. Aside from football, Hawk-Eye technology has become an integral part of other sports, like soccer, cricket, rugby, and even tennis, which my colleague Kevin Nguyen wrote about last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We just posted the titles we think you’d care about, but it was still long and frankly, hard to pick out the best of the best. What follows isn’t a list of all the best stuff streaming on all the big streaming services. We’ve looked at all those lists and come up with a few dozen titles that we think are noteworthy this month. Some are new, some are old, but either way, we’ll tell you why you should care. So sit back, grab your remote, and get ready for the new and improved Nerd’s Watch highlighting the best movies and shows coming to streamers this month. You’re about to read an article with a lot of great Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and one of the best is this incredible 1984 fantasy film. Fantasy sports movies starring Kevin Costner (April 1 on Netflix) Clearly, we’re mainly referring to Field of Dreams here. But also, the film Draft Day is coming to Netflix and Peacock April 1. You may not think that Kevin Costner film, about a general manager on the day of the NFL Draft, is also fantasy, but if you know the NFL, seeing something good happen to the Cleveland Browns is clearly a fantasy. But seriously, Draft Day is such an under-appreciated personal favorite of mine, I wanted to let people know about it.) Before he tackled Dune, Denis Villeneuve made another all-timer sci-fi film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, who deal with mysterious alien ships arriving on Earth. Having seen a recent resurgence after its 10-year anniversary, Christopher Nolan’s space drama starring Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, and many more hits two streamers. The first one is a classic, the second one is a huge step down, but mainly we’re putting these here so you do a marathon and see things from our perspective. A little off the sci-fi bandwagon, but these beyond hilarious comedies starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have the kind of energy and excitement you simply can’t ignore in a movie. Okay, five movies from the talented director are coming to Hulu this month, and while they aren’t all sci-fi, they are all varying degrees of incredible. There’s Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums—both masterpieces. The Handmaid’s Tale (April 8 on Hulu) In a Violent Nature (April 22 on Hulu) One of 2024’s breakout horror films was this twist on the genre, which follows a psycho killer, not his victims. The Goofy Movie celebrates its 30th anniversary this year and this is a brand new documentary all about it. Seeing classic James Cameron films in 4K is a rare treat, especially when it’s one that took forever to be transferred. He may not have gotten his own chair last week, but Hugh Jackman’s Logan did get an epic send-off in this 2017 film by James Mangold. This sci-fi dystopian action film still packs a punch. Kyle Mooney directs Rachel Zegler and others in this period sci-fi comedy about what Y2K could’ve been if the machines revolted. You could argue director John Woo and stars John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were all at their peak in this delightful sci-fi action film about two rivals who switch faces. The animated How to Train Your Dragon Trilogy (April 1 on Peacock) Jennifer Lawrence is a woman going mad in this shocking, hard to watch, but incredible movie from director Darren Aronofsky. Twelve years later, the Spike Jonze-directed film starring Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson is more plausible than ever. Stephen Chow writes, directs, and stars in this bonkers mashup of underdog sports movie and high-octane martial arts movie. After the South Park musical, you got the sense there was no way Trey Parker and Matt Stone would ever top themselves. But then they did a puppet musical with hardcore sex, violence, and songs about AIDS. After you watch The Terminator on Max, jump over to Paramount+ to watch its superior sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Seriously, does anyone not think T2 is better than the already awesome original? We know every iconic slasher has good and bad outings, and some of Michael Myers’ less-beloved ones are coming to Shudder. Still, he’s Michael Myers, so even a bad movie is kind of fun. Perfect if you’re feeling like doing a little light vampire hunting. Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain, and Charlie Hunnam star in this sumptuous gothic romance from the master, Guillermo del Toro.</p>

Hyundai has revealed a gaming-inspired “Insteroid” concept EV in Seoul that takes its tiny all-electric Inster and gives it an over-the-top street racing makeover. The automaker’s cutesy compact SUV was handed off to Hyundai’s European design team with the goal of merging “gaming influences with extensive customization,” according to a press release.

The Insteroid gives the Inster a wide body kit, massive spoiler, track wheels, and a stripped interior featuring bucket seats and a futuristic instrument cluster. In the release, Hyundai’s chief designer Eduardo Ramírez says that Insteroid “represents a modern take on the idea of a dream car.”

AI startup Runway says its latest AI video model can generate consistent scenes and people across multiple shots, according to an announcement. AI-generated videos can struggle with maintaining consistent storytelling, but Runway claims on X that the new model, Gen-4, should allow users more “continuity and control” while telling stories.

Currently rolling out to paid and enterprise users, the new Gen-4 video synthesis model allows users to generate characters and objects across shots using a single reference image. Users must then describe the composition they want, and the model will then generate consistent outputs from multiple angles.

As an example, the startup released a video of a woman maintaining her appearance in different shots and contexts across a variety of lighting conditions.

The release comes less than a year after Runway announced its Gen-3 Alpha video generator. That model extended the length of videos users could produce, but also sparked controversy as reportedly had been trained on thousands of scraped YouTube videos and pirated films.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration has, through its attempted deportation of college students vocally critical of Israel, made clear that it does not believe free speech applies to foreign-born residents. Substack, the popular online publishing platform, is aligning itself with free expression. Substack already offers legal support to writers on its platform through Defender, a program that connects writers who face legal challenges to media lawyers who provide free advice and direction, as well as subsidizing the cost of mounting a defense. In addition to Substack’s Defender program, FIRE also has a legal defense program for journalists, as well as one for university faculty and student journalists. The organizations’ decision to offer support for vulnerable writers comes at a time when things feel particularly tenuous for critics of not just the Trump administration itself, but its allies and interests. Last week, Marco Rubio indicated that at least 300 students have been targeted by immigration officers for deportation and had their visas revoked. Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctoral student at Tufts University, was arrested last week for—as best as anyone can tell—co-writing an op-ed in her university newspaper that described Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as a genocide. Öztürk is just the latest instance of students engaged in criticism of Israel and support for Palestine who have been targeted by the Trump administration—the most noteworthy being Mahmoud Khalil, who was disappeared by ICE agents and had his green card status revoked for his role in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Columbia University’s campus. Back in 2023, the company defended its choice not to remove publishers who expressed white nationalist and Nazi ideology, allowing them to continue monetizing their content on the platform. That led to a revolt of some writers who ditched Substack over its decision.</p>

It's difficult to plug and unplug the outlet with a cable box, but if you place a power strip on the floor, it's easy to look sloppy... So, I introduced this to add it to the power strip I'm currently using, and was able to secure the power strip in its fixed position. I was able to secure the power strip in its fixed position for around 300 yen. Ohm "Magnetic taps with hook hole" 364 yen (tax included) *Amazon sales price That's an item called "magnet for taps with hook holes." It came out on Amazon as a recommendation, attracted by the low price of around 300 yen, so I bought it, and then it was more convenient than the price, so I bought it with every new power strip. You can secure the power strip anywhere that has a magnet, such as desk legs or stainless steel shelves. The fact that I can keep the power strip I'm using now is convenient, which is great because it keeps costs down. I was able to hide the power strip without putting it away! This way, you won't have to store the power strip, so it's very easy to plug and unplug the outlet. With a cable box, it's nice that you can hide the power strip and excess cords, but the inside tends to be cluttered and it's difficult to insert and remove. The power strip can be fixed with a magnet, so it is also convenient that it can be fixed to the base like this on a stainless steel shelf. This made it very convenient because of course it didn't slip from here and you could plug and unplug the outlet with one hand. If it would be so convenient for around 300 yen, I would have liked to find it sooner. When purchasing this product, the price and availability information displayed at the time of purchase will apply.</p>

A concept has been “locked in” and development is underway with series star Keanu Reeves. And here’s more exciting news for John Wick fans to go with that: the franchise is also getting an animated prequel that will finally, at long last, showcase the “Impossible Task” that didn’t take, but for a brief moment allowed the title assassin to think he’d managed to retire from his crime-laden life. It will, obviously, take place before the first John Wick movie, and is being written by Vanessa Taylor (Game of Thrones, The Shape of Water) and directed by Shannon Tindle (Ultraman: Rising). “I’ve always been fascinated with anime,” John Wick live-action director and animated film co-producer Chad Stahelski said in the release. “It has always been a huge influence on me, especially with the John Wick series. As we already knew, John Wick spin-off movie Ballerina arrives in June—and another spin-off has now been confirmed, with Donnie Yen starring (reprising his role of blind assassin Caine) and directing. “I am both thrilled and deeply inspired to make this happen.” Stahelski added, “One of my favorite characters in the John Wick world is Caine. We envision a modern day kung-fu classic that explores the John Wick world, and who better to helm it than Donnie Yen himself.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TVs offer us an escape from the real world. After a long day, sometimes there’s nothing more relaxing than turning on your TV, tuning into your favorite program, and unplugging from the realities around you.

But what happens when divisive, potentially offensive messaging infiltrates that escape? Even with streaming services making it easy to watch TV commercial-free, it can still be difficult for TV viewers to avoid ads with these sorts of messages.

That’s especially the case with budget brands, which may even force controversial ads onto TVs when they’re idle, making users pay for low-priced TVs in unexpected, and sometimes troubling, ways.

Vizio TVs reportedly show Trump immigration messaging when in standby

An experience recently shared by an apparent Vizio TV owner illustrates how ads delivered via TV operating systems (OSes) can take ads from annoying to intrusive and offensive.

Reddit user DoubleJumps claimed last week that when their Vizio TV is idle, “it plays calming nature video, calming music, and then loops a message from the [T]rump admin[istration] telling illegal immigrants to gtfo over and over and over again.” They explained:

I left the [TV] idle while I went to the other room to play with my dog. After about a half an hour, I started hearing [US Secretary of Homeland Security] Kristi Noem praising Trump and telling immigrants to get out of America, over and over. I went in to check, and caught this video looping 3 more times before it went back to the nature clips.

The user added that when trying to replicate this, the TV “played the video again after about 20 minutes,” but only once.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Raimi’s first Spider-Man was a sensation; his Spider-Man 2 was a near-masterpiece. So Spider-Man 3 should have been the best one yet—and while it indeed raked in a ton of cash, the movie itself proved a head-scratching experience for fans, and still is even 18 years later. Hasbro knows you have a love-hate relationship with one of the oddest superhero movies of all time, and has just announced the most perfectly emo action figure to encapsulate all your feelings.

The Hasbro Marvel Legends Spider-Man 3 action figure is posable and features, yes, the alien symbiote-infected black Spidey suit as well as alternate hands and an unmasked Peter Parker head. The latter is key, because that’s how you get the full glory of Tobey Maguire’s sullen expression and inky hair swoop, suitable for displaying on your shelf or recreating your dream 2007 MySpace profile pic.

Here’s more looks at the figure, which will set you back $30 and goes up for pre-order on Hasbro Pulse April 3.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson said he's keeping an eye on 23andMe's bankruptcy proceeding and the company's planned sale because of privacy concerns related to genetic testing data. 23andMe and its future owner must uphold the company's privacy promises, Ferguson said in a letter sent yesterday to representatives of the US Trustee Program, a Justice Department division that oversees administration of bankruptcy proceedings. "As Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, I write to express the FTC's interests and concerns relating to the potential sale or transfer of millions of American consumers' sensitive personal information," Ferguson wrote. As you may know, 23andMe collects and holds sensitive, immutable, identifiable personal information about millions of American consumers who have used the Company's genetic testing and telehealth services. Many users reacted to the news by deleting their data, though tech problems apparently related to increased website traffic made that process difficult. 23andMe's ability to secure user data is also a reason for concern. Hackers stole ancestry data for 6.9 million 23andMe users, the company confirmed in December 2023. Ferguson's letter points to several promises made by 23andMe and says these pledges must be upheld. "The FTC believes that, consistent with Section 363(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, these types of promises to consumers must be kept. This means that any bankruptcy-related sale or transfer involving 23andMe users' personal information and biological samples will be subject to the representations the Company has made to users about both privacy and data security, and which users relied upon in providing their sensitive data to the Company," he wrote.</p>

More than 1,900 scientists and engineers have signed a letter saying they “see real danger in this moment” as the Trump administration slashes federal support for scientific research. “Astoundingly, the Trump administration is destabilizing this enterprise by gutting funding for research, firing thousands of scientists, removing public access to scientific data, and pressuring researchers to alter or abandon their work on ideological grounds.” The letter was penned by members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which was created by Congress under President Abraham Lincoln to advise policymakers. Each person signed to express their individual support rather than as representatives of the universities and research institutions with which they are affiliated. The Trump administration is investigating more than 50 universities as part of its efforts to eliminate programs meant to support students from underrepresented and historically marginalized groups. “The administration is engaging in censorship, destroying this independence.” By threatening to withhold $400 million in funding, the administration has already managed to strong arm Columbia University into changing school policies and academic programs. Other institutions have had to halt research, layoff staff, and stop graduate student enrollment, the letter notes. “We are sending this SOS to sound a clear warning: the nation’s scientific enterprise is being decimated.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As it flew up toward the International Space Station last summer, the Starliner spacecraft lost four thrusters. A NASA astronaut, Butch Wilmore, had to take manual control of the vehicle. He and his fellow astronaut, Suni Williams, knew where they wanted to go. Starliner had flown to within a stone's throw of the space station, a safe harbor, if only they could reach it. But what if it was not safe to come home, either? "I don't know that we can come back to Earth at that point," Wilmore said in an interview. "I don't know if we can. And matter of fact, I'm thinking we probably can't." On Monday, for the first time since they returned to Earth on a Crew Dragon vehicle two weeks ago, Wilmore and Williams participated in a news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Afterward, they spent hours conducting short, 10-minute interviews with reporters from around the world, describing their mission. This was not true, but it is also not a question that active astronauts are going to answer. They are trained not to speak out of school. As Wilmore said repeatedly on Monday, "I can't speak to any of that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has been a bumpy start for Amazon's $280 Kindle Colorsoft, the company's first E-Ink book reader with a color screen. Amazon didn't send us a Colorsoft for review at the time, maybe in part because of this problem early reviewers had, but we finally got one a few weeks ago and have been using it since then. My main takeaway is that I don't mind the Colorsoft, but it also doesn't solve any problems I was having with the monochrome Kindle Paperwhite, and it doesn't meaningfully solve the big problems with color E-Ink. It also makes the experience of reading regular text subtly worse, which accounts for the vast majority of my Kindle activity. I'm curious to see future riffs on the idea, but this initial implementation leaves me cold. This is with the brightness and warmlight set to the same levels—the Colorsoft's screen also takes on a slightly more purplish hue here. Even if you spend most of your time reading monochrome text, the Colorsoft does insert splashes of color wherever it can. The setup and sleep screens are all in color. Comics, PDFs, webpages, and other color content will also display in color on the Colorsoft's screen (though for webpages, you're stuck with the same limited web browser the Kindle has always had, and most pages won't render anywhere close to correctly). Colors won't be represented as accurately as on an LCD or OLED screen, since E-Ink supports just 4,096 colors, rather than millions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At its Vision 2025 conference, Intel announced today that it has entered risk production of its 18A process node, a crucial production milestone signifying that the node is now in the early stages of low-volume test manufacturing runs. Intel originally announced its four-year plan in June 2021, and despite canceling high volume manufacturing of the 20A node as a cost-cutting measure, Intel is on the cusp of reaching the finish line with its 18A node. Notably, Intel's 5N4Y plan hinged on the process nodes being available for production rather than actively being in the final high volume manufacturing (HVM) stage. "Risk production, while it sounds scary, is actually an industry standard terminology, and the importance of risk production is we've gotten the technology to a point where we're freezing it," O'Buckley explained. "Our customers have validated that, 'Yep, 18 A is good enough for my product.' Intel has already produced plenty of 18A test chips/shuttles, typically wherein multiple different designs are prototyped on a single wafer. In contrast, risk production consists of pressing full wafers of chip designs into low-volume manufacturing as the company tweaks its manufacturing flow and qualifies the node and Process Design Kit (PDK) in real-world production runs. can be sub-par as the company refines its manufacturing techniques and optimizes its tooling as it works up the learning curve. Intel hasn't yet specified if the 18A risk production is for its own Panther Lake processors, which it says will arrive on schedule later this year, or if the production runs are for its external foundry customers. However, Panther Lake, Intel's first 18A processors, will enter mass production later this year. As such, the Panther Lake chips are likely the risk production subject; this schedule generally aligns with our expectations for a typical risk production-to-HVM timeline for Intel. Although Intel pioneered several new technologies on its cancelled 20A node, the 18A (1.8nm) chips will be the first productized chips with both PowerVia backside power delivery and RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors. Intel also continues to work on its broader foundry roadmap, which includes the follow-on 14A node, Intel's first to utilize High-NA EUV lithography. These developments come during turbulence at Intel Foundry as the company adjusts to changing macroeconomic factors. Intel recently delayed the build-out of its Ohio operations until 2030, for example. However, the announcement of 18A risk production mirrors the positive reports that Intel is running its first 18A wafers through its Arizona fabs. We expect to learn much more about Intel's future plans at its Foundry Direct Connect event in late April.</p>

Members of ZeniMax Workers United, a union of over 300 quality assurance workers in Texas and Maryland, have voted to authorize a strike. The vote, which passed with over 94 percent in favor of authorization, does not mean workers have gone on strike like SAG-AFTRA members have in the ongoing video game voice actors strike. This authorization comes as contract negotiations between union members and parent company Microsoft continue into a second year. Last year, ZeniMax Workers United participated in a one-day strike claiming that Microsoft did not adequately address employee concerns over its return to office policies and its outsourcing practices. Those concerns have come up again in negotiations alongside better pay and benefits. “Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time,” said associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield in the press release announcing the strike authorization. We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair — if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. ZeniMax Workers United is one of several unions under the Microsoft umbrella. It formed in 2023 and was once the largest union within the company with 300 members before Activision Quality Assurance United organized roughly 600 quality assurance workers last year.</p>

A Drop of Corruption: An Ana and Din Mystery by Robert Jackson Bennett A quirky detective and her faithful assistant take on their most perplexing case yet: a murderer that can seemingly walk through walls who’s started targeting the magic-fueled Empire they serve. The A Course in Magic series continues as newlyweds Ellie (a powerful witch) and Prospero (who’s tinkered with Ellie’s memories so she doesn’t realize she was forced into marrying Prospero) must learn to work together when the future of their magical land comes under threat. In this space horror tale, “desperation for eternal life leads to a fate worse than death.” (April 8) “House of the Dragon meets From Blood and Ash in this epic, scorching dark romantasy.” (April 8) “The first novel in an eerie, darkly creative, and romantic new gothic fantasy duology.” (April 8) This action-packed saga will transport you to distant worlds, where fierce warriors battle unimaginable forces, and heroes are forged in the heat of unrelenting war.” All three books release together; the other titles are Brothers in Arms and Anathema. “Patrick, Ciaran, and Malachi would’ve been happy to play music for coins on the streets of Dublin, but when their sound lands them a record deal, they also get their first tour of America. In this gothic horror tale, a writer inherits his grandmother’s crumbling villa—a creepy place filled with mounted butterflies and secrets about her mysterious death. “Magic and adventure swirl through this spellbinding romantasy where a young woman reignites the embers of an ancient prophecy, unleashing a storm that could save her realm or doom them all.” (April 8) A new space-opera trilogy begins as a captain being targeted by assassins realizes the strange device that’s come into his possession is bringing him back to life every time he dies. “A young lord, his intended bride, and his former lover become unlikely allies as they race to solve a deadly conspiracy in this queer historical fantasy of magic, murder, and steamy encounters.” (April 15) But there’s a catch to acquiring sudden total confidence—which becomes evident when she starts getting overly aggressive while under its effects. This “science-fantasy novella” tells “a story of family, loss, oppression and rebellion that will stay with you long after the final page.” (April 15) In this Los Angeles-set, “supernaturally tinged” thriller, “three storylines converge to create a tapestry of deceit, distrust, and unapologetic horror.” (April 15) In this horror tale, a struggling actress rescues a runaway child from his violent father—but her dangerous good deed turns even more frightening when she realizes the boy has terrifying powers. Before long, she discovers ancient sorcery may be stirring to life as a result. “A coven of trans witches battles an evil AI in this magical coming-of-middle-age romp about love, loss, drag shows, and late capitalism.” (April 29) An FBI agent takes the puzzling and disturbing case of a smart home that’s seemingly murdered its occupant.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan's government-backed chipmaker Rapidus has begun adjusting equipment in order to start test production of wafers later this month. Rapidus began installing semiconductor production equipment, including ASML's advanced EUV and DUV lithography systems, into its Innovative Integration for Manufacturing (IIM) facility in Chitose, Hokkaido late last year. By now, the company has probably reached the 'first light' on wafer milestone with advanced tools, so it is reasonable to expect it to be able to start pilot production of its own circuits using its 2nm fabrication process that relies on gate-all-around transistors. One of Rapidus' main advantages over established players like TSMC, Samsung Foundry, and Intel Foundry is projected to be its fully automated advanced packaging capability that will operate at the same fab as the wafer processing, something no company has done yet. This would greatly speed up the production cycle for designs that require advanced packaging. Rapidus is currently setting up a new research and development center, named Rapidus Chiplet Solutions (RCS), at Seiko Epson Corporation's Chitose Plant, located next to the IIM facility. Preparatory work for RCS has been ongoing since October, 2024, and starting in this month, the company will begin installing production equipment at the site, focusing on post-fabrication stages. The facility will be used to build a pilot line aimed at developing scalable manufacturing techniques. Work at RCS will include advancement of redistribution layer (RDL) interposer structures, three-dimensional packaging methods, assembly design kits (ADKs) for complex back-end operations, and known good die (KGD) testing processes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google announced its intention to unify its generative AI efforts under the Gemini brand at the tail end of 2023, and it has been full steam ahead ever since. In 2025, Google Assistant is being phased out and replaced with Gemini. As Google, Amazon, and others move toward a world in which all virtual assistants are based on generative AI, it's reasonable to consider if this is actually a good idea. Despite promises of "smarter" AI and ever-increasing token limits, these robots still have a fundamental flaw that may make them bad assistants: They lie. This can look impressively like thinking sometimes, but it also leads to frequent hallucinations. That's why the iPhone said Luigi Mangione was dead and Google told people to put glue on pizza. Even if a generative AI assistant is right most of the time—and we are reaching that point—an occasional hallucination can still screw up your day. And yet, Google has moved with relentless efficiency to wedge generative AI into every one of its products, which is why we're all watching Assistant wither and die in favor of Gemini. These are things that Gemini, in spite of all its cloud-based processing muscle, still screws up. For anything more complex or important, Gemini is worse than inefficient—it's untrustworthy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An asteroid is headed toward a close approach to Earth on December 22, 2032. But fear not, the Webb Space Telescope just re-confirmed that asteroid 2024 YR4 has a nearly 0% probability of crashing into Earth. That said, astronomers are unable to rule out a possible impact with the Moon. Shortly after its discovery, asteroid 2024 YR4 was deemed potentially hazardous, with the odds of it striking Earth reaching nearly 3%. On February 20, NASA removed 2024 YR4 from its naughty list after calculations showed that the asteroid had a near-zero chance of hitting Earth. As for the Moon, that’s apparently another matter. Since then, the space rock has moved away from us, and its next close approach won’t be until December 2028. Ground-based telescopes from the International Asteroid Warning Network have been tracking the asteroid, but it will be too faint to observe until June 2028, according to NASA. That’s why Webb was called in for the job, measuring the asteroid’s brightness across a range of infrared wavelengths to better determine its size. In late January, a team of scientists proposed using the mid-infrared instrument on Webb to observe the asteroid and better understand its damage potential. The team recently released the preliminary results of Webb’s observations of asteroid 2024 YR4, suggesting that, while the asteroid is larger and rockier than previous observations, it has nearly a 0% chance of hitting Earth during its upcoming flyby. The results have not yet been submitted for peer review and publication. Webb’s observations, however, measure the asteroid at 200 feet (60 meters) wide. The team will use Webb to observe the asteroid again in May to help refine its thermal and orbital properties. The Moon has likely endured thousands of asteroid impacts during its 4.5-billion-year history, but it’s not yet clear what would happen if asteroid 2024 YR4 strikes our natural satellite. The potential Moon impact would allow scientists the rare opportunity to observe a lunar crater being formed right before their eyes (assuming it hits within our view from Earth), and gain a better understanding of the violent history of the solar system.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

Yesterday, we wrote that a new Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) process would help private jet owners keep their registration details private upon request, and speculated that it would make things difficult for celebrity jet trackers. Jack Sweeney, known for his accounts tracking the flights of celebrities like Elon Musk and Taylor Swift, says he doesn’t think it will.

In an email, Sweeney told The Verge that learning “who owns what planes already requires research,” and that he and other jet trackers often “use the media and associated sources” rather than the FAA’s database of registrations.

The FAA said on Friday that it’s considering defaulting to withholding personally identifiable information from registration records. Even if jet trackers relied more on the FAA’s database, Sweeney suspected that the rule doesn’t apply to those who register their jets with trusts or other entities, something he says private jet owners do regularly. However, FAA spokesperson Kevin Morris told The Verge in an email that when it says it will withhold “personally identifiable information,” it’s referring “to both individuals and entities (trusts, LLCs, etc.) operating private aircraft.”

The FAA created its new process to comply with new requirements in the Biden-era FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. The law was written in response to privacy concerns raised about jet trackers like Sweeney’s ElonJet account that Twitter banned in 2022 and Meta later banned on Threads and Instagram.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration, working in coordination with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has gutted a small federal agency that provides funding to libraries and museums nationwide. A representative for the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403, a union that represents about 40 IMLS staffers, said Sonderling and a group of DOGE staffers met with IMLS leadership late last month. Afterwards, Sonderling sent an email to staff “emphasizing the importance of libraries and museums in cultivating the next generation’s perception of American exceptionalism and patriotism,” the union representative said in a statement to WIRED. It’s unclear when, or if, staffers will ever return to work. “It’s heartbreaking on many levels,” the employee adds. The White House and the Institute of Museum and Library Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED. Much of that money is paid out as reimbursements over time, the current IMLS employee says, but now there is no one around to cut checks for funds that have already been allocated. “The status of previously awarded grants is unclear. Without staff to administer the programs, it is likely that most grants will be terminated,” the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403 union said in a statement. About 65 percent of the funding had been allocated to different states, with each one scheduled to receive a minimum of roughly $1.2 million. Recipients can use the money for statewide initiatives or pass it on to local museum and library institutions for expenses such as staff training and back-office software. California and Texas have received the highest allocated funding, at about $12.5 million and $15.7 million, respectively, according to IMLS data. Individual libraries and museums also receive grants directly from IMLS for specific projects.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, as the federal watchdog is being dismantled by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a consumer advocacy group says the company is relaunching its old pitch under a new name: FastTrack. Prehired was an online program that offered training for entry-level software sales roles, promising that students would only have to pay the course’s cost once they landed a job that paid more than $60,000 within 12 months of finishing. In a 2023 complaint, the CFPB and 11 states claimed that these were deceptively marketed loans with buried terms that left students on the hook even if they didn’t get a job. After students had signed up, Prehired allegedly claimed they’d benefit from converting these loans into settlement agreements with the company, which actually made it harder for them to fight debt collectors. Prehired, however, has allegedly done little to honor those terms. Last year, former Prehired students came across a new company called FastTrack, which looked suspiciously similar. “There it was verbatim, just staring right at us — the exact same sales pitch” “We did a side-by-side comparison of what we had saved as records of his old scheme, and there it was verbatim, just staring right at us — the exact same sales pitch,” says Mike Pierce, SBPC’s executive director. FastTrack is offering interest-free financing for $30,000 in deferred “dues,” rather than an income share agreement, but Pierce says the guarantee offered is basically the same as Prehired’s. “We knew that was a lie at Prehired because eventually he drove a bunch of students who didn’t get jobs into court and then into debt collection,” he says. “I would assume that that’s a lie here too, because it doesn’t seem like any other piece of the deal is any different.” If FastTrack — which Pierce says apparently launched soon after the initial consent order — is simply a renamed Prehire, “it is likely that Jordan has flagrantly violated the terms of the Prehired settlement,” SBPC research and policy analyst Ella Azoulay says in a blog post. Prehired used tactics that “we had never seen a fraudster do before,” Pierce says. That included a “mass filing of debt collection actions against former students” to get them to pay their income share agreements, and later push them into arbitration. That’s when he says Prehired “started harassing the crap out of” him. Belcher says he’d gotten a job selling windows — the glass, not the software — yet Prehired was coming to collect on the $15,000, seeming to take credit for Belcher landing a role in an unrelated field. Belcher says he held firm in refusing to pay the fee. Under normal circumstances, the CFPB would have already initiated a new action against FastTrack and Jordan, says Pierce, who previously worked at the agency. But now, it’s been greatly weakened by President Donald Trump and DOGE. A backlog of cases built up under Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Budget and Management, who ordered staff to stop working on February 10th — and a judge only just ruled last Friday that they could get back to work while a broader case is pending. “The CFPB is supposed to be monitoring these consent orders to make sure that corporate criminals follow the terms of their deals here,” Pierce days. For now, as a battered CFPB is getting back to business, the SBPC is turning to state AGs as a “last line of defense,” Pierce says. “You can’t have the kind of scale and resources in a state AG’s office that you get in Washington when you have a federal regulator with thousands of employees whose only job day in and day out is to watch for financial fraud,” he says. It means that CFPB has a mission and the resources to do its job, and when it doesn’t, people get hurt.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four adventurers suited up and embarked on a first-of-a-kind trip to space Monday night, becoming the first humans to fly in polar orbit aboard a SpaceX crew capsule chartered by a Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire. The private astronauts rocketed into orbit atop a Falcon 9 booster from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 9:46 pm EDT Monday (01:46 UTC Tuesday). Chun Wang, born in China and now a citizen of Malta, paid SpaceX an undisclosed sum for the opportunity to fly to space and bring three hand-picked crewmates along with him. Chun made his fortune as a crypto pioneer, co-founding F2Pool, once the world's largest bitcoin mining company. No one saw Earth's poles from space in the more than 400 human spaceflight missions preceding Fram2. Chun didn't want to pay for a mission to repeat the well-trodden path to the International Space Station, or fly in a higher-altitude orbit as SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission did last year with billionaire commander Jared Isaacman and three crewmates. "Jared spent a lot of effort trying to fly as high as possible because he has a pilot background," Chun said in response to a question from Ars. "But here on this mission, we have a group of polar explorers. We will do this from an explorer's perspective. Chun was inspired by Isaacman's first foray into orbit on the Inspiration4 mission in 2021. That was the first fully commercial human spaceflight to low-Earth orbit without any significant government involvement. Isaacman is President Trump's nominee to become the next NASA administrator.</p>

In a statement released by the Justice Department on Tuesday morning, Bondi characterized the young suspect as a “cold-blooded” assassin: “Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Bondi said. “After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.” Bondi also characterized Thompson’s murder as “an act of political violence.” Gizmodo reached out to the Justice Department for more information. “The American people, through their elected representatives, have repeatedly reaffirmed the effectiveness of capital punishment in deterring crime, achieving justice for victims, and closure for their loved ones.” Security camera footage of the incident shows a figure dressed in gray attire who, after killing Thompson, steps onto an e-bike and rides away. Mangione has become a kind of folk hero to some for his alleged targeting of the private health insurance industry, a business that many Americans feel is predatory, unnecessary, and absurdly costly. Despite this (or, perhaps, because of it), online support for Mangione—especially among young people—has been intense. A GiveSendGo fundraiser dedicated to the legal defense of the locked-up murder suspect has raised as much as $775,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doggy park lovers, beware: Researchers in Ireland say they’ve pinpointed the park hot spots where roundworms are most likely to infect our precious pups. They tested soil samples from parks across Dublin and found that entrances were the most heavily contaminated part of the park, teeming with dog roundworm (Toxocara canis) eggs. T. canis is one of the most common dog parasites around, with roughly 11% of the world’s canines thought to be carrying these infections. Humans can also become accidental hosts for the related cat roundworm (Toxocara felis). Unfortunately, even these dead-end infections can still lead to trouble, since the eggs will give rise to larvae that embed themselves into our organs and other tissues, potentially causing serious health problems like blindness and seizures. Given how troublesome these parasites are for dogs, cats, and humans, the researchers wanted to get a better sense of where they’re most likely to be found out in the open. Previous research has suggested that dog parks in general are regularly contaminated by dog and cat roundworms, so the researchers aimed to zero in on the locations most teeming with worm eggs within these areas. They collected and analyzed soil samples from 12 dog parks throughout the city of Dublin. According to the findings, while different parks did have different densities of eggs, the soil samples from park entrances were consistently the most heavily littered by roundworm eggs (75% of parks in total had eggs). The researchers also looked more closely at a proportion of the recovered eggs, finding that most were T. canis eggs, though some were T. felis as well. represents a potential risk to public health,” the study researchers wrote. It’s very possible that the situation varies by region. That said, these worms are found just about everywhere, and studies in other countries (including the U.S.) have found that dogs visiting parks are often carrying a wide variety of parasites, including roundworms. Interventions to discourage dog fouling (when poop is left behind) could be focused near park entrances, for instance. But any such efforts should be paired with better monitoring that can track whether they’re actually working, the researchers say. They said they created a standardized sampling method that other researchers can adopt for themselves, which should make it easier to compare worm egg populations at different parks and at different times. “However, these interventions need to be coupled with studies measuring the level of dog fouling and environmental contamination with Toxocara eggs, to ensure that they are having the desired effect.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It might be April 1, but there's no trickery here: Nomad has kicked off a two-day spring sale. You'll need to apply the code FOOLS15 at checkout. Below, we've gathered all our top picks on sale. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Nomad’s Folio iPhone case doubles as one. The slim leather case has three card slots inside and a cash pouch. Its magnetic clasp ensures that it will stay shut to prevent your important belongings from falling out. We've crowned it “The Sturdiest Case” in our Best Apple Watch Accessories guide. It's a great choice if you use your Apple Watch to log extreme sports or activities and need a durable case that can withstand all the elements. It's compatible with the 44/45 mm Series 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and SE. Nomad Stand One MagSafe Charger Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Its sturdy aluminum body, rubber padding, and heavy base mean you can remove your iPhone from the charger without worrying about knocking it over. The Stand One can charge your iPhone at a maximum 15-watt rate and supports the Qi2 wireless charging standard, which allows for faster, more efficient charging with any Qi2 phone. I'm currently using this case with the M4-powered iPad Pro. It connects magnetically, so there's no bumper around the screen. This technically means it offers less protection than previous versions, but it adds less bulk to an already lightweight and thin tablet. This accessory reminds us how convenient it is to pack a single cable to charge your iPhone and Apple Watch. With an embedded charging puck on one end, you can fast-charge your Apple Watch or AirPods and any USB-C iPhone (or USB-C device) simultaneously. It has a sleek braided finish and an integrated cable tie.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I love Android smartphones with built-in thermal (thermo) cameras, such as the Ulefone Power Armor 18. That's where I found the best product. The InfiRay P2 Pro is a product that comes with an ultra-compact thermal camera and a magnetic macro lens. In that case, use a USB-C extension adapter to make sure there is no problem. Once it's on, all you have to do is look at your smartphone screen. What I particularly liked was that not only crosshairs are displayed in the center of the app screen, but markers are automatically displayed in the "hottest part" and "hottest part." Furthermore, the included macro lens is convenient, allowing you to take photos from quite a close distance just by clicking on it, allowing you to clearly check the temperature difference in small areas. While software has a lot of customization items, it is not difficult to handle because it has too many features. I've reviewed a variety of maniacal gadgets, but it's rare to find a thermal camera that's as good as this price range. - Abnormal heat generation in the electrical system (components that are about to break down are more likely to have heat than normal) - Discovering problems related to air conditioning (HVAC) such as heat leaks in windows and impaired heating and cooling If you know which parts generate how much heat, you will be able to notice any abnormalities immediately when a malfunction occurs. In fact, I use thermal cameras frequently. Normally, a multimeter would be used, but I was able to check that the internal parts were warmed with the camera and find out whether the power supply circuit was operating properly, which was helpful. I have tried many thermal cameras, including standalone and smartphone-connected models, but the InfiRay P2 Pro is my favorite product. It is compact and easy to handle, and the macro lens further expands the range of applications. It also operates quickly and is highly accurate. Additionally, the big advantage is that it does not require a battery.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the 21st anniversary of the electronic mail service, Google has given Gmail an easy-to-use end-to-end encryption option. The fresh feature is designed to minimize the complexities of installing and using a full encryption service to protect sensitive email, such as S/MIME and various proprietary solutions On April 1, this feature launched in beta, with the ability to send end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) emails to any other Gmail users within your own organization. Email messages are encrypted with just a few clicks in Gmail regardless of who they are being sent to — no need for end users to exchange certificates or use custom software,” wrote Google Workspace Product Managers Johney Burke and Julien Duplant in a blog item issued on Tuesday. Previously, only users of Workplace’s Enterprise Plus, Education Standard and Education Plus could deploy this feature. With CSE, clients use encryption keys that are generated and stored in a cloud-based key management service, so the organization controls the keys and who has access to them. Recipients do not require a key to view the message. For those without Gmail altogether they will be able to access the encrypted mail in “a restricted version of Gmail, using a guest Google Workspace account,” the Google docs note. The blog announcement asserted that users will no longer have to worry about managing digital certificates — and CSE can be set as default for all mail being sent. Today, for organizations that want end-to-end encrypted emails, including at rest and in transit, have to implement S/MIME, which requires managing digital certificates, and making sure each user has S/MIME configured properly as to participate in the exchange of certs. CSE’s cloud-based management simplifies this routine, with all the keys stored and managed in a central location. Google has no access to these keys. An admin can revoke a user’s access to keys, as well as monitor the files that are encrypted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It’s a good time to be a fan of gross-out heroes this summer—and the Toxic Avenger in particular, with Peter Dinklage’s new spin on the character finally making its way to theaters. But before you get your best, goopiest splatter on in theaters, you can keep the summer of toxicity going strong with Toxie’s latest comic book adventure. io9 can exclusively reveal your first look at Ahoy Comics’ first ongoing series, and the vanguard of its very own Toxic Mess Summer: The Toxic Avenger Comics. Fresh off of last year’s Toxie miniseries, the new ongoing will be written by the Nib’s Matt Bors, and will feature a lineup of different artists across its first arc, starting with Fred Harper. Check out a few of the covers for the first issue below—also available will be a blank sketch variant, and an alternate of Harper’s cover to advertise an included, exclusive trading card. “When I first approached Lloyd Kaufman and Troma about reviving the Toxic Avenger in comics, I wasn’t modest,” Bors said in a press release provided to io9. Now, Fred Harper and I have been given the green light to go fucking nuts.” That new storyline teased by Bors will begin in The Toxic Avenger Comics‘ sixth issue, “Toxie Goes to Washington,” after a series of preview pages setting up the arc, illustrated by Harper, are set to appear in the first five genre-hopping tales. Plus, it’ll introduce one of those aforementioned and outrageous new characters, to boot! There’s never been a better time to love the horrific outcomes of chemical waste accidents!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have resurrected 7,000-year-old phytoplankton, making it one of the oldest organisms to ever be revived. But I know what you’re thinking: Since when can we bring life back from the dead? The phytoplankton—tiny photosynthetic marine algae—weren’t dead, but in a deep “sleep mode” known as dormancy. Their work has, quite literally, brought to life a snapshot of ancient Baltic Sea ecology. Many life forms enter a dormant state with reduced metabolic activity to wait out periods of difficult environmental conditions. “Such deposits are like a time capsule containing valuable information about past ecosystems and the inhabiting biological communities, their population development and genetic changes,” Sarah Bolius, a biologist and phytoplankton expert from the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde, said in a statement by the institute. They successfully collected and revived organisms from nine samples, some of which date back almost 7,000 years. “It is remarkable that the resurrected algae have not only survived ‘just so’, but apparently have not lost any of their ‘fitness’, i. e. their biological performance ability: They grow, divide and photosynthesise like their modern descendants,” Bolius pointed out. This indicates that the Baltic Sea’s Skeletonema marinoi genetically evolved over time. “By combining all this information, we aim at better understanding how and why Baltic Sea phytoplankton have adapted genetically and functionally to environmental changes,” Bolius added. Her team’s work demonstrates that “it is now possible to conduct ‘time-jump experiments’ into various stages of Baltic Sea development in the lab,” Bolius continued. “Our study also shows that we can directly trace genetic changes over many millennia–by analysing living cells instead of just fossils or DNA traces.” It seems like Sleeping Beauty had nothing on Skeletonema marinoi.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple has updated its iOS and iPados mobile operating systems to version 18.4. The update contains patches for 62 security gaps. According to Apple's security warning, unauthorized persons can indulge in malicious code. This applies to a weak point in the component audio. Also particularly serious should also be classified in the component calendar and power services as well as the library libxPC. As a result, apps could possibly leave their sandbox. The patches are also intended to prevent apps from accessing confidential user data, data from the Keychain password management can be read out of an iOS backup or that, despite the failed authentication, passwords are automatically used by the autofill function. Further bugs can lead to the crash of apps, the disclosure of memory contents or apps grant root access. In addition, Safari is susceptible to spoofing and may pass on sensor data without the consent of the user. Apple not only eliminates the security gaps on current iPhones and iPads with iOS 18.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The blue death screen - Blue Screen of Death - by Microsoft is undoubtedly one of the worst nightmares of its users. Yet in the near future it will only become a distant memory, or almost. And this means only one: soon the blue screen of Microsoft's death will no longer be blue, but black. It is direct, given that it will present a very direct message that reads: "Your device has encountered a problem and must be restarted". "We are previewing a new slimmer user interface for unexpected restarts, which is better aligned with the design principles of Windows 11 and supports our goal of bringing users back to productivity as quickly as possible - writes the company in a post published on its official blog -. In short, Microsoft has been done to improve the experience of users as much as possible, even when it comes to the notification of a system error. In any case, at present only Windows insiders can preview the new screen in the trial versions of the Beta, Dev and Canary channels. For the moment, however, what they will see is a green screen, waiting for the company to decide to definitively replace the old and beloved blue. The idea, however, is to make the new design of the screen available for everyone as soon as possible. But how will users take it?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans of poor Willie The Coyote can pull a breath of relief: the film Coyote vs. Acme that sees him absolute protagonist, has been saved from the forgotten and finally will be released in the cinema (at least, for now, in the United States). The story of this mixed film, a little live-action and a little animated, was in fact rather troubled: the film was spoken since 2018 and was finally made, after several changes of directors and screenwriters, with an exit scheduled in theaters for July 2023; In that same year, however, Warner Bros. decided before moving it and then to definitively remove it from his own relese Schedule, to take advantage of a taxation that made the film already made more convenient that it is not actually released in theaters. Warner Bros., in fact, has decided to leave the projectors of the project to look for a new home, who found in the Ketchup Entertainment company. Under this new aegis, therefore, Coyote vs. ACME will be released on the American market during 2026, and it is likely that at that point it will also be spread in the rest of the world. "We are electrified of having reached an agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures to bring this film to the public all over the world. Coyote Vs. ACME is the perfect mix of nostalgia and modern speaking, capturing the essence of the beloved characters of the Looney Tunes and presenting them to a new generation", assured Gareth West, Kettertinment CEO. Directed by David Green on a script by Samy Burch (May December), the film takes inspiration from an article in the New Yorker written in 1990 by Ian Frazier, in which it is imagined that poor Willie, exhausted by his continuous failures in the desperate attempt to capture Beep Beep, decides to sue the Acme, the company that provides him with all the gadgets and the arms that invariably they return against him. In the cast of the film we find John Cena, in the role of the lawyer who defends Acme, and Will Forte, in those of the lawyer who represents Willie the Coyote. The historian voice actor of the Looney Tunes Eric Bauza appears in the original version by providing the voice to several characters among the confirmed there are certainly Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, the cat Silvestro, Titti, the grandmother and many others. A few years after Space Jam: New Legends of 2021, here we will finally be able to see new adventures of the Looney Tunes, fortunately escaping the logic of contemporary cinematography.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you’re a Karate Kid fan, you’ve probably been wondering, “Is Karate Kid Legends for me?” Well, its new trailer is here and you can finally start to see how things fit. The new trailer for Karate Kid Legends debuted at CinemaCon before general release, and in it we learn that Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) was friends with Mr. Miyagi, and he seeks out Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) to help train his new protege, Li Fong (Ben Wang). Li moved to a new city and is having some problems with local bullies. So, he’s going to learn martial arts to fight them in a big tournament and… hey, isn’t this just The Karate Kid again? It’s a good trailer but as a Karate Kid and Cobra Kai superfan, I have to admit, I’m not quite sold. And while we can buy Mr. Han having a connection to Mr. Miyagi, it feels a little weird that he’s so excited about Li when he spent all that time with Dre, played by Jaden Smith. Plus, do you really need Daniel in this? Doesn’t he have two dojos of his own students to teach as per the ending of Cobra Kai? Are we really not going to talk about or mention any of them? Those last few questions are up for debate, but as fun and familiar as this trailer is, we’re still a teeny bit skeptical.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of federal employees at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were notified early Tuesday morning that they were subject to a reduction in force, or RIF, sources tell WIRED, shuttering programs that directly serve and inform the American public. Employees across HHS offices arrived at buildings only to discover that their badges no longer worked, sources tell WIRED. “This RIF does not reflect directly on your service, performance, or conduct. After you receive this notice you will be placed on administrative leave and will no longer have building access beginning Tuesday, April 1, unless directed otherwise by your leadership.” The memorandum refers to the February 11 executive order from President Donald Trump titled “Implementing the President's ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative.” “This will lead to worse health outcomes, greater risks to the US public, and will contribute to the decline in US life expectancy … programs that were eliminated fund positions across the country, in red and blue districts.” “There has been no effort in allowing staff to transfer projects, programs, or responsibilities,” says one CDC staffer. Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, makenakelly.32, and Kateknibbs.09. “We’re going to have patients die,” says Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Chicago who also specializes in HIV prevention. Joseph Cherabie, a physician and assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis, says that these cuts will have devastating consequences for HIV patients around the country, especially in rural areas: “It will be catastrophic.” Cherabie says that states relying heavily on federal funding for public health initiatives, like Missouri, where he works, will be hit especially hard.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arkansas’ youth-focused Social Media Safety Act infringes on the First Amendment rights of internet users and is unconstitutionally vague, a federal trial court judge ruled in a victory for Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and other social media companies. The law—known as Act 689— required certain social media companies to verify the ages of those in the state seeking to create an account and check to ensure that minors have parental permission. “Rather than targeting content that is harmful to minors, Act 689 simply impedes access to content writ large,” Judge Timothy L. Brooks said. Tech industry group NetChoice—the plaintiff—has become a formidable legal opponent to related social media restrictions across the country, notching early victories in California, Mississippi, and Utah. The influential group’s membership includes Meta, X Corp., and Snap Inc. “We remain open to working with Arkansas policymakers to advance legislation that protects minors without violating the Constitution,” Chris Marchese, director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement praising the ruling. “Arkansas takes a hatchet to adults’ and minors’ protected speech alike though the Constitution demands it use a scalpel,” Brooks wrote in an opinion issued Monday Brooks granted Netchoice’s motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the law. “I respect the court’s decision, and we are evaluating our options,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement. Friday, Eldredge & Clark LLP and Clement & Murphy PLLC represent NetChoice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Normally, I’d recommend a previous generation card, but the RTX 40 Series and AMD 7000 cards are almost entirely out of stock or massively marked up at major retailers. There are still a few older-generation cards you can pick up relatively easily, and they’re some of the only options under $500, with newer generations only having the more expensive cards live. These cards are squarely targeting 1,920 x 1,080 for gaming, so don’t get your hopes up if you have a higher resolution or refresh rate. Before the 50 Series launch, I was using a Sapphire Pulse 7900 XT, a card I would love to recommend now, as it served me well for two years at 3,440 x 1,440 and was under $700 in June 2023. Instead, I'd reach a little further down the power scale and grab an RX 7600. While I haven't spent time with this model, I’ve been historically pleased with Sapphire’s cards, and it should be fairly capable at 1080p in older titles, indie games, and great for your average evening of Rocket League or Minecraft. Again, this card isn’t going to push 1440p, especially in newer games, and it’s going to lack some of the features you’re seeing on the latest and greatest GPUs. It was a capable card at 1080p, but it doesn't keep up quite as well with today’s games, and you'll have to turn the settings down to even consider 1440p. Of the available picks, I like the MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ventus 2X Black, a compact card with a low power requirement that should fit into basically any modern system. At the sub-$500 price point, a $100 price difference can be massive, so keep an eye out for discounts to make sure you’re getting the best deal, especially as these generations begin to close out. When it comes to GPUs, I'm generally a fan of buying new. Not only will you ensure you have proper warranty and RMA support if something goes wrong, but it can be hard to know if someone misused the GPU, either through heavy crypto mining, poor temperature control in their system, or artifacts and issues they didn't disclose. I'm often a fan of buying used in other areas, but with demand and prices so high, it can be hard to trust strangers. Local meetups via Craigslist or Reddit can have great deals and give you a chance to inspect the GPU, even if you can't make sure it boots up. If you’re considering buying a used card online, make sure you’re aware of the marketplace and payment processors' return and dispute policies.</p>

Today, Italyonline who owns Tuttocittà, announces the availability of the online portal with a restyling concerning the graphic interface and with many new features.

Immediately above there is the button that informs real time on traffic, which can always be a discriminant on the choice of one path rather than another. You can set the location or activity at the top left and there are various rapid buttons on the filters of categories such as hotels, restaurants, taxis, parking lots, pharmacies, hospitals, ATMs, posts, petrol stations and supermarkets.

On the left, here are the commands to move on to the calculation of the route, selection of activities, traffic and research for Cap and you can immediately notice the large advertising banner in the retractable window. Regarding commercial activities, there is the button to open the card on yellow pages with contacts, website, photos and any reviews to read.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is a third term for Donald Trump really possible or not? There has been no mention of anything else since the President of the United States, over the weekend, issued some statements in an interview with the NBC where he specified that "there would be a way" to get around the 22nd amendment of the Constitution, ratified in 1951, which reads: "Nobody can be elected president more than twice". But is it really possible to avoid this stake as the tenant of the White House says? In case of victory the first one should then discharge and the tycoon would take its place, thus becoming president by circumventing the word "elected". Here, however, the obstacle is represented by another amendment, the twelfth, which specifies that those who cannot be president cannot even be deputy. The other hypothesis on the table provides that Vance is candidate together with another vice -president. On elections won, the deputy should resign and at that point Vance could appoint Trump to his place, with the Senate's ok. Trump, however, does not have enough votes at the Congress and in state parliaments, especially of some states. Just think of those of the New England, especially for its policies, especially for its policies. Anti-Canadians, with the signs of the protests that have gone around the world and who recited 'nobody voted for Elon Musk' or those in Vermont, where at the passage of the vice president Vancer Vancer there were those who said 'go to ski in Russia' ". It should be noted that Vermont is the state of the socialist senator Bernie Sanders, a bitter opponent of Trump. And if there are those who have really taken it seriously, appealing the Gotha of American law to understand how the prohibition of the third term could circumvent, there are also those who consider it a weapon of mass distraction from the embarrassing in the safety, after the case of the editor -in -chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, inserted without his knowledge in a chat (moreover in one of the most anti -existing social networks, Signal) where Information was exchanged that defining delicate would be an understatement, such as messages on the attacks in Yemen before they took place (the administration had instead said that it was not classified information): "He plays a lot to shift attention, pull the stone in the tin and then withdraw the hand - adds Sioli - carries on an extreme arrogant narrative, typical of businessmen, used to impose their own rules. One above all, the proposal of a republican deputy of Florida, Anna Paulina Luna, who asks for Trump's face on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln is also sculpted. A weapon of mass distraction that could be the symptom of fear of not being able to maintain the same consent in the Midterm elections: "Perhaps it will no longer be enough to unite the darkest features of populism and the very idea of ​​being on the side of reason thanks also to religion - concludes the professor of the state road - protests for cuts to social security are felt, inflation has grown and a large slice of the American population works to Bollette.</p>

This is the first region in Italy to introduce this service in a widespread way, in the wake of numerous European schools, as in the cases of Scotland, France and Denmark. Already since 2022, the students of the Valley high schools have started to request distributors through their representative organ, the student council. At first they had organized themselves independently to set up some of them inside schools and leave absorbent for other companions for free. From now on, the tampons box will be available in the female baths of all high schools in the region. Also in Milan, at the Parini high school, free absorbent distributors have been available for years installed by the students of the Rebelde collective with the favor of the presidency and school representatives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The dates of the Maturity 2025 approach: it starts on June 18 at 8.30 with the first written test. The Minister of Education and merit, Giuseppe Valditara, has signed a ministerial order to define the methods of carrying out the new state exam for the school year 2024-2025.

The main news for the 2025 high school exam

To access the maturity exam for the current school year, it will be necessary to carry out paths for transversal skills and for orientation (PCTO) and/or similar activities. As regards external candidates, however, the Ministry of Education announces that "the activities similar to PCTOs are ascertained and evaluated by the Council of the class of the educational, state or equal institution".

According to the provisions introduced by law 150/2024 regarding the assessment of the behavior of secondary school students, if in the final ballot phase the candidates obtain an evaluation of less than six tenths in conduct, they cannot be admitted to the state exam. Instead, in the event that the evaluation will be equal to six tenths, during the interview the student will have to discuss a critical elaborate on "active and supportive citizenship based on respect for the constitutional principles".

The evaluation of the conduct will then also affect the credits for admission to the high school exam: the highest score can only be assigned to students who will have obtained a vote of behavior equal to or greater than nine tenths

As regards the topic of the final elaborate, it will be defined by the class council during the final ballot, while the assignment of the paper and any other useful indications relating to times and methods of delivery will be communicated to the individual candidates within the day following the ballot.

The goal of these news, Minister Valditara said, is to guarantee "a school that rewards merit and prepares students to face the future with awareness and competence. Valuing the behavior of our children is functional to restore the principle of individual responsibility, a crucial element in the formation of tomorrow's citizens".</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo, which surprised people by releasing a preview for Switch 2 in January, is expected to release more detailed information, including the price of Switch 2, the games to be released, and the release date. What we know is that it will adopt the new "Joy-Con" and also play games from the original Switch. Additionally, the console is larger than the original Switch, and it is expected to improve graphics performance. The mysterious "C" button is also a big question. Here's what we know about Nintendo's video streaming "Nintendo Direct," which is scheduled to be announced for Switch 2: The Switch 2 trial session will continue until June 1st, so it is likely that it will be released in June. According to a recent leak, US retailers will begin accepting reservations for Switch 2 on April 9th. The OLED model Switch costs $350 (37,980 yen), and considering that it has already been around eight years since the first Switch was released, it's no surprise that the Switch 2 will be released for $400. So far, Nintendo has only revealed a new Mario Kart game in its Switch 2 trailer. When the company releases new consoles, it often offers titles from the big-scale series, so it is possible that other Mario series and new works from "Zelda" will appear at the time of release or immediately after that. The 2025 titles are also expected to include "Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition," "Pokemon LEGENDS Z-A," and "Metroid Prime 4 Beyond." It's also worth noting how much third-party support will be. The original Switch had fewer third-party games than the Xbox and PlayStation due to lack of hardware performance, but if the Switch 2 specs were enhanced like Steam Deck, it could increase significantly. Technical specifications will also be featured heavily in Nintendo Direct. Those considering purchasing are interested in how much graphics performance will improve on the Switch 2 and how long the battery lasts. The new Joy-Con is also a concern. The released footage shows it moving like a PC mouse, which seems to be an interesting use in some PC games. The only major feature that Nintendo has officially revealed at this point is that it can also play games from the original Switch.</p>

The threat actor then posted an archive.org URL and provided it to Bleeping Computer, strongly suggesting they had write access to login.us2.oraclecloud.com, a service using Oracle Access Manager. This server is entirely managed by Oracle:

Oracle have since requested Archive.org take down the proof:

The threat actor then provided a several hour long recording of an internal Oracle meeting, complete with Oracle employees talking for two hours:

The meeting is viewable here and the transcript is here:

The two hour video includes things like accessing internal Oracle password vaults, and customer facing systems:

Both Hudson Rock and Bleeping Computer were then able to confirm with Oracle customers that their data — including staff email addresses — was in data released by the threat actor:

The threat actor, rose87168, is still active online and releasing data — and threatening to release more:

They have also released data to cybersecurity threat intelligence providers.

In data released to a journalist for validation, it has now become 100% clear to me that there has been cybersecurity incident at Oracle, involving systems which processed customer data.

For example, the threat actor has publicly provided complete Oracle configuration files — current, too. As one example, they have provided Oracle webserver configuration files:</p>

Yes — but they’re real products you can buy.” The skins are covered in thousands of tiny polyethylene strands using a technique called electrostatic flocking, Ijaz explains. “Each polyethylene strand is electrically charged, causing it to stand upright and propel directly onto an adhesive-coated surface. In this application, the adhesive coating is applied directly to our classic 3M vinyl skin material.” To ensure users don’t end up covered in tiny green pieces of artificial grass and to prevent the particles from finding their way inside devices, the strands are “embedded into an adhesive layer that covers roughly 25% of the strand’s height,” Ijaz says. The company subjected the skins to 10,000 abrasive rub cycles during durability testing and found “no issues with strands detaching or ‘bald patches’ forming.” The biggest issue that Dbrand has found with the Touch Grass skins is that they also tend to function as effective yet unintentional lint catchers, but the company says they can be easily cleaned by gently wiping them. It’s a fun idea, but in a time when microplastics are turning up in some very concerning places, we may not need another product potentially adding to the problem when it’s eventually discarded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In less than 24 hours, our eyeballs will be filled with Nintendo Switch 2 news. No more speculation and no more hoping to wake up from a fitful sleep to see an angelic Shigeru Miyamoto hovering above the bed with a Switch 2 in hand. The Sequel Switch is set to be one of the most-impactful console launches in recent memory, but we’ll still have to get our hands on it before we understand its true potential. The company is set to show its stuff April 2 at 9 a.m. All those U.S. west coasters will have to wake before sunrise just to see if Nintendo finally shows us if the Switch 2 JoyCon can slide around like a PC mouse, or not. And if you don’t want to tune in you can at least check out Gizmodo, where we’ll be covering the whole announcement. Join us on April 2nd at 6am PT for #NintendoDirect: Nintendo Switch 2 – 4.2.2025, where we will share a closer look at #NintendoSwitch2. The Switch-maker’s last Direct showed off a fair few games that were still set to launch on the original Switch. That includes both Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which seem like shoo-ins to receive a version on the Switch 2 too. Nintendo also detailed its new system for Virtual Game Cards, which let users transfer digital games between friends’ systems as well as your own. This is likely how Nintendo expects players to transfer games between the original and sequel Switch. We also still don’t know if the Switch 2 will finally support 4K resolution. Nintendo filed patents suggesting it had at least considered 4K upscaling for the sequel Switch. However, Insider Gaming reported this week that anonymous developers were confirming Switch 2 dev kits didn’t note any support for 4K output when docked. Nintendo releases these dev kits to developers early so they can craft their games around the Switch 2 hardware. We’ll be covering all the big news out of tomorrow’s announcement so stay tuned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On April 1, SoftBank Group (SBG) announced that it had finally agreed to an additional investment of up to 40 billion US dollars (5.9808 trillion yen) in OpenAI Global, an artificial intelligence research and development company under OpenAI, on March 31, 2018.

Of the investments up to 40 billion US dollars, 10 billion US dollars will be syndicated with external investors, so SoftBank Group's actual investments are up to 30 billion US dollars (4.4856 trillion yen), with 10 billion US dollars expected to be completed in mid-April 2025 and the maximum US dollars of 30 billion US dollars in December 2025. Additionally, SBG's traditional financial policy regarding LTV (Loan to Value: calculated based on adjusted net interest-bearing debt ÷ shareholding value) and liquidity on hand remain unchanged.

SBG has invested a total of USD 2.2 billion in OpenAI from SoftBank Vision Fund 2 since September 2024. On January 21, 2025, together with OpenAI, they announced the "Stargate Project," which will build AI infrastructure in the United States.

The additional investment will be to support OpenAI's further growth in line with the Stargate project, and to incorporate the fruits of that growth into SBG's NAV (Net Asset Value: Stockholding - calculated as adjusted net interest-bearing debt).

According to both companies, in recent years, the security industry, like most industries, has become a serious labor shortage. Additionally, there was a challenge in dealing with highly specialized security services, which involves a huge cost to learn and adjust AI. Therefore, by utilizing tsuzumi, an industry-specific and lightweight LLM that can be used in a closed environment, we aim to operate an avatar that combines security and efficiency. By operating in a closed environment provided by NTT Com, visitors can safely handle information that is highly privacy and confidential. Specifically, three avatars will be installed at the pavilion "The Future of Life" at the Osaka-Kansai Expo, to respond to inquiries from visitors and provide information on areas off-limits. In addition, by summarizing the conversations between visitors and avatars in tsuzumi, it is possible to streamline the analysis of inquiry trends and report creation. The implementation period is from April 1st to October 13th. ALSOK will be responsible for central management, avatar management, and manned operators, while NTT Com will build a summary system and provide reports using tsuzumi. If the two companies can confirm the effectiveness of this initiative, they plan to apply tsuzumi to various fields of security work and promote business efficiency for the entire security industry.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple’s software design strives to be intuitive, but each iteration of iOS contains so many additions and tweaks that it's easy to miss some useful iPhone settings. Apple focused on artificial intelligence when it unveiled iOS 18 in 2024, but there's a lot under the hood that adds to the steady stream of intriguing customizations and lesser-known features from the last few years. Several helpful settings are turned off by default, and it's not immediately obvious how to switch off some annoying features. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Apple phone. How to Keep Your iPhone Updated These settings are based on the latest version of iOS 18, and should be applicable for most recent iPhones. Some settings may not be available on older devices or they may have different pathways depending on the model and the software version. Apple offers excellent software support for many years, so always make sure your device is up-to-date by heading to Settings > General > Software update. You can find the Settings app on your home screen. Here you can move icons and widgets around, remove anything you don’t want, or tap Add a Control at the bottom for a searchable list of shortcut icons and widgets you can organize across multiple Control Center screens. You can also customize your home screen with iOS 18 to change the color and size of app icons, rearrange them, and more. You know those lock screen controls that default to flashlight on the bottom left and camera on the bottom right? Tap the minus icon to remove an existing shortcut, and tap the plus icon to add a new one. While it’s good to have your screen time out for battery saving and security purposes, I find it maddening when the screen goes off while I’m doing something. The default screen time-out is too short in my opinion, but thankfully, you can adjust it. Head into Settings, Display & Brightness, and select Auto-Lock to extend it. You have several options, including Never, which means you will have to manually push the power button to turn the screen off. The iPhone’s keyboard clicking sound when you type is extremely aggravating. Go to Settings, pick Display & Brightness, and tap Dark. You may prefer to toggle on Automatic and have it change with the sun setting, but I prefer to be in Dark mode all the time. If you’re determined to squeeze as many years out of your iPhone battery as possible, consider changing the charging limit. The iPhone’s default is now Optimized Battery Charging, which waits at 80 percent and then aims to hit 100 percent when you are ready to go in the morning. Folks with an iPhone 15 Pro model or any device in the iPhone 16 range have an Action Button instead of the old mute switch. You can swipe through various basic options from Camera and Flashlight to Visual Intelligence, but select Shortcuts if you want it to do something more interesting. If you’re unfamiliar, check out our guide on How to Use the Apple Shortcuts App. Much vaunted but slightly underwhelming, Apple Intelligence isn’t fully baked yet, and we are still waiting for an improved Siri. If you prefer to keep select features on, you can find instructions in our How to Turn off Apple Intelligence guide. Whether you are embarrassed by your Candy Crush addiction or risque photos, or perhaps you’ve been using the Notes app to plan your partner’s birthday party, you can hide them from prying eyes. To protect an app, you have two options: tap and hold on the icon and select Require Face ID, then Require Face ID or Hide and Require Face ID. If you prefer to hide the app, choose the second option and then Hide App, and it will be obscured inside a Hidden folder at the bottom of your App Library that requires a Face ID check to open. It can be tough to make out the dialog in some TV shows and movies, but Apple has a fix for muffled speech on your iPhone. At an absolute minimum, you should shut up your iPhone at night so it doesn’t disturb your sleep, but Apple offers a wide range of tools to automate or schedule downtime to help you focus. You can turn off notifications but set up exceptions so that specific contacts or apps will get through. You don’t have to use Safari as your browser or Apple’s Mail app for emails. If you have valid alternative apps installed for Email, Messaging, Browser, and a few other categories, you can select them instead of Apple’s apps. You can choose to keep certain files that you have synced with iCloud stored locally on your iPhone, which is handy if you want to access them when there’s no internet available. You can tap and hold on any folder or file and select Keep Downloaded to keep a copy on your iPhone. It’s worth reviewing your app permissions and limiting them. There are a few routes to do this, but Settings, then Privacy & Security, might be the easiest. There’s a lot here, but I advise looking at Location Services and removing or reducing permissions for apps you don’t think need them. You can toggle off Precise Location for many, since an approximate location is often enough for them to function the way you want. Other apps to keep an eye on are Contacts and Photos, as both now give you the option to allow limited access. Apple offers a whole range of voices for Siri now. Go to Settings, choose Apple Intelligence & Siri, and tap Voice to see a list of variations (American, Australian, British, Indian, Irish, South African) and voices (Irish Voice 2 is my pick). Forget about typing out your whole email address every time. Tap Text Replacement and then the plus icon at the top right to set up text shortcuts, such as “eml” for your full email address, or “addy” for your mailing address. This can also work for any other text you type out frequently. Apple is all about privacy, but having to unlock your iPhone to see the content of an incoming message can be annoying. You can change how this works by going to Settings, Notifications, and selecting Show Previews. It is set to When Unlocked by default, but you can choose Always or Never. If you decide to give AI a chance and fancy generating some art with AI assistance, open up the Playground app. You can pick photos, themes, costumes, accessories, places, or type prompts. It's available on Apple devices running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2. You can turn it on or off to display dots that help reduce motion sickness, but if you tap Automatic, it will turn on when it detects you are in the car.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google’s artificial intelligence arm DeepMind has been holding back the release of its world-renowned research, as it seeks to retain a competitive edge in the race to dominate the burgeoning AI industry.

The group, led by Nobel Prize-winner Sir Demis Hassabis, has introduced a tougher vetting process and more bureaucracy that made it harder to publish studies about its work on AI, according to seven current and former research scientists at Google DeepMind.

Three former researchers said the group was most reluctant to share papers that reveal innovations that could be exploited by competitors, or cast Google’s own Gemini AI model in a negative light compared with others.

The changes represent a significant shift for DeepMind, which has long prided itself on its reputation for releasing groundbreaking papers and as a home for the best scientists building AI.

Meanwhile, huge breakthroughs by Google researchers—such as its 2017 “transformers” paper that provided the architecture behind large language models—played a central role in creating today’s boom in generative AI.

Since then, DeepMind has become a central part of its parent company’s drive to cash in on the cutting-edge technology, as investors expressed concern that the Big Tech group had ceded its early lead to the likes of ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

“I cannot imagine us putting out the transformer papers for general use now,” said one current researcher.

Among the changes in the company’s publication policies is a six-month embargo before “strategic” papers related to generative AI are released. Researchers also often need to convince several staff members of the merits of publication, said two people with knowledge of the matter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Described in a study published in the Genome Biology magazine, the new algorithm studies the behavior of proteins inside the cells, managing to predict those that have the potential to unleash neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SLA), Parkinson and Alzheimer's. This is why it represents a precious tool to help us identify molecular targets for targeted therapies. Only in Italy there are about one million people with neurodegenerative diseases, pathologies characterized by protein structures similar to balls (biomolecular condensed), such as the Parkinson's Lewy bodies, the accumulations of filaments in the ALS motorbike and the alzheimer's amyloid plaques. We know, in fact, that the ability of proteins to form balls, in conditions of good health, contributes to managing the production of other proteins and responding to situations of cell stress. But when this mechanism undergoes an alteration, this leads to the development of the disease, where protein balls are transformed into solid structures that accumulate (aggregates of solid matter) into the cells and lead them to death. "The identification of biochemical characteristics related to neurodegenerative diseases is crucial to intervene early and slowing down cognitive decay," explained Gian Gaetano Tartaglia, who coordinated the study. "We trained our system to recognize the formation of condensate, which in many cases is an initial step for the formation of toxic aggregates. A fundamental contribution to this event comes from the protein -na interaction". The robot method, explain the researchers, therefore allows you to study the influence of mutations on liquid-liquid separation: if they alter the protein -na interaction, it is likely that they also condition the formation of condensed, leading to pathological consequences. The Catgranule 2.0 Robot algorithm is part of the IVBM-4PAP international project, which aims to develop the microscope called In-Vivo Brillouin Microscope (IVBM), a tool that will serve to measure the properties of proteins and condensate within living cells, without external interventions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Don’t do an April Fools’ joke. Put the time and energy into doing something productive that will materially benefit the world (or, less idealistically, your business) instead. Or just don’t do anything. Abstaining entirely would still be a net positive over the drain of resources and mental energy.

Do an April Fools’ “joke,” but actually follow through on your stunt. This is arguably not a prank since you’ve actually created a video game skin or a real product that people can buy — but it doesn’t really hurt anyone.

Do an April Fools’ joke, but be extremely clear from the start that this is a dumb joke and you have no intention of doing the thing that you are “humorously” pretending to do. Does this defeat the purpose of doing an April Fools’ joke because you’re not “fooling” anyone anymore? Absolutely. (Please see my first two points.)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The artificial intelligence company of Elon Musk, Xai, risks being involved in a dispute linked to the name of its chatbot, Grok. It is not the first time that Musk chooses for its products a name that other companies claim to have already recorded. Last month, the entrepreneur's social media platform resolved with an agreement a cause intended by a marketing company that claimed to have the exclusive rights on the name X. Ron Shah, founder of the company, says he had the idea during a brainstorming session with a colleague, who had the habit of using the word as a verb (in the technological environments "to Grok" is often used as a synonym to "understand"). "I thought: 'It's just the right name' - Shah says to Wired US -. Two years later, when he was on the verge of launching an app for asynchronous meetings renamed Grok, Musk announced an homonymous chatbot. "It was a day that I will never forget - comments Shah -. I woke up and looked at my phone; there were a lot of messages from friends who said 'you were acquired by Elon? For me it was an absolute shock". Shah is convinced that Xai has violated his commercial brand. In the United States, however, the laws on the subject are first designed to protect consumers rather than companies, says Josh Gerben, founder of Gerben IP, a law firm that deals exclusively with brands. "The goal is not to create confusion about those who hide a product or service," he explains.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>is platforms and communities reporter with five years of experience covering the companies that shape technology and the people who use their tools. On Sunday, a few thousand people in Green Bay, Wisconsin, gathered to hear Elon Musk speak — and give away two giant cardboard checks for $1 million. Attendance at the event was limited to people who had added their names to a petition against “activist judges,” created by Musk’s America PAC. After their names were announced, winners shuffled onstage to awkwardly accept the prop checks and pause for a photo op with Musk, who has poured tens of millions of dollars into the race for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court seat. He has promised $100 to voters who sign the “activist judges petition” and micro-earnings for people who hold up a photo of Musk’s chosen candidate with a thumbs-up. This time, Musk and his America PAC are looking to tilt the close Wisconsin race toward Brad Schimel, a conservative judge and outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump. At Sunday’s event, Musk repeatedly said the checks were a gimmick to garner media coverage. The two recipients, Nicholas Jacobs and Ekaterina Diestler, supported that narrative in professionally shot videos shared to X by Musk’s America PAC. “I was in the audience and my name was called as the recipient of a check for $1 million, and I didn’t believe it. Jacobs’ affiliation with the College Republicans wasn’t disclosed onstage, and most news coverage has described Diestler simply as “a voter,” a stand-in for an average person who could experience a windfall if they sign Musk’s petitions. But Diestler is a graphic designer, according to LinkedIn, for a packaging company in the Green Bay area called Belmark Inc — which has strong ties to major Republican donors. Coupled with Jacobs’ affiliation, it raises questions about how the “spokespeople” for America PAC were selected. Belmark was founded by Bruce Bell, a major donor to Republican causes both personally and through organizations he controls. The promises to Wisconsin voters mirror what happened in swing states like Pennsylvania leading up to the election of Trump in November. In those cases, Musk first claimed America PAC would randomly offer $1 million to signatories of a petition. Then, after scrutiny about whether the sweepstakes-style gimmick was legal, Musk backtracked. Lawyers representing the super PAC told a judge that winners were not randomly selected but handpicked based on their ability to be political talking heads. Neither Belmark nor Diestler responded to The Verge’s requests for comment. The Wisconsin College Republicans also did not return a request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>German tech retailer Alternate has explained a controversial recent listing on its website for an RTX 5090 with missing ROPs. The online store confirmed has now that this GPU was part of a customer return and was never intended for sale (via ComputerBase). The first case of an RTX 50 series GPU with missing ROP units dates back to late February, with many subsequent reports to follow as awareness increased. ROPs are hardware units on your GPU responsible for pixel processing, blending, anti-aliasing, and writing to the frame buffer. Nvidia later issued a clarification asserting only 0.5% of produced RTX 5090s and RTX 5070 Tis were impacted, asking affected customers to push their respective board partners for a replacement. After it was revealed that this manufacturing defect extended to the RTX 5080 as well, testing by Gamer's Nexus showed that GPUs with a missing ROP cluster take an up to 11% performance hit while gaming. Considering the broad Blackwell shortage, retailers selling defective units with missing ROPs at a discount wouldn't be surprising. Last week, Alternate listed a "B-stock" RTX 5090 with 168 (out of 176 advertised) ROPs for €2,899 ($3,100), a price that's comparable to fully functional models. The defective RTX 5090 at Alternative was likely misclassified as B-stock in their database due to a part defect: the missing ROP units. Some internal processes run automatically where errors can happen.” Alternate to ComputerBase The GPU has now been delisted from the website, and it was apparently a customer return, likely intended for replacement. Even though street prices barely adhere to the MSRP, AIBs are continuing to increase them as we move into April. The average selling price of an RTX 5090 Founders Edition at eBay has stabilized at $4,000 but we're still likely months away from normality.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr House is one of the most beautiful series ever written but lasted too much due to the avidity of the network. After the fourth season, the quality of the show has dizzyingly dropped to the terrible eighth final vintage. To worsen things, the disagreement between the production and Lisa Edelstein, interpreter of the administrator of Princeton Plainsboro Lisa Cuddy and, at some point, also partner of the protagonist. David Shore had no idea that Lisa Edelstein was leaving the series after the producer Katie Jacobs had refused to adapt her salary to the renewal of the contract (Laurie was paid from 300 to 400 thousand dollars per episode, while the other actors was asked to accept a reduction after the decline in listening to the seventh season). Shore explained that if he had known that Cuddy would not return "during the last dozen of episodes, his farewell would take place in a different way". In fact, Cuddy disappears after House falls into the living room with the car, at the end of the seventh season, in what is one of the most criticized cliffhangers to date. In the eighth, Cuddy has already left the city after having resigned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google says it’s developed a new encryption model that, unlike the current encryption feature on Gmail, doesn’t require senders or recipients to use custom software or exchange encryption certificates. The feature is rolling out in beta starting today, and will initially be available for Google enterprise users to send encrypted emails to other Gmail users within the same organization. Google says this will expand to emails sent to any Gmail inbox “in the coming weeks,” and to inboxes from any third-party email provider “later this year.” Gmail’s current encryption feature, based on the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol, can already be used to send external emails. Doing so requires the recipient to have S/MIME configured and complete multiple steps with the sender before emails can be securely exchanged, however. The new process will allow Gmail users to simply toggle on “additional encryption” in the email draft window to send an encrypted message. Non-Gmail recipients without S/MIME will then be provided a link to sign into a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and reply to the email in a restricted version of Gmail. Emails to both business and personal Gmail accounts will be automatically decrypted in the recipient’s inbox. The encryption provided using this new system is higher than the standard Transport Layer Security Gmail uses by default on all emails, but we should note that this isn’t technically end-to-end encryption (E2EE), even if that’s what Google is calling it. The updated capability is powered by client-side encryption, which gives workspace administrators control over encryption keys, allowing them to revoke user access and “monitor user’s encrypted files,” according to Google’s help page.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rumors about an Xbox handheld have been flying around, and Asus just fanned the flames by dropping a teaser on its X (formerly Twitter) account. The video shows an animated robot programming improvements on a terminal for itself. Just as it was about to implement the changes, a device that looks like an ROG Ally X gaming console and an ROG Raikiri Pro controller fell in with the character. While neither party has revealed anything specific, the video gave us a preview of what to expect from this planned Xbox handheld. The company likely did this to avoid the teaser from being misconstrued as an April Fool’s prank, especially as many other tech companies are posting jokes of their own. However, just like its April 1 ROG Ally reveal a couple of years ago, it seems that this teased Xbox console is legit. This Asus reveal could therefore be an attempt to steal Nintendo’s thunder — and while it did not have much information, it likely caused a stir among PC gamers and handheld gaming enthusiasts. It still probably won’t sway hardcore Nintendo enthusiasts, though. We’re not expecting a new Xbox console until 2027, but the arrival of an 'Xbox handheld' will certainly be most welcome. We just hope that this will run Xbox games natively, and not just be a Windows 11 device with an Xbox skin on top of it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apparently Musk isn’t paying enough money in child support. But the Tesla CEO says he’s giving St. Clair plenty of money. “I’m selling because I need to make up for the 60% cut that Elon made to our son’s child support,” St. Clair says in the Daily Mail video. Asked why she thought Musk would do that and whether it was vindictive, St. Clair replied that it was his “modus operandi when women speak out.” The author, most famous for an anti-trans children’s book she wrote, said to “check the stocks,” a reference to Tesla’s plunging stock price, and “I’m not the only one who is cleaning up after his messes.” The video of St. Clair in front of her Tesla was posted to X by far-right influencer Laura Loomer on Monday, where she referred to St. Clair as a “gold digger and professional gaslighter.” Loomer wrote that St. Clair was “caught on camera” outside of her “ritzy Manhattan condo,” and claimed that Musk (who Loomer called her “sugar daddy), had paid for both the car and her condo. Loomer also claimed St. Clair “has hired anti-Trump lawyers to sue Elon Musk.” Gizmodo has no inside knowledge on whether any of that is true, but it’s necessary to understand the context of the shitshow conversation that would follow on the billionaire’s own social media platform. Musk replied that he doesn’t actually know if the child is his, but sort of claimed he wanted to know, even without a court-ordered paternity test. The billionaire also said he was giving St. Clair plenty of money. Despite not knowing for sure, I have given Ashley $2.5M and am sending her $500k/year,” Musk wrote. Perhaps it doesn’t in the grand scheme of things. But it does seem like an odd situation for a man whose worldview is so defined by having as many children as possible. And he wields enormous power, not just through his private companies like Tesla and SpaceX, but by dismantling the federal government, as he’s currently doing now with DOGE. It’s with that gigantic platform and incredible amount of power that Musk is advancing an agenda based on people having as many kids as possible. The billionaire oligarch believes that everyone should just procreate frequently, circumstances be damned, but doesn’t seem to care about the conservative principle behind the traditional Republican idea of having kids: Supporting them financially and emotionally. St. Clair has made Musk out to be a deadbeat father. And, again, it’s hard for an outsider to judge something like that. But it doesn’t seem to be in dispute that Musk’s many children (14 that we know of) don’t really get the attention they deserve. And that’s to say nothing of Musk’s estrangement from his trans daughter Vivian, who says he wasn’t around much. Musk has publicly referred to her as “dead,” a brutally cruel thing to say about one of your own children just because they came out as trans. And Ms. St. Clair doesn’t seem to think that’s happening right now with their son.</p>

Live Captions will also translate from 27 languages into Simplified Chinese (Image credit: Microsoft) Microsoft says that this feature “offers real-time translations in English for audio and video content during virtual meetings, podcasts, or video playback.” This feature, which Microsoft claims can live translate from 40 languages to English, has been around a while for SDX PCs, and is “coming soon” for those with a Ryzen AI 300 or Ultra 200V PC. Another new Copilot+ addition which Microsoft characterizes as an accessibility feature is rolling out to Qualcomm SDX machines soon. Voice Access delivers better descriptive and flexible language interaction with Windows. Cocreator in Paint is now ready for modern AMD and Intel processor owners. Here, Microsoft’s AI can help you create imagery from prompts or analyzing and improving on your badly drawn scrawl. Image Creator does what it says from your simple, or complex, text prompts. Remember, the expanded feature rollout availability will also vary based on your location and language selection. Considering x86 PCs with NPU-packing processors have been available for months, Microsoft has been rather tardy in breaking its most attractive Copilot+ features out from their Qualcomm-only rut. According to our editor-in-chief, you all haven’t been missing much, though.</p>

Gmail is 21 years old today and for its birthday present it wants to give the gift of easier encryption for all. This is a service that’s aimed at companies in regulated industries to more easily encrypt their emails, no matter the recipient. Currently this requires significant resources, involving proprietary solutions and getting into the complexities of Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. Now, with this new offering, companies simply need Client Side Encryption on their supported Workspace Enterprise Plus setup with Assured Controls add-on in place. Once all the above is setup at the enterprise level it’s a simple process to get encryption turned on for Gmail. This, it says, will allow you to, “protect sensitive information and comply with company policies.” If the encrypted emails are sent to other Gmail enterprise or personal users the messages are automatically decrypted to read right away. If the recipient is using another email service provider they will be sent a link to “view the E2EE email in a restricted version of Gmail.” The sets them up with a guest Google Workspace account to view and reply to the email. This should roll out to any Gmail inbox in the coming weeks, with further expansion to other email accounts later in the year.</p>

We’ll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we’ll take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder. A long-time reader and subscriber recently mentioned in the Ars Forums that they "kind of" missed the Daily Telescope posts that I used to write in 2023 and 2024. Although I would have preferred that everyone desperately missed the Daily Telescope, I appreciate the sentiment. I initially stopped writing these posts about a year ago because it just became too much to commit to writing one thing every day. But doing so on the daily crossed over the line from enjoyable to drudgery, and one of the best things about working for Ars is that it tends very much toward the enjoyable side. Anyway, writing one of these posts on a weekly basis feels more sustainable. Today's image comes to you all the way from Mars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google updated Gmail for its' Workspace customers adding end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging. “We’ve invented an entirely new type of encryption,” said Google Workspace Senior Product Manager Johney Burke and Product Manager Julien Duplant in an email to SC Media. This new encryption scheme aims to remove the complexity and implementation challenges of traditional E2EE models such as Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), which requires both the sender and recipient to have S/MIME enabled. “Alternatives to S/MIME, such as encryption features from email providers or proprietary point solutions, present significant drawbacks as well: the former requires sharing encryption keys, increasing data privacy and sovereignty risks, while the latter complicates end user experiences with custom applications, portals and browser extensions,” Google said. Google explained that its new feature, launched on Gmail’s 21birthday, will allow enterprise Gmail users to send E2EE encrypted emails to any inbox without overly complicated processes. The feature is driven by client-side encryption, meaning data is encrypted prior to transmission or storage by Google, restricting access solely to the sender and recipient. "Google's announcement marks an important step in making client-side encryption more accessible to enterprise Gmail users. While the underlying encryption capability has existed for some time, the general availability helps streamline adoption for regulated industries and privacy-conscious organizations," said Piotr Wojtyla, head of threat intelligence at Abnormal Security, in an email to SC Media. Emails from an enterprise Gmail account to any other Gmail account (including personal accounts) will automatically be encrypted and then decrypted in the recipient’s inbox, Google explained, while emails to recipients who have S/MIME will be encrypted and decrypted via S/MIME. SlashNext Email Security+ Field CTO J Stephen Kowski told SC Media that E2EE offerings like Gmail's may create a false sense of security, as humans continue to be the "weakest link" when it comes to email protection. "Just like we saw with the Signal-related breach , which was 100 E2EE, we found that perfect encryption doesn't protect against users making mistakes or falling for social engineering tricks," Kowski noted. Microsoft Outlook includes E2EE via S/MIME and Microsoft Purview Message Encryption , the latter of which, similar to Gmail’s new feature, allows non-Outlook users to open encrypted emails in a dedicated portal. According to the latest information available from Microsoft , Microsoft manages the root key for Microsoft Purview Information Protection, formerly Azure Information Protection, by default, but offers a “bring your own key” option that can be set up by the user. Sectigo Senior Fellow Jason Soroko noted, in an email to SC Media, that client-side encryption "is only as secure as the environment in which it's used" and requires organizations to ensure they can properly protect their encryption keys.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On April 1st, KDDI began offering "RCS" (Rich Communication Services) to iPhone users.

RCS is, so to speak, an enhanced version of SMS. You can exchange large-capacity content such as photos and videos using just your phone number.

To use it, you will need to update to iOS 18.4, turn on the RCS switch and apply for the RCS option.

RCS is a globally standardized messaging service by GSMA, an industry association for mobile communications operators, and can also send and receive large files between Android and iPhone.

Meanwhile, carriers are required to use it on iPhones, and KDDI is the first domestic carrier to start offering RCS on iPhones. However, if other carriers do not respond, it will not become a general messaging service, so trends in other carriers are also being watched.

Matsuda Hiroji, CEO and CEO of KDDI, commented, "KDDI supports efforts to expand the spread of RCS and will further promote the appeal of messaging services. GSMA is working with domestic and international partners to promote standardized RCS specifications globally."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite a fundamental difference in direction that led Anthropic's founders to quit OpenAI in 2020 and later create the Claude AI assistant, a shared technical hurdle has now brought them together: How to easily connect their AI models to external data sources. The solution comes from Anthropic, which developed and released an open specification called Model Context Protocol (MCP) in November 2024. MCP establishes a royalty-free protocol that allows AI models to connect with outside data sources and services without requiring unique integrations for each service. The analogy is imperfect, but it represents the idea that, similar to how USB-C unified various cables and ports (with admittedly a debatable level of success), MCP aims to standardize how AI models connect to the infoscape around them. So far, MCP has also garnered interest from multiple tech companies in a rare show of cross-platform collaboration. For example, Microsoft has integrated MCP into its Azure OpenAI service, and as we mentioned above, Anthropic competitor OpenAI is on board. Last week, OpenAI acknowledged MCP in its Agents API documentation, with vocal support from the boss upstairs. "People love MCP and we are excited to add support across our products," wrote OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on X last Wednesday. MCP has also rapidly begun to gain community support in recent months. For example, just browsing this list of over 300 open source servers shared on GitHub reveals growing interest in standardizing AI-to-tool connections.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is expected to bolster its "healthcare" apps with AI doctors, or health coaches that incorporate them into its mobile devices. According to Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the initiative is known as "Project Mulberry," and could be released as early as 2026 in a future version of iOS. It provides advice on eating habits and exercise methods, and is said to utilize data collected from iPhones and Apple Watches. It is already known that Apple CEO Tim Cook is aiming to strengthen its healthcare-related technology. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It is not clear whether the company's efforts will become a medical resource with diagnostic capabilities, as Bloomberg reports suggests, or it will be positioned as a virtual advisor to health and wellness. According to Bloomberg, the AI ​​agent is trained with data from real physicians and could include content from doctors and health experts. As Mayo Clinic reports, combining AI with healthcare has great potential, especially in terms of preventive medicine and risk assessment, but risks have also been pointed out. In December 2024, ECRI, a non-profit medical research organization, published a report cited AI as the biggest risk factor for healthcare in 2025. The report acknowledges that AI could change healthcare for the better, but warns that inaccurate or misleading AI responses and AI products that do not work as expected can be potentially dangerous to the healthcare industry.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But there’s also a qudit, a different way of storing and making use of quantum information. Gizmodo spoke to Christine Muschik, a quantum researcher at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the University of Waterloo, Ontario, about the computational unit, which could capitalize on a key tenet of quantum systems to do more complicated computing than classical computers are capable of. Muschik’s team published research last week in Nature Physics that they say “open the door for hardware-efficient quantum simulations of gauge theories with qudits in near-term quantum devices.” Muschik’s new paper comes on the heels of a 2021 paper on the same subject, published in PRX Quantum. Below is our conversation, lightly edited for clarity. Isaac Schultz, Gizmodo: I realize you have this new paper out, but maybe first we can just talk about the term qudit, and what the heck it means. Step number one is, of course, that we think quantum computers have an opportunity to be more powerful. But once we are on the route of harnessing quantum, what is the most efficient way to do that? The field was very much inspired by how regular computers work, because in regular computers, you have zeros and ones, and you can do logical operations on that. How most quantum computers work is you also take zeros and ones, only you add your bit of quantum to it. Now you have qudits, with a ‘D’—because why do we stop at two levels? But what happens if we don’t ignore all the other states, but we encode information [in them]? Gizmodo: If you treat each one of those as a different way of encoding information, it sounds like you could encode exponentially more information. Gizmodo: How does that change the operation of a quantum computer? Christine Muschik: There’s a price to pay, and then there’s the reward that we reap. The most important thing is that your circuit complexity shrinks. We’re in the business of designing logical circuits, and what hinders my team and me all the freaking time is that if the circuit gets too long, that’s our bottleneck. Quantum computers are not ever corrected, and every time you make an operation, you introduce a bit of noise. That’s our headache, and why we don’t sleep properly. What we realized with these qudits is that, because information is manipulated so efficiently, it’s like you’re putting your circuit on a diet. Gizmodo: Now we’re really touching on the research—could you speak to your team’s latest paper and exactly what you found? How did it move the needle on this idea? Christine Muschik: My team had this dream that we wanted to simulate fundamental particle interaction—that’s actually what I got my job for, to simulate fundamental particle interactions. But it’s really hard to do on a quantum computer. We had this dream of fundamental particle interactions and this other team was in the business of building a qudit quantum computer. I would argue our outcomes moved the needle two-fold. But accidentally, we also accomplished something else: the first full qudit algorithm. Gizmodo: I was going to ask you about applications now that, now that you’ve derived this. Christine Muschik: The obvious thing is in particle physics, where you can simulate many things. But then there are also other problems you can simulate, like in materials science, and chemistries you can simulate. It’s also extremely useful in quantum enthusiasts’ notion of the quantum internet that people try to build. You can make information more secure in quantum communication. We realized all these things last year in summer in a joint workshop at the Institute of Quantum Computing and the Perimeter Institute, where we brought together experimental people, theorists, and users. This week we started to write a perspectives paper, because we want to make a roadmap of how qudits can be useful in different areas of quantum technology. There’s so much to figure out. Gizmodo: How do these simulations and kinds of theoretical frameworks marry with real world experimentation that’s going on at places like CERN, at LCLS—places where they are colliding particles and looking at such subatomic interactions? Christine Muschik: All our quantum computers are, like, really proof of concept. We cannot even outperform my laptop. For a while classical computers will be well ahead [of quantum computers], but eventually they will hit a roadblock. But once we build [a quantum computer] there’s nothing blocking it. There are particle collisions at CERN—the quantum computer, hopefully based on qudits—that can make a prediction for the collision and you can compare that to the experiments. For instance, we simulate particle-particle pair creation, which is something we cannot see in experiments just yet. In the future, there will be experiments that rip particle-antiparticle pairs in QED out of the vacuum, and so we want to compare to that experiment. But there are some problems where the classical computer is so good, there’s no reason to build an expensive quantum computer for it. Gizmodo: You mentioned that qudits should be in the game when we’re talking about particle collisions. Some people think that qubits and qudits would be competitors, but we had one quantum computer whose register was comprised of both. I call it a seamless merging opportunity—you can really plug and play according to what you need. Gizmodo: What specifically are their synergies, and what kind of questions are better explored using qubits versus qudits and vice versa? Christine Muschik: In our example, we have a gauge theory—just a fundamental particle interaction—and it has two fundamental ingredients. One ingredient is matter—in our case, we had electrons and positrons. It turns out there’s a very natural description in terms of qubits for an electron and positron, so we leave that to qubits. But force fields—what some call quantum gauge bosons—naturally have many different levels. We could get a lot more efficiency using qudits for that. What does this mean for quantum physics more generally? But next we want to include quarks and gluons. A few weeks ago we dove into quantum sensing with qudits. If you could have this [qudit] efficiency but also error correction on top of that, then you’d really be in business.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For example, iPhone users can click on the "Data Protection & Security" tab and then go to the location services. It is best to configure the apps so that they have to ask first before you can use a location or that the location may only be used while the app is open. It is a little different with Android phones. As a rule, however, the location symbol can be typed in the settings and switched on or off for all or individual apps. Apple also has further options to reduce tracking by third -party providers. In the "Data Protection & Security" setting, there is a switch on the "Tracking" tab that can be used to allow or reject the request for tracking. If this option is deactivated, new app requests are automatically rejected. Data protection experts recommend blocking the internal ad identification of Google or Apple devices. On newer Android smartphones you also go to the data protection settings and then to advertisements where you should delete the advertising ID. Regardless of whether it is an Android or Apple device, both have the possibility to be able to precisely determine the location of the device. This means that the mobile device can precisely determine the location-even if, for example, there is no GPS signal within a building. If you don't want an app to access this information, you should only release the general location information. To do this, the setting "location accuracy" is deactivated on Android smartphones and on the iPhone you switch on or off this feature for each individual app. Popular smartphone browsers such as Safari or Chrome can also reveal the location of a mobile phone. This can be avoided by using other browsers such as Duckduckgo, Firefox Focus or Ecosia. In the event that you have to access the location via an IP address, these data protection-oriented browsers will request a location approval and do not fall back on it. Telefone or tablets can be searched for with the functions "Find My" by Apple or "Find My Device" from Google.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GlobalFoundries is mulling a possible merger with Taiwanese semiconductor producer United Microelectronics Corp. to strengthen their shared role in making chips using mature and specialty process technologies, according to an assessment document reviewed by Tom's Hardware. The document outlines plans for 'Project Ultron,' which is meant to create a powerhouse controlling a significant share of the global production of chips. However, the plan will likely face major financial, political, and regulatory challenges. UMC has denied involvement, saying it is not currently conducting a merger. SMIC has become a much bigger competitor than it was seven or eight years ago, and China has invested tens of billions of dollars into fabs that use mature process technologies. Tim Breen, named GlobalFoundries's next chief executive in February, will take over in April and is considering acquiring UMC, one of GF's main rivals. Combining two major foundries would create a stronger competitor in the mature-node segment (e.g., 28nm and above), essential for automotive, industrial, and legacy applications. The combined company is expected to control around 28% of the mainstream node foundry revenue, and a greater scale would enable better pricing power, operational efficiency, and stronger negotiating leverage with customers. Also, UMC and GF have different but complementary customer sets, so a merger could enable cross-selling, better utilization of fabs, and more diversified revenue streams, reducing business risks. Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Also, UMC is heavily concentrated in Taiwan, while GF operates fabs in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore, so a merger would spread geographic risk, reduce reliance on Taiwan, and appeal to customers and governments looking for supply chain resilience. Taiwan would still lead with 40% of capacity (UMC), followed by Singapore with 25% (shared by both), and smaller shares in China (11%), Germany (9%), the USA (9%), and Japan (6%). Last but not least, GlobalFoundries – UMC will have the scale to develop new 'single-digit nanometer' process technologies, which will open doors to new applications and design wins for the combined company, according to the document. While the idea for GlobalFoundries to acquire UMC is an ambitious project that has a lot of rationale, it will be hard to accomplish. GF does not have the cash to acquire UMC now, so it will either have to take on debt, issue more shares, or ask its main investor, Mubadala, for cash. However, even if funding is secured, regulatory barriers could prevent the transaction from happening. If GlobalFoundries were to take control after a deal, that outcome would likely be opposed by the Taiwanese government. Chinese approval could be hard to obtain too as the new entity will be a tough rival for Chinese mature nodes fabs.</p>

The writing tool that helps you write works on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS in general, and can be used in a wide range of apps from emails, messages, memos, and other companies. "Rewrite" allows you to adjust the textual expression, while "proofreading" allows you to check the grammar and structure. The Summary feature allows you to shorten or list selected text. The Photos app now has natural language search, allowing you to search for photos and videos using specified keywords. Cleanup (Google's Eraser Magic function) will erase unnecessary objects and automatically generate movies from the descriptions entered using the memory function. Image Playground, an image generation tool, allows you to easily generate images in three styles: animation, illustration, and sketch. Furthermore, "Gen Characters" allows you to use the generated AI to generate emojis that suit your taste. The email app will prepare a "priority message" and display highly important emails at the top of your inbox. The AI-generated platform enables natural dialogue and allows for smooth switching between voice and text input. A "visual intelligence" function has also been implemented, in which AI explains the objects captured on the camera. When you show the object you want to know with a camera and ask, "What is this?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In addition to weight loss, intermittent fasting has a wide range of effects on our body. Among these, now, there could also be the increase in sexual desire. "Our goal is to obtain information that could also be relevant for humans." In particular, the study involved a group of male mice, starting from 2 months of age, subjected to a specific intermittent fasting model: they were allowed to feed for 24 hours, then followed by another 24 hours in which they had access only to the water. Only at the end of the fasting regime, for a group that lasted 22 months, for another 6 months and for another even a few weeks, male mice came into contact with females. "It's a matter of behavior," said the expert. "In other words, these animals had an unusually high frequency of coupling and, consequently, an unusually high number of offspring for their age. Their mating behavior compensated more than widely the physiological limitations related to age." The greatest sexual activity was also observed in younger male mice, which had followed fasting for 6 months, but was completely absent in other groups of mice, both young and old, who had followed him for a few weeks. "In order for intermittent fasting to increase Libido, it takes some time," explained the co-author Yu Zhou. "Based on our experiments, the minimum duration seems to be between 6 weeks and 6 months". Triptofano is responsible for production in the brain of serotonin, neurotransmitter generally associated with inhibitory effects, which was present in male mice at unusually low levels. "The mice were, so to speak, sexually uninhibited," commented Ehninger. At the moment, however, "it is not clear whether the reduction of serotonin levels is connected to our specific diet or would also occur with other types of fasting", added Zhou, suggesting that the effect could also occur in a diet where food is always available, but in reduced quantities. "This applies in particular for serotonin," explained Ehninger. "I consider it very plausible that sexual desire in humans can be influenced by fasting, perhaps not only in men, but also in women, since serotonin also affects their libido", concluded the expert, according to which, although they serve further research, intermittent fasting could potentially be added to the treatments already available to treat the unwanted drop in libido.</p>

Rufus can remove Microsoft account requirements when installing Windows from an ISO image file and automatically create a local account with a specific username. Exchanges between Microsoft and local accounts have been going on for years, and there has been a never-ending battle in which someone will find a new workaround and the company will ban it if Microsoft removes it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI, the creator of the popular interactive AI "ChatGPT," is building a new AI model. The model will become an "openweight" language model with inference capabilities, CEO Sam Altman revealed on social media X. It is expected to be released in the next few months. The weights, which are coefficients of AI models, are published, so they can be modified without retraining using new data. These models are often relatively inexpensive and are available to companies, providing a high degree of freedom in customization. For example, if a company uploads its internal documents to an existing open weight model, the information can be reflected in the results without having to recreate the entire model from scratch. As the name suggests, open source models also reveal the source code, as well as how the models are learned and how their weights are set. Considering that OpenAI has not previously published the data used to learn ChatGPT, it is likely that even this new open weight model will only contain some of the information published. OpenAI is looking for developer feedback to make the new open-weight model maximally useful. Interested people can apply to participate in a feedback session using the form on the OpenAI website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly essential for business operations and consumer products, businesses are expected to spend significantly on artificial AI. Gartner's latest forecasts show that this high-profile AI sector spending totaled $644 billion worldwide in 2025, an increase of 76.4% compared to 2024. However, the current generation AI is still in its early stages and suffers from the problems of many defects and errors. A classic example is that AI tends to cause halcinations and generate inaccurate, inappropriate, or misleading answers. As a result, many chief information officers and technology executives are disappointed by the high frequency of AI making mistakes. Still, the future prospects of generating AI means AI providers and other companies continue to invest huge amounts in the technology. So where do businesses put their time, effort and money? "As 2024 ambitious internal projects will be rigorously vetted in 2025, as CIOs will choose commercial off-the-shelf solutions for feasibility and high business value," he said, "Even as models continue to improve, CIOs will be able to reduce proof of concept (PoC) and in-house development efforts, and instead focus on the capabilities of the generated AI provided by existing software providers." Approximately 80% of the expected increase in AI-related spending will be spent exclusively on incorporating AI into existing hardware such as servers, PCs and smartphones. Gartner also mentions the further distant future, saying manufacturers will be able to incorporate AI capabilities into more and more devices. "Whether or not the market will get back on track will depend heavily on the increasing adoption of AI-enabled devices, and by 2028, AI-enabled devices will likely be able to make almost all of the consumer device market," Lovelock said, noting that "but consumers aren't looking for these features.</p>

A rising trend of techno-fascism driven by populism and artificial intelligence has been visible since the US presidential election in November. Nexus, which was published just a few months earlier, is a timely explainer of the potential consequences of AI on democracy and totalitarianism. In the book, Harari does not just sound the alarm on singularity—the hypothetical future point at which technology, particularly AI, moves beyond human control and advances irreversibly on its own—but also on AI’s foreignness. This interview was conducted by Michiaki Matsushima, editor in chief of WIRED Japan, and was also recorded for “The Big Interview” YouTube series for the Japanese edition of WIRED, scheduled to be released in April 2025. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. WIRED: In the late ’90s, when the internet began to spread, there was a discourse that this would bring about world peace. WIRED, which has been a voice of change and hope in the digital age, was part of that thinking at the time. In your new book, Nexus, you write that such a view of information is too naive. YUVAL NOAH HARARI: Information is not the same as truth. Most information is not an accurate representation of reality. Sometimes people are connected by truth, but often it is easier to use fiction or illusion. DNA connects many cells together to make a body, but it does not tell us the truth about anything. This is because there are three main difficulties with truth. First of all, telling the truth is costly. On the other hand, creating fiction is inexpensive. If you want to write a truthful account of history, economics, physics, et cetera, you need to invest time, effort, and money in gathering evidence and fact-checking.</p>

The changes currently being deployed for Windows 11 Insiders make the BSOD error screen simpler and more refined. In an announcement regarding the latest Windows 11 Insider build, the company states: "We're previewing a new, simpler UI for unexpected reboots. BSOD errors are caused by fatal system errors or crashes, often due to hardware or driver conflicts. A typical BSOD error will tell your PC that there is a problem and present two-dimensional code that identifies the cause of the conflict and shows you how to troubleshoot the problem. According to Windows Latest analysis, the new screen is based on the black color that is seen when updating Windows. The screen previewed by Windows Insider is green. Recently, Microsoft has been focusing on making various screens look simpler and more unified. Most of the design changes have been deployed to Windows Insiders using Windows 11 24H2 on the Beta, Dev and Canary channels. Microsoft has not stated when these changes will be applied to the Windows 11 production version. Some may be gradually rolled out over several months, but it may not be applicable until the official release of Windows 11 25H2 in the second half of 2025.</p>

ChatGPT’s latest image generator — which has gone viral for its ability to generate uncanny recreations of Studio Ghibli art — is now available for everyone, after OpenAI initially delayed the rollout beyond its paid tiers following heavy demand.

CEO Sam Altman announced on X that the image generation update has “now rolled out to all free users.” There are usage limits, though ChatGPT itself doesn’t elaborate — saying only that free users have “limited access” to image generation. Altman has previously posted that the free tier would get three image generations a day, however, and that’s exactly what the tool allowed before telling me to pay up.

Powered by the company’s GPT-4o model, the updated image generation initially launched on March 25th, and was always planned to be available across the ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Free subscription tiers. The free rollout was delayed just a day after launch, as Altman joked that “our GPUs are melting” following high demand. At one point ChatGPT picked up a million new users in a single hour.

Yesterday OpenAI completed a new funding round that saw it raise another $40 billion, the largest funding round for a private tech company in history, leaving the company now valued at $300 billion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On March 29th, US time, Google announced that it has released the "most intelligent" AI model, the Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental), which it announced on the 25th, to all users. Gemini 2.5 is a thinking model that allows you to infer through thought before responding, following the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model that appeared in December. HLE is a benchmark test recently developed to address "benchmark saturation," which makes industry testing problems too easy for fast-evolving models. Therefore, although it is a relatively difficult test to achieve excellent results, the Gemini 2.5 scored 18.8%, exceeding the o3-mini 14% (there is only text and no images) and the Claude 3.7 Sonnet 8.9%. Gemini 2.5 has already won the top spot on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard and surpasses competing models in general benchmarks in science, mathematics and coding. However, although the difference is generally small, considering the speed at which new models evolve, it can be said to be within the scope of our predictions. Google reports that Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) has improved in inference, multimodal and agent functions, even if there is only a "one-line prompt." In a post on X, Google said it would deploy "Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental)" to all users "rate-limited." It is said to be compatible with mobile devices soon. It is said that "Gemini Advanced" users will be provided with a larger context window and extended access.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>筆者がディナーパーティで写真を撮ろうとしていると、友人が「またそのスポンジ・ボブみたいなスマホを持ってきたの？」と話しかけてきた。私はそれに、「どちらかと言えばミニオンっぽいと思ってるんだけど、その例えもなかなかいいね」と笑顔で応じた。

友人が話題にしたのは、小米科技（シャオミ）のサブブランドであるPOCOが最近発売した、鮮やかなイエローのミッドレンジスマートフォン「POCO F7 Ultra」のことだ。POCO F7 Ultraは、最小構成の価格が649ドル（日本では税込9万9800円）のモデルだが、その中身は見た目以上に尖っている。プロセッサーはQualcommの「Snapdragon 8 Elite」、バッテリー容量も5300mAhと大容量で、さらにInstagramへの投稿にも使える高品質な写真が撮れるトリプルリアカメラシステムを備えている。

そのスペックは、それだけでも十分に特筆に値するものだ。特にSnapdragon 8 Eliteを搭載しているという点では、サムスンの「Galaxy S25」シリーズや「OnePlus 13」、「Xiaomi 15 Ultra」などのハイエンドモデルと肩を並べている。では、F7 Ultraの性能はそれらのお高いモデルに匹敵するものなのだろうか。それとも、その安さには大いなる妥協が伴うのだろうか。

筆者は、実際にF7 Ultraを2週間ほど使って、その使い勝手を確かめてみた。その間、友人や花の写真を撮ったり、テレビ番組をストリーミングしたりしただけでなく、逆ワイヤレス充電機能で外出中にiPhoneの充電に使ったりもした（この見た目が印象的なスマートフォンは、この機能のおかげで頼れる相棒になってくれた）。

POCO F7 Ultra本体とディスプレイ

全体として言えば、POCO F7 Ultraは丸い角とフレームギリギリまで広がるディスプレイを持つ、なめらかな仕上げの洗練されたスマートフォンだ。そのサイズは「iPhone 16 Pro Max」と同じくらい（それよりはやや小さいが）で、筆者の手の大きさにぴったりだった。

画面はサイズが6.67インチで120MHzのAMOLEDディスプレイで、ピーク輝度は3200ニトとなっている。この数字は、iPhone 16シリーズの2000ニトやGalaxy S25の2600ニトは上回っているが、OnePlus 13の4500ニトには及ばない。屋内ではPOCOとサムスンのディスプレイは同じくらい鮮明に見えるが、明るい日差しの下ではF7 Ultraの明るさが際立つ。また、POCO F7 Ultraのディスプレイは、他社のフラッグシップモデルと同じように常時点灯しているため、いつでも時刻や通知を盗み見ることができる。

筆者が特に嬉しく感じたのは、F7 Ultraのベゼルが細く、ストリーミングやソーシャルメディアを楽しむ時の没入感が高いことだ。動画の色彩はiPhoneやGalaxyシリーズよりも抑えめになっており、そこに映る物体や人物の顔はやや色温度が高く、鮮やかさに欠ける。しかし、映像のシャープさに不足はない。

重量は212gと若干重めだが、それがかえって、しっかりと作られたプレミアムなデバイスだと感じさせる要因になっている（F7 Ultraの重量はOnePlus 13とほぼ同じで、Galaxy S25 Ultra、iPhone 16 Pro Maxよりも軽い）。ガラス製の背面カバーと金属の側面フレームは、高級感のあるマットな仕上げになっており、滑りにくい。アルミ製のリングで囲まれたカメラモジュールは背面から出っ張っているが、邪魔に感じるほどではなく、ケースを付けずに机の上に置いてもそれほどがたつかない。

また同社によれば、デバイスの前面は強固な画面保護ガラスである「POCO Shield Glass」で覆われている。実際にディスプレイをタップしたり押したりした際にも、頑丈さが感じられた。幸いなことに、これまでのところ、デバイスを落としてしまった場合にこの保護ガラスがどうなるかをテストする機会はなかった。少なくとも、このデバイスをケースや画面保護フィルムを付けずに何日もバックパックに放り込んで使っていても、傷一つ付かなかった。POCO F7 UltraはIP68等級の防塵・防水性能を備えているが、幸運にも、まだその性能を試すような事態には遭遇していない。

POCO F7 Ultraのカラーバリエーションには、イエロー以外に、もっと落ち着いたブラックも存在する。筆者が個人的に選ぶとすればブラックだが、大胆なデザインが好きで、イエローの方が好みだという人もいるだろう。

POCO F7 Ultraの性能とバッテリー

POCO F7 Ultraの最大の特徴はSnapdragon 8 Eliteを搭載していることであり、その価格に期待される水準を大幅に上回る、目覚ましい性能を発揮する。このプロセッサーは、F7 Ultraよりもずっと高価なGalaxy S25シリーズやOnePlus 13、「Oppo Find N5」などにも採用されており、それらのモデルの性能を大きく引き上げた。

F7 Ultraでアプリをスワイプして切り替えるときの感触は快適かつスムーズだ。ディスプレイに内蔵されている超音波指紋センサーを使ったロック解除も速やかで、ラグはまったく感じないし、カメラもほぼ瞬時に起動できる。ただし、動画をストリーミングする際や、横方向から縦方向、あるいはその逆に画面の向きを切り替える際には若干のラグが生じるし、YouTubeやNetflixをスワイプしてピクチャー・イン・ピクチャーモードに切り替えたりするのにも若干時間がかかる。それを除けば、マルチタスクはスムーズに行える。

GPUとマルチコアCPUのベンチマークテストである「Geekbench 6」では、POCO F7 Ultraは「Galaxy S24 Ultra」や「POCO X6 Pro」よりも上だ。「3DMark Wild Life Extreme」を使ったグラフィックスのテストでも、iPhone 15 Pro、Galaxy S24 Ultra、「Xiaomi 14」を上回った。詳しいデータについては以下のグラフを見てほしい。

F7 Ultraのもう1つの大きな特徴は、5300mAhのバッテリーを積んでおり、120Wの超高速充電と50Wのワイヤレス充電に対応していることだ。これだけ容量があれば、1回の充電で1日中使ってもおつりが来る。また、ワイヤレス逆充電（ワイヤレス充電対応のデバイスをPOCO F7 Ultraから充電できる機能）は非常にありがたい機能で、筆者の場合、外出先で他のスマートフォンを充電する必要ができた時に（移動が多い記者にはよく起きる問題だ）助けられた。

ストリーミング、ソーシャルメディアの閲覧、ビデオ通話への参加、ゲームなどを組み合わせた45分間の耐久テストでは、バッテリーが満充電から97％まで低下した。これは「OnePlus 13R」と同じ成績で、2025年に入ってから最高の結果だ。YouTubeの動画を全画面モードで、最大輝度にしてWi-Fi経由で再生する3時間のストリーミングテストでは、バッテリーは100％から87％に低下した。また充電テストでは、なんと30分間で0％から90％まで充電でき、満充電までにかかった時間はわずか35分強だった。

POCO F7 UltraにはAndroid 15が搭載されており、RAMが12GB、内蔵ストレージが256GBのモデルが649ドル（日本では9万9980円）、RAMが16GB、ストレージが512GBのモデルが699ドル（同10万9800円）となっている。

POCO F7 Ultraのカメラ

続いて、スマートフォンを購入する人の多くが重視しているカメラに話を移そう。POCO F7 Ultraには、5000万画素のメインカメラ、5000万画素の2.5倍望遠カメラ、3200万画素の超広角カメラ、そして3200万画素の前面カメラが搭載されている。

一般に、F7 Ultraの写真は色が柔らかで、色調は抑えめになる。友人のDanaをポートレートモードで撮った以下の写真がその好例だ。全体的にベージュがかった色調が彼女の衣装を引き立て、写真全体に落ち着いた印象を与えている。筆者は、前面の友人が非常に鮮明に写っており、背景に穏やかなボケ効果が入っているところが気に入っている。

自撮り写真も同じように色調はソフトで落ち着いた感じになるが、その代わり肌が美しく滑らかに見える。それはポートレートモードで撮った自撮り写真についても同じで、こちらもしっかり被写体にピントが合っている。

筆者はもう少し色彩が鮮やかな写真が好みなのだが、特に屋外では、F7 Ultraのカメラでもそのような写真が撮れる場合がある。小鳥用の水盤を写した以下の写真では、石材の色や、花びらの明るいピンクや、背景の鮮やかな緑が織り成す幅広い色相が、よりパンチの効いた色合いで表現されている。白い花の花びらは少しぼやけて境界が分かりにくくなってしまっているが、それ以外の部分は、石もレンガもくっきりと写っていることが分かるだろう。

F7 Ultraの5倍ズームでは、シャープネスと鮮明さがしっかりと保たれている。次のチューリップの画像を見てもらえば、花びら一枚一枚に入っている細い線などの細かい部分まではっきり写っていることが見て取れるはずだ。この写真の色彩は特に鮮やかだが、その代償として背景の陰影も強くなってしまっている。ユーザーは、そうした欠点も含めて、どちらの色調がいいかを自分で選択するしかない。

F7 Ultraのカメラが苦手とする場面もある。例えば、昼下がりに強い日差しの中で撮影した次の写真は、かなり白飛びしてしまっている。ただし幸いなことに、これは例外的なケースだった。

筆者が特に感心したのは夜の写真だ。このトルコランプの写真は、真っ暗闇に近い中で撮影したものだが、鮮明でクリアに写っており、模様の色の違いも判別できる。

AIで写真から不要なもの削除する機能を使えば、タップ2回で邪魔なものを消すことができるのだが、この機能は完璧ではない（これは、他社の同様の機能にも言えることだ）。何かを消す処理に数秒間かかるだけでなく、以下の写真で「人間を消す」オプションを選んだケースでは、人間が立っていた部分がぼやけた感じになった。トートバッグの残骸も残っており、筆者は再度これを手動で消す必要があった。

総じて言えば、これらの写真のほとんどはソーシャルメディアへの投稿に相応しいものだった。これは、筆者としてはかなり高い評価のつもりだ。

POCO F7 Ultraはどんな人向け？

POCO F7 Ultraは、価格の割には機能が充実したスマートフォンで、処理性能が非常に高く、充電速度も驚異的で、総合的なプレミアム感も備えている。これらの特徴は、同価格帯の「Galaxy S24 FE」やOnePlus 13Rなどとは一線を画すものだ。ディスプレイのシャープさや、一般的なラグや、一部のカメラ機能に多少の弱点があるが、長所が短所を大きく上回っている（重量に関してはもう少し軽ければよいとは思うが、購入をためらうほどの問題ではない）。

大金を払うことはできないが、処理能力、バッテリー容量、カメラが優れているスマートフォンを探しているという人なら、POCO F7 Ultraは魅力的な選択肢に感じられるだろう。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is completely reviewing its sign-in screen to make it easier to authenticate your account using passwordless methods, including passkeys. Robin Goldstein, partner director of product management for the cloud identity service Microsoft Identity, explained in a blog post dated March 27th, that the new sign-in process will be displayed on services such as Outlook, Xbox, Windows, and Microsoft 365. The new screen will start to appear on Xbox in March and will be rolled out sequentially until the end of April. At that point, over 3 billion Microsoft users around the world will see improved processes when logging in to Windows on PCs and Microsoft services on the web. One of the main objectives of the new process is to make passwordless options like passkey, face recognition, and fingerprint authentication easy to use. "By streamlining the UX (user experience) design for authentication, we were able to rethink the default sign-in experience and place even more emphasis on ease of use and safety," Goldstein said. "In recent years, we've made several enhancements, including the ability to completely remove passwords from accounts and the ability to sign in using a passkey instead of a password. Our new UX has been optimized for passwordless passkey preferences." If you sign up for Microsoft services with an existing email address, you will not be asked to create a password. Instead, the one-time security code required to obtain access rights will be sent by email. Once a passkey is created, it becomes the default sign-in option whenever possible. There is a risk that your password could be forgotten or guessed by an attacker," Goldstein explained. "All you need is to authenticate your email with one-time code. This will be the default credentials for your new account and you can start without a password. In addition, you can now link your account with an email address in case you want to restore your account or start on a new device." The screen is placed more centrally so that users can concentrate without being distracted. Plus, it is displayed properly on any device, from smartphones to desktop monitors. Users can select the Light/Dark mode according to their preference. The selected mode will be automatically enabled each time you sign in. When I tried out a new sign-in screen on Xbox, the login experience was improved. I usually use an authentication app to authenticate my Microsoft account. In addition to enhancing this approach, the new experience also offers other passwordless authentication methods. The new screen will first be adopted in web/mobile applications.</p>

Microsoft testet den neuen Blue Screen of Death derzeit für Windows 11 im Insider-Programm. Microsoft hat eine Funktion seines Betriebssystems überarbeitet, die Anwender in der Regel nicht nutzen möchten: den Blue Screen of Death. Die Änderungen stehen derzeit Teilnehmern des Windows-Insider-Programms für Windows 11 zur Verfügung. Microsoft zufolge werden Nutzer künftig die gleichen Informationen sehen wie bisher, aber in einem neuen Design – das zudem auf die namensgebende blaue Farbe verzichtet. „Wir stellen eine neue, schlankere Benutzeroberfläche für unerwartete Neustarts vor, die besser mit den Designprinzipien von Windows 11 übereinstimmt und unser Ziel unterstützt, die Benutzer so schnell wie möglich wieder produktiv zu machen“, so Microsoft in einer Ankündigung zum neuesten Windows 11 Insider-Build. Ein Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) wird als Reaktion auf einen schwerwiegenden Systemfehler oder -absturz ausgelöst, der häufig auf einen Hardware- oder Treiberkonflikt zurückzuführen ist. Windows kann sich von dieser Art von Fehler nicht erholen, so dass ein Computer neu gestartet werden muss, um sich selbst zu bereinigen. Der typische BSOD teilt Nutzern mit, dass auf ihrem PC ein Problem aufgetreten ist, identifiziert oft die Quelle des Konflikts und bietet einen QR-Code mit Details zur Problembehandlung. Das neue Design verzichtet laut Windows Latest auf den QR-Code und ein Smiley mit stirnrunzelndem Gesicht.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hell, that same jack will even charge your gadgets in a pinch, but not in the US because this e-bike is for Europe only. Estonia-based Ampler is best known for making reliable direct-to-consumer e-bikes from its home in Tallinn using decent, mostly off-the-shelf parts that can be serviced at any local bike shop. Adding USB-C charging from a laptop charger you might already own makes a ton of sense as Europe standardizes on the port to eliminate redundancy and reduce waste. You can charge the relatively small 48V 336Wh integrated batteries (removable for service only) on the Nova series e-bikes from zero to full in as little as three hours from a USB-C PD 3.1 charger operating at up to 140W. Some e-bikes fitted with a battery this same size can take five hours or longer to refill from chargers with proprietary connectors, and others fitted with larger batteries and 300-plus-watt charging bricks can bring that down to around two hours. Ampler has also tested its bikes to work with less capable Ikea and MacBook chargers that support the older USB-C PD 3.0 spec. And while the USB-C port is bidirectional on the Nova series, it’s only capable of charging your USB-C gadgets at a modest 15W. Both the €2,990 (about $3,230) Nova and €3,490 (about $3,770) Nova Pro are available in step-through and step-over frames in three sizes to accommodate most riders, with EU standard 250W motors maxing out at a basic 25km/h. They’re essentially improved Stout and Stella models designed to be more compatible with accessories like U-locks, third-party saddles, and child carriers. The base Nova model is fitted with wide 27.5-inch tires and depends on an oily chain and derailleur for its nine-speed transmission. Both the Nova and Nova Pro are available to preorder starting today in the UK, EU, and Switzerland, with shipping set to begin in June.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I think most readers of this series are accepting new employees. In any case, I told you last time that if you can use new encounters as a species of serendipity, you won't have to worry about your job being taken away by AI. I myself have been working on a new job since April in search of serendipity. I look forward to all sorts of coincidences. Now, what should new employees who have begun their careers as engineers or students aiming for a career as engineers should learn is a profound topic. Over 90% of the engineers I have worked with have graduated from the university's Faculty of Science and Technology. However, even in science and engineering, there are many cases where people majored in mechanical engineering, physics, mathematics, etc., while many people from so-called liberal arts faculties such as economics, law, and literature have been active as engineers. Telecommunications carrier engineers often do not engage in tasks like device development or program coding. Of course, there is no way telecommunications carrier engineers are involved in device development or coding. In practice, we purchase commercially available communication devices and servers, connect them to media such as optical fiber, and provide services with appropriate settings. It is also important to decide and coordinate what protocols to use when connecting with other telecommunications carriers and users. Selecting equipment, connecting to networks such as optical fibers, introducing configurations, and understanding and using protocols - if you write this, once you set it optimally, you may think that the machine will move on its own. Also, optical fiber buried underground can be cut off by road construction, and protocols can be dialects and versions, so it is usually not easy*2.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three days later, DOGE employees made their way into the building, reportedly using a physical key from a former security contractor. As of this past Friday, most USIP staffers have received termination notices. While US district judge Beryl Howell declined the USIP request for a temporary restraining order that would reinstate the institute’s board on March 19, she sharply criticized DOGE’s conquest in court. Court documents filed by defendants on Monday reveal the next phase of DOGE’s plans for USIP. They further state that Cavanaugh has been instructed to transfer USIP’s assets—including its real estate—to the GSA. The letter detailing those changes and instructions was signed by secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio. Cavanaugh did not immediately respond to a request for comment by WIRED. The lead attorney for the Department of Justice in this case also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cavanaugh goes on to estimate that the building has a “fair market value” of $500 million. In another letter included in the lawsuit’s docket dated March 29, Project 2025 architect and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought writes to Ehikian to approve his request “to set the amount of reimbursement at no cost for the transfer of the United States Institute of Peace’s (USIP) headquarters building.” To state this plainly: DOGE forced out the directors and staff of a nonexecutive agency and installed one of its own GSA staffers as president, and that person is now attempting to hand the institute’s $500 million headquarters over to the agency he came from, at zero cost. Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at barrett.64. In an opposing court filing, government lawyers claim that “the Institute is an executive agency and has decided consistent with the Executive Order and its statutory authority to transfer its excess property to GSA,” referring to president Donald Trump's February EO that purportedly “reins in independent agencies.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ZDNET's key takeaways The OnePlus 12 typically sells for a starting price of $799. The lack of generative AI features is felt, but for many, that may not be a problem. OnePlus is holding a new promotion for its old flagship phone. Instead of prematurely jumping onto the AI bandwagon, promoting its phones with features that aren't readily available, the Shenzhen manufacturer prioritized aspects that mattered more, such as charging tech, battery life, and performance. Also: Amazon's Spring Sale is over, but this Google Pixel 9 offer at Target is still my favorite spring phone deal live now A smartphone that excels at the things you actually want and need. I find it very difficult to recommend any other mobile device in 2025. My fondness for the OnePlus 12 is part of a bigger story. The OnePlus 12 has all three of those features and a very competitive price, especially in today's market. The device's edges are curved to make it sit smoothly in my hand, and I don't struggle to press any of the buttons. Also: 12 Android phone settings you should change to dramatically increase battery life For something that requires a toggle instead of a press, physically switching from "Ring" to "Vibrate" to "Silent" feels more cumbersome than it should. Otherwise, I'm a fan of OnePlus' industrial design, which is a little more distinct now that both Samsung and Google have officially ditched the curved glass form factor. The OnePlus 12 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which brings improved day-to-day performance and better efficiency of on-device AI applications. I've had no problem putting the phone through its paces, whether it's editing videos on Premiere Rush, playing demanding games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact, or multitasking with a PiP (Picture-in-Picture) video playing. While the marketed peak brightness of 4,500 nits puts even the Galaxy S24's 2,600 value to shame, I only found it to be slightly brighter when outdoors. Aside from Google's stock AI features, such as Magic Compose and Photomoji, this model has no killer generative AI service, as I alluded to in the introduction. That's not a bad thing, especially if you don't factor generative AI into your lifestyle anyway. Also: 5 tools I trust to keep my online conversations private and anonymous That said, the latest Android 15 update for the OnePlus 12 introduces some familiar generative AI tools that put the device closer to its competitors, such as Circle to Search, AI Unblur, AI Assistant for Notes, and more. The new software version also brings Open Canvas to the phone, a multitasking feature that deploys floating windows for quicker navigation between apps. Also: This Anker power bank is on sale and it's my everyday carry - Here's why Because the telephoto lens is capped to 3x optical zoom, shooting subjects that are further away tends to produce pictures that appear more washed out and lacking in detail. For images captured with Hasselblad Portrait Mode, the phone can struggle to apply a bokeh effect behind people with fuzzy and springy hairstyles. In both cases, a visual engine that can help amplify or better detect subjects would be immensely helpful. Ultimately, one of the most compelling reasons to buy a OnePlus phone is its battery life and charging speed. It's also a great phone for users who aren't fully bought into the AI craze. If you can shoulder the compromises, which are more subtle than ever, then I have no problem recommending the latest phone from OnePlus, especially at its Black Friday price. As per OnePlus, this deal will end on April 13, 2025. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Skylight, a startup taking on TikTok with a more open alternative, is launching its mobile app to the public on Tuesday after just 10 weeks of active development. That means videos posted on Skylight can be seen and engaged with by users on Bluesky and other ATProto-based apps, like the more photo-centric app Flashes, for example. The company is funded by a pre-seed round from Cuban, who said earlier this year that he wanted to fund a TikTok alternative built on the AT Protocol. White, who used to be a travel influencer and is now a self-taught software developer living in Seattle, says she and co-founder Hermeyer were inspired to create Skylight when they first heard that TikTok was getting banned in the U.S. In preparation for the ban, which is currently on pause, White had backed up her TikTok videos. But she still worried about losing access to her community and comments. Hermeyer and White soon realized this was an ideal time to build a new social app on the protocol that could be “ban-proof.” Tapping into her influencer background, White began documenting Skylight’s development on TikTok, which helped bring exposure to the product and build a following of potentially interested users. “I actually made a video before we ever wrote a line of code for this … [so] everyone can follow our journey as we build,” she told TechCrunch at the conference. Today, White’s @buildwithtori TikTok profile has nearly 50,000 followers, many of which turned into early testers. Like Bluesky, Skylight supports video uploads of up to three minutes in length, a recent increase from the one-minute-long videos supported previously. But White sees Skylight becoming more than just a decentralized TikTok clone. She hints that Skylight in the future will allow users to customize their feed, including by utilizing new gestures beyond swiping and scrolling. Other features in the works include support for sounds, duets, stitching, bookmarks, and playlists.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The idea of getting her eldest child a smartphone had long felt inevitable, said Daisy Greenwell. But by early last year, when her daughter was 8 years old, it filled her with dread. When she talked to other parents, “everyone universally said, ‘Yes, it’s a nightmare, but you’ve got no choice,’” recalled Ms. Greenwell, 41. A friend, Clare Fernyhough, had shared her concerns about the addictive qualities of smartphones and the impact of social media on mental health, so they created a WhatsApp group to strategize. Then Ms. Greenwell, who lives in rural Suffolk, in the east of England, posted her thoughts on Instagram. “What if we could switch the social norm so that in our school, our town, our country, it was an odd choice to make to give your child a smartphone at 11,” she wrote. “What if we could hold off until they’re 14, or 16?” She added a link to the WhatsApp group. Within 24 hours the group was oversubscribed with parents clamoring to join. Today, more than 124,000 parents of children in more than 13,000 British schools have signed a pact created by Smartphone Free Childhood, the charity set up by Ms. Greenwell, her husband, Joe Ryrie, and Ms. Fernyhough. It reads: “Acting in the best interests of my child and our community, I will wait until at least the end of Year 9 before getting them a smartphone.” (Year 9 is equivalent to the American eighth grade.)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon’s movie strategy is finally ready for its close-up.

After a decade-long dalliance with big-screen theatrical releases, the giant tech company will take center stage this week at the annual convention for theater owners, spending several millions of dollars to parade a stream of A-list stars including Ryan Gosling, Ben Affleck and Chris Hemsworth. It is the first time the company has ever taken on such a role.

The point: to prove that its movie arm, Amazon MGM Studios, is serious about releasing around 14 big, broad commercial films a year to theaters nationwide and around the world.

The appearance is the culmination of a strategic change for Amazon that began when it bought MGM, with the venerable studio’s impressive library, in 2022 for $8.5 billion. For years, the company has released five to eight films theatrically, but it was never clear how long they would stay in theaters before going to Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming service. “Air,” starring Mr. Affleck and Matt Damon, received a 37-day exclusive theatrical release. “Red One,” with Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, hit Prime just weeks after it debuted in theaters.

Now with 14 movies a year, Amazon’s lineup will rival those from the big studios in both size and scope, and most will spend 45 days in theaters before hitting pay-per-view and then Prime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China’s Xiaomi, a consumer electronics giant turned automaker, said it was cooperating with a police investigation into a fatal crash involving one of its electric vehicles while the driver was using the car’s autonomous driving features.

A Xiaomi SU7 sedan drove into a concrete guardrail on an expressway in eastern China late Saturday at around 60 miles per hour, according to a post on Xiaomi’s official social media account. On Tuesday, local media published reports about the collision and ensuing fire, which killed three college students, along with pictures of the charred remains of the vehicle.

Xiaomi said the driver had deployed the company’s Navigate On Autopilot, an assisted-driving feature, while going around 70 m.p.h. on the expressway. The car was traveling at that speed when it reached a roadblock, because a portion of the road was under repair with traffic diverted into a different lane.

Seconds before the collision, the car warned that there were obstacles ahead and started to decelerate, but it was too late. The company said it had called the police and emergency services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company is notifying TikTok Notes users of its decision to retire the app and is directing them to ByteDance-owned Lemon8, which isn’t surprising given that the apps are quite similar and offer the same sort of functionality. “We’re excited to bring the feedback from TikTok Notes to Lemon8 as we continue building a dedicated space for our community to share and experience photo content, designed to complement and enhance the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. While TikTok didn’t provide a specific reason for shutting down the app, it’s likely that the company didn’t see much adoption for TikTok Notes and is deciding to instead push Lemon8, which had around 12.5 million global monthly active users as of December 2024. In a notice to TikTok Notes users, TikTok says the decision to shut down the app “was not made lightly.” The notice encourages users to download and save their TikTok Notes data and “continue sharing your creativity on Lemon8.” TikTok says that “Lemon8 is a lifestyle app that offers a similar experience to TikTok Notes” but with “even more features.” Lemon8 launched in Japan in 2020 and later expanded to markets across the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Lemon8 offers users access to creative tools, filters, effects, stickers, text templates, and more. While TikTok is pushing Lemon8 as an alternative to TikTok Notes, ByteDance has also tried to position the app as an alternative to TikTok itself in the face of a potential U.S. ban. Last November, the company made it possible for users to directly access Lemon8 with their TikTok accounts and rolled out the ability for users to cross-share photo content between the apps. The move was seen as a way for ByteDance to move creators onto the new platform without having to get them to sign up for it separately in case TikTok were to go away. Fast-forward to today, and TikTok continues to promote Lemon8 in its app as it faces a new ban deadline of April 5.</p>

Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, attributed the rising tides not only to new models, but also to new capabilities. Just this past month, Google brought a “canvas” feature to Gemini that lets users preview the output of coding projects, and Anthropic has steadily added tools to its Claude client. Yousef pointed out that ChatGPT had 10x mobile app weekly active users compared to Gemini and Claude combined as of March.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE PHOTO: Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealth Group chief executive Brian Thompson, appears in Manhattan Supreme Court on New York state murder and terrorism charges in New York City, U.S., February 21, 2025.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday said she had ordered federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, who is charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City in December.

"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America," Bondi said in a statement issued by the Department of Justice.

"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again," the attorney general said.

Karen Agnifilo, Mangione's lawyer, condemned Bondi's decision.

"By seeking to murder Luigi Mangione, the Justice Department has moved from the dysfunctional to the barbaric," Agnifilo said in a statement.

"Their decision to execute Luigi is political and goes against the recommendation of the local federal prosecutors, the law, and historical precedent," the attorney said.

"While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi," Agnifilo said.

"By doing this, they are defending the broken, immoral, and murderous healthcare industry that continues to terrorize the American people."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a series of posts on X on Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the popularity of the company’s new image-generation tool in ChatGPT will cause unspecified product delays.

“We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” Altman wrote. “Working as fast we can to really get stuff humming.”

OpenAI’s new image-generation capability arrived with much fanfare — and controversy — for its impressive ability to recreate styles like Studio Ghibli’s hand-drawn animation. Over the weekend, Altman said in posts on X that the company “hasn’t been able to catch up” since launch and that staff have worked late nights and through the weekend to “keep the service up.”

In a single hour on Monday, ChatGPT added a million new users, Altman claimed in a post. ChatGPT now has 500 million weekly users and 20 million paying subscribers, up from 300 million users and 15.5 million subscribers at the end of 2024.

In an effort to ease its capacity issues, OpenAI delayed the release of the image-generation tool for free ChatGPT users and temporarily disabled video generation for new users of Sora, the company’s suite of generative AI media tools.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CaaStle, a startup that launched in 2011 as a plus-sized clothing subscription service and later became an inventory monetization platform for clothing retailers, is facing financial difficulties, the company confirmed to TechCrunch following a report by Axios. Citing a letter from the board, Axios reported that the company is almost out of money, CEO Christine Hunsicker resigned from her CEO role and the board, and the company has involved law enforcement to investigate alleged financial misconduct. The company also confirmed to TechCrunch that it furloughed all of its employees. We regret having to temporarily furlough our employees, but we believe this will best position the company to successfully recover from our current situation,” the company said in an emailed statement after TechCrunch inquired about the company’s status. In that letter, also cited by Puck, the board is alleging that Hunsicker misled at least some of the company’s investors about financial performance, and about the company’s capital and outstanding shares, including two “falsified” audit opinions. Both Axios and Puck have reported that days before Hunsicker exited the company, she was out fundraising, and making claims about the company’s healthy finances. Axios has noted that if the board’s allegations lead to a case of fraud made against the founder, this would be one of the largest such cases ever. Last week, Charlie Javice, the founder of student loan application startup Frank, which was purchased by JPMorgan for $175 million, was found guilty of defrauding the bank. But the investment numbers for CaaStle are three times as large. While this might not be a typical startup shutdown experience, experts have told TechCrunch that 2025 is on track to be another brutal year for failed startups.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zelle is shutting down its stand-alone app on Tuesday, according to a company blog post. This news might be alarming if you’re one of the over 150 million customers in the U.S. who use Zelle for person-to-person payments. But only about 2% of transactions take place via Zelle’s app, which is why the company is discontinuing its stand-alone app. Most consumers access Zelle via their bank, which then allows them to send money to their phone contacts. Zelle users who relied on the stand-alone app will have to re-enroll in the service through another financial institution. Given the small user base of the Zelle app, it makes sense why the company would decide to get rid of it — maintaining an app takes time and money, especially one where people’s financial information is involved. On Venmo, users can receive payments into their own Venmo wallet, which they can then deposit into their actual bank account — but if you don’t want to wait a few days for the deposit to process, you’ll have to pay a fee for an instant transfer. Because of Zelle’s connections with banks, it’s able to offer instant transfers without charging additional fees. Zelle said that in 2024, users sent $1 trillion in payments, breaking the record of any other payment app. This might be the case because consumers tend to use Zelle for larger payments like rent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Take a category of consumers that Doug Rubin’s startup, Northwind Climate, calls “climate doers.” They’re concerned about climate change and tend to prioritize climate-friendly purchases, the sort of identifiers who might be stereotypically associated with things like buying organic foods or prioritizing local businesses. What’s more, some 30% of climate doers are Republicans, he added. Northwind Climate evolved from Rubin’s work in the political world, where surveys are vital to understanding shifts in public sentiment and identifying likely voters. The startup has raised a $1.05 million pre-seed round, it exclusively told TechCrunch, with participation from angel investors, including Tom Steyer, former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, and Alexander Hoffmann of Susty Ventures. Rather than divide people into demographic buckets that might segment along political, generational, or regional lines, Northwind Climate analyzes survey responses for behavioral clues that can be used to classify consumers. For climate doers and “climate distressed,” two categories of consumers who are most likely to buy an EV, the startup suggests that automakers frame the cars as matter of choice. “We’re providing choices for those who care about reducing pollution, saving money on gas, and helping address climate change,” reads one of Northwind’s suggested pitches. The startup has built a database that consists of 20,000 survey respondents across eight surveys, and Rubin says it’s growing by 2,500 respondents per month. Every three months, Northwind also runs an industry-specific survey to capture deeper insights for different customers. Companies that subscribe to the service, which costs $10,000 per quarter or $40,000 per year for a typical customer, can add up to four of their own questions every quarter, which Rubin said is less than what they’d shell out for one annual survey. But Rubin isn’t concerned, saying surveys have shown that consumers are pretty savvy. “Our data shows there is a clear risk to brands and their reputations from making claims that are exaggerated or otherwise untrue,” Rubin said. Rubin said that Northwind is also developing what he calls a virtual focus group. It’s essentially an AI model, trained on survey responses, that can analyze a company’s marketing materials like TV spots or social media ads and provide feedback, just like a human focus group would. Rubin is convinced that companies have been missing opportunities to connect with climate-conscious consumers. “If you look at the data and where consumers are — and it’s across the board, it’s not just Democrats or Independents — they really want this, and they will reward companies who are willing to be smart about it,” he said.</p>

Meta’s VP of AI research, Joelle Pineau, is planning to leave the company, she announced in a post on Facebook Tuesday. Pineau said she’s leaving in May after more than two years overseeing FAIR, Meta’s internal AI research lab led by Yann LeCun.

Pineau’s exit comes as Meta ramps up its AI efforts, with the company planning to spend $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025.

In a statement to Bloomberg News, a Meta spokesperson said the company does not have an immediate replacement for Pineau but is conducting a search for her successor. Last year, Meta reportedly reorganized the company to have its AI research unit report to the company’s chief product officer, Chris Cox.

As for Pineau, the executive said she’ll take some time off before jumping into an unnamed “new adventure.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company is notifying TikTok Notes users of its decision to retire the app and is directing them to ByteDance-owned Lemon8, which isn’t surprising given that the apps are quite similar and offer the same sort of functionality. “We’re excited to bring the feedback from TikTok Notes to Lemon8 as we continue building a dedicated space for our community to share and experience photo content, designed to complement and enhance the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. While TikTok didn’t provide a specific reason for shutting down the app, it’s likely that the company didn’t see much adoption for TikTok Notes and is deciding to instead push Lemon8, which had around 12.5 million global monthly active users as of December 2024. In a notice to TikTok Notes users, TikTok says the decision to shut down the app “was not made lightly.” The notice encourages users to download and save their TikTok Notes data and “continue sharing your creativity on Lemon8.” TikTok says that “Lemon8 is a lifestyle app that offers a similar experience to TikTok Notes” but with “even more features.” Lemon8 launched in Japan in 2020 and later expanded to markets across the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Lemon8 offers users access to creative tools, filters, effects, stickers, text templates, and more. While TikTok is pushing Lemon8 as an alternative to TikTok Notes, ByteDance has also tried to position the app as an alternative to TikTok itself in the face of a potential U.S. ban. Last November, the company made it possible for users to directly access Lemon8 with their TikTok accounts and rolled out the ability for users to cross-share photo content between the apps. The move was seen as a way for ByteDance to move creators onto the new platform without having to get them to sign up for it separately in case TikTok were to go away. Fast-forward to today, and TikTok continues to promote Lemon8 in its app as it faces a new ban deadline of April 5.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While working on their MBAs at Harvard Business School, Colombian immigrants Stephanie Murra and Lorenza Vélez noticed that most of the workers in the cafeteria were Hispanic. In conversations with them, a common theme kept coming up: how difficult it was for people who legally moved to the U.S. from Spanish-speaking countries to find their first jobs in the United States. Not speaking English well or at all, unsurprisingly, was the biggest challenge. “But then we’re looking at the news and seeing that the U.S. is actually facing an unprecedented labor shortage, especially for these types of positions where you would usually see low-skilled immigrant workers,” Murra told TechCrunch in an interview. “So we were like, ‘Ok, there’s definitely an issue here.’” The roommates began doing research and realized that many potential employers would use traditional job boards like Indeed, which is “not meant for Hispanic immigrants,” Murra said. “These workers, many of whom don’t speak English and are not really good with technology, are used to finding jobs through friends,” she explained. The duo — who had previously worked together for two years at Colombian fintech Addi — founded the Miami-based company in April 2023, during their final semester at Harvard. So we built Ponte to bridge this gap,” Vélez added. Workers are hired directly by employers rather than through staffing agencies, which they say not only saves employers money, but gives them a larger pool of potential employees to choose from. Ponte only works with documented immigrants: every candidate is pre-vetted for legal work authorization before reaching an employer. For now, it is only focused on the hospitality industry but plans to expand into other sectors such as construction or elder care in the future. Ponte has been steadily growing since Murra and Vélez formally launched the platform in November 2023, onboarding over 60,000 candidates and placing nearly 800 workers in hospitality roles. Its annualized net revenue has grown from $70,000 in February of 2024 to $550,000 today. Besides using WhatsApp, it also places ads on Facebook and Instagram. “That focus has helped us build deep trust with the community and tailor our approach to their specific needs,” she said. “But we’re building tools that are language-agnostic and could easily be adapted to serve other immigrant communities, including Portuguese-speaking Brazilians, in the future.” “So that’s not just helping them find an entry level job. We also want to help them grow within those jobs,” Vélez said. “We see one of the biggest opportunities in helping the candidates learn English, because that’s where they get stuck between where they are right now and getting a promotion for their next job.” Henri Pierre-Jacques, managing partner of Harlem Capital, said he’d been tracking the founders from Ponte’s pre-seed days. “We received very positive references from customers who raved about their product. It was obvious that Stephanie and Lorenza could do a lot with very little.” Pierre-Jacques also believes that Ponte’s focus on Hispanic hospitality workers is “a huge differentiator.” “With talent marketplaces we are always thinking about how our founders manage the supply side,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenSNP, a large open source repository for user-uploaded genetic data, will shut down and delete all of its data at the end of April, co-founder Bastian Greshake Tzovaras has confirmed. Founded in 2011 by Greshake Tzovaras, along with Philipp Bayer and Helge Rausch, openSNP became an open and public repository for customers of commercial genetic testing kits, including 23andMe, to upload their test results and find others with similar genetic variations. News of openSNP’s shutdown comes in the wake of 23andMe filing for bankruptcy protection, intensifying concerns that the company’s vast banks of customers’ sensitive genetic data will be sold to the highest bidder, who may not adhere to 23andMe’s privacy commitments. “Sunsetting openSNP — along with deleting the data stored within it — feels like it is the most responsible act of stewardship for these data today.” When reached by TechCrunch, Greshake Tzovaras was blunt in his decision to shut down openSNP now and not sooner. “The ‘why now’ to me is ultimately down to there being what counts for a fascist coup in the U.S.,” Greshake Tzovaras told TechCrunch, a native of Germany. In one historical example he gave — when law enforcement used genetic data from genealogy site GEDmatch in 2018 to identify a notorious serial killer — Greshake Tzovaras said openSNP seemed at the time like it was less relevant or at risk for use by law enforcement compared to larger ancestry-specific databases. (Greshake Tzovaras confirmed to TechCrunch that notwithstanding the open and public nature of the data it stores, openSNP has never received a law enforcement request for any genetic or user data.) Greshake Tzovaras said that compared to the first Trump administration, “the misuse of science was both qualitatively and quantitatively very different than what we see today.” Greshake Tzovaras also told TechCrunch that on a positive reflection, keeping openSNP running for 14 years may be his “biggest achievement.” He said openSNP ran on about $100 per month, in the face of commercial startups that have worked to monetize people’s data yet ultimately failed. The site has also contributed to research and publications “across a wide range of disciplines — from infosec/privacy all the way to biomedical studies,” said Greshake Tzovaras. Many undergraduates also benefited from having access to real-world data hosted by openSNP, he said. “In that sense, I think our hope of ‘democratizing’ access to genomics was at least partially successful,” said Greshake Tzovaras.</p>

The venture capital firm is reportedly in talks to invest in TikTok as part of a bid led by Oracle and other American investors looking to buy out TikTok from ByteDance, according to the Financial Times.

TikTok is once again slated to be banned in the U.S. on April 5 unless its Chinese-based owner sells its U.S. branch to a non-Chinese owner. The Oracle deal is said to be one of the frontrunners, according to the FT.

Andreessen Horowitz has a long history of investing in social media: It was an early investor in Facebook and Instagram and invested $400 million to help Elon Musk acquire Twitter. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

Someone is making precisely that tantalizing, bizarre, and clearly sketchy job offer. If you are interested, you can join our channel first,” read the message, which included a link to a Telegram channel. For some reason, I also received this message from an X account named “Look at my homepage,” which had a username, @JerelLayce88010, that looked like it was randomly generated. “Are you proficient in penetration technology?” Jack asked me. As long as the domain is registered in China, it is our target range,” said Jack, referring to web shells, programs or scripts that hackers can use to control hacked web servers. There is no upper limit to the number we need. “What I need is China’s traffic,” Jack said, perhaps losing patience with my questions. At this point, Jack definitely got tired of my questions and gave me an assignment: Get me three web shells on any domain registered in China so I know you have the skills. Generously, Jack offered me $100 for each hacked domain. Instead I kept asking questions, including who Jack was working for. “Indian government,” Jack responded, although in a subsequent chat Jack contradicted that, blaming automatic translation, which they said they were using because Chinese is their first language. I spoke to some of the researchers who got Jack’s strange job offer, and they were also puzzled. Nobody said they have gotten a malicious link, for example, or suspicious questions that would indicate some sort of doxing or scam campaign. “If they want to hire top talent this is not definitely the way.” The Grugq, a well-known cybersecurity expert, told TechCrunch that he has never seen anything like this recruiting campaign. “I have seen [people] asking dumb questions and spamming for various cybersecurity-related things,” he said. “But never anything like the persistent, widespread, bizarre s— from this guy.” “I really can’t think of wtf they’re doing,” The Grugq concluded. Godspeed, Jack, in whatever adventure you are embarking on.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You know the online dating scene is bad when dating giants like Tinder are now introducing AI personas for users to flirt with. On Tuesday, the company announced a new game powered by OpenAI, allowing users to interact with an AI bot to practice flirting, reenact meet-cute scenarios, and receive scores with suggestions for improving their dating skills. The game gives users a deck of cards, with each one featuring a different AI persona and scenario. Users must use their voices to respond and try to flirt their way into getting a date with the bot. After the interaction, users are scored on a three-point scale using flame emojis. If users are rude, for instance, the AI offers suggestions to improve the conversation. According to the company, the new game is intended to provide a fun and lighthearted experience, not to be taken too seriously. However, the trend of people flirting with AI bots is becoming scarily popular, and Tinder seems to be banking on this as a way to attract more users amid its struggles for growth. There are already existing apps in this space, such as Replika’s AI dating sim Blush, Teaser, and Rizz. Tinder has announced other AI features, such as an AI photo selector tool that launched last year and upcoming features for discovery and matching.</p>

Intel’s new CEO Lip-Bu Tan wasted no time laying out his plans for the semiconductor giant.

Speaking at the Intel Vision conference this week, Tan told attendees that the company will spin off assets that aren’t core to its mission, Bloomberg reported. Tan didn’t specify what was classified as core and noncore to the company’s business.

Intel will also launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers, Tan added. But he made no mention of breaking up the company, according to Bloomberg, which was a potential turnaround strategy floated in recent months.

Tan was named Intel’s CEO on March 12 and assumed the role on March 18, a little over three months after former CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced out of the role on December 1. Previously, Tan was a member of the company’s board of directors before resigning late last August.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google on Tuesday announced a new partnership with gaming company Roblox, which will allow advertisers to purchase and scale Roblox’s Rewarded Video and other immersive ad formats. That means marketers who want to reach the younger Gen Z audience that dominates the platform will be able to use Google Ad Manager to place their video ad buys, including the Rewarded Video format, Roblox says.

The latter can be purchased both directly and programmatically, allowing brands and agencies to reach Roblox’s “tens of millions” of Gen Z users who are active daily on the service.

For Roblox, the partnership offers more ways for game creators to monetize their efforts while also offering their players other ways to earn benefits inside their games. With the Rewarded Video ads, Roblox users watch up to 30 seconds of full-screen video ads in the Roblox games and online experience to receive the perks the game creator chooses to make available. The company says that tests of these ads saw completion rates of over 80%.

Roblox also announced other partnerships in the industry, including with Cint, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science (IAS), Kantar, and Nielsen to help advertisers measure the impact of their ad buys.</p>

NaNoWriMo — an abbreviation of National Novel Writing Month — is an annual challenge for writers to complete a rough draft of a novel during the month of November. mailing list in 1999, the project grew into a self-described “internet-famous” writing challenge with hundreds of thousands of participants over more than two decades. The organization says it has had longstanding financial issues that have made it difficult to operate, but its other problems became more public last year. NaNoWriMo lost significant community support when it took a stand in favor of the use of artificial intelligence in creative writing. New York Times bestselling authors Maureen Johnson and Daniel José Older resigned from the nonprofit’s board in response, reflecting a growing concern among writers about how their work is being stolen to train the very AI models that threaten their livelihoods. Around the same time, the nonprofit was also lambasted for inconsistent moderation on its all-ages forums, which created an unsafe environment for teenage writers, community members claimed. According to NaNoWriMo, these controversies over content moderation and AI did not directly lead to the organization’s demise. “To blame NaNoWriMo’s demise on the events of the last year does a disservice to all struggling nonprofits,” a NaNoWriMo spokesperson, Kilby, stated in a YouTube video. “Too many members of a very large, very engaged community let themselves believe the service to be provided was free.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drones have begun to replace some of those inspections, but the flight-time for these can be limited. Hamburg, Germany-based Beagle uses long-range drones to capture data about energy infrastructure. Co-founder Oliver Lichtenstein says he and his team spent five years developing what they dub a “computer with wings” that complies with strict EU airspace regulations for long-range flights, and with no personnel on site — the drone literally rises from its housing unaided. We’re cashflow positive in Germany with the current team and operations,” he said over email. Here’s how it works: An operator sends geo data of their grid to Beagle and gets a quote based on the per-kilometer price for one or both of Beagle’s products (methane detection or hazard detection). Admittedly Beagle does have competitors, including Intero, the Adlares CHARM helicopter (which detects methane emissions), as well as local helicopter or small airplane services. However, Beagle claims to have 75 times the resolution of satellites, is cheaper, has lower emissions than planes, and is permitted to fly long-range repeatedly. The “Fully EU” (“Made in Germany”) solution also means it has full control over the data and software, something of an advantage in today’s world where systems made outside the EU may come up against geopolitical headwinds. Furthermore, Lichtenstein said: “We have Operational Approval for flights in EU airspace and can currently cover 80% of the EU area, apart from densely populated areas.” But while the company is limiting its drones to civilian applications for now, Nikolas Samios, managing partner at PT1, commented that it could be used in other scenarios: “In a world where critical infrastructure is being attacked, it has never been more important to have real-time surveillance for critical infrastructure — from energy lines to telecommunications… so the potential applications of this tech are very broad.” He’s joined by Jerry Tang (robotics engineer), Mitja Wittersheim, and Bendix Böttger (former head of Sales DACH for Trustpilot).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Accounting software company Open Ledger has launched a new product in time for tax day. Meet PokéTax, a game that helps make tax filing quite fun. Each leader asks questions that help players complete their tax forms. The game is an adaptation of the open source Pokémon game called Pokémon Showdown, and he promised this was not an April Fool’s joke. Tax fraud isn’t funny — and neither is the IRS,” he said. Adade-Yebesi said his team first built this product, which is open source, as a joke. “Could we actually pull this off?” he and his team pondered. The game has an AI assistant that helps organize users’ responses, and players can win badges — discover new deductions — as they take on the Tax Trainers. Notably, in 2023, there was the dating-style game Tax Heaven 3000, where users went on a date with an avatar named Iris who asked questions to help complete a tax form. Adade-Yebesi hopes that by adding fun to such financial processes, they will be “more engaging and way less soul-sucking.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI has been accused by many parties of training its AI on copyrighted content sans permission. Now a new paper by an AI watchdog organization makes the serious accusation that the company increasingly relied on nonpublic books it didn’t license to train more sophisticated AI models. Trained on a lot of data — books, movies, TV shows, and so on — they learn patterns and novel ways to extrapolate from a simple prompt. While a number of AI labs, including OpenAI, have begun embracing AI-generated data to train AI as they exhaust real-world sources (mainly the public web), few have eschewed real-world data entirely. The new paper, out of the AI Disclosures Project, a nonprofit co-founded in 2024 by media mogul Tim O’Reilly and economist Ilan Strauss, draws the conclusion that OpenAI likely trained its GPT-4o model on paywalled books from O’Reilly Media. O’Reilly doesn’t have a licensing agreement with OpenAI, the paper says. “GPT-4o, OpenAI’s more recent and capable model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O’Reilly book content … compared to OpenAI’s earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo,” wrote the co-authors of the paper. “In contrast, GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible O’Reilly book samples.” Also known as a “membership inference attack,” the method tests whether a model can reliably distinguish human-authored texts from paraphrased, AI-generated versions of the same text. They used 13,962 paragraph excerpts from 34 O’Reilly books to estimate the probability that a particular excerpt had been included in a model’s training dataset. That’s even after accounting for potential confounding factors, the authors said, like improvements in newer models’ ability to figure out whether text was human-authored. It isn’t a smoking gun, the co-authors are careful to note. They acknowledge that their experimental method isn’t foolproof and that OpenAI might’ve collected the paywalled book excerpts from users copying and pasting it into ChatGPT. Muddying the waters further, the co-authors didn’t evaluate OpenAI’s most recent collection of models, which includes GPT-4.5 and “reasoning” models such as o3-mini and o1. That being said, it’s no secret that OpenAI, which has advocated for looser restrictions around developing models using copyrighted data, has been seeking higher-quality training data for some time. That’s a trend across the broader industry: AI companies recruiting experts in domains like science and physics to effectively have these experts feed their knowledge into AI systems. It should be noted that OpenAI pays for at least some of its training data. The company has licensing deals in place with news publishers, social networks, stock media libraries, and others. OpenAI also offers opt-out mechanisms — albeit imperfect ones — that allow copyright owners to flag content they’d prefer the company not use for training purposes. Still, as OpenAI battles several suits over its training data practices and treatment of copyright law in U.S. courts, the O’Reilly paper isn’t the most flattering look.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Members of President Donald Trump’s National Security Council, including White House national security adviser Michael Waltz, have conducted government business over personal Gmail accounts, according to documents reviewed by The Washington Post and interviews with three U.S. officials. The use of Gmail, a far less secure method of communication than the encrypted messaging app Signal, is the latest example of questionable data security practices by top national security officials already under fire for the mistaken inclusion of a journalist in a group chat about high-level planning for military operations in Yemen. A senior Waltz aide used the commercial email service for highly technical conversations with colleagues at other government agencies involving sensitive military positions and powerful weapons systems relating to an ongoing conflict, according to emails reviewed by The Post. Waltz has had less sensitive, but potentially exploitable information sent to his Gmail, such as his schedule and other work documents, said officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe what they viewed as problematic handling of information. NSC spokesman Brian Hughes said he has seen no evidence of Waltz using his personal email as described and said on occasions when “legacy contacts” have emailed him work-related materials, he makes sure to “cc” his government email to ensure compliance with federal records laws that require officials to archive official correspondence. When asked about a Waltz staffer discussing sensitive military matters over Gmail, Hughes said NSC staff have guidance about using “only secure platforms for classified information.” Waltz has also created and hosted other Signal chats with Cabinet members on sensitive topics, including on Somalia and Russia’s war in Ukraine, said a senior administration official. Publicly, Trump has strongly backed Waltz, but on Wednesday he met with Vice President JD Vance, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and others to discuss whether to keep him on. Data security experts have expressed alarm that U.S. national security professionals are not more readily using the government’s suite of secure encrypted systems for work communications such as JWICS, the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System. Most concerning, however, is the use of personal email, which is widely acknowledged to be susceptible to hacking, spearfishing and other types of digital compromise. “Unless you are using GPG, email is not end-to-end encrypted, and the contents of a message can be intercepted and read at many points, including on Google’s email servers,” said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s comments in the Signal chat detailed the sequencing, timing and weapons systems in advance of the Trump administration’s March attack on Houthi militants in Yemen, potentially jeopardizing U.S. airmen headed into harm’s way. Israeli officials expressed frustration that their capabilities were made public. U.S. officials say Trump is much more upset about the inclusion of a liberal journalist on a confidential group chat than he is about exposing secrets to foreign adversaries. But White House officials have found Waltz’s denials increasingly hard to believe. Waltz, who added Goldberg to the chat, told Fox News: “I take full responsibility. I built the group.” But he has subsequently said Goldberg’s contact information was “sucked into” his phone somehow and that he’s never met or talked to the journalist despite a newly circulated photo of the two men near each other at an event at the French ambassador’s residence in Washington. That’s simply not true,” Goldberg told “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Waltz, the first Green Beret elected to Congress and an adviser to former vice president Dick Cheney, has long pontificated about the importance of classified information and harshly criticized the Justice Department for not pursuing charges against Hillary Clinton for using a private email server as secretary of state. Not a damn thing,” Waltz wrote on social media in June 2023. Rubio and his staff, who have years of experience with classified intelligence from his former role as vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, are known for taking operational security seriously, said a senior U.S. official. Rubio noted that his contributions in the Signal chat were minimal. “Just speaking for my role, I contributed to it twice,” Rubio told reporters. On Sunday, Trump dismissed the controversy as a politically motivated attack. While Democrats have seized on the incident as evidence of incompetence, some in the MAGA wing of the Republican Party have assailed Waltz as a George W. Bush-aligned neoconservative, circulating a video from 2016 in which he condemned Trump as a draft-dodger, saying “Stop Trump now.” A key mark in Waltz’s favor is that the breach was discovered by a left-of-center media outlet and not conservative media, officials said.</p>
