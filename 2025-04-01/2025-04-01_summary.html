Andry José Hernández Romero sent to an El Salvador prison after claim ‘crown' tattoos proved he was a gang member

For as long as anyone can remember Andry José Hernández Romero was enthralled by the annual Three Kings Day celebrations for which his Venezuelan home town is famed, joining thousands of fellow Christians on the streets of Capacho to remember how the trio of wise men visited baby Jesus bearing gold, frankincense and myrrh.

At age seven, Andry became a Mini King, as members of the town's youth drama group Los Mini Reyes were known. Later in life, he tattooed two crowns on his wrists to memorialise those carnival-like Epiphany commemorations and his Catholic roots.

“Most Capacheros get crown tattoos, often adding the name of their father or mother. We've lots of people with these tattoos – it's a tradition that began in 1917,” said Miguel Chacón, the president of Capacho's Three Kings Day foundation.

The Latin American tradition appears to have been lost on the US immigration officers who detained Hernández, a 31-year-old makeup artist, hairdresser and theatre lover, after he crossed the southern border last August to attend a prearranged asylum appointment in San Diego.

Hernández, who is gay, told agents he was fleeing persecution stemming from his sexual orientation and political views. Just weeks earlier, Venezuela's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, had unleashed a ferocious crackdown after being accused of stealing the presidential election to extend his 12-year rule.

But Hernández's tattoos were deemed proof he was a member of Venezuela's most notorious gang, the Tren de Aragua, and a “security threat” to the US.

“Detainee Hernandez ports [sic] tattoos ‘crowns' that are consistent with those of a Tren de Aragua member,” an agent at California's Otay Mesa detention centre claimed, according to court documents published this week.

Those 16 words appear to have sealed the fate of the young Venezuelan stylist, who friends, family and lawyers say has never committed a crime.

On 15 March, after more than six months in custody in the US, Hernández was one of scores of Venezuelans flown from Texas to a maximum security prison in El Salvador as part of Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign. To the horror of their relatives, some detainees were paraded before the cameras and filmed being manhandled by guards and having their heads shaved before being bundled into cells.

“Let my son go. Review his case file. He is not a gang member,” Hernández's mother, Alexis Dolores Romero de Hernández, pleaded as she came to terms with her son's disappearance into the notorious Central American “terrorism confinement centre”, known by the Spanish acronym Cecot.

“Everyone has these crowns, many people. But that doesn't mean they're involved in the Tren de Aragua … He's never had problems with the law,” said Hernández, 65, who has not heard from her son since he called on the eve of his transfer to let her know – incorrectly – that he was being deported to Venezuela.

“We know nothing. They say nothing. They give no information. That's the trauma – not knowing anything about these young men, especially mine,” Alexis Hernández complained.

Her son's plight has caused outrage in Táchira, the western state where he grew up, with people packing Capacho's picturesque 19th-century church, San Pedro de la Independencia, to demand his freedom.

“We're talking about someone who has been part of Capacho's Three Kings Day celebrations for 23 years,” said Chacón, who is leading the campaign. “That's why I'm doing everything I can to get this young man released. He is completely innocent.”

Krisbel Vásquez, 29, a manicurist, denied her “calm, kind and humble” childhood friend was a villain. “I've known him all my life. He doesn't bother anyone,” Vásquez said, urging Trump and El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, to backtrack.

Xiomara Ramírez, 57, said her son had grown up with Hernández, with the pair doing homework together at her house. “I wonder why so much injustice. Why doesn't the US give good people like Andry opportunities?” Ramírez asked.

Melissa Shepard, an attorney from the California-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, representing Andry, was perplexed that her “very sweet, kind and thoughtful” client had been incarcerated in “one of the worst places in the world.

“The fact that this administration has taken somebody who is so vulnerable and put them into such a terrifying situation has just been horrific. We fear that if it can happen to him, it can happen to anyone,” she said.

Growing indignation over Hernández's plight, and that of other apparently innocent Venezuelans deported to El Salvador on the basis of their tattoos, is spreading to unexpected places.

“It's horrific,” Joe Rogan, a Trump-endorsing podcaster, said on his latest show. Rogan supported Trump's offensive against Venezuelan “criminals” the president claimed terrorised the US. “But let's not [let] innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs,” he said, asking: “How long before that guy can get out? Can we figure out how to get them out? Is there any plan in place to alert the authorities that they've made a horrible mistake and correct it?”

But the Trump administration has shown no sign of reconsidering its decision to send so many Venezuelans to El Salvador on the basis of such flimsy evidence.

On Monday, Trump thanked Bukele for receiving another group of alleged Latin American criminals “and giving them such a wonderful place to live!”

Bukele said the deportations were “another step in the fight against terrorism and organised crime”, claiming the 17 detainees were all “confirmed murderers and high-profile offenders”.

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, bristled when questioned about agents' use of a “points system” to classify detainees as gang members based on their tattoos or attire. “Shame on you and shame on the mainstream media for trying to cover for these [criminal] individuals,” she replied, claiming “a litany of criteria” was used to correctly identify “foreign terrorists” or “illegal criminal aliens” for removal.

Shepard questioned the administration's assertion that detainees such as Hernández were being “removed”. “He has been disappeared,” she said. “I know the government tries to use the language that he was ‘removed' [but] … he has absolutely been disappeared.”

Thousands of miles away in Capacho, Hernández's mother spoke sorrowfully of how her son had decided, against his family's wishes, to abandon their economically damaged country last May and make the perilous journey north through the Darién jungles between Colombia and Panama. “He left because he wanted to help us … and to fulfil his dream,” Hernández said, adding: “Now the reality is different.”

On a recent evening, she and hundreds of protesters filled the San Pedro church for their latest vigil in support of Hernández. The crowd included three men dressed as the Three Kings, who wore theatrical beards and diadems dotted with fake jewels and carried plaques bearing the words: Conscience, Justice and Freedom.

“We, his family, and the entire town vouch for [Hernández's] innocence. It's not possible that in Capacho having a crown tattoo is a symbol of pride, but for him, it makes him a criminal,” Chacón said, appealing directly to the presidents of the US and El Salvador.

“I know Trump is a good man and Bukele is a good man,” Chacón said. “But it cannot be that they have sent this young man to prison. There must be many others like him.”

Democratic New Jersey senator's address saying ‘our nation is in crisis' passed the 20-hour mark on Tuesday afternoon

Cory Booker, the Democratic US senator from New Jersey, has embarked on a marathon speech on the Senate floor to warn of what he called the “grave and urgent” danger that Donald Trump's presidential administration poses to democracy and the American people.

Booker began his speech at 7pm on Monday night and passed the 20-hour mark with barely a break in speaking at 3 pm on Tuesday afternoon.

“I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,” Booker said near the start of his speech. “I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our nation is in crisis.”

Booker said that he has heard endless stories of “pain and fear” from constituents who are both Democrats and Republicans due to the Trump administration's policies.

“Institutions that are special in America, that are unique in our country are being recklessly – and I would say unconstitutionally – affected, attacked and even shattered,” Booker said.

“In just 71 days the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for, from our highest offices, a sense of common decency.

“These are not normal times in America and they should not be treated as such. I can't allow this body to continue without doing something. The threats to America's democracy are grave and urgent.”

Booker's speech is not technically a filibuster as he is not trying to run down the Senate's time to prevent a piece of legislation from passing.

Instead, he has used his speaking slot to decry the Trump administration's spending cuts, its attempt to abolish the Department of Education, the president's attempts to bypass the judicial system and the removal of people from the US who speak out against the administration.

Booker's speech has been supported with reams of quotes from speeches by the late American politicians John McCain and John Lewis, as well as excerpts from newspaper articles.

Some of the senator's fellow Democrats have helped support him during his monologues, with several asking questions that have allowed Booker to have a break without yielding the floor.

The Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, was the first to pose a question to his New Jersey colleague, and he praised Booker for his “strength and conviction”.

“You're taking the floor tonight to bring up all these inequities that will hurt people, that will so hurt the middle class, that will so hurt poor people, that will hurt America, hurt our fiscal conditions, as you document,” Schumer said in his own question to Booker.

“Just give us a little inkling of the strength – give us a little feeling for the strength and conviction that drive you to do this unusual taking of the floor for a long time to let the people know how bad these things are going to be.”

At one point, Booker spoke about the need for bipartisanship and mentioned a recent dinner he had with Ted Cruz, the arch-conservative Republican senator from Texas. Cruz is no stranger to marathon speeches, having spoken for more than 21 hours in 2013 in an attempt to filibuster an expansion of Medicaid eligibility. At one point, Cruz read from Green Eggs and Ham, the Dr Seuss children's book.

Booker is getting close to the all-time Senate record. In 1957, Strom Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes to filibuster the Civil Rights Act of the same year.

Iran remains the primary cause of global terrorism, both directly and through its proxies, the National Security Council said on Tuesday in its public assessment of threats against Israelis abroad, ahead of spring vacations.The NSC said the assessment is intended to raise awareness among Israeli travelers regarding the threats they may face in destinations worldwide. The assessment focuses on key trends in global terrorist activity that may constitute a risk to citizens abroad.  “Iran continues to use terrorist operations as a central policy tool and as retaliation for strikes against senior Iranian, Hezbollah, and Hamas officials in the context of war in Gaza,” it said.The assessment notes that myriad Iranian-in-origin terror plots have been thwarted around the world, including attempted attacks on Israel's embassies in Sweden and Belgium, as well as various cyber or online attacks.

The NSC listed several ISIS-inspired or led attacks, including the terrorist who rammed into New Year's Eve revelers in New Orleans; multiple vehicular attacks in Germany; a stabbing incident in Austria; synagogue arson and planned bombing attacks on Jewish sites in Australia; and several firebombing and shooting incidents targeting synagogues and Jewish schools in Canada.According to the NSC, global jihadist activity remains highly concentrated in Africa (especially the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, and parts of Central Africa), the Middle East, and Asia (notably Afghanistan, the southern Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kashmir in India, and parts of Indonesia).Egypt and the Sinai PeninsulaThe NSC added that the Sinai Peninsula remains a “high-risk area for terrorist activity.”It acknowledged the area has received fewer Israeli tourists than previous years, but that, nevertheless, it is still a visitor attraction and one that is classified as a Level 4 travel warning (Severe Threat).

Rolling Stone interviews with 10 people reveal claims that Jeremy Lewin threatened a girl with a knife and openly shared racist views

An employee of Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), who was parachuted in as a senior manager at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as it was being wound up, has been accused of a history of misogyny, racism and violent outbursts.

The claims against 28-year-old Jeremy Lewin were made following an investigation by Rolling Stone magazine, which said it was based on interviews with 10 people who know him.

Among the claims are that a girl had complained to police that Lewin had threatened her with a knife, that he physically assaulted a fellow student in the cafeteria at the elite private school he attended, and that had a history of racist remarks.

The magazine said neither the Trump administration nor Lewin had responded to repeated requests for comment. Representatives for Doge did not immediately respond to the Guardian's requests for comment about Lewin, and a representative for the Department of State, which assumed control of USAID programs after it was shuttered, said it does not comment on personnel matters.

According to the magazine: “Police records show he was also once accused of threatening a girl with a knife, asking why ‘he shouldn't gut [her] and cut [her] right now,'” adding that the girl told police she feared for her life.

Lewin was recently appointed deputy administrator for policy and programmes at what remained of USAID after the Trump administration's decision to dismantle it. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that all local workers, diplomats and civil servants associated with USAID overseas had been fired, the final step in shuttering the aid organization. Congress was notified on Friday that virtually all of USAID's employees were to be fired by September and all of its overseas offices will be shuttered.

According to Rolling Stone, it was Lewin who signed the email last week officially closing USAID as he noted that he and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, were “grateful” for employees' “continued service to our great nation”.

According to the magazine, Lewin previously worked with the prominent constitutional legal scholar Laurence Tribe, a frequent critic of Trump, and those familiar with Lewin described an individual prone to violent outbursts and racially demeaning comments.

“I have a vivid memory of him telling me that he believed non-white people were inherently of ‘lower value' than white people,” a former acquaintance who called him “blatantly racist” told Rolling Stone, one of five former classmates it said made similar remarks.

Another person who knew Lewin well as a teenager recalls him being ejected from classes for espousing racist ideals. “He was into the Great Replacement Theory before it was a thing,” they said.

The claims about Lewin follow controversies over other individuals who have become promoted by Musk and Doge. In February another young Musk hire at Doge, 25-year-old Marko Elez, who previously worked for Musk's SpaceX company, resigned over racist remarks before Musk insisted he would rehire him.

A social media account connected to Elez posted a variety of inflammatory comments including the statement: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.” Another post, in September, said: “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.”

The most serious incident involving Lewin occurred at a party at his parents house in 2015.

According to the police report seen by Rolling Stone, “Jeremy started yelling at [a girl who was also at the party] and blamed her for his missing belongings.”

“[Redacted] states during the argument Jeremy pulled out a knife with an Orange [sic] handle and said ‘Tell me why I shouldn't gut you and cut you right now.' [Redacted] continued to tell [police officers] that she felt threatened by Lewin's actions and she was in fear for her life. [Redacted] then left the party and had her friend drop her off at the Newton police station.”

In the report, Lewin told police that the girl threatened him during an argument and threw a notepad at his head. He admitted taking out a knife, but said he slammed it on the kitchen countertop and asked her to leave in response.

The police officer who investigated the incident called for a hearing to be scheduled “for the charge of assault by means of a dangerous weapon”, which ultimately did not take place for reasons that are not clear.

Trump administration begins reducing Health and Human Services workforce as Kennedy plans up to 10,000 job cuts

Thousands of Health and Human Services (HHS) employees across the country are being dismissed on Tuesday as the Trump administration began implementing its controversial workforce reduction plan, which could ultimately remove 10,000 staff from the department through forced layoffs.

The job cuts mark the first tangible impact of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's departmental overhaul announced last week, landing just days after Donald Trump moved to strip collective bargaining rights from workers at HHS and other federal agencies.

Health department workers lined up outside of federal buildings in Washington DC and Maryland on Tuesday morning, some for hours, as they waited to find out if they were still employed. At least one office employee waved their badge at the entry point to see if a red or green light would appear – indicating if they still had a job or not.

One employee, who has been with the department for 20 years and was waiting in line to find out her fate, said her colleagues have known for some time that HHS would be a target under the Trump administration.

“It's in Project 2025,” she said. “Basically since February they've been telling us we might be let go.”

In the early 2000s, the department was among several others to offer legal reductions of force through voluntary buy-outs and early retirement packages. This time has been different.

“We're being led through a security line like you would if you were at TSA,” the HHS employee, who is a supervisor, said. “We have to take off our shoes, take out our laptops and they have to check our badge to make sure we can swipe it, and then check our names against a list.”

Kennedy's restructuring goal is meant to dramatically reshape the department that oversees the US's food supply, monitors disease outbreaks, conducts critical medical research, and administers health insurance for nearly half the country. He has also said he will create a new office – “the administration for a healthy America” – which is meant to absorb agencies controlling billions of dollars in funding that manage addiction services and community health centers.

When finished, the cuts are expected to reduce HHS staffing from 82,000 to 62,000 positions – slashing nearly a quarter of its workforce through a combination of layoffs and early retirement offers.

Union representatives were notified last Thursday that 8,000 to 10,000 employees would be terminated, with positions in human resources, procurement, finance and IT targeted. Jobs in “high cost regions” and those deemed “redundant or duplicative” will be prioritized for elimination, according to a reduction of force email seen by the Guardian.

The department has outlined specific job losses across a number of agencies, including 3,500 positions at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2,400 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and 300 at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

In Congress, former health and human services staffers confronted Republican lawmakers about huge department cuts and layoffs sweeping through the agency. Indiana Republican senator Jim Banks told former HHS budget analyst Mack Schroeder he “probably deserved” to lose his job “because you seem like a clown” according to video footage shared by Schroeder himself.

In a post on LinkedIn, the former CMS executive Karen Shields said one team was given a reduction in force notice that suggested they contact the former director of the office if they had a complaint. But that director died in December, Shields wrote.

“I knew her. This would have broken her heart.”

Back in Washington, the HHS employee waiting in the security line outside of her office building could not wrap her head around the motive behind the White House's plan.

“We help vulnerable people, vulnerable communities,” she said. “We're civil servants, we don't work for political parties.”

“This is not fair; normally they look at job series, performances, costs,” she added in between tears. “I don't think that's happening.”

The Israeli military struck a building in Beirut's southern suburbs early Tuesday, killing at least four people in an attack it said targeted a member of the Hezbollah militant group. The airstrike came just days after Israel launched its first attack on the Lebanese capital since a ceasefire ended fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah in November.

Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, report finding it harder to find food as bakeries were closing due to lack of flour and fuel. Israel says enough food entered Gaza during a six-week ceasefire with Hamas to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for “a long period of time,” but the U.N. says its stockpiles are critically low. 

For the past month, Israel has not allowed food, fuel or humanitarian aid to enter Gaza to pressure Hamas — a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime.

Here's the latest:

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the United Nations is “at the tail end of our supplies,” forcing the U.N. World Food Program to close all 25 of its bakeries in Gaza because of a lack of flour and cooking fuel.

“WFP doesn't close its bakeries for fun,” Dujarric said.

He said the food situation remains “very critical” since Israel closed all crossings into Gaza a month ago, cutting off all humanitarian deliveries.

COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said Tuesday that nearly 450,000 tons of aid entered Gaza during the ceasefire. COGAT claimed at least some of the aid from the U.N. and its humanitarian partners was being diverted to Hamas.

Responding to that, Dujarric said, “The U.N. has kept a chain of custody, and a very good chain of custody, on all the aid.”

A teenager from the West Bank who was held in an Israeli prison for six months without being charged died after collapsing in unclear circumstances, becoming the first Palestinian under 18 to die in Israeli detention, officials said.

Walid Ahmad, 17, was a healthy high schooler before his arrest in September for allegedly throwing stones at soldiers, his family said. Rights groups have documented widespread abuse in Israeli detention facilities holding thousands of Palestinians who were rounded up after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in the Gaza Strip.

Israel's prison service did not respond to questions about the boy's cause of death. 

The family believes Walid contracted amoebic dysentery from the poor conditions in the prison, an infection that causes diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness — and can be fatal if left untreated.

Prison authorities deny any systematic abuse and say they investigate accusations of wrongdoing by prison staff. But the Israeli ministry overseeing prisons acknowledges conditions inside detention facilities have been reduced to the minimum level allowed under Israeli law.

The Western-backed Palestinian Authority says he is the 63rd Palestinian from the West Bank or Gaza to die in Israeli detention since the start of the war.

Accompanied by German diplomats, hundreds of Gaza residents were flown from southern Israel's Ramon Airport to the German city of Leipzig on Tuesday, the Israeli Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Interior Minister Moshe Arbel visited the airport “with the aim of examining the process of voluntary departure of Gazans to a third country,” the statement said.

German officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the flight.

Israel's Cabinet recently approved a new directorate tasked with advancing the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians from Gaza, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to depopulate Gaza and rebuild it for others. The Defense Ministry said the new body would coordinate “passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries.”

Tuesday's statement appeared to be the first official announcement by Israel that Palestinians were leaving as part of such a plan.

Trump's plan has been universally rejected by Palestinians, who view it as forcible expulsion from their homeland. Human rights experts say it would likely violate international law.

The Interior Ministry statement said hundreds more Palestinians from Gaza had been flown to a third country “since the beginning of the process,” mainly to Germany, Romania and United Arab Emirates.

Dozens or Palestinians lined up outside a United Nations warehouse in northern Gaza on Tuesday to receive food parcels from the agency's rapidly dwindling supplies, as Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza for the past month.

Nageya Gaballah, a displaced woman living in a tent with 10 family members, said she wouldn't be able to secure essentials if it weren't for aid and vouchers distributed by UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. She lost her job as a cleaning staffer at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza last month and her husband is unemployed.

At the warehouse in Jabaliya, UNRWA distributed flour bags and food parcels with cooking oil, canned tuna, beans, hummus, salt, sugar and yeast.

Mohamed Ghabn, who is also unemployed, said securing food has become extremely difficult, as he cannot afford to buy it from markets when it's available, and World Food Program-supported bakeries have shut down. He said a bag of pita bread costs 30 shekels ($8) and a kilogram of tomatoes is priced at 15 shekels ($4).

“We are unemployed and don't have jobs. We're just sitting there, and we don't have shelter or anything … simply speaking, I can't feed my children,” he said.

Mohamed Salah Bardawil was a journalist with the Hamas-affiliated Aqsa Radio. He was the nephew of Salah Bardawil, a well-known member of Hamas' political bureau who Israel killed last month in a strike that also killed his wife.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike, which hit the journalist's home early Tuesday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis and killed his wife, two daughters and son.

Associated Press footage showed the building completely collapsed, with dried blood splatted on the grey rubble. Nearby, a child's school notebook, dust-covered dolls and clothing lay half-buried in the ruins.

Fathi Nushasi, a Khan Younis resident who lives nearby, said the airstrike felt like an earthquake.

“I've witnessed many wars, but I have never seen anything like what happened to us. The rubble entered our bedroom,” he said.

Dozens of people gathered at Nasser Hospital for funeral prayers, with one man crying in anguish, “Those were children sleeping!” A press vest was placed over Bardawil's body bag.

Israel has killed over 170 journalists and media workers since the war with Hamas began in October 2023, the Committee to Protect Journalists estimated as of March 24. Most recently, prominent Al Jazeera journalist Hossam Shabat was killed by a strike on his car.

Israel says enough food entered the Gaza Strip during its six-week ceasefire with Hamas to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for “a long period of time.”

U.N. agencies have warned that food is running out, and Palestinians in Gaza say markets are largely empty after Israel cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to the territory at the beginning of March to pressure Hamas.

COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said Tuesday that more than 25,000 trucks entered Gaza during the ceasefire, carrying nearly 450,000 tons of aid. It said that amount represented around a third of what has entered during the entire war.

“There is enough food for a long period of time, if Hamas lets the civilians have it,” it said.

Palestinians in the Gaza Strip say it's even harder to find food as bakeries close due to a tightened Israeli blockade of the territory.

The World Food Program was forced to close another 19 bakeries that had served hundreds of thousands of people because its supplies are dwindling, according to an internal memo circulated among aid groups on Monday.

Mohammed al-Kurd, a father of 12, said his children go to bed without dinner.

“We tell them to be patient and that we will bring flour in the morning,” he said. “We lie to them and to ourselves.” Sulaiman Hasanat, a father of seven, said his family often spends an entire day searching for bread without any luck.

Israel cut off the supply of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians in early March to pressure Hamas into accepting changes to their ceasefire agreement. Israel resumed airstrikes and ground operations later that month.

The World Food Program says it's immediately closing all of its bakeries in Gaza following a monthlong blockade by Israel into the strip. 

In an internal memo circulated among aid groups Monday, the U.N. agency said that due to the lack of humanitarian aid, its supplies are running out and it doesn't have enough wheat flour needed to make bread. 

The agency said it's distributed all available food rations, and there are unfortunately no more stocks.

For four weeks, Israel has shut off all sources of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies for the Gaza Strip's population of more than 2 million Palestinians. It's the longest blockade yet of the 17-month war with Hamas, with no sign of it ending. 

Aid workers have stretched supplies, but warn of a catastrophic surge in severe hunger and malnutrition.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has withdrawn his nomination of a former navy commander to lead the country's internal security agency after a flurry of criticism.

Netanyahu's office said in a statement early Tuesday after meeting with Vice Adm. Eli Sharvit that he “intends to examine other candidates,” without elaborating.

The nomination announced on Monday had provoked widespread criticism from allies and opponents.

Critics of Netanyahu are already up in arms over his move to fire Ronen Bar, the current head of the Shin Bet domestic security agency, viewing it as part of a broader assault on state institutions at a time when Netanyahu is on trial for alleged corruption and his aides are being investigated over links to the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar.

Israel's Supreme Court froze Bar's dismissal pending further hearings but cleared the way for Netanyahu to interview candidates for the job.

The nomination of Sharvit angered some of Netanyahu's allies after Israeli media reported that he had taken part in protests against Netanyahu's plans to overhaul the judiciary in 2023.

The move also brought an unexpected rebuke from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, who tweeted an excerpt of an op-ed Sharvit had written for an Israeli technology news website in January 2024 criticizing Trump's climate policies.

Graham called the nomination “beyond problematic.”

The Israeli military says it intercepted a projectile fired from the Gaza Strip early Tuesday that set off sirens in nearby communities.

Palestinian militants have fired a small number of rockets, without causing any casualties or damage, since Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas last month.

Israel has launched waves of airstrikes and limited ground operations, killing hundreds of Palestinians.

Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251, most of whom have since been released in ceasefires or other deals. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.

Israel's offensive has killed over 50,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants or civilians.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Online recruiting techniques and complicit local authorities have been among the details revealed by the renewed investigation of a ranch in western Mexico where authorities say the Jalisco New Generation Cartel trained its recruits.

Lured by fake job offers, those who resisted risked death.

One of Mexico's most powerful cartels, which the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says has some 19,000 in its ranks, developed rapidly into an extremely violent and capable force after it split from the Sinaloa cartel following the 2010 killing of Sinaloa cartel capo Ignacio “Nacho” Coronel Villarreal by the military.

The Jalisco cartel is led by Nemesio Rubén “el Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes, for whom the U.S. government has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture. Oseguera drew renewed attention this week after his image was projected as a band played at a music festival in Jalisco over the weekend.

The Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels have battled for control of various parts of Mexico, including Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. Both are among six Mexican organized crime groups recently designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. government.

One of authorities' recent advances against Jalisco was the arrest of José Gregorio Lastra, allegedly in charge of the cartel's recruitment.




The Jalisco cartel employs three recruiting methods: there are volunteers drawn by the pay and imagined lifestyle, which experts say make up the bulk of their number; there's targeted recruitment of ex-military and police forces, who because of their professional training enter the cartel as trainers and leaders of squads of gunmen. Finally, there's the kind of forced recruitment that investigators say happened at the Jalisco ranch.

For that last category, authorities say the cartel uses social platforms — they've identified at least 60 pages — to offer fake job opportunities, especially as security guards, with weekly salaries of $600, well above the average for such positions. Once they have the applicants, they force them to join the cartel.

One recruit who reportedly survived the ranch has said that the cartel picked up recruits at bus stations under false pretenses and took them to the ranch where they were trained for a month in the use of weapons in addition to fitness training, Mexico's Public Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch said. Those who refused or tried to escape were beaten, tortured and killed.

Security analyst David Saucedo said Jalisco's structure is vertical, with Oseguera at the top.

Last weekend, pictures of Oseguera were projected as a band started playing at a regional music festival in Jalisco. Some in the crowd cheered and on Monday President Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as Jalisco's governor, condemned the act. The Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office said it was opening an investigation. Such displays of respect for cartel leaders are not uncommon.

Below Oseguera are regional commands, as well as areas responsible for drug production and sales, Saucedo said.

The DEA says the cartel has a presence in 21 of Mexico's 32 states, exceeding the Sinaloa cartel's 19. Some analysts believe Jalisco is actually in as many as 25 states, including its home base in the state of the same name. It also maintains a presence in some 100 countries, according to the DEA.

In less than two decades, Jalisco became one of Mexico's most powerful criminal organizations and even managed to take control of some traditional strongholds of the Sinaloa cartel. Sinaloa has been weakened more recently by infighting among its factions following arrests of key leaders, including Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, who is serving a life sentence in the U.S., and Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who was arrested last July along with one of Guzmán's sons and is awaiting trial in the U.S.

Center for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology researcher Carlos Flores said Jalisco's “capacity for violent action” and style of “irregular warfare” aided its speedy rise, which coincided with the emergence of fentanyl as a highly profitable revenue stream.

Saucedo says that Jalisco has also successfully allied itself with other criminal groups, allowing it to penetrate some territories with a sort of “franchise” model as in the central state of Aguascalientes and the key border city of Tijuana.

The case of the ranch also serves as an example of how the Jalisco cartel is able to operate with impunity in territory it controls thanks to the complicity of local authorities, Flores said.

Despite being discovered in September 2024 and 10 people being arrested, the ranch's investigation stalled until family members searching for their relatives went there themselves in March and raised the alarm about hundreds of clothing items they found, as well as apparent bone fragments. Since then, authorities have detained three local police officers who were allegedly tied to disappearances at the ranch.

“There are signs that show publicly how those kinds of deals have allowed the Jalisco cartel to establish itself in certain states, while they go about eliminating their rivals, sometimes with the help of public safety forces,” Flores said.

European officials are worried that measures against companies like Google and Meta could escalate the trade war, but they say Trump has shifted the goalposts.

ROME — Scrambling to respond to the Trump administration's cascading list of tariffs, the European Union is weighing whether to hit one of the most lucrative U.S. exports: billions of dollars' worth of digital services that American Big Tech companies sell to European consumers.

The debate over digital services risks expanding the trade war from manufactured goods such as cars, steel and whiskey to services from cloud storage and satellite internet provided by U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Google, Meta and Elon Musk's Starlink network.

European officials, largely behind closed doors, have been debating for weeks the wisdom of targeting digital services with tariffs and other measures: part of a carrot-and-stick response that would also include new trade concessions to Washington. As attempts to negotiate with the Trump administration have hit a wall, several nations within the 27-member E.U. bloc are more seriously pressing to include digital services in countermeasures, according to three European officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Some nations, including France, are actively pushing for a tougher response that includes digital services, one of the officials said, adding that others, such as more Trump-friendly Italy, remain generally opposed, seeing such a move as only provoking the White House into further escalation.

But it was still possible that the bloc could unite to impose “some partial measures against American services,” the official said.

A second official said that targeting digital services had previously been viewed as an overly provocative step, but the Trump administration's continued escalation and refusal to negotiate could change that. “The goal posts have been shifted by the Americans.”

Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo addressed the question of targeting digital services Monday after meeting with the E.U. trade commissioner. “Let's wait and see what the measures are that the U.S. puts on the table, and depending on that, we will react,” he told reporters.

The discussions underscore Europe's frustrations with what they call Trump's selective grievances about trade, which have largely focused on the U.S. deficit with Europe in manufactured goods. While the E.U. enjoys a trade surplus with the United States of $170 billion on goods, it shoulders a deficit of $118 billion in services, according to 2023 European trade data.

The European officials cautioned that there is no agreed-on hit list of digital services. But discussions on what services to target could be accelerated depending on the scope of new U.S. tariffs set to be announced Wednesday. The Trump administration has already declared stinging global tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum. The Europeans remain worried that new tariffs will go significantly further, hitting food, pharmaceuticals and other key goods.

A move to target digital services risks opening an even wider rift with the White House, which warned Europe in February that its digital regulations could lead to reciprocal tariffs. The E.U. has spearheaded global tech regulation and described it as essential to preventing abuse. But Silicon Valley has long bristled at what it sees as the bloc's overly onerous rules that firms say are aimed at stifling U.S. tech companies in Europe.

Vice President JD Vance singled out the bloc's signature Digital Services Act and what he called Europe's “excessive regulation” of artificial intelligence during a speech in February at a tech summit in Paris, in comments that echoed U.S. corporate complaints.

European fines — including a penalty of 150 million euros ($162 million) that France heaped on Apple on Monday for abuse of competition laws — have also drawn U.S. ire. The European Commission, the E.U.'s executive branch, is also expected in the coming days to announce new penalties against Meta and Apple for violations of its Digital Markets Act.

“Europe has been targeting U.S. tech companies with its regulatory framework, but moving directly to tariffs would be an escalation,” said Kay Jebelli, senior director for Europe at the Chamber of Progress, a tech industry coalition group whose partners include Apple, Uber, Amazon and Google. “Europe will understandably retaliate against U.S. tariffs, but targeting tech on top of its existing regulatory interventions will only widen the digital divide.”

European officials remain cautious — concerned about provoking Trump, but also wary of undermining the bloc's own argument that its actions to date against U.S. tech companies have been regulatory in nature rather than punitive or anticompetitive.

Any move to target U.S. digital service exports would hit one of the biggest profit centers for tech companies. The U.S. exported $283 billion in digital services to Europe in 2021, more than double what it exported to the entire Asia-Pacific region, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

European officials are also discussing possible trade concessions. They have signaled their willingness to reduce the 10 percent tariff on American autos and increase purchases of U.S.-made liquefied natural gas and defense equipment. The E.U. may also be willing to reverse course on some of the $26 billion in countermeasures it announced in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, two of the European officials said.

That response targeted a host of American goods, including Harley Davidson motorcycles, bourbon and soybeans. They were set to be phased in starting Tuesday but have been delayed until mid-month, giving the bloc more time to study the impact of the American tariffs set to be announced by Trump this week.

Maros Sefcovic, the European trade commissioner, has traveled twice to Washington seeking an off-ramp from the accelerating trade war but said that the Trump administration does not want to engage in concrete negotiations until after unveiling its measures Wednesday.

Many European exporters are putting enormous pressure on their governments to reach a truce on trade with the White House, even as others say the Europeans must be prepared to fire back.

European wine producers are already reporting massive shipments stuck at port amid cancellations from U.S. importers. Other Europe-based exporters say they have received desperate calls from their U.S. distributors, asking them to consider sharing the cost of Trump's tariffs to avoid big price hikes for American consumers. Still others, such as the Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari, have outlined price increases of up to 10 percent on some models.

The E.U. can tighten rules on Big Tech or limit U.S. companies' access to public contracts without resorting to its harshest measure, called the Anti-Coercion Instrument. That tool allows the bloc to target services to respond to economic pressure with sweeping countermeasures, such as revoking patents or blocking online streaming services and software licensing.

Such moves are considered a “nuclear option,” given that they could take the trade war to new heights of rhetoric while inflicting real economic damage on both sides of the Atlantic.

Europe's exporters are calling for a measured response. Francesco Mutti, chief executive of Italian food maker Mutti, a major tomato exporter, said European leaders should wait and see what further tariffs the U.S. imposes and seek to negotiate a solution.

But he also said that Apple, Netflix and other U.S. companies that do huge business in Europe should be fair game if the Trump administration imposes restrictions on items including European foods.

“Yes, absolutely yes,” he said, calling for a “proportionate” response. “This is a break, or a reduction, in relations. I do not understand the reason.”

Follow live updates on the Trump administration. We're tracking President Donald Trump's actions by day, his progress on campaign promises, and legal challenges to his executive orders and actions.

Tariffs and the economy: A few months into his presidency, Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs shows no sign of slowing down. The tariffs have heightened concerns that the U.S. economy is heading toward a recession with Trump declining to rule one out. Here's a look at the tariffs Trump has enacted, threatened and canceled.

Signal chat leak: Top officials in the Trump administration discussed highly sensitive military planning using an unclassified chat application that mistakenly included a journalist. The Atlantic published a transcript of the Signal group chat after the administration denied that any classified material had been shared. Here's a comparison of the transcript versus several claims the administration has made about the leak.

Federal workers: The Trump administration continues to work to downsize the federal government — eliminating thousands of jobs at agencies, including: USAID, the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Education Department, the Defense Department, health agencies, the National Weather Service and the National Park Service.

U.S. DOGE Service: Elon Musk and his team have moved to dismantle some U.S. agencies, push out hundreds of thousands of civil servants and gain access to some of the federal government's most sensitive payment systems. Here's who's working for DOGE.

As Canada prepares for Trump's anticipated tariffs, Prime Minister Mark Carney appealed to his liberal party's "unwavering belief" that the economy must "serve everyone," and refuted the idea that the US will own Canada: "That will never happen."

        A torrent of online abuse has been directed at Bénédicte de Perthuis, the judge who presided over the Paris court on Monday.
    

While far-right politician Marine Le Pen vowed to appeal the conviction she was handed on Monday, the judge who presided over her case has faced a torrent of intimidating online reactions. 

Bénédicte de Perthuis, the judge who sentenced Le Pen for embezzling EU funds and barred her from running in France's 2027 presidential election, was placed under police protection on Monday night over alleged death threats she received, domestic press reported.

The fiery fallout came her way as some took offence at what they claim is political revanchism — despite de Perthuis herself emphasising that the role of the court and her as a judge was to treat Le Pen's case like any other.

“Equality before the law is a pillar of democracy. Elected officials enjoy no impunity," said de Perthuis on Monday, before she issued a judgment, which she had worked on with two other high-profile judges. 

On Monday Le Pen left the courtroom before her sentence was handed down, writing on X, "I'm told it's a judicial decision, but no, it's a political one."

Along with 24 other National Rally (RN) members, Le Pen was found guilty of a scheme using money intended for European Parliament aides to pay staff who worked for the party at its head office in France. 

The parliamentary leader of the National Rally in France's National Assembly was handed a four-year prison sentence, with two of those years suspended and two to be served outside jail with an electronic bracelet. 

Back in January, the Paris Public Prosecutor's office launched a probe into death threats posted on the far-right website Riposte Laïque — which have since been deleted — under an article entitled  "A Stalinist trial set up to ruin the RN."

The threats followed the culmination of Le Pen's nine-week trial in November and were directed at de Perthuis, as well as prosecutors Louise Neyton and Nicolas Barret. 

One user posted a comment which called for “a 9 mm bullet in the back of the court president's head.”

Another user named "Job" wrote, “I don't like that judge's face. Another leftie, a sh*t who wants to dictate their ideology. To be eliminated as soon as possible.” 

After the verdict on Monday, users on social media again targeted de Perthuis.

"Benedicte de Perthuis, you dirty d*g, we got eyes on you," one menacing post on X said.

"Far-left fascist," "red judge" and "the face of shame" who "vandalised democracy" were some of the other claims X users made regarding the Paris judge.

A three-minute video narrated by a person wearing a black mask reminiscent of a Squid Game character, claimed de Perthuis was a "symbol of judiciary power which doesn't deliver justice anymore, but rather the politics of the system".

Another widely shared post contains a photo of De Perthuis and a caption claiming that the "judiciary was at the service of (French President) Emmanuel Macron." 

Following the verdict, this and similar claims were shared in Facebook groups, many of which have nothing to do with politics, and instead are used by people interested in topics from local car-sharing to walking. 

A number of accounts sharing claims about De Perthuis on X had AI-generated profile pictures, suggesting they could be bot accounts.

France's High Council of the Judiciary (Conseil Supérieur de la Magistrature) expressed its "concern over the virulent reactions" which came after Monday's judgement. 

In a post on X, France's Justice Minister Gérard Darmanin branded the threats "unacceptable in a democracy" and "worrying for the independence of the judiciary".

Other politicians like Mathilde Pannot, president of the far-left France Unbowed Party, also said the situation was "unacceptable" and that the online threats were part of "far-right tactics".

Meanwhile, members of Marine Le Pen's Patriots for Europe party were quick to rally their support, with right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán posting "Je suis Marine" on X shortly after the verdict was handed. 

Le Pen has vowed to appeal her case "as soon as possible" and said she would use "whatever legal avenues" she could.

The retreat of the RSF has revealed the scope of looting and destruction in a city that was once a refuge of last hope for the war-weary and displaced.

Sudan's capital was once a refuge for those fleeing a countryside ravaged by successive conflicts and climate crises. For years, the war-weary and displaced came to Khartoum on donkey carts and in rickety trucks, driving population growth that was expected to continue.

Only a few years ago, the city ranked among other burgeoning megalopolises — what The Washington Post in a 2021 report called Africa's rising cities, set to dominate the world's urban future. More growth and development — even if uneven and beset by the challenge of expanding squatter camps populated by more recent arrivals — appeared inexorable.

That was before the ruinous civil war began in 2023. Sudan's military last week recaptured Khartoum from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces after nearly two years of fighting.

Photographs reveal the extent of the destruction and looting of the capital's landmarks during a devastating conflict that has killed more than 150,000 people and created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

More than 6 million people lived in the city before the ongoing civil war began. A quarter of that population, according to U.N. estimates, or more than half, according to some researchers, settled in Khartoum after displacement by war, including the decades of conflict that eventually led to the independence of South Sudan in 2011.

The current war has displaced more than 11 million people internally and pushed nearly 4 million people out of the country, according to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration. Khartoum alone, fragmented into enclaves by the conflict, accounted for nearly a third of the displaced, according to IOM figures.

In the years leading up to the civil war, Khartoum was becoming a more cosmopolitan and fashionable city, with a lively street life, said Alden Young, an associate professor of history and global affairs at Yale and author of the book “Transforming Sudan.”

“There would be tons of civic gatherings on the banks of the Nile,” said Young, adding that one of the major challenges of reconstruction would involve welcoming back and housing people displaced from the city.

The army chief and de facto head of state, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, landed on the tarmac of Khartoum International Airport in a helicopter on Wednesday after it was recaptured by the military, kissing the ground as he emerged.

The airport was stormed and occupied by paramilitary forces in April 2023 — shuttering it for nearly two years, during which time much of the airport was destroyed. A photo showed the rusted carcass of a minivan outside the terminal on Thursday. In a nearby hangar were the charred remains of an aircraft.

“Khartoum is now free,” Burhan told journalists as he toured the remains of the war-ravaged presidential palace Wednesday.

From the outside, photographs showed the palace walls blackened by fire or shelling, and parts of the roof were destroyed. The grounds were overgrown.

In an arched hall of the palace, fallen masonry and other debris littered the ground. Another room was lined with shelves of charred documents.

The destruction of Khartoum has elevated the importance of other cities such as Port Sudan, which became the country's temporary administrative capital in 2023.

“One of the questions that everyone is asking is, will Khartoum be able to recapture its status as the capital of a united Sudan?” Young said.

Photographs released by the Sudanese National Corporation for Antiquities showed the country's national museum — once billed as a “sanctuary of African art and archaeology,” with artifacts dating back to the Stone Age — plundered of its treasures.

Fears of widespread looting surfaced early in the conflict, as footage on social media appeared to show fighters raiding the museum.

The Sudan Tribune posted a video of one of the few remaining artifacts: a large statue of King Taharqa, a Nubian from the Kingdom of Kush, in what is now known as Sudan, who ruled Egypt from 690 B.C. to 664 B.C.

The museum's windows were shattered and the entrance was piled with rubble.

A pancake-style collapse of several buildings and houses has become a challenge for rescuers in earthquake-ravaged Myanmar. 

Officials said a pancake collapse means buildings have landed on other buildings. It would have been easier to rescue trapped people had it been a titled collapse, they added.

Due to the pancake collapse, rescuers are being forced to cut through heavy slabs for hours and lift mounds of rubble through earth movers to look for people who could be alive.

Meanwhile, the stench of death has permeated quake-struck Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar.

The death toll from the initial quake and a series of aftershocks has climbed to 2,719, according to Myanmar's military chief. The number of injured stands at 4,521, with more than 400 missing. Since over 72 hours have passed, the chances of finding survivors are diminishing every hour.

Locals believe scores of people remain trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings.

Days after the 7.7 magnitude earthquake devastated the city, a spate of aftershocks have exacerbated the crisis as they are threatening already damaged structures.

On Tuesday, another aftershock measuring over 5 magnitude rattled the city at 5.31 pm local time, causing at least half a dozen already damaged buildings to collapse.

Two such buildings collapsed near street 78 of Mandalay as the fresh tremor again sent panic through the streets, where hundreds of families, displaced and desperate, have set up makeshift camps.

The city is already suffering crippling shortages of medical supplies, food, water and shelter.

“We haven't dared to sleep in our houses since Friday,” said one local, echoing the sentiments of many who now live in constant fear.

Meanwhile, India's NDRF team is also pressed into the rescue and relief operations. They are using four dogs to sniff signs of life.

India has dispatched a team of 80 NDRF rescuers to its neighbouring country.

The infrastructure and communication channels of several affected cities have been damaged, making rescue and relief operations difficult.

Russian authorities have dismissed growing speculation over reports of an unidentified virus that causes patients to cough up blood and suffer from prolonged high fever, saying no new pathogens have been detected, Newsweek reported. 

Reports of a mysterious respiratory illness, initially circulated by the Telegram channel SHOT and later amplified by local media, described patients experiencing severe symptoms while testing negative for influenza and COVID-19.

Russian health officials now attribute these cases to common respiratory infections, including Mycoplasma pneumonia. In a statement, Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's public health watchdog, asserted that there is "no evidence of a new or unidentified virus circulating in the Russian Federation."

The rapid spread of such rumours highlights an ongoing challenge for health authorities in Russia and globally. The claims emerged against the backdrop of lingering public anxiety from the COVID-19 pandemic, where early miscommunication and underreporting led to delays in containment efforts.



Moscow authorities acted swiftly to investigate and dispel the reports. However, public distrust in Russian institutions remains high, particularly regarding transparency in health matters. During the COVID-19 pandemic, scepticism extended to the Russian-made vaccine, with a 2020 survey showing that 52% of 3,000 medics were unwilling to take it.

The first reports of an "unknown virus" appeared on March 29 via SHOT, a Telegram news channel with alleged ties to federal agencies. It claimed that patients in multiple Russian cities were experiencing persistent high fevers, and severe coughing- sometimes with blood and body aches, despite negative tests for influenza A, B, and SARS-CoV-2.

A woman identified as Alexandra told SHOT that by the fifth day of her illness, she began coughing up blood. "Even after a week of taking antibiotics, the coughing fits didn't stop," she said. She was later diagnosed with Mycoplasma pneumonia, a bacterial infection that mimics flu and pneumonia symptoms.

Several other cases reported by SHOT described similar symptoms, body aches, high fever, and a persistent cough. Doctors reportedly listed the diagnosis as "acute upper respiratory tract infection of unspecified origin" and advised patients to seek emergency care if symptoms worsened.

Mainstream Russian media, including Lenta.ru and Newizv.ru, picked up the reports, reiterating the claims while noting the lack of official confirmation from health authorities.

Users on Telegram channels such as Moscow Live also shared their experiences, with one writing, "It's a nightmare- my ribs hurt from coughing, I can't eat, and even the medications make me sick." 

Another user said, "The cough has lasted over a month, and the fever stayed for nearly three weeks. I got over COVID much easier."

Despite the public concern, Rospotrebnadzor reiterated on Monday that the situation remains "stable and completely controlled."

The Trump administration announced it will review almost $9 billion in grants and contracts at Harvard University, the latest school to be threatened with a federal financial penalty over campus antisemitism.The announcement of the review on Monday means that Harvard could face the same predicament as Columbia University, where the Trump administration froze $400 million in funding last month over similar claims.  Columbia later acquiesced to many of the government's demands, and its interim president resigned on Friday.“Harvard's failure to protect students on campus from antisemitic discrimination — all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry — has put its reputation in serious jeopardy,” said Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a statement.

It also includes more than $8.7 billion in “multi-year grant commitments,” according to the announcement.

The school settled two lawsuits with Jewish organizations in January over allegations that it had fostered an antisemitic atmosphere.Among the terms of the settlement were stipulations around the policing of anti-Zionist speech, more funding for the study of antisemitism, and a pledge to partner with an Israeli campus.

Garber wrote that the school would “fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry.”Garber, who is Jewish, also said he had personally faced antisemitism on campus while serving as president.“Urgent action and deep resolve are needed to address this serious problem that is growing across America and around the world. It is present on our campus,” he wrote.  “I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university,” he added.He also expressed concern over potential cuts to the school's research funding, writing that it could “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.”The recent announcement comes after the Trump administration sent letters to Harvard and 60 other universities earlier in March informing them of investigations into allegations of antisemitism on their campuses.“While Harvard's recent actions to curb institutionalized antisemitism – though long overdue – are welcome, there is much more that the university must do to retain the privilege of receiving federal taxpayer's hard-earned dollars,” said Josh Gruenbaum, the commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, in a statement.“This administration has proven that we will take swift action to hold institutions accountable if they allow antisemitism to fester. We will not hesitate to act if Harvard fails to do so,” said Gruenbaum.In recent weeks, students from other Ivy League universities, including Columbia and Tufts, have seen students detained by ICE over their involvement in pro-Palestinian protests in another sharp escalation of the administration's response.

Little over twenty-four hours before he drops the reciprocal tariff bomb for the world, including his countrymen to deal with, Donald Trump has made a stunning claim - that he heard India will drop tariffs on US imports substantially.

During a press briefing at the Oval Office in the White House, President Trump was asked about reciprocal tariffs that he would officially announce on April 2, and if that would push away some of America's allies.

In his reply, President Trump said, "I think a lot of them will drop their tariffs because they were being done in an unfair way. They've done this for years. If you look at the European Union, they already dropped their tariffs on cars down to two-and-a-half per cent. It was announced a couple of days ago. And I think I heard just a short while ago that India will be dropping its tariffs very substantially."

Mr Trump however, did not give any names or specifics which back his claim that India will be significantly reducing tariffs, which have been in place for decades. There has been no official confirmation on the matter by India either.

President Trump also denied that his reciprocal tariffs might push allies and partners more towards China. "No, it won't", said the US President bluntly.

India and the US have been negotiating on a mutually beneficial trade deal even amid repeated threats of reciprocal tariffs by the Trump Administration. The US President has called April 2 "Liberation Day" for the United States.

"A lot of countries will drop its tariffs," fearing America's move to do to them, as they do to us, claimed Mr Trump.

On a number of occasions, Donald Trump has labelled India as the "tariff king" and also said that India is one of the biggest "abuser of tariffs".

Earlier today, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt spoke about the "unfair" trade practices in India's tariff structure, highlighting how India imposes 100 per cent tariffs on agricultural imports from the US. She also mentioned similar high tariff structures by the EU (50 per cent on American dairy products), Japan (700 per cent on rice), and Canada (300 per cent on butter and cheese). These hinder and hurt US exports and leads to imbalances and trade deficits in the US, she said.

"This makes it virtually impossible for American products to be imported into these markets, and it puts a lot of Americans out of business and out of work over the past several decades," she added.

While most countries have vowed to retaliate US reciprocal tariffs, India has been one of the very few countries which wants to avoid animosity and friction, and has hence been working to find ways to manage the India-US trade ties amicably.

India has already reduced tariffs on certain products like Harley Davidson motorbikes and American bourbon whiskey. According to a Reuters report, India has apparently also offered to reduce import duties on select agricultural products. News agency Reuters also claims that India has offered reductions on more than half of US imports worth $23 billion - but only if US exempts India from any reciprocal tariff.

In its annual Union Budget for 2025, India has already announced reduction of customs duties on American solar cells, machinery, and luxury cars. India has also announced that it will remove the 6 per cent tax on digital advertisements starting April 1, 2025 - a move that will greatly benefit US tech firms like Meta, Google, and Amazon.

India and the US also aim to speed up talks of a mega trade deal much before its autumn deadline.

Police have issued a critical update concerning Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre, who, after a car crash, stated she had only four days left to live.

The Western Australia Police Force (WAPF) confirmed receiving a report of a "minor crash" involving a bus and a car north of Perth on March 24.

However, Kylie Whitely, Acting Western Australia Police Commissioner, said no injuries were reported. "There were no reported injuries as a result of the crash," the Western Australia police spokesman said in a statement, the Telegraph reported. 

In an Instagram post shared on Monday, 41-year-old Virginia Giuffre claimed she was struck by a school bus travelling at 110 km/h (68.3 mph) and had been given just four days to live. She also shared a photo that appeared to show her lying in a hospital bed with extensive facial bruising, including a black eye.





A post shared by Virginia Roberts (@virginiarobertsrising11)



Giuffre stated that she was being transferred to a specialist hospital in urology, which treats kidney and other organ-related conditions. Expressing her final wish, she wrote: "They've given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology. My last wish is to see my three children one last time."

Reflecting on the crash, she added: "No matter what your car is made of, it might as well be a tin can when a school bus comes at you at 110 km/h while you're slowing down for a turn."

A WAPF spokesperson told The Mirror that the crash, which occurred in Neergabby on March 24 just after 3 p.m., was reported by the bus driver the following day. The car sustained approximately AUD 2,000 in damage, and no injuries were reported.

Brad Edwards, who has represented Giuffre in past legal cases, described her condition as "very bad" but expressed hope that she would recover with proper medical care.

Originally from California, Giuffre now resides in Australia. She was a victim of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and has previously alleged she was trafficked to Prince Andrew. While Andrew has denied the claims, he reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022, which included no admission of liability.

Days before Donald Trump said he is "not joking" about aiming for a third term as US President, he used his presidential privilege of an executive order to introduce sweeping changes to America's voting system. A move that has now forced opposition Democrats to sue him.

"It is simply not within the president's authority to set election rules by executive decree," a statement issued by advocacy group Campaign Legal Center stated after the lawsuit was filed in a US court.

Among the massive changes in the US electoral process ordered by President Trump, a few that have analysts concerned are requiring voters to register themselves by submitting documents proving their US citizenship, else not be eligible to vote; and limiting the counting of mail-in ballots that arrive after voting day.

The Democratic Party, upset over such changes - which may impact millions of voters, and potentially sway the election result - demanded that the federal court block the President's executive order. "The President does not get to dictate the rules of our elections," said the lawsuit filed in Washington by the Democratic National Committee, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and others.

Describing the changes as "radical", the Democratic Party's lawsuit against Trump said, "The executive order seeks to impose radical changes on how Americans register to vote, cast a ballot, and participate in our democracy - all of which threaten to disenfranchise voters,"



"None of this is legal," it claimed.

Donald Trump, who signed the presidential order titled 'Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections' on March 25, called it "the farthest-reaching executive action ever taken". He had said he has done so to secure the US election from "widespread rigging".

Till date, Donald Trump does not agree with or acknowledge his defeat in the 2020 US presidential election. He has repeatedly questioned the integrity of the US electoral system. He has been very vocal about "massive election fraud" in the United States, particularly involving "absentee voting".

A faction of legal experts, who back the Democratic Party lawsuit against Trump, have denounced the presidential order as "an abuse" of his power. These changes, they say, will "prevent millions of voters from casting their ballot".

"The president's executive order is an unlawful action that threatens to uproot our tried-and-tested election systems," a statement issued by them says.

Donald Trump insists those who are coming to vote must register with proper documentation proving their citizenship - like a passport, for example. President Trump gave India's example and credited the world's largest democracy for having something called a voter card and Aadhaar card, which ensures proper registration of voters.

Though his current presidential order mentions nothing about proposing any changes to the number of terms a US President can have, Donald Trump has said he is actively considering a third term in office - which happened only once in US history, after which a two-term limit was introduced by way of a constitutional amendment.

The US Constitution limits the number of 4-year terms that a President can have to just two. These can be consecutive or non-consecutive, but cannot exceed two terms or 8 years. For Donald Trump to contest for a third term as President, his party will have to introduce a Constitutional amendment - which is difficult to achieve as it required sweeping support both in the US Congress as well as in a majority of the 50 states.

In a telephonic interview to NBC News, Donald Trump made his intentions clear. "No, I'm not joking. I'm not joking (about a third term as President)." However, he added that "it is far too early to think about it," considering his second term in office has just completed two months.

On being asked how he plans to go ahead with it, President Trump simply said, "There are methods by which you could do it, as you well know," declining to elaborate or give specifics of how or when he plans to do so.

To allow for a third term, Donald Trump and his party will have to change the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. But a proposal to overturn a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress and ratification by the legislatures of three-fourths of the 50 US states.

Some Trump allies have floated the idea of keeping Trump in the White House beyond 2028. Donald Trump, who at 78 was the oldest US president at the time of his inauguration, would be 82 if he took on another four-year term following the November 2028 election.

America's first president, George Washington, had set a precedent in 1797 by stepping down after serving two terms in office, but the two-term presidential limit was only formally codified more than 150 years later.

Only one US President - Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt - served more than two terms in the White House. President Roosevelt was elected four times - in 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944. His fourth term ended prematurely with his death on April 12, 1945. He was 63 at the time of his death.

Other former US Presidents, notably Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt, had sought a third term in office, but failed to win the nomination or re-election.

The 22nd Amendment limiting a President to two terms in office was passed in 1947 - two years after Franklin D. Roosevelt's death - by two-thirds of the House of Representatives and two-thirds of the Senate.

It was ratified by three-quarters of the 50 US state legislatures in 1951.

A woman was rescued in Myanmar's capital on Tuesday from the rubble of a high-rise building that collapsed in last week's powerful earthquake that hit the country and its adjoining regions, fire services reported.

The fire department in Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble after being buried for 91 hours. The building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit midday Friday.

While the woman was rescued, the hope of finding more survivors continued to fade. The death toll, meanwhile, has crossed 2700.

Experts say the likelihood of finding survivors drops dramatically after 72 hours, AP reported.

The head of Myanmar's military government, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, told a forum in Naypyitaw that 2,719 people have now been found dead, with 4,521 others injured and 441 missing, Myanmar's Western News online portal reported.

It has also been reported that shelter, clean water and medicine are in short supply following the earthquake in Myanmar that has caused significant structural damage and had a devastating human toll, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Tuesday.

Multiple UN Agencies have raised the alarm about the shortage of drinking water, with concerns of cholera spreading.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said hospitals were overwhelmed and that medical supplies were running out, and that there were shortages of running water and fuel.

Just days after the deadly quake, the ruling military regime resumed bombing parts of the war-torn country where it lost crucial territory over more than a year of intense fighting.

Pro-democracy rebel groups reported fresh airstrikes in areas close to the epicentre. The ruling State Administration Council's spokesman, Major General Zaw Min Tun, did not respond to requests seeking comment.

He has previously said the military government is busy with rescue efforts, highlighting efforts to find survivors in collapsed buildings.

        Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia had legal protection from being deported to his home country of El Salvador, from which his lawyers say he fled aged 16.
    

The Trump administration has admitted to deporting a Maryland resident to a Salvadoran mega-prison due to an "administrative error" despite a court order barring him from being sent to the country.

While it appeared to acknowledge the mistake, the government then argued it could not return him to the US, where court records filed by his lawyers state he has lived since 2011, and has a family. 

Attorneys for the US government conceded in a court filing on Monday that they deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national living in Maryland with his wife and five-year-old son, despite him being legally protected from being returned to his country of origin.

Both his wife and child, who is disabled, are US citizens, lawyers told the court. 

“Although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the government stated in its filing.

The defendants said the US did not have jurisdiction to secure his return from the notorious CECOT prison. 

Abrego Garcia was granted protected legal status by an immigration judge in 2019 which prohibited the government from deporting him to El Salvador.

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia stated that he came to the US around the age of 16 after fleeing gang violence. "Beginning around 2006, gang members had stalked, hit, and threatened to kidnap and kill him in order to coerce his parents to succumb to their increasing demands for extortion," they said in their filing. 

The Salvadoran national has no criminal record in the US or any other country, according to his legal team. It said he has no gang affiliation, despite claims by the US government, which Abrego Garcia's lawyers said "has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded accusation". 

In the government court filing, which was first reported by The Atlantic, the government downplayed concerns that Abrego Garcia was likely to be tortured or killed in CECOT.

The case appears to be a first: Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told the magazine that he had never seen a case in which the government knowingly deported someone who had already been granted protected status.

Lawyers for the plaintiff said that immigration authorities "would have no legal impediment" in deporting him to any other country except for El Salvador, claiming that the "defendants found those legal procedures bothersome, so they merely ignored them and deported Plaintiff Abrego Garcia to El Salvador anyway". 

When contacted by Euronews, the US Department of Homeland Security insisted that it possessed "intelligence reports" that Abrego Garcia was a gang member. 

"Whether he is in El Salvador or a detention facility in the US, he should be locked up," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Euronews.

Euronews also contacted ICE for comment.

The Trump administration on 16 March deported more than 250 Venezuelans without a hearing to a maximum security prison in El Salvador under a deal with the Central American country. 

The government accused them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang and deported them under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 – legislation which has been invoked just three times in US history.

After seeing a photo in a news article about CECOT, where prisoners' faces were not visible, Abrego Garcia's wife identified her husband based on his tattoos and two scars on his head.

By Andrew Osborn

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia cannot accept U.S. proposals to end the war in Ukraine in their current form because they do not address problems Moscow regards as having caused the conflict, a senior Russian diplomat said, suggesting U.S.-Russia talks on the subject had stalled.

The comments by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov suggest Moscow and Washington have so far been unable to bridge differences which President Vladimir Putin raised more than two weeks ago when he said U.S. proposals needed reworking.

They come as U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be growing increasingly impatient with what he has suggested might be foot-dragging over a wider deal by Moscow.

Trump in recent days has said he is "pissed off" with Putin and has spoken of imposing sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil if he feels Moscow is blocking a deal.

Ryabkov, a specialist in U.S.-Russia relations, said Moscow was not yet able to move forward with a deal however.

"We take the models and solutions proposed by the Americans very seriously, but we can't accept it all in its current form," Ryabkov was quoted by state media as telling the Russian magazine "International Affairs" in an interview released on Tuesday.

"As far as we can see, there is no place in them today for our main demand, namely to solve the problems related to the root causes of this conflict. It is completely absent, and that must be overcome."

Putin has said he wants Ukraine to drop its ambitions to join NATO, Russia to control the entirety of four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, and the size of the Ukrainian army to be limited. Kyiv says those demands are tantamount to demanding its capitulation.

'VERY COMPLEX'

Asked about Trump's latest remarks about wanting Putin to do a deal on Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier on Tuesday that Moscow was "continuing our contacts with the American side".

"The subject is very complex. The substance that we are discussing, related to the Ukrainian settlement, is very complex. This requires a lot of extra effort."

Russia also said on Tuesday it was fully complying with a U.S.-brokered moratorium on attacking Ukraine's energy facilities.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told state TV that Defence Minister Andrei Belousov had briefed Putin on alleged Ukrainian violations during a meeting of Russia's Security Council on Tuesday. Russia passed a list of the violations to U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Lavrov said.

Before the weekend, Trump had taken a more conciliatory stance towards Russia that has unnerved the United States' European allies as he tries to broker an end to the conflict in Ukraine, now in its fourth year.

But in recent days, and amid lobbying by Europeans such as Finland's president urging him to hold Russia to account, he has adopted a tougher tone.

        The new directive is aimed against “exploitative” ticketing scalping for concerts – an issue which is not exclusive to the US.
    

Donald Trump invited rocker and MAGA supporter Kid Rock into the Oval Office and signed an executive order that he says will help curb ticket scalping and bring “commonsense” changes to the way live events are priced.

Kid Rock campaigned for regulations and legislation to be implemented when it comes to online ticket purchases, citing the “unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct” in the ticket resale market. 

The president said rising fees for concerts and other events have “gotten worse and worse with time.”

Kid Rock, wearing a red bedazzled suit featuring an American flag motif and a straw fedora, agreed: “Anyone who's bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years — no matter what your politics are — knows that it's a conundrum.”

“You buy a ticket for $100, by the time you check out it's $170, you don't know what you're charged for.”

The order directs authorities to enforce the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act, a federal law designed to prevent scalpers from buying tickets in bulk using bots in 2016.

Additionally, it instructs US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi to ensure that ticket resellers are entirely compliant with IRS regulations and other laws, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) working with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce antitrust laws in the concert industry.

Kid Rock continued: “These bots come in and get all the good tickets to your favourite shows, and they're re-listed immediately for a 4-500 per cent markup. The artists don't see any of that money.”

“Ultimately, I think this is a great first step. I'd love down the road if there would be some legislation that we can actually put a cap on the resale of tickets. I'm a Capitalist and for deregulation, but they've tried this in some places in Europe and it seems to be the only thing that lets us as artists get the hands in artists at the price we set.” 

Attempts to curb scalping in Europe have had mixed results.

The most recent and headline-grabbing instance has been for the highly awaited Oasis reunion tour.

The band mentioned efforts to prevent touts from re-selling tickets at inflated prices, saying that tickets sold for profit on other sites would be cancelled. However, when tickets finally went on sale and rapidly sold out, it was reported that roughly 50,000 tickets ended up on resale sites.

It was then announced in February that thousands of tickets were cancelled by Ticketmaster in a crackdown on bots. However, many infuriated fans claimed they were targeted wrongfully and then faced with surging ticket prices.

Secondary ticket swap sites such as Viagogo, TicketSwap and the Oasis-approved Twickets have become a widespread part of the live event market in recent years. 

Ostensibly intended as a means for gig-goers to sell on tickets to other fans when they can't attend due to unforeseen circumstances, these secondary sites are regularly filled with tickets for popular events snapped up by touts being advertised for significantly above the original asking price. 

According to the BBC, some of the tickets listed on these secondary sites for the upcoming Oasis tour were being sold for as much as £119,000 (€143,000). A quick check through StubHub and Viagogo found multiple examples of tickets being sold for thousands of euros.

Scientists at the world's largest atom smasher have released a blueprint for a much bigger successor that could help solve some of the remaining enigmas of physics.

The plans for the Future Circular Collider: a nearly 57-mile loop along the French-Swiss border and even below Lake Geneva, published late on Monday put the finishing details on a project roughly a decade in the making at Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research.

The study lays out features like the proposed path, environmental impact, scientific ambitions and cost of the project.

Independent experts will take a look before Cern's two-dozen member countries – all European except for Israel – decide in 2028 whether to go forward, starting in the mid-2040s at a cost of some 14 billion Swiss francs (about £12.5 billion).

Cern officials have touted the promise of scientific discoveries that could drive innovation in areas like cryogenics, superconducting magnets and vacuum technologies that could benefit humankind.

Outside experts pointed to the promise of learning more about the Higgs boson, the elusive particle that helped explain how matter formed after the Big Bang.

“This set of reports represents an important milestone in the process, but a full sense of the likelihood of it being brought to fruition will only be known through careful studies by scientists, engineers and others, including politicians who must make difficult decisions at time when uncertainty rules the day,” said Dave Toback, a professor of physics and astronomy at Texas A&M University, in an email.

The new collider “provides and exciting opportunity for the particle physics community, and indeed all of physics, on the world stage,” said Prof Toback, who was not affiliated with the study, and who worked for years at the Fermilab Tevatron collider in the United States that was shut down in 2011.

For roughly a decade, top minds at Cern have been cooking up plans for a successor to the Large Hadron Collider, a network of magnets that accelerate particles through a 17-mile underground tunnel and slams them together at velocities approaching the speed of light.

Work at the particle collider confirmed in 2013 the existence of the Higgs boson – the central piece in a puzzle known as the standard model that helps explains some fundamental forces in the universe.

Cern scientists, engineers and partners behind the study considered at least 100 different scenarios for the new collider before coming up with the proposed circumference at an average depth of 200 metres.

The tunnel would be about five metres in diameter, Cern said.

“Ultimately what we would like to do is a collider which will come up with 10 times more energy than what we have today,” said Arnaud Marsollier, a CERN spokesman.

“When you have more energy, then you can create particles that are heavier.”

A bigger collider would also offer greater precision to help plumb particularities of the Higgs boson, which “we have kind of a blurry image of” now, he added.

        Brussels has a "strong plan to retaliate" against Trump's reciprocal tariffs, Ursula von der Leyen has said while calling for a "negotiated solution".
    

The European Union holds "a lot of cards" that can be leveraged to negotiate, dissuade and, if needed, "push back" against Donald Trump's plan to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs on all America's trading partners, Ursula von der Leyen has said on the eve of what the US president has dubbed "Liberation Day".

Trump, whose unprecedented initiative has antagonised long-time allies, rattled stock markets and raised the spectre of recession, has said his tariffs would target "all countries" as a starting point and then "let's see what happens".

For the bloc, the reciprocal tariffs will come on the heels of 25% duties on steel, aluminium and car exports. The European Commission has presented countermeasures to retaliate against those but delayed their introduction until mid-April.

With a new, larger raft of Trump tariffs now imminent, the Commission is hardening its tone and warning its response will have no red lines.

"Let me be clear: Europe did not start this confrontation. We think it is wrong," von der Leyen said on Tuesday, speaking before the European Parliament.

"We have everything we need to protect our people and our prosperity. We have the largest Single Market in the world. We have the strength to negotiate. We have the power to push back. And the people of Europe should know: together we will always promote and defend our interests and values. And we will always stand up for Europe."

The Commission president said tariffs would raise prices for everyday consumers, destroy jobs, create a "bureaucratic monster" at customs and be a "nightmare" for US companies that sell their goods to Europe. She also predicted the duties would run counter to Trump's much-touted agenda to re-industrialise America.

"This confrontation is in no one's interest," she said.

Throughout her speech, von der Leyen insisted the Commission's goal would be a "negotiated solution" to prevent what is rapidly shaping up to be an all-out trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic, which analysts expect to have disastrous economic consequences at a time of heightened global uncertainty.

"We will approach these negotiations from a position of strength. Europe holds a lot of cards: from trade to technology to the size of our market," von der Leyen said.

However, she pointedly added, if these talks fail to yield a compromise, Brussels will not hesitate to take "firm countermeasures", with all options on the table.

Commission officials have already signalled the potential response might go beyond the traditional tit-for-tat on goods and include services, which have so far remained untouched. In 2023, the EU recorded a surplus of goods with the US worth €156.6 billion but a deficit of services worth €108.6 billion.

"We would all be better off if we could find a constructive solution," von der Leyen told lawmakers in Strasbourg. 

"At the same time, it also has to be clear: Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate but we have a strong plan to retaliate if necessary."

As trade tensions increase, von der Leyen has intensified her engagement with the leaders across the bloc to ensure a unified front against the White House.

While heads of state and government agree the Trump tariffs cannot go unanswered, they disagree on which products should be targeted in reaction, fearing the countermeasures could damage key industries of their domestic economies.

Many professionals neglect their health in a rush to meet deadlines, chase career goals, and juggle responsibilities. For some, this always-on work culture can seriously compromise their health. Reminding people of the dangers, a CEO and founder posted a LinkedIn share describing how he learned the hard way that “work is important, but health is non-negotiable.”

Amit Mishra recalled how, while working on his laptop, he suddenly had unstoppable nose bleeds that landed him in the ICU. Once he reached the hospital, the doctors found that his blood pressure (BP) had increased to 230.

Misra wrote that he had “no headaches, no dizziness, no warnings, no history of BP” but still landed in this “unexpected crisis.” What happened next was even more puzzling; his BP dropped drastically the next day.

Though the CEO is still under treatment and doctors are trying to find out the reason behind the increase in his BP, he reminded people of what this scary incident taught him.

“Your body doesn't always give clear warnings. High BP, stress, and health risks can be silent killers. Regular checkups are a must,” he wrote, “Work is important, but health is non-negotiable. We often ignore small signs, thinking we're fine, until we're not,” he added.

He further added a piece of advice for working professionals, “Listen to your body. Don't wait for a wake-up call like mine.”

What did social media say?While people wished him a speedy recovery, some also joined in on the conversation about prioritising health over professional life. An individual posted, “I wish you a healthy recovery. This happened to me a few years back, though it was not this serious. Take care of yourself and prioritise health over everything. That would be my advice to everyone.” Another suggested, “Exercise is something that we in India neglect badly. We often see people over 50 just end up going for a normal walk as a start. In fact, sports is something that should be part of our daily routine right from youth/childhood.” Also Read: Texas man declares himself CEO of LinkedIn: ‘You can just say you worked anywhere'A third commented, “Get well soon, I will act on your wisdom - ‘Listen to your body, don't wait for the wake-up call' and with your permission, I will use this Sermon in my sessions for entrepreneurs and top professionals who tend to keep health on hindsight. Get well soon.” A fourth wrote, “Unfortunately, everybody is in the rat race. Requirements have been unnecessarily inflated. Societal pressure is blurring reality and influencing people to make nonsensical choices. All these add up to eroding the most important wealth, which is health. I wish you a speedy recovery.” Who is Amit Mishra?According to his LinkedIn bio, he completed BA in Economics from D.A.V. (Dayanand Anglo Vedic) College in Kanpur. After two years, he founded his own company. After that, he worked as a sales manager for the next few years. In 2017, he founded Dazeinfo Media & Research Pvt Ltd.

One analyst called China's large-scale drills a “pre-invasion operation” as it ramps up attacks on Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, calling him a “parasite.”

With warships and a barrage of propaganda, the Chinese military launched large-scale military drills on Tuesday to protest Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's increasingly forceful rejection of Beijing's claim to rule the self-governed island democracy.

The exercises involve army, navy, air and rocket forces practicing a coordinated seizure of the sea and airspace around Taiwan, blockading Taiwanese sea lanes and launching attacks against maritime and ground targets, China's Eastern Theater Command said in a statement.

The announcement was accompanied by posters declaring that the Chinese military was “closing in” on “Taiwan separatists” and a series of unusually personal attacks on Lai. In one animation, the democratically elected president of Taiwan was depicted as a poisonous “parasite” trying to hijack Taiwan — until he ultimately met a fiery end.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office called the drills “severe punishment” for Lai's “rampant provocation” with recent actions that “exposed his ugly side of being anti-peace, anti-exchange, anti-democracy, and anti-humanity.”

“It's not just a drill,” said Huang Chung-ting, an associate research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, a government-funded think tank. “To be concrete about the threat these Chinese exercises pose to Taiwan, we should call it a pre-invasion operation.”

By specifically targeting Taiwan and blaming Lai, Huang said, China is engaging in “cognitive warfare” that is gradually making Taiwanese numb to the real threats they face.

The Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan but calls the island of 23 million its “sacred territory.” The party's powerful leader, Xi Jinping, calls unification “inevitable” and regularly threatens to take control by force if Taipei refuses to submit.

Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have continued to escalate since President Donald Trump entered the White House, as both Beijing and Taipei try to work out whether his “America First” foreign policy means the United States will pull back from protecting Taiwan.

While the U.S. is law-bound to help Taiwan boost its own defenses, Washington has always been deliberately vague about whether it would send American troops to help fend off a Chinese invasion.

Many in Taipei have watched Trump's ebbing support for Ukraine with concern that Taiwan could be next, although those fears have been partly alleviated by an internal Pentagon memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth calling for the U.S. military to prioritize deterring a Chinese takeover of Taiwan.

Beijing has sought to undermine Lai by exploiting rising doubts about American support.

“History proves that the U.S. only gives Taiwan superficial ‘rock-solid' support, while long preparing to ‘abandon Taiwan' for its own interests,” the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper said Tuesday.

Beijing especially dislikes Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party he leads for previously advocating formal independence. As vice president then as president, Lai softened his stance and promised to focus on keeping the peace across the Taiwan Strait.

But Beijing again expressed outrage last month when Lai labeled China a “foreign hostile force” and revived martial-law-era military courts to punish Chinese spies. He also pledged to raise defense spending to 3 percent of gross domestic product, the highest level in a decade.

From Beijing's perspective, Lai's designation was “another huge step on the path of provoking Taiwan independence,” said Xin Qiang, director of the Center for Taiwan Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.

Labeling China an outside power is “a huge provocation to Beijing politically and blocks the mainland's expectations for peaceful reunification,” Xin said.

Aside from calling him a parasite, the Chinese military also accused him of Joseph McCarthy-like tactics to take down his political opponents and likened him to the demon boss from “Black Myth: Wukong,” a popular Chinese video game.

“We want to warn the Lai administration that if they continue to pursue ‘independence,' the People's Liberation Army will take further action,” Lt. Col. Fu Zhengnan, a researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, told state media.

Professor Zheng Jian of Xiamen University's Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies even compared Lai to Adolf Hitler in using populism to drive young people against China.

Lai's office condemned the drills Tuesday and called Beijing a “recognized troublemaker” for its military harassment across the Asia-Pacific. “Taiwan's determination to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait remains unchanged,” spokeswoman Kuo Ya-hui said.

Beijing often uses extreme threats to put psychological pressure on Taiwan's leaders and sap the Taiwanese people's hope in their ability to defend against a Chinese attack.

Those tactics are increasingly combined with real-world preparation for an invasion, however.

Beijing has staged similar large-scale drills with increasing regularity over the past three years to probe Taiwan's defenses. The People's Liberation Army often uses the exercises to mimic blockades or potential lines of attack.

It was unclear how large the current drills will be or how long they will last. Unlike previous rounds, Eastern Theater Command did not give a planned conclusion date nor did it announce exclusion zones that would indicate the scale of operations planned.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry said that China sent 71 fighter jets and 21 warships, including an eight-vessel carrier strike group, into the air and seas close to Taiwan between 7 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. local time Tuesday.

Six teams of Chinese Coast Guard ships also took part in the drills, with two vessels entering restricted waters near one of Taiwan's outlying islands, Dongyin, on Tuesday, Taiwan's Coast Guard said.

This time, China appears to be focusing on “a single command theater's ability to conduct joint operations across the army, navy, air force and rocket forces,” said Lin Ying-yu, a Chinese military expert at Tamkang University in Taipei.

The gradual ratcheting up of activity in frequency and complexity raises the possibility that “drills could escalate into actual conflict,” Lin said.

Shepherd reported from Singapore, Chiang from Taipei and Li from Seoul.

Rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building in Myanmar's capital on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the earthquake that killed at least 2,000, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a bloody civil war.

The Myanmar fire department in the Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble early on Tuesday, 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that occurred at midday on Friday.

The earthquake's epicentre was near the country's second-largest city, Mandalay, and so far the military-run government has reported 2,065 people killed, more than 3,900 injured and 270 missing.

Those figures are widely expected to rise, but the earthquake hit a wide swathe of the country, leaving many areas without power, telephone or mobile phone connections and damaging roads and bridges, leaving the full extent of the devastation hard to assess.

Most of the reports so far have come from Mandalay and Naypyitaw.

The World Health Organisation said overall, more than 10,000 buildings are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged in central and north-west Myanmar.

The earthquake also rocked neighbouring Thailand, causing a high-rise building under construction to collapse and burying many workers.

Two bodies were pulled from the rubble on Monday but dozens were still missing. Overall, there were 20 people killed and 34 injured in Bangkok, primarily at the construction site.

An estimated 14 million undocumented migrants in the United States, lurking in fear of deportation, are resorting to desperate measures to avoid the gaze of immigration agents allegedly scouting neighbourhoods to look for “illegals”.

Residents and immigrant rights advocacy groups told news agency AFP that the fear of deportation, have prompted undocumented migrants to go underground and pull out their children from schools to avoid detection.

Many have also formed online communities on messaging apps like WhatsApp to stay informed of enforcement actions around their communities, the AFP report said.

Rosario (name changed), a 35-year-old mother of two, entered the United States in 2021 after an arduous journey. She has been living underground in her Washington home and anxiously scrolls through community groups to keep informed of real-time updates, often unverified or false information.

“You stay informed and stay a little more alert thanks to the group. That way, you get rid of fear a little bit -- but fear always persists,” she said while looking through her window blinds for any lurking agents from ICE -- the Immigration and Customs Enforcement department.

Rosario is unable to verify the information but remains confident that the group, helped by other immigrants and advocates, provided reliable information that helped her decide on daily activities to avoid potential detection.

Despite a rise in raids and arrests, the number of deportation flights since Trump took office on January 20 has been roughly the same as those in the final months of President Joe Biden's administration, AFP reported. But communities are shocked by the Trump administration's rhetoric and tactic to publicise raids and widely share videos of deportees being shackled on military flights.

A director of an immigration advocacy group in Washington echoed a similar argument, “In the current scary climate, it is hard to know what's true, what's inaccurate. (Its hard to) decipher fact from fiction,” he said, requesting anonymity.

Last month an online video of claiming arrest by immigration agents was found to have been staged by AFP during its fact checking. Another video of an undocumented Colombian woman being expelled was also found to be a fictionalized clip posted in 2023 by an American YouTuber.

Fear is also amplified by the Trump administration's decision not to exempt sensitive locations like the schools, hospitals and religious places from enforcement action by immigration agents. Messages of raids on such places keep undocumented migrants on the edge.

Venezuela is set to have its first female saint following approval from Pope Francis.

On Monday, he paved the way for the canonisation of Blessed Maria Carmen Rendiles by authorising a decree recognising a miracle attributed to her, the founder of the Congregation of the Handmaids of Jesus.

A date for her canonisation has not been set.

Carmen Rendiles was born on August 11 1903 in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, and died there on May 9 1977.

From a young age, following her father's death, Sister Rendiles helped her mother support the family and worked at a local parish.

She joined a French congregation in Venezuela in 1927 and became a novice at age 24. In 1961, supported by the local Catholic hierarchy, she founded an autonomous congregation.

The Catholic bishops conference of Venezuela said in a news release on Monday that she struggled with the loss of an arm, but her physical deficiency “did not prevent her from developing an exemplary Christian life”.

Catholic leaders in Venezuela requested her canonisation in 1995. She was beatified in 2018.

According to the Vatican, Sister Rendiles miraculously cured a young woman diagnosed with a type of hydrocephalus, a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid builds up within the brain.

Her condition had worsened until a Mass was celebrated before Sister Rendiles' grave.

Loved ones prayed for her recovery. And after the sick woman touched Sister Rendiles' portrait, her health improved.

“The young woman's recovery was complete, stable and long-lasting, and the event was deemed scientifically inexplicable,” the Holy See said in a written statement.

Earlier this year, Pope Francis approved the canonisation of Blessed Jose Gregorio Hernandez, born in October 1864, known as “the poor's doctor”, the first Venezuelan layperson to be beatified.

President Donald Trump's administration is done with talking about the group war chat scandal. And so should everyone else now, too.

That appeared to be the message on Monday from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, after she was asked for an update on any review into the fiasco that saw the number of The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg accidentally added to an exchange on the messaging app Signal in which top Trump officials discussed a war strike on Yemen.

“This case has been closed here at the White House, as far as we are concerned,” said Leavitt. “There have been steps made to ensure that something like that can obviously never happen again.”

Leavitt didn't detail exactly what the “steps” were.

“We're moving forward,” she added.

Critics, though, argued the case hadn't really been opened and demanded accountability for the security gaffe that, so far, appears not to have seen any official face consequences.

Aid agencies say the workers were killed and buried in a mass grave in Rafah in southern Gaza. Residents described being shot at along the evacuation route.

JAFFA, Israel — Israel on Monday ordered the evacuation of most of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, warning that the military is “returning to combat in great force” in the area, a day after the bodies of more than a dozen emergency personnel, missing for a week after responding to a strike, were recovered from a mass grave in the city.

Over the past week, the Israeli military has pushed back into Rafah, launching air and artillery strikes, sending troops into several neighborhoods and forcing Palestinians who had recently returned under a ceasefire to flee once again, according to residents who escaped the bombardments and gunfire.

The evacuation order Monday was the largest since Israel resumed military operations in Gaza nearly three weeks ago, covering swaths of Rafah that, while mostly destroyed, hosted many families who returned during a two-month ceasefire that began in January. In a statement, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Avichay Adraee directed Palestinians toward Mawasi in western Gaza, an Israeli-designated “humanitarian zone” that many Rafah residents had left just weeks ago.

Israel has long seen the control of Rafah, which sits on the border with Egypt, as crucial to stemming the flow of weapons and goods to Hamas, the militant group that ruled Gaza before the war. But Israeli leaders have also warned of plans to expand operations across the territory, including a much larger ground campaign that could culminate in the long-term occupation of Gaza.

The Washington Post spoke to eight residents who recently fled Rafah and described harrowing scenes as intensive strikes began in the city late on March 22, days after Israel broke a two-month ceasefire with Hamas and unleashed strikes that killed more than 400 people in a single night on March 18.

“They bombed the house right in front of us,” said Sanaa Abu Taha, 42, who was staying in the rubble of her home in the Saudi neighborhood of Rafah before fleeing on March 23. “Three people on our street were killed. … The shooting did not stop.”

Amid the chaos of the first night, the Palestine Red Crescent Society dispatched two ambulances to the scene of a strike in Rafah's Hashashin area shortly before 4 a.m. on March 23, according to PRCS spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh.

The dispatchers soon lost contact with one of the ambulances, she said, and paramedics in the other vehicle were sent to search for their missing colleagues. Not long afterward, they relayed what they saw: The ambulance was found near vehicles belonging to the United Nations and Gaza's civil defense. The paramedics had been shot and were wounded, Farsakh said, and PRCS dispatched two more ambulances to retrieve the injured.

The organization also lost contact with those ambulances, but not before one of the medics briefly called the dispatch center and Israeli forces could be heard speaking in the background, Farsakh said.

For days, the paramedics were missing, along with a team from Gaza's civil defense and a staffer with the U.N. But on Sunday, the PRCS, the civil defense force and the U.N. all said they had recovered their colleagues' bodies in a mass grave in Rafah, including eight paramedics, six civil defense workers and one U.N. staff member. In a statement, PRCS called the incident a “massacre.”

“They were killed in their uniforms. Driving their clearly marked vehicles. Wearing their gloves. On their way to save lives,” Jonathan Whittall, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Gaza and the West Bank, wrote on X.

He described the efforts to find the teams, including on the first of day of Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. “This should never have happened,” Whittall wrote.

In a statement, the IDF said its forces opened fire at vehicles after they “advanced suspiciously toward the troops … eliminating a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.” The IDF said an initial investigation found that “some” of the vehicles had been ambulances and fire trucks. It did not provide evidence of the claim that militants were in the convoy and did not respond when asked why the first responders were buried in a mass grave.

The IDF also said that the vehicles were moving “without prior coordination,” though Adraee, the military spokesman, published an evacuation order for the area on his X account several hours after the incident. Farsakh said the area was not a “red zone” when the ambulances were dispatched, as it is the organization's policy to generally not send first responders to closed military areas where coordination is needed.

“We demand answers and justice,” U.N. humanitarian affairs chief Tom Fletcher said Monday.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. It launched the war in response to the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, a rampage that killed about 1,200 people.

Hamas and allied militants also took 251 hostages into Gaza, some of whom are still in captivity. The IDF said Saturday that its “troops located and recovered findings associated with the body of” Menachem Godard, who was killed on Oct. 7, 2023. The IDF said the remains were found in “an outpost area in Rafah” belonging to Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally.

Residents said that as they fled Rafah last week, they were being fired on by the Israeli military or seeing the bodies of people who were shot along the evacuation routes. “It was like a video game,” said Mustafa Jabar, 36, who said he saw more than 10 bodies on the ground as he fled the Saudi neighborhood with his extended family on March 23.

Haroun al-Karnab, 29, said “the gunfire was random” as he evacuated from Rafah's Tel al-Sultan neighborhood the same day, adding that it did not appear that Israeli troops were clashing with militants. In his post on X, Whittall said he and his team “witnessed a woman shot in the back of the head” as they were traveling to the area where the paramedics were buried. “When a young man tried to retrieve her, he too was shot.”

In a statement, the military denied firing on civilians leaving Rafah, saying that it “completely rejects the claims.”

“The IDF allows the civilian population to evacuate from combat zones in the Gaza Strip to protect noncombatant civilians,” it said.

Rafah residents said that the IDF dropped leaflets and sent text messages with an evacuation route but that they had little notice, could take few if any belongings and were fearful of the path provided. The IDF route directed Palestinians to a makeshift checkpoint and inspection cameras set up near an abandoned U.N. warehouse.

Haya Abu Labda, 25, said she lost her brother-in-law, 15-year-old Mustafa, in the mayhem of the evacuation. The family had split up because her husband wanted to wait with his grandmother, she said. Neighbors later said they saw Mustafa lying on the ground, shot dead, near a military checkpoint. He had a cart carrying some food and clothes, and it appeared he had taken a route not designated by the IDF, Abu Labda said.

With no belongings and nowhere to go, the extended Abu Labda family has fled to Mawasi, which they left only weeks ago.

“Until this moment, I still cannot believe what happened,” she said.

Harb reported from London. Farouk Mahfouz reported from Cairo.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

Newsmax stock (NMAX) soared as high as 173% Tuesday, extending its massive 735% gain on Monday following the conservative cable news outlet's IPO.

Newsmax raised $75 million in its IPO Friday, with shares priced at $10. The outlet's rapid ascent in its first two days of trading pushed its market cap to more than $20 billion Tuesday afternoon, with shares trading as high as $228.

“This incredibly successful offering, combined with our previous Preferred Offering, provides us with the capital and financial freedom to accelerate our growth initiatives, expand our programming, and further enhance our digital presence,” said CEO Christopher Ruddy, a media mogul and friend of President Trump who founded the company in 1998.

Newsmax, which became a cable TV network in 2014, has faced an onslaught of critiques and legal battles for touting conspiracy theories. The company is facing an ongoing lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems seeking $1.6 billion in damages related to false claims it made in its coverage of the 2020 election, which Newsmax cited among risk factors to its business in its latest 10-K filing to the SEC.

Newsmax settled another lawsuit with another election tech company, Smartmatic, in 2024 for similar claims and has paid $20 million of the $40 million settlement thus far, according to the filing. The news outlet, seen as a Fox News alternative, also drew criticism when it reported false claims and conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol.

While Newsmax's revenue soared roughly 26% to roughly $171 million in 2024, the company lost $72 million that year. The company also said in its filing that it has identified "material weaknesses" in its financial reporting controls such that there may be "a material misstatement" in its financial statements that it may not detect "on a timely basis."

Oops, something went wrong

A staple of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign trail rhetoric returned this week with a version of 20% "blanket" tariffs now apparently being considered as the president struggles to fill in the details of his “Liberation Day” promises.

The potential move, applying to all or most goods imported to the United States, would represent a dramatic pivot of sorts for the president amid implementation worries and political complications that have dogged the White House's long-promised plan for more specific country-by-country duties.

But it would also mark a return to an approach to trade that Trump has long championed despite varied warnings from economists that it could have the deepest of consequences for the US economy.

The Yale Budget Lab Tuesday tabulated that a move toward true blanket tariffs would stoke inflation by more than 2% and — assuming no countermeasures from the Federal Reserve — create a loss of buying power of $3,400-$4,200 per household.

The researchers added that 20% duties, if added on top of existing tariffs, would make the average effective US tariff rate the highest since 1872 at 32.8%.

A previous estimate from the Tax Foundation has also put the cost in the thousands and found that 20% blanket duties would represent an average tax increase on US households of $2,045.

Even studies from Trump-friendly groups — such as one issued during the 2024 campaign by a group called the Coalition for a Prosperous America — acknowledge that tariffs would raise consumer prices.

Thus far, there are signs from media reports that 20% duties are being considered by the Trump team, including a report Tuesday from the Washington Post that detailed the latest machinations.

Some in the administration are openly pushing for aggressive revenue goals where the math would likely require some flavor of universal duties.

On Sunday, senior White House trade and manufacturing counselor Peter Navarro said the Trump 2.0 tariffs could add around $700 billion a year annually to US coffers — combining $100 billion from recently announced 25% auto tariffs to $600 billion more from other duties.

Such an ambitious top-line number can't be achieved without a wide array of duties. 20% blanket tariffs, one of the most aggressive options to raise revenue yet, are estimated to raise only about half the amount floated by Navarro, assuming that other countries retaliate.

A 20% blanket tariff rate would represent a dramatic turn for Trump back to outsized campaign trail promises of his stewardship of the US economy at a delicate time for markets.

It could also be seen as a recognition of sorts that his oft-repeated promises of actions where "what they do to us, we do to them" is more challenging in the face of already overtaxed ports and also political constituencies that have spent recent months clamoring for exceptions.

If nothing else, a blanket tariff would be simpler to implement and is likely not to add significantly to what is known as the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States — an already overstuffed 99-chapter-long guide that duty collectors and importers rely on at ports.

A move toward universal tariffs — if Trump follows through — could also lessen some political pressure with less opportunity for exceptions.

Garrett Watson, the director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, previously noted to Yahoo Finance that the move toward reciprocal country-by-country tariffs was one that presented political pitfalls that could be weighing on Trump's team today.

He said selective tariff considerations present "the risk of creating a political bonanza ... that makes the situation complicated and uncertain and can create political winners and losers."

Trump has declined to offer much in the way of specificity. When asked Wednesday about applying universal versus individual tariffs, he responded, “You're going to see in two days,” while declining to offer specifics.

The president nonetheless continued to up the stakes. In addition to his oft-repeated use of the moniker “Liberation Day” for this Wednesday, he said he is now considering the implementation of tariffs that he believes represents a "rebirth of the country."

It's a topic that Democrats are also likely to hammer the president on, especially if this week's rollout goes poorly and already shaky markets continue to sell off.

“Perhaps if they are blanket 20% across-the-board tariffs that are imposed tomorrow, markets may have some certainty going forward,” former Biden administration official Alex Jacquez said Tuesday morning.

But then he quickly added, "It's hard to see that they'll like those either."

Wall Street's bullishness on gold doesn't appear to be wavering as the precious metal hit yet another all-time high.

On Tuesday, futures (GC=F) made their 19th intraday record of the year, surging above $3,170 per ounce before paring gains ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariff plan announcement expected on April 2.

"Within the commodities complex, long Gold presents the obvious hedge for risky market exposure in our view, especially since the bullish medium-term trend dynamics remain firmly intact," JPMorgan analysts said in a note on Tuesday.

Most notable is the rapid pace at which gold has risen, notching its best quarterly performance in nearly 40 years.

JPMorgan's researchers note gold went from $2,500 to $3,000 per ounce in 210 days, much faster than previous $500 increments, which took an average of 1,700 days.

Year-to-date gold prices are up 19%, while over the past year the commodity is up more than 40%.

"A simple regression analysis shows that over the period since early 2024, gold has turned into a momentum trade, which appears to be backed less by fundamentals and driven more by momentum," wrote Societe Generale researchers and strategists in a note last month.

"Our view is that this momentum dynamic will remain broadly intact," they wrote. The firm expects gold to reach $3,300 by year-end.

Goldman Sachs analysts recently raised their year-end price target to $3,300 "reflecting upside surprises in ETF inflows and in continued strong central bank gold demand." The firm also identified potential events that could spark selling and create better entry points for investors.

"First, a Russia-Ukraine peace deal would likely trigger speculative selling," Goldman commodities strategist Lina Thomas said in a note last Wednesday.

"Second, while not the base case of our portfolio strategists, a potential sharp equity sell-off may trigger margin-driven gold liquidation," she added, noting that a sell-off would be "short-lived."

In the meantime, near-term price action may depend on the exact details of President Trump's highly anticipated announcement at the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. Trump is expected to announce reciprocal tariffs on imports from other countries.

"Tariff-related information has already been partly reflected in gold prices over the past week," said Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com. "If President Trump delays the implementation of these policies, the market may witness a short-term correction in gold as investors take profits after a strong rally."

Newsmax stock (NMAX) soared as high as 132% Tuesday, extending its massive 735% gain on Monday following the conservative cable news outlet's IPO.

Newsmax raised $75 million in its IPO Friday, with shares priced at $10. The outlet's rapid ascent in its first two days of trading pushed its market cap to $16.7 billion early Tuesday, with shares at one point reaching a high of roughly $194.

The stock pared gains midday, up around 78% to roughly $149, putting the company's market cap at just over $13 billion.

“This incredibly successful offering, combined with our previous Preferred Offering, provides us with the capital and financial freedom to accelerate our growth initiatives, expand our programming, and further enhance our digital presence,” said CEO Christopher Ruddy, a media mogul and friend of President Trump who founded the company in 1998.

Newsmax, which became a cable TV network in 2014, has faced an onslaught of critiques and legal battles for touting conspiracy theories. The company is facing an ongoing lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems seeking $1.6 billion in damages related to false claims it made in its coverage of the 2020 election, which Newsmax cited among risk factors to its business in its latest 10-K filing to the SEC.

Newsmax settled another lawsuit with another election tech company, Smartmatic, in 2024 for similar claims and has paid $20 million of the $40 million settlement thus far, according to the filing. The news outlet, seen as a Fox News alternative, also drew criticism when it reported false claims and conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol.

While Newsmax's revenue soared roughly 26% to roughly $171 million in 2024, the company lost $72 million that year. The company also said in its filing that it has identified "material weaknesses" in its financial reporting controls such that there may be "a material misstatement" in its financial statements that it may not detect "on a timely basis."

Oops, something went wrong

Data out Tuesday showed activity in the manufacturing sector slipped into contraction for the first time this year and costs continued to surge as suppliers weigh the impact of President Trump's tariff policy.

The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI registered a reading of 49.0 in March, down from February's 50.3 reading and below the 49.5 economists polled by Bloomberg had expected. Readings above 50 for this index indicate an expansion in activity, while readings below 50 indicate a contraction.

The prices paid index surged to 69.4, up from 62.4 the month prior and the highest reading since June 2022, reflecting companies' continued increase in costs. Economists had expected a reading of 64.6.

"Demand and production retreated and destaffing continued, as panelists' companies responded to demand confusion," Institute for Supply Management chair Timothy Fiore wrote in the release. "Prices growth accelerated due to tariffs, causing new order placement backlogs, supplier delivery slowdowns and manufacturing inventory growth."

Many survey respondents cited increased uncertainty due to tariffs as companies attempt to restock inventories ahead of future policy rollouts, with reciprocal levies set to come as soon as Wednesday. 

Notably, new orders fell to the lowest reading since May 2023.

"The slight dip in the ISM manufacturing index in March suggests that, rather than triggering a reshoring factory renaissance, the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff threats are depressing activity," Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, wrote in reaction to the data.

"While the prices paid index is still some way below its pandemic [level], even after rising again in March, it seems likely to increase further next month once more tariffs come into effect," Chambers said. "There's a whiff of stagflation in the air."

Shortly following the data's release, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tracker, which analyzes incoming data points, signaled negative growth of 3.7% in Q1, an escalation of the prior negative 2.8% reading.

Another reading on manufacturing activity out Tuesday also raised concerns over Trump's tariff uncertainties. The final reading of S&P Global's manufacturing PMI hit 50.2 in March, down from a strong 52.7 in February.

Despite the slowdown, it was the third month the index registered a reading above 50 "but only just."

"The PMI signaled a marginal improvement in operating conditions that was the weakest of the year so far," S&P Global said in the release, noting a drop in production for the first time since December weighed heavily on the headline index while order books expanded only modestly.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in the release, "The strong start to the year for US manufacturers has faltered in March."

"While business confidence about the outlook remains relatively elevated by standards seen over the past three years, this is based on companies hoping that the near-term disruption caused by tariffs and other policies will be superseded as longer-term benefits from the policies of the new administration accrue," he continued. "However, March has seen more producers question this belief."

S&P said a "key concern" among manufacturers is the degree to which heightened uncertainty resulting from policy changes, notably tariffs, cause customers to cancel or delay spending, along with the ripple effect when it comes to rising costs and deteriorating supply chains.

"Tariffs were the most cited cause of factory input costs rising in March, and at a rate not seen since mid-2022 during the pandemic-related supply shock," Williamson said. "Supply chains are also suffering to a degree not seen since October 2022 as delivery delays become more widespread."

Oops, something went wrong

It could be time to kick the tires on Microsoft stock (MSFT) after a 12% first quarter beating.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria added the tech behemoth to his "Top Picks" list on Tuesday.

"We believe investors underappreciate the GenAI innovation Microsoft brings throughout the infrastructure and application layers, and view the recent underperformance of the shares as a buying opportunity," Jaluria wrote in a client note. "We believe that Azure growth can reaccelerate, driven by AI momentum, capacity continuing to come online, and the Azure 'AI halo effect' coming into play."

Reasons behind the bullish call include Microsoft being a market leader in enterprise software and public cloud through Azure. He expects Microsoft to maintain a low teens percentage compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2026.

Listen: What Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates thinks about Nvidia

He added that Microsoft is likely to enter new markets, such as hyperautomation, to drive its growth. Lastly, Microsoft's Office installed base will likely continue to expand.

Jaluria slapped Microsoft with a $500 price target (assumes 33% upside from current price levels) and an Outperform rating.

The $500 price target is about average among the sell-side analysts that cover Microsoft, according to Yahoo Finance data. Of the 58 analysts who publish research on Microsoft, 91% rate the stock a Strong Buy or Buy.

Microsoft's stock was the fourth-worst performer from the "Magnificent Seven" in the first quarter. Tesla (TSLA) led declines with a 38% drop, Nvidia (NVDA) fell 21%, Google (GOOG) declined 19%, and Amazon (AMZN) shed 14%.

The drivers behind the Microsoft sell-off in the first quarter are threefold.

First, investors have rotated out of large-cap tech names and into perceived safe-haven assets like gold and healthcare stocks with Trump tariff fears running rampant. Second, ever since DeepSeek's breakthrough development in January, investors have been concerned that AI investment will slow materially in 2025.

Microsoft has been an aggressive investor in AI infrastructure, most notably seen in its backing of OpenAI.

And lastly, Microsoft's fourth quarter left some things to be desired.

Microsoft's Commercial Cloud segment sales, which includes cloud services sales, saw revenue rise 21% year over year to $40 billion. It was shy of Wall Street expectations of $41.1 billion. Microsoft's intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, saw revenue of $25.5 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $25.8 billion.

Cloud gross margin came in light versus estimates.

Watch: The biggest investing mistakes you keep making

The company will have some proving to do to Wall Street when it reports earnings in late April.

But one of its main chip suppliers has offered a clue that the market's fears about slowing AI investment may be overdone.

"The need for compute continues to be immense," AMD CEO Lisa Su told me in a Yahoo Finance exclusive interview on Monday (video above). "We see that throughout all of our customers globally, and we're going to continue to invest strongly in this area because I think this is the single most important technology. I like to say it's the single most important technology of the last 50 years."

Economic data releases and earnings

If all goes according to plan on "Liberation Day" — President Trump's term for Wednesday's scheduled reciprocal tariffs — the trade war showdown will be the starting point of a new American era, of a nationalistic economy that boosts our self-sufficiency and prosperity.

But even if every aspect of the president's agenda falls into place, there's a laundry list of things that will have to go right for it to work out. Things that essentially seem impossible.

First off, the countries whose imports would be tariffed need to do nothing, instead of unleashing a wave of repercussions that would nullify or complicate the imagined progress of an America First platform.

The rollout itself has to be clean, without the expected messiness of retaliatory tariffs and chaos at US ports.

                            Terms
                        
                     and 
                        
                            Privacy Policy
                        
 

The tariffs, any further tit-for-tat levies, and rollout need to be a historical economic exception that boosts growth and doesn't end up kickstarting a brutal disruption for businesses and consumers.

Businesses need to get creative as international trade continues to be reshaped by policy and torpedoed relationships with allies and trading partners.

Consumers need to be patient, forgiving, and team players willing to make sacrifices. While the White House contends that the price increases triggered by tariffs will be fleeting, consumers have made it plain they're fed up with inflation. Relying on a theory that tariff-inspired price increases will only be transitory — and that Americans will be willing to accept them — seems an economically and politically dangerous gamble. Consumers will improbably have to play along.

"Liberation Day" also puts the Federal Reserve in a jam. If the Fed cuts rates to reverse flagging growth — yet another “best case” scenario for Trump that isn't ideal for the rest of us — the central bank risks driving up inflation. And those rate cuts will come in the form of a monetary rescue mission instead of a final, easing maneuver in a soft landing.

And then, all of this needs to crystalize into a sentiment, growth, and earnings boom.

That's an incredible string of green lights the Trump administration needs to hit. Or holes-in-one; pick your metaphor. Which is why, as many economists, strategists, and analysts — people incentivized by being correct, not politically correct — have noted, the upside may be limited, but the downside is a black pit.

If Trump's antagonistic negotiating leads to deals with our trading partners, there's still a lot that would need to happen for the market to return to glory and for businesses and consumers to shed their anxieties.

Even a narrower tariff rollout would arrive with an array of caveats and carveouts. Wall Street analysts and business leaders would still have to qualify their thinking of "this isn't as bad as we thought" with a "for now" clause. And in the meantime, the agonizing run-up has already done damage. A months-long protectionist realignment isn't just a mindset, it's now been baked into operations and expectations.

Economic data releases and earnings

If all goes according to plan on "Liberation Day" — President Trump's term for Wednesday's scheduled reciprocal tariffs — the trade war showdown will be the starting point of a new American era, of a nationalistic economy that boosts our self-sufficiency and prosperity.

But even if every aspect of the president's agenda falls into place, there's a laundry list of things that will have to go right for it to work out. Things that essentially seem impossible.

First off, the countries whose imports would be tariffed need to do nothing, instead of unleashing a wave of repercussions that would nullify or complicate the imagined progress of an America First platform.

The rollout itself has to be clean, without the expected messiness of retaliatory tariffs and chaos at US ports.

                     and 
                        
                            Privacy Policy
                        
 

The tariffs, any further tit-for-tat levies, and rollout need to be a historical economic exception that boosts growth and doesn't end up kickstarting a brutal disruption for businesses and consumers.

Businesses need to get creative as international trade continues to be reshaped by policy and torpedoed relationships with allies and trading partners.

Consumers need to be patient, forgiving, and team players willing to make sacrifices. While the White House contends that the price increases triggered by tariffs will be fleeting, consumers have made it plain they're fed up with inflation. Relying on a theory that tariff-inspired price increases will only be transitory — and that Americans will be willing to accept them — seems an economically and politically dangerous gamble. Consumers will improbably have to play along.

"Liberation Day" also puts the Federal Reserve in a jam. If the Fed cuts rates to reverse flagging growth — yet another “best case” scenario for Trump that isn't ideal for the rest of us — the central bank risks driving up inflation. And those rate cuts will come in the form of a monetary rescue mission instead of a final, easing maneuver in a soft landing.

And then, all of this needs to crystalize into a sentiment, growth, and earnings boom.

That's an incredible string of green lights the Trump administration needs to hit. Or holes-in-one; pick your metaphor. Which is why, as many economists, strategists, and analysts — people incentivized by being correct, not politically correct — have noted, the upside may be limited, but the downside is a black pit.

If Trump's antagonistic negotiating leads to deals with our trading partners, there's still a lot that would need to happen for the market to return to glory and for businesses and consumers to shed their anxieties.

Even a narrower tariff rollout would arrive with an array of caveats and carveouts. Wall Street analysts and business leaders would still have to qualify their thinking of "this isn't as bad as we thought" with a "for now" clause. And in the meantime, the agonizing run-up has already done damage. A months-long protectionist realignment isn't just a mindset, it's now been baked into operations and expectations.

Just because the April 2 tariff guessing game has passed doesn't mean tariff uncertainty will end. If nothing is set in stone, the potential for future disruption continues to hang over markets.

Oops, something went wrong

Stagflation has become the latest buzzword in financial markets as President Trump promises more tariffs, with reciprocal levies set to come as soon as Wednesday. 

Concerns about stagflation, a bleak economic scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises, have risen following a string of disappointing data releases, the Trump administration's shifting trade narrative, and other policy unknowns, including recent efforts to cut government jobs from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

"It's really a shame that Trump is so willing to take a wrecking ball to the economy," Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "It has been very resilient over the past three years in the face of the tightening of monetary policy."

Yardeni upped his probability of the US entering a stagflation period to 45% from the prior 35%, adding that the scenario includes the possibility of a shallow recession during the second half of this year.

The strategist pointed to several economic indicators, including faltering manufacturing activity and higher prices paid by purchasing managers, warning, "The higher inflation part of stagflation is almost a certainty."

On Friday, data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed consumers spent less than forecast in March while inflation rose more than anticipated — a sign that stagflation cracks are beginning to show up in hard economic data, or objective metrics. That coincided with weak survey and sentiment readings, often referred to as soft economic data, which highlighted increased pessimism on the outlook for inflation and the US labor market.

Notably, the Federal Reserve has maintained a base case that tariff-induced inflation will be "transitory" and, therefore, have a short-term impact on price growth. This was reflected in the central bank's latest projections, which forecast year-end PCE inflation rising to 2.7% before reaching its 2% target by 2027.

But economists have argued that "transitory" inflation remains an unrealistic expectation.

"We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation," Capital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown wrote in reaction to the decision.

Along with higher inflation, economists argue growth risks remain tilted to the downside, mostly due to the ripple effects of Trump's tariff unknowns. Currently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tracker, which analyzes incoming data points, signals negative growth of 2.8% in Q1.

At its most recent policy meeting, which concluded on March 19, the Fed lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast to 1.7% from the prior 2.1%, noting in the policy statement, "Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased."

But as tariffs serve as the most immediate threat to growth and inflation, a resilient US labor market continues to assure Wall Street watchers the economy can avoid a recession — at least for now.

"I would get a lot more concerned if the labor market were to start to crack," Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, told Yahoo Finance on Monday. "As long as we're generating job growth, we're generating income growth, and then there's room to spend."

As a result, Bhave said he doesn't see recent data points as recession precursors.

"We see this as a soft patch," he said. "Nominal spending still looks OK. Most importantly, the labor market is holding up, and I won't give up on the US consumer as long as the labor market holds up."

The March jobs report, set for release on Friday, will serve as the latest test. Economists polled by Bloomberg expect the US labor market added 135,000 jobs in the month, down from the 151,000 seen in February. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.
