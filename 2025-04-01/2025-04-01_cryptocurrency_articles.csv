Crypto stocks are also performing well, with bitcoin miners Core Scientific (CORZ) and CleanSpark (CLSK) jumping almost 10% on the day. Strategy (MSTR) is up 5.4% and Coinbase (COIN) 2.1%.

U.S. stocks reversed early session losses to turn higher as well, with the Nasdaq now ahead just shy of 1% for the day.

The action comes ahead of the Trump administration’s so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariff rollout set for tomorrow after the close of U.S. trading.

Hope?

A report from NBC News suggested the market's most feared option — blanket 20% tariffs across the board — is ""less likely"" to be the direction taken by the White House. Instead, according to the report, a ""tiered system"" of different rates or country-by-country rates could be announced.

Also maybe helping is what appears to be the first acknowledgement that the administration is aware of the market tumult resulting from all the tariff chatter. Speaking today at her daily briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that there were legitimate concerns about market swings.

Gala's price target of $220 suggests just shy of 30% downside from the current price in the $300 area.

Gala argued that it will become increasingly more difficult for Strategy to raise money to buy bitcoin via share issuance, forcing the company to shift towards fixed income vehicles.

“If fixed income securities do not become a greater portion of issuance, the BTC treasury strategy will look increasingly challenged.”

Gala noted that MSTR has already used $18.6 billion of its $21 billion common share at-the-market offering. The company also raised another $711 million last week via STRF, its second series of preferred stock.",coindesk

A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put buyer is essentially bearish on the market, in this case, anticipating a price drop to below $70,000 from the current $84,000.

A block trade is a large, privately negotiated transaction executed outside the public market, typically by institutions, to avoid affecting the going market rate.

Other notable trades included a put ratio spread, featuring long positions in the $75,000 strike put and double short positions in the $70,000 put; and a risk reversal, involving a long position in the $90,000 call and a short position in the $70,000 put, as Pelion Capital founder Tony Stewart noted.

The bearish flow in the $70,000 put follows purchases of put options expiring April 4 in the $78,000 to $85,000 range last week and increased demand for the $76,000 put option expiring on April 25.

Meanwhile, HIPPO, BANANA31, TST and LUMIA posted similar declines shortly after 1100 UTC, though not as large as ACT, with dips in some tokens like KAVA getting quickly purchased by fast-fingered traders.

The tokens are not related or in the same sector. Data showed a surge in selling volumes roughly around the same time, with no other tokens on Binance seeing similar spikes in selling volumes.

The stage for volatility was likely set by Binance's announcement at 10:30 UTC, which introduced changes in leverage requirements and margin tiers for perpetual contracts for several tokens, including ACT/USDT.

The announcement said the new rules will be applicable to existing positions. That likely spurred position adjustments by trading bots, leading to price volatility in perpetuals, which quickly spilled over to spot prices.

The cascade spread over to other exchanges, with these tokens down equivalent amounts on other centralized exchanges as well as on decentralized exchanges.

Early reactions on X ranged from surprise to speculations of a market-making bot possibly causing the declines due to a misconfiguration on how they trade, though CoinDesk could not independently confirm the allegations as of writing time.

Top blockchains by DEX trading volumes. (DefiLlama)

The change in leadership happened as the total crypto market capitalization fell 4.2% to $2.63 trillion, extending February's 20% loss, as macroeconomic uncertainty and disappointment over the lack of fresh BTC purchases in the U.S. strategic reserve saw bitcoin slip below $80,000.

The bearish market sentiment dampened speculation across the broader landscape, especially within the memecoin sector, as reflected in the significant decline in activity on Raydium, the leading Solana-based DEX and a hotspot for meme trading in late 2024.

Throughout March, Raydium did not log a single day with trading volume exceeding $1 billion, highlighting a considerable decrease from its record-high of $13 billion on Jan. 18, DefiLlama data show.

Additionally, daily volume on the Solana-based memecoin launch pad averaged less than $100 million in March, down significantly from the peak of $390 million in mid-January. Activity on Solana-based DEXes peaked with the debut of President Donald Trump's TRUMP token in January.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's outperformance was driven by Uniswap, which achieved over $30 billion in trading volume, with Fluid taking the distant second spot with $9 billion in activity.

Still, Ethereum's ether token fell over 18% to $1,822 in March, registering bigger losses than Solana's SOL token, which fell by 15.8%, per data source TradingView and CoinDesk.

Per observers, ether's inflationary tokenomics and the growing popularity of Layer 2 solutions, which supposedly siphon activity from the main chain, are responsible for ether's poor performance.

Not in the “we forgot something” sense, but in the core architectural sense. It doesn’t have a real memory layer.

After World War II, John von Neumann laid out the architecture for modern computers. Every computer needs input and output, a CPU for control and arithmetic, and memory to store the latest version data, along with a “bus” to retrieve and update that data in the memory. Commonly known as RAM, this architecture has been the foundation of computing for decades.

At its core, Web3 is a decentralized computer — a “world computer.” At the higher layers, it’s fairly recognizable: operating systems (EVM, SVM) running on thousands of decentralized nodes, powering decentralized applications and protocols.

But, when you dig deeper, something’s missing. The memory layer essential for storing, accessing and updating short-term and long term data, doesn’t look like the memory bus or memory unit von Neumann envisioned.

Instead, it's a mashup of different best-effort approaches to achieve this purpose, and the results are overall messy, inefficient and hard to navigate.

Here’s the problem: if we’re going to build a world computer that’s fundamentally different from the von Neumann model, there better be a really good reason to do so. As of right now, Web3’s memory layer isn’t just different, it’s convoluted and inefficient. Transactions are slow. Storage is sluggish and costly. Scaling for mass adoption with this current approach is nigh impossible. And, that’s not what decentralization was supposed to be about.

But there is another way.

A lot of people in this space are trying their best to work around this limitation and we're at a point now where the current workaround solutions just cannot keep up. This is where using algebraic coding, which makes use of equations to represent data for efficiency, resilience and flexibility, comes in.

The core problem is this: how do we implement decentralized code for Web3?

A new memory infrastructure

This is why I took the leap from academia where I held the role of MIT NEC Chair and Professor of Software Science and Engineering to dedicate myself and a team of experts in advancing high-performance memory for Web3.

I saw something bigger: the potential to redefine how we think about computing in a decentralized world.

My team at Optimum is creating decentralized memory that works like a dedicated computer. Our approach is powered by Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC), a technology developed in my MIT lab over nearly two decades. It’s a proven data coding method that maximizes throughput and resilience in high-reliability networks from industrial systems to the internet.

Data coding is the process of converting information from one format to another for efficient storage, transmission or processing. Data coding has been around for decades and there are many iterations of it in use in networks today. RLNC is the modern approach to data coding built specifically for decentralized computing. This scheme transforms data into packets for transmission across a network of nodes, ensuring high speed and efficiency.

With multiple engineering awards from top global institutions, more than 80 patents, and numerous real-world deployments, RLNC is no longer just a theory. RLNC has garnered significant recognition, including the 2009 IEEE Communications Society and Information Theory Society Joint Paper Award for the work ""A Random Linear Network Coding Approach to Multicast."" RLNC's impact was acknowledged with the IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award in 2022.

RLNC is now ready for decentralized systems, enabling faster data propagation, efficient storage, and real-time access, making it a key solution for Web3’s scalability and efficiency challenges.

Why this matters

Let’s take a step back. Why does all of this matter? Because we need memory for the world computer that’s not just decentralized but also efficient, scalable and reliable.

Currently, blockchains rely on best-effort, ad hoc solutions that achieve partially what memory in high-performance computing does. What they lack is a unified memory layer that encompasses both the memory bus for data propagation and the RAM for data storage and access.

The bus part of the computer should not become the bottleneck, as it does now. Let me explain.

“Gossip” is the common method for data propagation in blockchain networks. It is a peer-to-peer communication protocol in which nodes exchange information with random peers to spread data across the network. In its current implementation, it struggles at scale.

Imagine you need 10 pieces of information from neighbors who repeat what they’ve heard. As you speak to them, at first you get new information. But as you approach nine out of 10, the chance of hearing something new from a neighbor drops, making the final piece of information the hardest to get. Chances are 90% that the next thing you hear is something you already know.

This is how blockchain gossip works today — efficient early on, but redundant and slow when trying to complete the information sharing. You would have to be extremely lucky to get something new every time.

With RLNC, we get around the core scalability issue in current gossip. RLNC works as though you managed to get extremely lucky, so every time you hear info, it just happens to be info that is new to you. That means much greater throughput and much lower latency. This RLNC-powered gossip is our first product, which validators can implement through a simple API call to optimize data propagation for their nodes.

Let us now examine the memory part. It helps to think of memory as dynamic storage, like RAM in a computer or, for that matter, our closet. Decentralized RAM should mimic a closet; it should be structured, reliable, and consistent. A piece of data is either there or not, no half-bits, no missing sleeves. That’s atomicity. Items stay in the order they were placed — you might see an older version, but never a wrong one. That’s consistency. And, unless moved, everything stays put; data doesn’t disappear. That’s durability.

Instead of the closet, what do we have? Mempools are not something we keep around in computers, so why do we do that in Web3? The main reason is that there is not a proper memory layer. If we think of data management in blockchains as managing clothes in our closet, a mempool is like having a pile of laundry on the floor, where you are not sure what is in there and you need to rummage.

Current delays in transaction processing can be extremely high for any single chain. Citing Ethereum as an example, it takes two epochs or 12.8 minutes to finalize any single transaction. Without decentralized RAM, Web3 relies on mempools, where transactions sit until they’re processed, resulting in delays, congestion and unpredictability.

Full nodes store everything, bloating the system and making retrieval complex and costly. In computers, the RAM keeps what is currently needed, while less-used data moves to cold storage, maybe in the cloud or on disk. Full nodes are like a closet with all the clothes you ever wore (from everything you’ve ever worn as a baby until now).

This is not something we do on our computers, but they exist in Web3 because storage and read/write access aren’t optimized. With RLNC, we create decentralized RAM (deRAM) for timely, updateable state in a way that is economical, resilient and scalable.

DeRAM and data propagation powered by RLNC can solve Web3’s biggest bottlenecks by making memory faster, more efficient, and more scalable. It optimizes data propagation, reduces storage bloat, and enables real-time access without compromising decentralization. It’s long been a key missing piece in the world computer, but not for long.",coindesk

In Most Technology Markets, The Early Winners Are Determined Long Before Mass-Market Adoption. As we’re Now Entering the mass adoption era for blockchain (my Opinion), the options facing some companies Now are Ether Act Quickly or Spend the Next FeW Decades Playing Catch-Up. If your CEO SAYS, “There's no hurry, it's early days Yet,” Your Company Has Already Given Up the Fight.

For those Staying in the Fight, Speed ​​Kills. It's True on the Road and It’s True in Business. People are Always Forgetting that “Move Fast” Came With “Break Things.” That’s Why for Those Rushing Ahead in This Market, Risk Management Has Never Been A More Critical Skill. Done Correctly, there are Several Ways for Companies that Want to Sprint Ahead in This Market to Minimize the Risk of Catastrophic Failure. There are three i have in at least.

The first step is to put in place controls and operations that close the door on past problem that other firms have experience. This may strike you as bolting the barn door after the Horse has Already Left, but it is necessary because IF you don’t, you risk repeating history and that’s way more humiliating Than Communting Entirely Novel Mistakes. Nor are the Basics Particularly Difficult: External Auditors, Business Controls, and Standard Best Practices. We are so fortunate to live in an era where, for the first time, we have a good supply of experience blockchain and crypto people who can applly real-life lessons learned.

Secondly, I Think It is critical for Companies to Think Strategaly and Explicitly About the Kind and Number of Risks They Want to Take. There is technology risk (very relevant with smart contracts and defi). There is market risk. And there is counter party risk.

You can learn critical lessons from all Three, but it Often Makes Sense to have controlled learning environments. One of my frustration has been watching people Jump to wildly Incorrect Conclusions When Things Go Wrong, Sometimes Because they Too many risk at the same time and cannot separate out what the causes were.

Lastly, It Makes a Lot of Sense to be strategic about what you do internally and what Gets Done Externally. In Technology Companies, Especialy when the Engineers are in Charge, The Tempation is Always to Build. I know. I have an engineering team. It’s More Fun Than Managing a Vendor. “I Built It” is a million Times More Satisfying Than Telling some “I Bough it.” I never thought i’d be quoting Mr. Beast in Business, but as he Said, “Consultants are a cheat code.” It’s that Simple: Someone Else Has Done IT Before. Take Advantage of that to reduce your risk and complexity.

There is no path to growth without risk and that risk increate with the speed of growth. Therefore, for firms Seeking Accelerated Growth, Particularly in Ecosystems powered by emerging technology, good risk management policies are a must. Please Buckle Up for your own Safety and Keep Your Eyes on the Road.

AI tokens, including Near Protocol (NEAR), Internet Computer (ICP), Bittensor (TAO) and Render (RENDER), were all up over 3% on Tuesday, with RENDER leading the group, trading 7.4% higher. The broader digital assets market, CoinDesk20 Index, also rose 3%.

Meanwhile, the shares of Core Scientific (CORZ), the bitcoin miner and data center with a large partnership with CoreWeave, have also risen more than 9% on Tuesday.

Earlier this week, Miller Whitehouse-Levine founded the organization and announced his position as CEO shortly after stepping down from the Defi Education Fund.

Though the group hasn't yet clarified its source of funding, its website said it will focus its message on ""how decentralized networks like Solana are the future of the digital economy.""

Smith has led the Blockchain Association for almost seven years — a dramatic period for the developing industry. Since late last year, the political grounds have solidified under the sector's feet as it finds allies running all levels of the U.S. government, where crypto advocates have long been trying to get a comprehensive set of regulations.

The Blockchain Association has been a central player in the industry's lobbying.

The organization said its board is now conducting a search to replace Smith.

Whitehouse-Levin once worked in that organization's policy operations.

""Innovators deserve to have the clarity they need to build a frictionless, Internet-based global economy — a future we believe is achievable with the right laws, rules and frameworks,"" he said in a statement during this week's launch of the Solana group.

A sale option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying assets at a predetermined price on a later date. The buyer of a sale option is essentially lower on the market, in this case anticipating a drop in price from $ 84,000 to less than $ 70,000.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Beyond The Vault: Why Bitcoin’s True Power Lies In Motion,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/beyond-the-vault-why-bitcoins-true-power-lies-in-motion,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:34:50 GMT","Michael Saylor, you were forced to realise that all the store-of-value assets are defective and pushed you to focus on the only asset that is not. That does not make you immune to seeing the medium of exchange case. You will see how the housing market is huge when you watch it from one point of view and horrible from another. But if you experience pain driving you to keep your billions of dollars purchasing power, housing is a decent tool to keep it.

Your SoV obsession misses the mark—badly. The biggest aspect of Bitcoin is the medium of exchange. Even though the fiat system increasingly separates money’s functions, that doesn’t mean it should. I get that saying Bitcoin is a medium of exchange is kicking the hornet’s nest, and all the other currency lords will try to stop Bitcoin. It’d be great if they joined in instead of fighting it. That will give all the billionaires certainty that they can put money in it, but simply using Bitcoin just to store value is attacking it. That approach will turn it into digital gold 2.0, captured.

There’s no store of value without a medium of exchange! The medium of exchange comes first. You receive a transaction, then you store the Bitcoin. If the store of value were the main point, imagine announcing you lost your keys for your Bitcoin stack—you’d still store it perfectly, but without the medium of exchange function, the market will wipe out the fictional fiat value layered on top. That value is there exactly because it can move and still can be used as a medium of exchange.

An oxygen tank is vital for reserves, but breathing matters more. The store of value is secondary and relies on the ability to transact. Without that, the store of value means nothing. Michael, you learned this firsthand when your million-dollar holdings in Argentina were diluted by 90%. You struggled to preserve the value not because you did not see it coming but because you couldn’t use it as a medium of exchange. True, a poor store of value weakens the medium of exchange, but why does the latter take priority? Because the ability to exchange is what lets you respond.

By now, most people exposed to Bitcoin know the chart from Jesse Mayers that you popularized. You claim there’s no better idea than a $900 trillion clean store of value, then immediately call Bitcoin one of the world’s most liquid markets, running 24/7/365. Guess what? Liquidity means medium of exchange.

Now, let’s break down the Jesse chart, starting with the housing market. It’s valued at $330 trillion, but it’s such a poor medium of exchange that it only trades for $1.3 trillion annually. Regulations and taxes make trading real estate even tougher. Still, since it’s more than 100 times better as a store of value, billionaires prize it, increasingly dominating the market and pricing out younger generations.

A house might be valuable, but its worth grows not just from what it is but from its ties to nearby utilities. Build a road to it, and the value rises. Add a superstore or a gas station, or connect it to the electrical grid, and the value climbs again. The network creates opportunities for energy to flow into the area, boosting the chance to capture that energy as economic value, like money. So the exchanges that happen in the network are what increases the value of a house. But I see the flip side: if you’re a billionaire and everyone’s after your resources, you don’t want a big network around your house. You’d prioritize privacy instead. The house might lose value, but the goal shifts to raising the cost for others to reach you, reducing the chance to be attacked.

What about the bond market? Bonds are valued at $300 trillion as a store of value, with $140 trillion traded yearly plus $25 trillion in new bond issuance. That means the medium of exchange value is about 50% of its total value annually. It’s better than houses in that sense, but the numbers still show people primarily use it as a store of value.

Next up are equities. Valued at $115 trillion, they were traded for about $175 trillion. This shows their strength as a medium of exchange exceeds their store of value role. Take your MicroStrategy stock—you know it better than anyone. How much value did it store last year, and how much was exchanged through it?

The next two sections are interesting. The art industry’s yearly transactions are so minor that they don’t even register on the chart. Meanwhile, the cars and collectibles sector sees trading volumes of nearly $4 trillion annually. This highlights that they’re mostly seen as a store of value each year, but it also reveals how poorly the housing market performs as a medium of exchange—outdone even by the car market.

Ooooh gold! Gold bugs rave that it’s been around for over 5,000 years, calling it the ultimate store of value for whatever reason—yet it’s just 1.78% of the store of value market. This shows that once its medium of exchange role was stripped away, it became vulnerable to capture and manipulation. Sorry, gold bugs, that genie’s not going back in the lamp. Gold holds $16 trillion in value, and the gold bugs claim it could store the $120 trillion worth of money in it. They’re desperate to pump their bags, but the market disagrees, valuing the defective fiat money ten times higher than the shiny, lifeless rock. Is gold a better medium of exchange, then? It trades at $54 trillion yearly, boosted by derivatives, making its medium of exchange use 3.5 times its store of value role.

Money might not dominate as a store of value among assets, but it’s the leading medium of exchange by far. Other stores of value assets don’t even come close. What if the dollar, the top currency, became just a store of value? It would collapse the USD network, boosting the value of non-US assets as their networks step in to meet the demand. Over time, their store of value assets would rise while USD assets would plummet. Global money totals around $120 trillion, but look at the top central banks’ transaction volumes: Fedwire at ~$1,182 trillion, TARGET2 at ~$765 trillion, CHAPS at ~$145 trillion, and others (partial) at ~$500 trillion (a conservative estimate due to incomplete data). So, while the store of value is $120 trillion—per the Jesse chart—the medium of exchange utility of these networks is over 20 times greater, which is around ~$2.5 quadrillion. What would the medium of exchange value be if 2 billion unbanked people were included? How many more transactions would that spark? And what if microtransactions were possible?

Where does Bitcoin fit into all of this? The prevailing narrative urges holders never to sell, positioning Bitcoin solely as a store of value. Yet, the market tells a different story. In 2024, Bitcoin’s market cap hit $2 trillion, while the value exchanged on its first layer—the blockchain—reached $3.4 trillion. Factor in the Lightning Network (though its exact figures remain elusive), and the total likely approaches $4 trillion. This suggests that Bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange is twice as significant as its store-of-value function. So, what happens if that long-standing “hold forever” propaganda narrative begins to fade?

Bonds and equities are financial “instruments” that pretend to be money because fiat currency is flawed. This creates a market that shuts out much of the population from safeguarding their wealth, further splitting money’s store of value role. But how inclusive are these instruments? Or are they just tools to siphon value from the fiat medium of exchange, channeling it to privileged individuals and billionaires and others alike with a need to hoard?

Globally, only 10-20% of people have exposure to bonds, mostly indirectly through pension or investment funds, not directly. For equities, 15-25% of the population has some access. That leaves at best 80% of humanity without these tools to protect themselves, making them vulnerable to exploitation. Splitting the store of value from the medium of exchange sets up a dynamic of extractors and the extracted. This amplifies the “cantillion effect”: those who can print the medium of exchange buy up store-of-value assets, sidelining 80% or more of people. It’s a feedback loop that weakens the system, widening the gap between haves and have-nots. The more you print, the more you disconnect money from its store-of-value role.

Another very big part of the whole system is the fees. There are fees for sending dollars via the banking system, and that is a service, but how much are the fees when you want to switch from the medium of exchange into the store-of-value instruments? A lot more. That is creating so much friction in the whole system, and it contributes to excluding the have-nots from storing their value. At this point, the medium of exchange turns more and more into the medium of extraction rather than for exchange. This is also a reason why the store of value case is more appealing in the fiat system.

Bitcoin is not pretending to be money like everything else; it is the first engineered money that doesn’t erode like a melting ice cube and doesn’t discriminate. It is the money of those who choose it. With no printer behind it, there’s no urge to swap it for a “better” store of value—there’s no second best. Even those without Bitcoin can use it to shape their lives into the lives they desire. Moving away from chasing money to store in something and instead building whatever enriches their lives on top of Bitcoin.

The biggest idea isn’t storing value—it’s moving it. But to move value, you first need to have some stored. Then again, to have some stored, someone needs to move some your way first. That’s why the rich prefer assets that don’t erode like a melting ice cube. Meanwhile, those starting their careers focus more on receiving value than storing what they don’t yet have.

Why does the store of value case draw so much attention? One reason could be the effort involved. With a store of value, you buy and hodl—no work needed to improve your life. With a medium of exchange, you must work to grow your savings, persuading others to pay for your goods or services in Bitcoin. Another factor: for most, their fiat portfolio still outweighs their Bitcoin one. Only when Bitcoin surpasses their fiat holdings will they consider enhancing their lives with it. That shift isn’t tough for much of the world’s population, who lack savings or assets anyway. This might explain why the current system resists letting them exit, pushing dependency by offering to custody their Bitcoin—trading one reliance for another.

Even ossification ties into the need for more mediums of exchange use. You, Michael, strongly support ossification, but if Bitcoin isn’t used to reach more people, you’re delaying it. Unlike you, America knew that to make the dollar the world’s reserve currency, they had to distribute it widely to lock in the network effect. They saw the network as the key to ossification, and it worked easily since printing and sharing bills cost little. With Bitcoin, its absolute scarcity requires balancing how much to spread versus store. Still, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend any at all.

The metaphor of storing fat in the body is key to long-term survival. True, but it overlooks the need for a steady food income to stay alive before storing fat. Without income, there’s nothing to store—so exchange comes first. Yet, for someone not worried about hunger, the focus shifts to storing food to prevent spoilage. I keep hammering this point to highlight your bias toward the store of value, which skews your judgment and misleads others.

At this stage of my Bitcoin journey, I’m certain of this: chasing money corrupts you. Bitcoin shifts that—it stops you from pursuing money endlessly and lets you use it for the life you want. What happens when you have enough of everything you desire? What then? With Bitcoin, that’s entirely possible, and every Bitcoiner should be ready with an answer for when it happens. Chasing money, though, is a bottomless pit you can’t fill. The Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil. I agree, but how does it play out? What is the mechanism? Chasing money—making it the top priority and making the other things lesser—is the mechanism.

You’re not building a Bitcoin standard—you’re stacking a deck. Like gold in the past, you’re the one this time hoarding Bitcoin from people and institutions, further entrenching the fiat standard. Saylor, you’re not attacking the dollar as some believe—you’re bolstering it by boosting your stock and its ecosystem. Instead, you’re speculatively hitting those who fund your Bitcoin buys. You’re not just hurting them; by strengthening the dollar, you’re amplifying the pain for other currency holders. Hoarding sats while the world watches? That’s not a cybercity—it’s a gated estate funded by their own money.

I wonder if people would want to invest their Bitcoin in your securities. How many would actually do it? I’m sure true Bitcoin maximalists wouldn’t trade their perfect store of value asset for a fiat “instrument.” Ask yourself: at this point, would you spend your Bitcoin to buy Apple stock? You did invest in them before, after all. It makes no sense—I’d give you Bitcoin just for you to turn it into some fiat thing, pay fiat fees, bolster fiat custodians and third parties, only so you can buy Bitcoin again on the other end.

In the end, I don’t have proof, but I’m fairly certain you already know everything I’m saying in this article/message. Though it’s written to you, Michael, it’s aimed at those who see you as the new Bitcoin Jesus, blindly following without questioning your actions. They make reckless bets in their own lives—bets that could wipe out their Bitcoin—lacking the financial safeguards and interest rates you have. Your messages, which they echo, don’t apply to most of humanity.

Bitcoin isn’t just another asset or financial tool—it’s borderless, permissionless money for the people. Treating it otherwise diminishes its true worth. Merely storing it won’t bring freedom. Letting sats flow builds the network. Letting sats flow fosters cooperation for a better future. Letting sats flow strengthens the ecosystem. Store some for tomorrow, but do not be the richest man in the grave—save them for plans that keep them moving later.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,China’s Legalization of Bitcoin Mining Threatens Global Hashrate Distribution,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/chinas-legalization-of-bitcoin-mining-threatens-global-hashrate-distribution,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:44:11 GMT","China’s Communist Party announced today in a surprise move that it would be reversing its stance on Bitcoin mining, legalizing mining for Chinese entities and individuals. In 2021, the Chinese government banned Bitcoin mining, citing risks of capital flight, environmental challenges, and competition to their nation’s digital currencies.

The announcement came during growing tensions between the United States government and the world’s largest Bitcoin miner manufacturer, Chinese based Bitmain. Allegedly, Bitmain skirted US sanctions on providing companies such as Huawei with AI chips. Latley, US based Bitcoin miners have been facing seizures by customs of Bitmain miners without much explanation, as reported on by Blockspace.

The move comes at a time when mining profitability is squeezing many US based mining firms. Before the Chinese mining ban, some speculated that China housed up to 75% of the global Bitcoin hashrate. Some speculate that it still has up to 20% of the global hashrate despite the ban. China’s Re-legalization of Bitcoin mining poses the possibility of an explosion in network hashrate, threatening the viability of many American firms.

Today China dominates global Bitcoin miner manufacturing with the three largest manufacturers: Bitmain, Micro BT, and Canaan, based in the communist nation. With rising tensions in trade wars, combined with the legalization of Chinese mining, many are fearful that China will restrict exports of Bitcoin mining machines to the west, meaning that the United States would be at a serious disadvantage. Luxor estimates that the United States currently has roughly 36% of the world’s hashrate with 17% of it estimated to be located in Texas.

China has been facing many economic headwinds due to the fall out of their restrictive Covid- 19 response, the deflation of their real estate bubble and the general global economic downturn and may be looking at Bitcoin as a way to help jump start their faltering economy.

Many are speculating whether this move may mean that China will be changing its tune in regards to Bitcoin in general, seeking to try and outpace the United States in stockpiling the digital currency.

If the Chinese government were to restrict exports of Chinese made Bitcoin miners, it could put the United States years behind the land of the dragon. While TSMC (The world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors) has been building chip manufacturing plants in the United States, it will likely take some time for the other manufacturers based in the US to catch up with Bitmain, leading to a likely dominance of Bitcoin network hashrate by China.

There are some hopes though for preventing complete network centralization. “TSMC, based in Taiwan, could stop providing ASIC chips to Chinese manufacturers,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot Platforms. “This would hurt Bitcoin’s decentralization and could escalate tensions with China.” he explained. In recent yrars, China has been floating the idea of invading Taiwan. If China were to invade the island nation, that would only raise tensions with the west who has been on and off on whether they would provide military protections to Taiwan in the case of military conflict.

Chinese premier Xi Xinping has reportedly been meeting with Kim Jong Un in recent months, learning about the North Korean Bitcoin strategy.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Leaked Pete Hegseth Group Chat Messages Suggest Trump Considering Nationalizing Michael Saylor’s Company Strategy,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/leaked-pete-hegseth-group-chat-messages-suggest-trump-considering-nationalizing-michael-saylors-company-strategy,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:37:09 GMT","On Monday, the Atlantic released a series of unredacted messages from a Signal chat including various Trump administration officials discussing the administration’s desire to nationalize Strategy (formally Microstrategy) as a way to bolster the United States Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in a “budget neutral” manner.

Below are the text messages that Hegseth sent to the group of 18 senior Trump officials on March 31, according to screenshots released by The Atlantic on Monday.

TEAM UPDATE:

1000et: Strategy has been amassing Bitcoin for us. Saylor is prepared to run damage control from potential fallout.

1030et: Not sure how this move will negatively impact the price of the president’s Solana Meme Coin.

1045: Discussing strategies with social media influencers to spin narrative away from this being an executive order 6102 like event.

1055: President is concerned David Bailey will uninvite him from the Bitcoin conference if he makes this move.

1100: Jason Lowery advises to do it. Says it plays perfectly into his Softwar thesis.

1130: Brian Armstrong is also asking for Coinbase to be nationalized as well. It seems like he gets off on complying however he can.

1145: POTUS is advising to hold off until more research can be done on potential implications to his meme coin prices. MORE TO FOLLOW. We are currently clean on OPSEC. Godspeed to our crypto bags.

The messages were leaked to the Atlantic by an unnamed PODCONF official who was mistakenly added to the group chat and is concerned the events could undermine Bitcoin’s “Number Go Up.”

Why defense secretary Pete Hegseth is involved: Bitcoin seems to be a growing part of the Trump Administration’s national security policy. Financial sovereignty is a substantial part of national defense. Some speculate that Donald Trump is very proud of the way that Hegseth handled the bombing of Yemen last week.

Why it matters: Many Bitcoin users have been critical of Strategy, due to its close proximity to Langley, VA as well its choice to custody funds with Coinbase, who also custody funds for the United States government. The leaked Signal group chat log suggests that Strategy may have been operating as a front for the US government to amass a large portion of Bitcoin. A common saying in the Bitcoin community is “Not your keys, not your coins,” pointing to how the digital currency could be arbitrarily confiscated by governments if held by 3rd parties.

What Hegseth is saying: It appears Hegseth understands this will likely be an unpopular move both in the business world and the Bitcoin ecosystem. When a government nationalizes a company in order to take control of their assets, it can cause uncertainty in the business world. It seems that the Trump administration is working with a series of media personalities and influencers to try and craft a narrative in an effort to manage any tensions or fallout that could result from this move.

How this could impact Bitcoin Price: Analysts we have talked with are ambivalent on how the nationalization of Strategy could impact the price of Bitcoin. In the short term it may cause fear and uncertainty leading to a sell off, but many believe that it’s good for price in the long term as once again, it would be a vote of confidence in the digital currency from the world’s most powerful government.

Will this leak unwind the plan: The leak may have foiled the Trump Administration’s plans, yet it is unsure if they were planning on doing this versus just exploring the possibility. In 1962 the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented a plan to President Kennedy called Operation Northwoods in which acts of terrorism carried out by US intelligence agencies would be committed on US soil in an attempt to manufacture consent for the invasion of Cuba. From Hegseth’s messages, the president appeared hesitant as the move may have negative impacts on the price of his cryptocurrency holdings.

Bitcoin Bugle’s annual popularity tournament took a strange turn when 16 seed wildcard Teddy Bitcoins defeated Bitcoin fan favorite, Adam Back.

During the seven rounds of polling, Bitcoin maximalists followed in horror as Twitter villain and rumored felon Teddy Bitcoin overtook the prestigious news agency’s race with a wild voter turnout that put to shame Biden’s 2020 successful US elections sweep.

In the PODCONF sponsored showdown, Teddy Bitcoin beat legendary Bitcoin maximalists including Greg Zaj, Hodl Magoo, Adam Back, the lovely Lyn Alden and defending champion Yellow, concluding the ‘Maxi’ championship by defeating Strategy CEO Michael Saylor by a large margin.The final poll drew over 90 thousand votes, a record in the championship’s history.

At first drawing enthusiasm and sportsmanship, the tournament took a dark turn after Teddy beat championed memer Yellow in the 4rd round. The social media platform increasingly roared with ‘rees’ and accusations as Bitcoin purists searched for who to blame. Online commentators accused PODCONF, the auditor of the contest, with corruption and mismanagement. Many of these conspiracy theorists spread unsubstantiated claims on the fairness of the voting system.

Swanning to the Rescue

Swan Bitcoin, a Bitcoin brokerage service with strong brand recognition thanks to its ‘Bitcoin Maxi’ identity politics, had many employees upset by these events. Swan’s C Suite was seen protesting Teddy Bitcoin in numerous online posts, calling him a scammer, before simmering down during the alleged mental health day.

Text for image: Swan co-founder tweeted in support of inventor of proof-of-work Adam Beck competing agiainst his fellow $MSTR enthusiets Teddy Bitcoin

Ashley Marchetta, Swan’s head of Culture and People answered our request for comment: “Identity is central not only to Swan Bitcoin’s marketing and sales strategy but to our culture as a Bitcoin company. Teddy Bitcoin’s win in Maxi Madness was a clear attack on our business’ and customer’s core identity. Being a Bitcoin Maxi isn’t just about being ‘Bitcoin only’ but about ambition and keeping things clean. In our team’s view, The Bugle has slandered Bitcoin Maximalism by letting shitcoiners like Jason Williams and Teddy Bitcoins into this prestigious Maxi only tournament. These outcomes created immense mental damage to our community. We know this has been tough on the ecosystem, and are now providing community crisis counseling.” Marchetta added that they would be tasking Swan’s HR department with offering their counseling services to the broader community to help reaffirm their identities as Bitcoin maxis.

Is this good use of the firm’s resources? Many expect this move will help gain favor for Swan in the Bitcoin community which has seen a rise of Antiswanitism over the last year.

Budapest, Hungary, April 1st, 2025, Chainwire

Mosaic Alpha commenced its Basket Manager Combine, a three-month competition for crypto influencers, asset managers, and experienced investors to create and manage token baskets to win a share of over $30,000 in rewards. The competition runs from April 1, 2025, until June 30, 2025.

A token basket is a decentralized financial product that combines multiple cryptocurrencies into a single, tradable portfolio. Each basket reflects the creator’s investment strategy and can be followed, shared, and tracked in real time. Anyone can invest in a token basket, effectively subscribing to an asset manager’s strategy. If the basket performs well, both the manager and the investors benefit through gains—however, underperformance may lead to losses as well.

Basket managers earn performance-based fees from investor participation, creating a shared incentive model that aligns their success with that of their followers. To maintain quality and reliability, only carefully selected, whitelisted assets are allowed in token baskets— meaning no unverified tokens are featured on Mosaic Alpha. Unlike traditional asset management, token baskets are non-custodial, transparent, and entirely blockchain-based.

This competition allows participants to create and manage their own token baskets using Mosaic Alpha’s platform. The top-performing token basket managers on the leaderboard will be rewarded with prizes paid in the official utility token of the platform (Kodexa token). The prizes are $15,000 worth of KDX tokens for 1st place, $10,000 worth of KDX tokens for 2nd place, and $5,000 worth of KDX tokens for 3rd place.

How to Participate:

Create a Wallet – Set up a digital crypto wallet using Metamask, Trustwallet, or any other crypto wallet that supports the Walletconnect function. Fund Your Wallet – Deposit USDT, BNB, or other supported cryptocurrencies on the Binance Smart Chain network. Build Your Token Basket – Choose your preferred cryptocurrencies, craft a unique strategy, and set the initial composition of your token basket. Keep your basket compliant with the rules of the competition. Optimize Your Basket – Continuously manage and adjust your basket as market conditions shift. Share your basket with your community to increase engagement. Compete for Rewards – Track your performance and strive for the top of the leaderboard to win prizes.

To further improve reliability, participants can verify their profiles by uploading their trading history, bio, and other credentials. Verified profiles will be marked on the platform, giving potential investors greater confidence when choosing where to invest. This increased trust can lead to higher investment inflows, ultimately boosting the basket manager’s earnings through fees.

“We’re looking forward to seeing how our diverse community of traders, influencers, and investors will leverage the platform’s token basket capabilities to build winning strategies,” said Attila Vidákovics, CEO at Mosaic Alpha. “The Basket Manager Combine is a perfect opportunity to put those strategies to the test in a competitive environment, with substantial rewards up for grabs, and in the end bring our users more diversified and tailored portfolios.”

Commenting on the launch and integration of this version, KX Wu, COO of Bitunix, said that this is a unique feature that no one has offered before. “We are the first to offer this version to our users.

During these years, Bitunix has created partnerships with industry leaders like Moonpay, Volet, Coinify, and Alchemy Pay, making purchasing crypto securely and easier. Additionally, Hacken, Certified, and Salus security audits have reinforced its commitment to user safety.

Panama, Panama, April 1st, 2025, Chainwire

Backed by strong investment, record-breaking NFT sales, and a 60-million user base, SEED is setting the new trend for the GameFi narrative. As traditional Play-to-Earn fades, SEED brings back the NFT Gaming, combining opportunities for sustainable rewards with a real playing experience. With a bold vision and long-term strategy, SEED aims to pioneer the first sustainable Web3 gaming ecosystem on Sui and set a blueprint for the future of Web3 gaming.

SEED has gained the community’s attention with notable milestones, starting with investment secured from the Sui Foundation. Building on this traction, their NFT collection recently claimed the top 1 on Sui, proving the strong demand and real value of SEED’s in-game assets. Meanwhile, $SLOVE reached Top 2 trending on DexScreener, amassing 25K+ holders in just 3 days. With support from Mysten Labs, SEED is proving that Web3 gaming is more than a trend.

SEED officially lists on April 1, 2025, at 10:00 AM (UTC) on leading exchanges like KuCoin, BingX, MEXC, and Cetus. With staking rewards and strategic token burns, including the burn of 37.5 million $SEED from the Mon Box launch, SEED is set up for long-term growth and a potential price increase of 200% or more.

The Comeback of NFT Gaming

SEED Go is the team’s next big step in Play-to-Earn – a location-based game that brings Web3 gaming into the real world. By combining Play-to-Earn with real-world exploration, SEED Go is set to make Web3 gaming more interactive, immersive, and rewarding than before. Instead of playing on-screen only, players will walk to the nearest tree on the SEED map and send their SEED Mon on a hunt for $SLOVE, $SEED, and hidden treasures.

Launched on Mar 26, SEED Go has already drawn 50,000+ players, increasing every single day, into the hunt with earning potential from $5 – $50 per day. SEED Mon NFTs have already generated $2M+ in sales, fueling the demand for its in-game economy.

Looking Ahead: Expanding Gameplay and Real-World Integration

After TGE, the team’s priority is to onboard more users, keep them engaged, and make sure they stay for the long run. They’re also rolling out Adventure Mode and Mon Battle. Adventure Mode is where players hunt SEED Mons in the real world using their Mons. Comparable to Pokémon Go, but for blockchain gaming. Meanwhile, Mon Battle offers strategic combat against Mons for glory and rewards. And beyond all that, SEED is building a Real World Network – RWA Layer 1, integrating real-world assets, to take Web3 gaming beyond the screen.

Instead of chasing short-term hype, SEED is committed to building lasting value, real engagement, and an immersive gaming experience through its dual-token model and well-designed economy. SEED holders will continuously benefit from all DApps within the SEED ecosystem.

With a clear vision for the future, SEED aims to not only lead the charge in GameFi innovation but also lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable, real-world-integrated gaming that may shape the industry for years to come.

About SEED

From a Telegram Miniapp with over 60M users, SEED is evolving into the top RPG in Web3 gaming, inspired by the success of games like Pokémon Go and Axie Infinity. With the Sui Foundation’s backing, SEED is transforming from a Telegram Miniapp into the first 100M-user Web3 gaming ecosystem on the Sui blockchain.

Recently, Wintermute was involved in test transactions related to USD1, a stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and backed by the Trump family.

Market observers suggest that falls could be linked to recent Binance position limits settings.

The changes require traders to maintain higher margin levels for the same position size. For example, positions that previously required $ 1 million margin to sustain a $ 5 million position now need additional margin to avoid automatic settlement.

Some speculate that market creators may not have met the new margin requirements, leading to forced liquidations in low liquidity markets.",cryptobriefing
https://decrypt.co,Kristin Smith Steps Down as Blockchain Association CEO to Lead Solana's Policy Push,https://decrypt.co/312728/kristin-smith-steps-down-as-blockchain-association-ceo,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:24:27 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith will resign next month from her role at the prominent crypto-focused industry group that helped elect the U.S.' first pro-crypto president to lead Layer-1 blockchain Solana’s new policy push.

Smith will begin a new role as president of Solana’s Policy Institute on May 19, she said Tuesday in an X post. Her last day at the Blockchain Association will be May 16.

The Blockchain Association’s Board of Directors has already begun the search for Smith’s successor, the group’s communications lead Curtis Kincaid told Decrypt.

“We’ve grown from a small group of passionate advocates into a leading force in Washington, D.C., and beyond,” Smith said in the X post. “Blockchain Association today is stronger than ever.”

Founded in 2018, the Blockchain Association is one of several industry groups that has fought to advance the crypto industry's interests on Capitol Hill. Their efforts helped lead to the election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump last November—a watershed moment for an industry that had previously existed on tenterhooks.

But as digital asset firms’ clout in Washington D.C. has grown, so too have calls to enshrine even more of the industry's interests into law. To meet that demand, a few Layer-1 blockchains have launched policy institutes. Now, Solana is joining them.

Dogwifhat organizers have given up on their goal of advertising the prominent Solana meme coin on the Las Vegas Sphere, over a year after nearly $700,000 worth of crypto was raised for the campaign. This comes after the token’s official X account hinted in late January that the dog would appear on the exosphere in Q1 2025.

Late Monday, pseudonymous organizer GamesMasterFlex, also known as Edward, took to X (formerly Twitter) to state that the push to put the pup on the Sphere has ended, and that contributors will start to be refunded as early as Tuesday. The statement was reposted by the token’s official X account.

Edward claims that the team had secured a deal with a “fashion partner” that would advertise the Dogwifhat logo on the Sphere. The purported signing of this contract led to the token’s official X account confirming, retracting, and then just hinting that the dog would finally appear on the outer part of the Sphere, known as the “Exosphere,” in Q1 2025, according to Edward's post.

@dogwifcoin x @SphereVegas update: Contributions are being refunded. Those who sent from a CEX will need to manually submit proof to receive their refund. I know it’s been a frustrating year, but at least we can say we gave it our best shot. We had contracts signed through a… — GamesMaster.wif 🇬🇧‣🇺🇸‣🇨🇴 (@GamesMasterFlex) March 31, 2025

Days later, however, a Sphere spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt that no deal had been signed and that it only accepted advertising from crypto exchanges and about Bitcoin.

“We have never had a deal with Dogwifhat, and our agency at the time only had one very preliminary conversation early last year,” a Sphere spokesperson told Decrypt in January. “There was and is no plan for Dogwifhat to appear on the Exosphere, and we are distressed they are using our name for fraudulent purposes.”

Edward claimed this statement “spooked” the fashion brand. The organizer told Decrypt that the fashion company, which he did not disclose, was especially concerned by the Sphere spokesperson’s use of the words “distressed” and “fraudulent purposes.”

The Dogwifhat token, which trades as WIF, then crashed 18% in the day following the statement, which Edward said led to the partner raising the alarm about how the advertisement could have a direct impact on the token price—and how that could be viewed by the SEC. This led to the deal breaking down, the organizer said.

A source familiar with the Sphere’s policies told Decrypt that the venue reviews all content that’s slated to appear on the exosphere. If any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin was included in an ad—including the likes of Ethereum, not just WIF—then the content would be flagged and not approved to run.

Edward said that the team then moved on to working with a musician set to play at the Sphere to include Dogwifhat in their visuals, but could not execute this in the previously announced timeframe. The team was working with an agency that claimed to have a “strong relationship” with Sphere CEO James Dolan, Edward said, and had pitched an art installation featuring the hat—but ultimately, this proposal also failed to come to fruition.

“I know it’s been a frustrating year, but at least we can say we gave it our best shot,” Edward said on X. “You'll see refunds going out from [Tuesday]. The hat stays on.”

Dogwifhat (WIF) has climbed 5.7% since the Sphere update, according to DEX Screener—perhaps a sign that the market is eager to put the saga behind them, and to see refunds issued to backers following a year of uncertainty.

When Decrypt reached the Sphere for comment, a spokesperson said that nothing had changed since the venue's previous statements.

Since raising nearly $700,000 in March 2024, the advertisement has become a shadow looming over the token as its community grew restless—with many sending hate and insults to the organizers on social media.

Pressure continued to mount when Crypto.com advertised Bitcoin on the Sphere last July, and again when rival Solana meme coin BONK was featured in a drone light show above the venue in December.

Fortunately, the funds were always traceable on the Solana blockchain via block explorer Solscan, where $697,800 worth of the USDC stablecoin remains in the original mutli-sig wallet—which requires multiple signers to move the funds.

Despite speculation from some aggrieved backers that the campaign was a scam or that the organizers were swiping the funds, they remain in clear view in the wallet. That said, the funds had been moved to an external wallet when the Q1 announcement was made, presumably to pay for the signed contract, but were moved back two weeks later.

Refunds are set to start as early as Tuesday; Edward told Decrypt that organizer Mihir is in charge of the refund process. Edward explained that the process will be automatic for contributors aside from those who sent funds via a centralized exchange. They will have to go through a manual submission process to seek a refund.

Mihir did not respond to Decrypt’s request for comment for further details on the refund process.

While the market may be receiving the Sphere news positively, one of the multi-sig owners took the opportunity to chastise community members who complained along the way.

“Getting WIF on the Sphere would’ve been a net positive for all memes,” pseudonymous organizer and multi-sig owner Quasi said on X. “Instead you guys ridiculed us and called us scammers for trying (and holding funds in the most transparent way possible).”

“Sad state of affairs,” Quasi said.

The Switch is Nintendo’s best-selling home console of all time, and widely beloved for its rich library of games—a dramatic turn from the middling Wii U before it. But it’s been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo’s next big thing.

Luckily, it's coming. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025.



From what we know officially and what's been widely reported, the Switch successor will pack in more power than the original while maintaining its winning blend of home console and handheld functionality. Here's everything you need to know.



What is the Nintendo Switch 2?

It's official: Nintendo is making a successor to its wildly popular Switch console. Granted, that's no surprise to anyone that's followed the video game industry for more than a minute. But now we've seen what's coming.



Nintendo shared the first official teaser video below on January 16, 2025, sharing many key details for the Switch 2 while still playing coy on others. We've learned a lot from this video, no doubt, but there's still plenty we want to know.

But this isn't the first time that Nintendo has officially commented. On May 7, 2024, Nintendo's official corporate account tweeted the following statement:

""This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.""

It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct… — 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) May 7, 2024

Even ahead of the May 2024 announcement, Nintendo was clearly planning for what’s next. In response to a fan question in June 2023, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said, “As for the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next-generation machine, we want to do as much as possible in order to smoothly transition our customers, while utilizing the Nintendo Account.”

When will the Nintendo Switch 2 come out?

Reports had long pointed to a late 2024 release target, but that didn't happen. Now, with the official trailer launch, all we have is a ""2025"" release window.



Join us tomorrow, April 2nd, at 6 a.m. PT for a closer look at #NintendoSwitch2! The #NintendoDirect: Nintendo Switch 2 – 4.2.2025 livestream will be approximately 60 minutes long. Watch it here: https://t.co/Rw1wnp5Xbr pic.twitter.com/eF7jJ2dDxj — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 1, 2025

We can make some educated guesses here, however. Nintendo will hold an hourlong Direct livestream on April 2, 2025 at 9am ET to presumably share much more about the console. After that, on April 3-4, Nintendo's ""Treehouse"" team will host livestreams showcasing hours of gameplay from Switch 2 games.

Nintendo will then hold hands-on events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas throughout the rest of the month, with the last announced event ending on April 27.

Nothing is official, but a June release target has been widely reported, including in a late March report from Insider Gaming citing retailer launch documents. Pre-orders are expected to begin either April 2, following the stream, or a week later on April 9.

Any in-demand console launch is inevitably plagued by shortages, but Nintendo's president says the company is already thinking ahead to how to minimize the impact the next time around.

In an investor-centric Q&A from June 2024 translated from Japanese by IGN, Shuntaro Furukawa said that Nintendo is thinking ahead to supply issues and looking into how local laws and regulations could help stymie the resale market that many consoles get snapped up and sold into at inflated prices. Furthermore, the firm doesn't anticipate significant component shortages that could slow console manufacturing.

“Although we were unable to produce sufficient quantities of Nintendo Switch hardware last year and the year before due to a shortage of semiconductor components, this situation has now been resolved,"" he said. ""At this time, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model.""

In February 2025, during the firm's latest earnings call, Furukawa reiterated that the company is aiming to discourage scalpers from buying up available stock for the resale market.

“We will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date (regarding scalpers and the like). We are making preparations,"" he said, per Nikkei (via VGC).

Even with Nintendo's preparations, however, there's concern that launch supplies won't meet demand. The unnamed ""large U.S. retailer"" that provided documents to Insider Gaming is expecting a day-one pre-order sellout, for example.

How much will the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?

Officially, we don't know yet: Nintendo hasn't said anything on this front. But there's been plenty of speculation.

The original Switch launched for $300 in 2017, with the purely handheld Switch Lite rolling out for $200 in 2019. With some premium enhancements (including a larger, bolder screen), the Nintendo Switch OLED model shipped for $350 in 2021.

In October 2023, a leaker—who WCCF Tech said has previously shared reliable information—claimed that the price point for the Switch 2 will be $449 for the base model and $400 for a version that is fully digital without cartridge support. The official Switch 2 trailer did not showcase or point to any fully digital model, however, so that may not actually be in the works.

The Switch 2 will launch into an increasingly competitive handheld landscape that includes many PC gaming devices. Valve's popular Steam Deck, for example, starts at $399 for the base model with an LCD screen, while more robust models with OLED panels start at $549.

What will the Nintendo Switch 2 look like?

After a whole ton of speculation, much of which was right on-target, we can finally say: The Switch 2 looks like a bigger Switch, mostly.

Nintendo thankfully isn't ditching the Switch's smash-success hybrid design, delivering a handheld that can easily be docked for TV use. At its core, the Switch 2 doesn't change too much. But there are some notable tweaks and upgrades we're seeing from the trailer and official imagery so far.

First off, the screen and Joy-Con attachment controllers are definitely larger. If we had to guess on screen size, we'd estimate somewhere around 7-8 inches, compared to 6.2 inches on the normal Switch. But Nintendo has yet to release official specs.

The model shown in the first trailer ditches the bold red and blue Joy-Con designs of the original launch model, instead going for a sleek black or perhaps dark gray scheme with red and blue accents under the analog sticks and in the connective tissue between the console (screen) unit and controllers.

Instead of having these Joy-Con controllers slide into place, they'll plug in via an adapter port and be held in place with what appear to be magnets. There had been significant speculation that the Switch 2 will use electromagnets to keep the controllers in place. We can also see from the trailer that there's a new release button on the back of each Joy-Con that triggers a small plunger to disconnect them from the unit.

Furthermore, there appears to be a new sensor on the Switch 2 Joy-cons that lets them be used like a computer mouse on a flat surface, once plugged into the wrist strap attachments. This appears to confirm speculation regarding mouse-like functionality, enabling more advanced control schemes for games like shooters, strategy sims, and maybe even creative apps.

Nintendo even has the Joy-Cons scurrying around like little techie mice in the trailer—and in a teaser image shared on April 1, one day before the next big livestream, Nintendo again showed the Joy-Con in a mouse-like position. But the right Joy-Con appears to ditch the infrared camera found on the original model, which was barely used by many games anyway.

Other interesting details from the trailer: The new kickstand is much larger and hopefully sturdier than that of the original Switch, allowing for more freestanding positions. Also, there are now two USB-C ports—one on top and one on the bottom. Is the extra one meant to enable potentially new accessories?

In an updated render shared by Nintendo in late March, the small button at the bottom of the face of the right Joy-con controller now has a ""C"" emblazoned on it. Will it be a ""Cast"" button for streaming, or is it something else entirely? We should find out next week.

And we know that the Switch 2 will continue to use the same physical cartridges from the Switch—yes, enabling backwards compatability—along with downloadable games.

How powerful will the Nintendo Switch 2 be?

Nintendo hasn't shared official specs yet, and the one game from the trailer didn't give a great sense of a visual upgrade. But we certainly expect a notable step up from what the original Switch could handle.

Reports suggest that Nintendo will not try to compete with the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X as the standard-bearers for home consoles and instead deliver a gaming experience with a bit less fidelity. That's been the standard Nintendo approach for a few generations now. Even so, it sounds like a significant improvement over the Switch.

In September 2023, leaked documents from major game publisher Activision showed that the company had evaluated the hardware in late 2022, ultimately surmising that the Switch successor will have similar power to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hardware.

While those are 10-year-old home consoles, it still would be a notable step up from what the original Switch can handle. The Switch’s hybrid home-plus-handheld model also means that Nintendo has to keep in mind a slim form factor and battery life expectations, so it’s unlikely that we’d even see a Switch-like device with top-end internals at a reasonable price.

Eurogamer reported that Nintendo showed off private tech demos for the Switch 2 to developers at the Gamescom conference in August 2023, and that it used an upgraded version of 2017’s hit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a demonstration of the new hardware’s capabilities.

VGC supported that report and added that Nintendo also used Epic Games’ The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, with capabilities like ray tracing (realistic lighting effects) and AI-driven visual upscaling tricks enabled. Another rumor points to the use of ""ray reconstruction,"" a less hardware-intensive way of delivering ray tracing effects with the help of AI, via Nvidia's DLSS 3.5 tech.

All told, this may point to hardware that is actually more capable than the PS4 or Xbox One, even if it doesn’t quite match the benchmarks of the current-gen PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It could be relatively well equipped in terms of RAM, however, with noted leaker Felipe Lima suggesting that the device with have 12GB onboard—that's more than the Xbox Series S console at 10GB.

A February 2024 report from Reuters cites a source claiming that the Switch 2 will use a custom Nvidia chip, much like the original Switch hardware did.

According to a January 2024 report from Bloomberg, Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase says that Nintendo has picked a sizable 8-inch display for the Switch 2, and the display will use LCD tech as other reports have previously noted. Nintendo declined comment. The current Switch OLED model has a 7-inch screen, so this would be larger than any original Switch device.

Mobapad also points to an 8-inch display, which it says it be upgraded from 720p HD resolution on the original Switch to 1080p Full HD resolution on the successor.

What games will the Nintendo Switch 2 have?

We know one for sure: a new Mario Kart, revealed in the Switch 2 trailer. We don't have an official name yet; Mario Kart 9 would make sense based on the series' mainline entries, though earlier rumors pointed to a name of Mario Kart X to account for the mobile game Mario Kart Tour launching since Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (and later Switch).

Whatever the final name, the new Mario Kart looks much like what we've come to expect from the series, though the brief tease appears to show 24 starting spots on the track—so there may be way more racers than usual.

You can bet that we’ll see Nintendo’s tried-and-true franchises like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and many others in the mix before long, though Nintendo hasn't shown anything else besides Mario Kart just yet. Previous rumors have pointed to games like a new Donkey Kong or Ubisoft's next as-yet-unannounced Far Cry sequel, but those remain unconfirmed for now.

The long-delayed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still set to launch on the original Switch in 2025, Nintendo confirmed in February—but it's been widely rumored to also launch on Switch 2.

In fact, many gamers have suspected that the game's trailer is actually showing Switch 2 footage, but that hasn't been confirmed. But really, why wouldn't Nintendo release it across both consoles? There's precedent too: Nintendo launched The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the same date across Switch and Wii U, and Zelda: Twilight Princess just weeks apart across Wii and GameCube.

Electronic Arts appears to be onboard with the Switch 2, and while that might sound obvious, EA hasn't put a new Madden NFL game on a Nintendo console since 2012. It's true: Madden never hit the Switch, and the company has been pretty selective with Nintendo games in the past.

""Any time a new console comes into the marketplace, that's of a benefit to us,"" EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during an earnings call in February 2025, per GameSpot. ""It gives us the ability to access and acquire new players. Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past.""

Microsoft is also planning to support the Switch 2 with Xbox games, as part of the firm's recent expansion to bring its owned franchises to other hardware. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January 2025 that he's ""really looking forward to supporting"" Nintendo's next console with games.

After Rockstar Games' official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is currently announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, it begs the question: Will it come to Switch 2, too? And perhaps more pressingly, will the Switch 2 be powerful enough to run it?

There's no official word for now, of course, and there wouldn't be until Nintendo actually reveals its next console. But in the meantime, the technical experts at Digital Foundry are dubious that the Switch 2 will have enough power to handle Rockstar's next big game—at least based on the leaks so far.

""I’d love to say it would happen. I don’t think it will, realistically,"" said Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter in a YouTube video (via IGN). ""It’s a mobile chipset. We’ve seen a lot of amazing things on the Switch 1. Switch 2 is going to be a lot better, a proper generational leap, and forward-looking in many ways. But the stuff they seem to be rolling out for GTA 6 is possibly beyond that.""

""It seems a step beyond,"" he added, ""and out of character with what we know about Rockstar’s M.O.""

Will it play original Switch games?

Yes! Nintendo tweeted on November 5, 2024 that the ""successor to the Nintendo Switch"" will also be able to play original Switch software. This had been rumored and reported previously, but the gaming giant cleared up any questions about Switch owners making a graceful transition to the new device. The Switch Online service will also return on Switch 2.

This is Furukawa. At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about… — 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) November 6, 2024

Nintendo repeated the message in the January 2025 trailer, showing that Switch cartridges will fit into the Switch 2, and noting that digital games will also be supported. A physical copy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was shown in the trailer. However, there was a caveat: Some games may not be supported or work in full.

What does that mean? While we don't know for sure yet, it's likely that some games designed for the size and shape of the original Joy-Cons—like fitness game Ring Fit Adventure, which had players snap their controllers into an accessory shell—simply won't work with the Switch 2 controllers. And the rare few games that used the IR camera on the original right Joy-Con, like 1-2 Switch, similarly will lose functionality on Switch 2 hardware.

The other lingering question about backwards compatibility is whether the Switch games will simply run as-is, or if they will take advantage of the Switch 2's expected performance bump—whether that's an automatic upgrade, or one that developers may need to code and patch in.

A report from Eurogamer in February 2024 suggested that Nintendo will let users play their original Switch games (both physical and digital) in the Switch 2 hardware with enhancements. Developers will reportedly need to update their games to unlock such upgrades, however, which means not every game will necessarily take advantage of the Switch 2's improved power.

https://decrypt.co,Top Lawmaker Shuts Down Coinbase Plea for Interest-Bearing Stablecoins,https://decrypt.co/312692/top-lawmaker-shuts-down-coinbase-plea-interest-stablecoins,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:28:03 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

As stablecoin legislation races toward the finish line in both chambers of Congress, crypto leaders have issued increasingly direct appeals to make those bills more favorable to their industry—but they're encountering resistance from lawmakers.

One emergent sticking point has been whether U.S.-regulated stablecoins should be allowed to generate interest for holders moving forward. On Coinbase, for instance, users can currently earn 4.1% APY on their USDC deposits—an attractive feature that could at scale make stablecoins competitive with traditional bank savings accounts, which offer much lower interest rates.

But as currently written, bills in the House and Senate on the subject forbid stablecoins from offering users interest or yield to their holders. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar that allow crypto traders to enter and exit positions without the need to access dollars directly, and underpin the entire crypto economy to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in daily volume.

On Monday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong made a direct appeal to lawmakers to loosen restrictions on interest-bearing stablecoins. In a sharp statement posted to X, Armstrong argued that if Congress prevented stablecoins from generating interest, the government would effectively be “put[ting] it’s thumb on the scale to benefit” the banking industry over crypto.

Within hours, however, the top Republican lawmaker shepherding stablecoin legislation through the House poured cold water on that argument, shutting down Armstrong’s request.

Rep. French Hill (R-AR), chair of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, told reporters Monday afternoon that a fundamental understanding among lawmakers that allowed stablecoin legislation to get off the ground in the first place was the notion that the products should be considered a payment rail designed to increase efficiency—not an investment product.

“That was a consensus that's been established on both sides of the Hill, and it's not really more complicated than that,” Hill said. “It's not going to be an investment per se. It’s meant to be payment.”

In response to a question from Decrypt about Armstrong and Coinbase’s position—that such a law as written could unfairly benefit banks—Rep. Hill offered his candid assessment.

“I don't view it the same way I would view a bank account,” Hill said of stablecoins. “I hear the point of view, but I don't think there's consensus among the parties, or the [chambers] of Congress, on having dollar-backed payment stablecoins pay interest to the holders of that stake.”

Hill and the House Financial Services Committee are set to mark up their stablecoin bill, the STABLE Act, on Wednesday.

Decrypt reached out to Coinbase regarding Hill’s position on the subject, but did not immediately receive a response.

As stablecoin issuers have jockeyed to prepare offerings in the expectation of the passage of related legislation, interest and yield have emerged as key selling points for such products. But now, those perks may not materialize.

Last week at the DC Blockchain Summit, the Trump family and its business partners—who recently launched their own stablecoin via World Liberty Financial—made the pitch that the product could usher in the future of American banking thanks to lucrative incentives.

“You’re giving these people this unchained banking apparatus that allows them to have dollars that are maybe earning 4%, 5%, 6%, right in their account, where they can pay directly at any source of consumerism,” Chase Herro, a co-founder of World Liberty, said onstage, referring to stablecoins.

“I think we’ve looked past the most simple idea,” Herro said. “How do you get a consumer to consume with a better product?”",decrypt

Sinagpore, Sinagpore, April 1st, 2025, Chainwire

LBank (lbank.com), a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has released its Q1 2025 Performance Report, showcasing record-breaking trading volume, robust product growth, and major security enhancements as it solidifies its position as a global leader in digital asset trading.

LBank’s proactive approach to Fastest Altcoin Listings, Top1 in Meme Liquidity, and Pre-market Guarantee has reinforced its competitive edge. The exchange’s daily trading volume surpassed $4 billion, reflecting a 17.47% increase from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, monthly visits surged by 20%, reaching 14.9 million in Q1 2025, further cementing LBank’s position as a major force in the digital asset ecosystem.

In Q1 2025, LBank accelerated its rapid-listing strategy, adding 366 high-potential assets across memecoins, Layer 2, and DeFi sectors. Notably, about 51% of these listings were memecoins, with many achieving returns exceeding 10x. LBank’s dominance in the memecoin sector was further recognized by crypto media outlet CoinGape, which named it the “Top Choice for Meme Investment.”

Beyond asset listings, LBank introduced innovative trading mechanisms to enhance user protection and profitability. Its exclusive pre-market guarantee, the first price protection mechanism among centralized exchanges, covers 90% of assets and delivers standout performers, including $PAIN, $KAITO, and $IP, with returns peaking at 206x. Meanwhile, Launchpool projects MVHQ and RealtyX soar by 633% and 718%, respectively, empowering users to access high-potential opportunities with reduced risk.

LBank’s advanced security system prevented over 1,800 incidents in Q1, blocking potential losses exceeding $200 million. To enhance user safety, LBank launched a $100 million Futures Risk Protection Fund. Additionally, LBank forms a strategic compliance partnership with Elliptic, strengthening regulatory alignment and security protocols to uphold a transparent and compliant trading ecosystem.

LBank expanded its global presence through high-profile offline events and strategic marketing initiatives. In Hong Kong, the exchange hosted “AI in the Skyline,” a flagship industry event that attracted significant attention.

Discover SCENE

Kingstown, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, April 1st, 2025, Chainwire

Bitunix exchange has announced that it has launched the Ultra version of the K-line (candlesticks) on its mobile app integrated with TradingView. This advanced charting system transforms the mobile trading experience for cryptocurrency traders, allowing them to enjoy a smooth candlestick experience.

Bitunix is the first exchange in the industry to integrate TradingView professional-grade features on its app, making this an Industry-Leading feature integration. This launch marks a significant milestone for the crypto exchange on a journey that began nearly four years ago.

Users can set stop-loss and take-profit levels, place limit orders, and interact with charts in real time, easily syncing with the web platform. The app offers a smooth trading experience with easy-to-use charts that allow swiping, zooming, and dragging. Traders can customize their view with various chart styles, technical indicators, and drawing tools. Plus, a refined slider feature makes order placement even more precise and user-friendly.

Traders can activate the Ultra Version K-line by navigating to the settings in the Bitunix app and selecting the Ultra Version K-line option.

Commenting on the launch and integration of this version, KX Wu, COO of Bitunix, said that this is a unique feature that no one has offered before. ""We are the first to offer this version to our users. This has come as a result of the fact that we are always looking to introduce new features for our traders. Now everything will be easier for them with our TradingView Integrated K-Line Ultra App Version,"" he said.

All TradingView Functions Now Available on Bitunix Mobile App

With the Ultra Version K-Line offering improved tools, better customization options, and an improved interface, users can analyze the market more effectively and execute trades with greater ease. Here are some of the key upgrades and features:

Setting a New Industry Standard for Mobile Trading

Candlestick charts, or K-lines, are critical tools for cryptocurrency traders, enabling market analysis and strategic decision-making. Historically, mobile apps have struggled to match the sophistication of web-based charting tools. This version redefines mobile crypto trading by delivering a professional, web-level experience on mobile devices.

Bitunix continues to prioritize user experience, following the latest insights from the industry. According to a report on the importance of user experience in crypto trading apps, by Blockchain Magazine, improving the trading platform’s usability is crucial for attracting and retaining users in an increasingly competitive market hence the launch of the K-Line Ultra.

Breaking Records Since 2021

Since its launch in 2021, Bitunix has continuously improved its platform. Version 1 introduced spot and futures trading, followed by Version 2 in 2022, which added third-party fiat payment integration.

In 2023, Bitunix expanded with a P2P market, and in 2024, it introduced Convert and Copy Trading features along with a Multi-asset margin function. It also launched an advanced multi-window trading interface, where users can open up to 16 windows on one screen at the same time, becoming the only exchange in the world to have this feature. Looking ahead, 2025 will see the launch of Earn products and COIN-M futures trading, further elevating user experience.

In 2024, the platform demonstrated its Proof of Reserve, showcasing its commitment to security and transparency, and secured a $5 million insurance fund for its users. This led to Bitunix being ranked among the top 15 exchanges on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, a testament to its rapid growth and reliability. Recently Bitunix was also ranked among the top 10 crypto exchanges on CoinGlass.

During these years, Bitunix has created partnerships with industry leaders like Moonpay, Volet, Coinify, and Alchemy Pay, making purchasing crypto securely and easier. Additionally, Hacken, Certified, and Salus security audits have reinforced its commitment to user safety.

Bitunix participated at Blockchain Life 2024 conference in Dubai, was a Silver Sponsor at Token2049 Singapore, Golden Sponsor at ETH Riyadh 2024, and Title Sponsor at Web3 Amsterdam. The exchange will also participate in Paris Blockchain Week and Token2049 Dubai in 2025, among other key conferences.

The launch of the Ultra Version K-line is the culmination of all the efforts that the Bitunix team has made to make trading as easy as possible for traders. As the world's fastest-growing crypto exchange, Bitunix has been committed to continuous improvements and remains dedicated to ongoing innovation and user-driven improvements.

Discover SCENE

Panama, Panama, April 1st, 2025, Chainwire

Backed by strong investment, record-breaking NFT sales, and a 60-million user base, SEED is setting the new trend for the GameFi narrative. As traditional Play-to-Earn fades, SEED brings back the NFT Gaming, combining opportunities for sustainable rewards with a real playing experience. With a bold vision and long-term strategy, SEED aims to pioneer the first sustainable Web3 gaming ecosystem on Sui and set a blueprint for the future of Web3 gaming.

Strong Metrics Ahead of Listing

SEED has gained the community’s attention with notable milestones, starting with investment secured from the Sui Foundation. Building on this traction, their NFT collection recently claimed the top 1 on Sui, proving the strong demand and real value of SEED’s in-game assets. Meanwhile, $SLOVE reached Top 2 trending on DexScreener, amassing 25K+ holders in just 3 days. With support from Mysten Labs, SEED is proving that Web3 gaming is more than a trend.

SEED officially lists on April 1, 2025, at 10:00 AM (UTC) on leading exchanges like KuCoin, BingX, MEXC, and Cetus. With staking rewards and strategic token burns, including the burn of 37.5 million $SEED from the Mon Box launch, SEED is set up for long-term growth and a potential price increase of 200% or more.

The Comeback of NFT Gaming

SEED Go is the team's next big step in Play-to-Earn - a location-based game that brings Web3 gaming into the real world. By combining Play-to-Earn with real-world exploration, SEED Go is set to make Web3 gaming more interactive, immersive, and rewarding than before. Instead of playing on-screen only, players will walk to the nearest tree on the SEED map and send their SEED Mon on a hunt for $SLOVE, $SEED, and hidden treasures.

Launched on Mar 26, SEED Go has already drawn 50,000+ players, increasing every single day, into the hunt with earning potential from $5 - $50 per day. SEED Mon NFTs have already generated $2M+ in sales, fueling the demand for its in-game economy.

Looking Ahead: Expanding Gameplay and Real-World Integration

After TGE, the team's priority is to onboard more users, keep them engaged, and make sure they stay for the long run. They're also rolling out Adventure Mode and Mon Battle. Adventure Mode is where players hunt SEED Mons in the real world using their Mons. Comparable to Pokémon Go, but for blockchain gaming. Meanwhile, Mon Battle offers strategic combat against Mons for glory and rewards. And beyond all that, SEED is building a Real World Network - RWA Layer 1, integrating real-world assets, to take Web3 gaming beyond the screen.

Instead of chasing short-term hype, SEED is committed to building lasting value, real engagement, and an immersive gaming experience through its dual-token model and well-designed economy. SEED holders will continuously benefit from all DApps within the SEED ecosystem.

With a clear vision for the future, SEED aims to not only lead the charge in GameFi innovation but also lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable, real-world-integrated gaming that may shape the industry for years to come.

About SEED

From a Telegram Miniapp with over 60M users, SEED is evolving into the top RPG in Web3 gaming, inspired by the success of games like Pokémon Go and Axie Infinity. With the Sui Foundation’s backing, SEED is transforming from a Telegram Miniapp into the first 100M-user Web3 gaming ecosystem on the Sui blockchain.

Tortola, British Virgin Islands, April 1st, 2025, Chainwire

SHRAPNEL, the award-winning first-person shooter, is set to become China’s first licensed web3 game built on the nation’s official RWA Trusted Copyright Chain, where digital assets and IP rights are officially certified by government administrative bodies to enable true digital ownership for all citizens. This historic agreement aligns with China’s push into blockchain-based gaming and opens up new opportunities in the country’s multi-billion-dollar gaming market.

The launch expected this year includes:

A dedicated game launcher tailored for the Chinese market.

A marketplace built on China’s official RWA Copyright Chain, providing a suite of blockchain tools to help manage the tokenization of real-world assets in a compliant manner.

Exclusive tokenized Shrapnel in-game IP cosmetic items available only to Chinese players.

The creation of the RWA Copyright Chain shows China’s eagerness to digitize Real World Assets (RWAs), starting with the tokenization of Shrapnel IP. By putting legal records of its gaming assets on-chain, Shrapnel aims to pioneer with the Chinese government a new way of owning and trading digital assets that is fair and transparent.

As the official newspaper of the Chinese Government, People’s Daily and SHRAPNEL also reached a preliminary agreement on a monumental partnership via its digital subsidiary Lingjing Game Labs. This partnership involves the government-compliant distribution of SHRAPNEL’s localized web3 game in China, digital asset minting, issuance, free trading, and localized operations. As a government initiative, Lingjing aims to build platforms in cultural digital certification, game digital asset transformation, and game monitoring in China. (Source: People's Daily)

Recently, the SHRAPNEL team participated in a forum on ""Web3 Gaming and International Digital Copyright Collaboration"" held in Beijing with attendees including Wang Yefei, the Chairman of the Capital Copyright Association.

Refer to the official publication by the Chinese government detailing our collaborative meeting here.（Note: The government website is accessible between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM Beijing Time. The SHRAPNEL team has also hosted the contents of the government website here to be viewed 24/7. ）

“This cooperation provides a compliant solution for overseas high-quality content to enter the Chinese market. Copyright is a global consensus. Based on this consensus, they build a blockchain digital asset system, ensure cross-border copyright circulation, and show the practical value of global promotion. Especially in the field of RWA (real-world assets), they provide a Chinese model for combining digital assets and the real economy.”

“This milestone unlocks massive potential for both SHRAPNEL and web3 gaming in China,"" said Ken Rosman, CEO of Neon Machine. ""It also sets a strong precedent for how decentralized paradigms and a nation’s government can work together to drive growth on a global scale. This is just the beginning.""

Further details about the launch and the whitepaper for the China RWA Copyright Chain will be revealed in the near future.

https://decrypt.co,Hot Air Rises Again as Fartcoin Outpaces Dogecoin in April Fool's Meme Rebound,https://decrypt.co/312701/fartcoin-outpaces-dogecoin-april-fools-day,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:31:05 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Flatulence-themed Solana meme coin Fartcoin is on the rise again, jumping nearly 22% in the last 24 hours to $0.53 and outpacing the gains of top meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and President Trump’s official Solana token (TRUMP) in the same timeframe.

The token, whose proponents use the tagline “hot air rises” when promoting its glide higher, has reclaimed a $500 million market cap after crashing to approximately $200 million in early March.

However, FARTCOIN still remains about 78% off its all-time high of $2.48 from February.

By comparison, DOGE and TRUMP have gained just 4% and 2% in the last 24 hours, respectively.

Fartcoin’s place as the top meme coin leader on April Fool’s Day may be a coincidence, but the token’s rebound of more than 108% in the last month comes amid an apparent sentiment shift among Solana meme coin traders as they hope for another potential run for the token.

“Fartcoin's outperformance today is on tens of millions of dollars in liquidity and over $10 million volume in the past 24 hours. Nothing else like this is happening in the meme coin space,” posted pseudonymous crypto personality Artchick on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday. She added that Fartcoin could be “a Trojan horse for the entire meme coin sector.”

The token’s mindshare is growing, as well, based both on X activity and on-chain data.

The name for Fartcoin was dreamed up by an AI chatbot, and data related to its mindshare is being tracked alongside other AI agent tokens via analytics platform Cookie.fun. Fartcoin currently maintains the largest mindshare among AI tokens at 13.39%, and has also posted the largest mindshare gain in the last three days, jumping 4.5% over that time.

Will the Fartcoin bounce help propel a potential meme coin comeback? It may be too early to tell, but Pump.fun token launchpad co-founder Alon Cohen told Decrypt in late March that he believes meme coins are here to stay.

“A crypto user today is as likely to be trading meme coins as they were one or two months ago,” said Cohen.

The meme category has jumped by more than 5% in the last 24 hours while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained approximately 2% and 4% respectively, according to data from CoinGecko.

UK police recovered approximately $671,000 (£520,000) in crypto that was fraudulently obtained from an 80-year-old man, in what lawyers involved with the retrieval are describing as a British first under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

Working in collaboration with legal firms Edmonds Marshall McMahon and 5SAH, as well as professional services company Grant Thornton, police were able to trace the misappropriated crypto via wallet addresses supplied by the victim, known only as Mr A.

They made legal use of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which in October 2023 was amended to include a new, crypto-related section, enabling victims of cryptocurrency fraud to apply for the release of funds from wallets on which freezing orders have been placed.

Mr A had sent upwards of 9.1 BTC to fraudsters posing as exchange operators, with authorities able to establish that the Bitcoin had been converted into USDT by the perpetrators and sent on to an account with an “overseas exchange.”

Based on this information, a UK court ordered the repatriation of the defrauded crypto under the terms of the amended Proceeds of Crime Act.

Speaking to Decrypt, Ashley Fairbrother—a partner at London-based Edmonds Marshall McMahon—explained that it was the manner in which the assets were recovered that makes the case “groundbreaking” from a British legal perspective.

“Recent legislation under the Proceeds of Crime Act, specifically section 303Z51, empowers the Police to issue crypto wallet freezing orders,” he said. “Once in place, this allows victims to apply for the recovery of stolen assets once such orders are in place.”

At least $7.7 million (£6 million) in misbegotten crypto has now been retrieved by British police using the new crypto freezing orders, according to data from the HM Courts & Tribunals Service.

Fairbrother also explained that the process of retrieval operates within a civil regime but in criminal courts, which is unusual for the UK and which also means it requires lawyers with “very particular expertise” to execute properly.

In his view, the “legislation is a significant step forward—an innovative legal framework that streamlines the asset recovery process, provided there is constructive cooperation between the Police and victims.”

However, this is where challenges can arise, given that police forces in the UK can be uncertain about how much support to provide to victims beyond specific criminal investigations.

“But if the Police are willing to collaborate closely with victims and their legal representatives, as was the case here, this new legislation could be the silver bullet to addressing cross-border crypto fraud on a much larger scale in this country,” Fairbrother added.

In fact, Fairbrother states that Edmonds Marshall McMahon expects the retrieval of misappropriated crypto to become more routine in the UK.

He said, “given the unique nature of blockchain public distributed ledgers, it can actually be easier to recover crypto assets compared to traditional fiat asset recovery.”

Yet “significant” legislative work may be needed in order to facilitate more cooperation between the police and victims, while Fairbrother also suggests that forces would benefit from “the creation of dedicated cyber pursuit teams.”

Despite these challenges, Fairbrother is optimistic that this recent case marks the opening of a new phase in crypto law enforcement in the UK.

He said, “With more resources and a dedicated team in place, along with clear guidance, this could be a major catalyst for improving recovery efforts and making it a more routine part of the process.”

Stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings purchased 8,888 Bitcoin in the first quarter, adding $735 million worth of the asset to its reserves on Tuesday alongside its latest attestation report.

The company managing Tether’s industry-leading footprint now controls $7.8 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to the blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence. Three months ago, Tether padded its reserves with $777 million worth of Bitcoin.

Tether meanwhile reported record-breaking profits of $4.5 billion the first quarter, saying $1 billion flowed from massive holdings of U.S. Treasuries in a new attestation report.

The El Salvador-based firm said it now holds $90.87 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries, which mirrors Germany’s holdings of U.S. debt in early 2024, per U.S. Treasury Department data.

The remainder of Tether’s profits came from market-to-market gains on its Bitcoin and gold, the company said. Within the company’s reserves, which includes cash equivalents and other investments, Tether says it holds $5.4 billion worth of Bitcoin and $3.65 billion worth of gold.

The company said in May 2023 that it would allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. At the time, its Bitcoin holdings were worth around $1.5 billion.

In the first quarter, the precious metal’s price set new records. Futures contracts for the precious metal also rose over 19%, marking the best quarterly stretch since 1986, per Barron’s.

Bitcoin’s price fell 12% over the same period, according to the crypto data provider CoinGlass, suggesting gold played a major part in what Tether says is a new high-water mark.

In addition to the stablecoin Tether, which has a total value of around $144 billion, the company issues Tether Gold, which is worth $780 million, according to CoinGecko. Tether Gold can be redeemed for actual gold, according to Tether’s website.

For years, Tether has published attestation reports, while competitors and critics have consistently pointed out that they are not audited financial statements. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Reuters this month that a full audit is the company’s top priority.

Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the price of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar. They are often backed by a mix of cash and U.S. Treasuries.

Tether’s record-breaking profits come as lawmakers debate stablecoin legislation on Capitol Hill, which may provide a pathway to legality for stablecoin issuers in the U.S. for the first time.

The bill could also force Tether, which is not based in the U.S., to comply with anti-money laundering rules, although U.S. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) is opposed to the move. Based on the bill’s draft language, JP Morgan analysts also think Tether may have to change the structure of reserves backing its leading stablecoin.

Those details could end up leading the debate among lawmakers on Wednesday, when the House Financial Services committee is set to mark up the so-called STABLE Act.

Although some collectors have left NFTs for dead, Canary Capital believes the asset class could find fans on Wall Street.

In a recent interview with Decrypt, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg suggested the NFT market could soon experience a revival, with chatter about funds tracking NFT prices potentially stoking investor interest in digital art collectibles.

Although an NFT-backed ETF might have been unthinkable a few years ago, the likelihood that such a fund could become available to U.S. investors has increased as federal regulators embrace new, crypto-friendly regulations and as “more liquid” NFTs have come to market, McClurg told Decrypt.

“Today's SEC is more open to actively managed products, and more liquid ‘digital art’ has been created,” McClurg said. “Now that the major barriers have been removed, I…thought it was an opportunity to attempt an NFT-backed ETF.”

The executive’s comments come just 10 days after Canary Capital filed to launch a Pudgy Penguins and PENGU ETF in the U.S.—a move that divided Crypto Twitter.

Some members of the crypto community mocked the ETF filing, casting Canary Capital’s announcement as nothing more than fluff or fanfare designed to pump the Pudgy Penguins collection.

Experts previously told Decrypt that putting NFTs into ETF wrappers could present structural and technical issues, with the relative illiquidity of NFTs also posing market-making problems.

However, digital art proponents have expressed hope that an NFT-based ETF could revitalize the languishing NFT market.

Last year, the NFT market slumped to a three-year low, with both sales and trading volumes slumping nearly 20% compared to the year prior, according to Web3 data provider DappRadar’s 2024 Industry report. Meanwhile, popular NFT collections such as Pudgy Penguins, Crypto Punks and Milady Maker have lost 30%, 7% and 17% of their values in the past year, respectively, according to CoinGecko data.

Despite that market downturn, McClurg is optimistic digital art is on a path toward wider adoption in the near future.

“Now that the SEC determined digital art and collectibles to not be securities, I see the long-term trend in digital art and digital rights to those works,” McClurg said. “Major barriers have been removed.”

Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed firm Metaplanet just grabbed another 696 Bitcoin (BTC)—its most recent step in a bid to build one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in the world.

The Japanese investment company said it had acquired the coins as part of its Bitcoin Income Generation strategy, which involves selling put options and using the collateral to purchase Bitcoin at an effective discount, in a statement released Tuesday.

Metaplanet acquired 645.74 BTC when cash-secured put options they sold were exercised, and received 50.26 BTC as premiums from selling those options—bringing the total to 696 BTC added in the quarter, the company said.

“Cash-secured” refers to the company reserving sufficient capital upfront to fulfill its obligation to purchase Bitcoin if the put options are exercised.

That strategy generated over $5.1 million (¥770 million) in premiums in Q1 2025 alone—an 11.4% increase from the previous quarter—while also enabling the company to acquire Bitcoin at an effective price of just $88,800 per coin (¥13.48 million), below market rates at the time of execution.

While the acquisition nominally cost $96,000 (¥14.58 million) per BTC, the premium income reduced the net cost—demonstrating what Metaplanet called “improved BTC acquisition efficiency.”

Tuesday’s announcement is the latest in a string of moves that point to Metaplanet’s transformation into a full-blown Bitcoin treasury.

The company has now amassed 3,896 BTC through a mix of strategic options trading and capital raises. At current prices, its Bitcoin holdings are worth over $324 million.

The latest acquisition officially places the firm as the ninth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, just behind tech heavyweights like Tesla and Block, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net.

To fund its accumulation, Metaplanet approved a $13.3 million (¥2 billion) zero-coupon bond issuance on March 31.

That followed a $25.9 billion raise completed in February through unsecured bonds and stock acquisition rights issued to EVO FUND.

Grayscale Investments, one of the largest Bitcoin ETF issuers, filed to convert its existing private Digital Large Cap Fund to a publicly available exchange traded fund (ETF). It currently contains Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano.

The existing private fund, which is only available to accredited investors through private placement, heavily leans towards Bitcoin with a 79.4% weighting, at the time of writing.

The rest includes Ethereum with 10.69%. XRP, Solana, and Cardano take up 5.85%, 2.92%, and 1.14% respectively. Cardano was only added to the fund in January 2025, the filing states, following the removal of Avalanche (AVAX) due to an index rebalancing.

Since its inception in 2018, the fund’s market price has cumulatively increased by 478.83%, the Grayscale site says.

The S-3 form filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday looks to keep much of this the same while making it more widely available. It is worth noting that the filing is not complete, including the exact management fee percentage, and is subject to change.

If successful, the conversion of this fund into an ETF would enable everyday investors to gain exposure to the crypto market. The filing claims that the fund covers approximately 75% of the market cap of the digital asset market, excluding meme coins and stablecoins.

Currently only qualified investors could access Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund. The ETF conversion would remove this barrier.Since the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved in the States back in January 2024, the industry has seen a slew of crypto ETF applications. This has included Ethereum ETFs that passed in May before a hybrid Bitcoin-Ethereum fund was also approved.

At the time of writing, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs contain $97.27 billion worth of assets under management and Ethereum ETFs have $8.59 billion assets under management, according to CoinGlass.

With Donald Trump winning the U.S. Presidential election, many issuers have seen it as the start of a new regulatory environment and have filed for more experimental crypto funds. As such, we’ve seen ETF filings for the likes of Dogecoin, Bonk, and even the official Donald Trump meme coin—none of which have been approved as of yet.

Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas speculated that the DOGE and TRUMP ETFs could hit the market in early April, due to the specific filing type compared to other crypto ETF filings. However, predictors on Myriad Markets believe this is unlikely with 93% of voters believing there will not be a TRUMP ETF by the end of April.

Data on CoinGecko also shows green over the past 24 hours across Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and Solana. Charts show Bitcoin gaining 2.5%, Ethereum up 3.7%, with BNB and Solana up 2.5% and 3.3% respectively.

Notably, some $1 million in bearish Bitcoin options, with 1,180 contracts for $70K put options, was sighted Monday evening. Those options expire by April 25.

Ethereum, meanwhile, showed renewed momentum as it outpaced Solana for decentralized exchange volumes, with $63.02 billion over the latter's $51.25 billion. Despite this, data from DefiLlama shows that Solana is catching up, with a 32% uptick over the week against Ethereum's 14%.

Still, Dune data shows that Solana-based meme coin volume has dropped to just below $100 million from up to $390 million in January.

“Renewed optimism”

Those modest gains show ""renewed optimism for the new quarter,"" driven by ""a market rebound as Trump's tariff concerns have been fully absorbed,"" Dominick John, an analyst at Kronos Research, told Decrypt.

Users on MYRIAD, the decentralized prediction market launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, mirrored that sentiment. Those predicting a Crypto Fear and Greed Index score of below 32 by April 4, indicating Fear, dropped sharply from highs of over 37% at the weekend to around 17% by Tuesday morning, with the greater number of users now expecting a score of between 40 and 44.

John noted that the single-digit gains from the other majors are ""riding the overall bullish momentum."" If no ""fresh tariff developments or macroeconomic shocks"" show up within the week, such a trend could persist.

The broad-based rally, while modest, comes after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and tech equities indexed in the S&P 500 ""logged their worst quarterly performance in three years,"" according to research from QCP Capital.

This meant a ""sobering start to Q2"" over a market that is ""still searching"" for its bullish momentum, QCP Capital wrote. Some risk over a ""broad and aggressive regime"" may also ""deepen recession fears,"" QCP noted.

Broader macroeconomic factors, such as President Donald Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs, are expected to draw persisting volatility by Wednesday, followed by the release of the jobless claims report on Thursday.

Void Labs-backed Blade of God X (BoGX), a blockchain-powered action RPG that raised millions from top crypto investors, came under scrutiny after a public fallout between its core teams.

On Tuesday, Amber Bella, former CMO of Blade of God X (BoGX), posted a series of tweets on X, formerly Twitter, accusing the game’s founder, Tnise Liu Yang, and the Web2 development team of mismanagement, reward manipulation, and cutting off the Web3 community that initially funded the project.

“I must now confront the painful truth: this project has failed to deliver on the promises to the community,” she wrote, saying she never handled BoGX funds herself. Instead, she said she trusted founder Tnise Liu Yang’s “experience and character as a 10-year entrepreneur.”

Bella said tensions began in October 2024 during the launch of BoGX’s Ethereal NFT Collection, which promised exclusive staking rights and gameplay benefits.

Being suddenly blocked on all communication channels by @BladeofgodX founder,… pic.twitter.com/5v02wBdfq6 — AmberBella.eth (@0xAmberBella) April 1, 2025

The NFTs granted holders the ability to use in-game AI agents as “mining machines” and participate in token generation.

However, Bella claims the Web2 development team was still updating site features minutes before the mint, resulting in a two-hour website outage that disrupted the launch.

Amber Bella has not responded to Decrypt’s request for additional comment.

Despite being funded primarily by Web3 contributions, Bella said the development team rejected NFT utilities and community proposals.

During the game’s third test phase, her team discovered internal developer accounts competing on public leaderboards and winning real-money prizes meant for players.

“Only when we presented evidence showing that the accounts were linked to their own wallets did they finally remove these accounts,” the ex-CMO said while alleging that the team initially kept mum when confronted.

Backed by some of the biggest names in the crypto investment space—OKX Ventures, Delphi Ventures, BreederDAO, Eden Holdings, and others—BoGX was marketed as a hybrid action RPG that merged blockchain mechanics with advanced AI.

The project had raised $6 million in funding last May, and was promoted as a leading example of “play-to-train” innovation in Web3 gaming.

Bella said BoGX’s founder sidelined Web3 entirely, leading to “delayed payments turning into no payments” and creating “financial strain on professionals who devoted months to the project.”

After attempting to propose a structured resolution—including NFT refunds and financial transparency—Bella said she was blocked and removed from all internal systems.

To address the situation, the ex-CMO announced she will use her personal 24.2 ETH to distribute partial compensation via “ARB transfers,” based on an end-of-March snapshot of NFT holders.

Blade of God X remains available in early access on the Epic Games Store.

The game blends dark Nordic themes with “Souls-like” combat mechanics and supports optional blockchain features through Immutable X and Ethereum Virtual Machine chains.

Players can collect NFT-based “Soul Cards,” train AI companions, and link wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.

Void Labs and Tnise Liu Yang have not yet commented publicly on the allegations.

Bella closed her thread with a direct message to Liu Yang, “You've abandoned the project without explanation or basic settlement… The Web3 community deserves better than promises that evaporate once funding is secured.”

Discover SCENE

A member of the California State Assembly has introduced an amendment to a recently introduced money transmission bill that would protect the ability of state residents to use cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.

First introduced by Democrat Senator Laura Richardson on February 20 as the Money Transmission Act, the bill had been concerned primarily with requiring digital wallet providers operating in California to “take certain actions” to ensure the security of their products, including the use of two-factor authentication.

Introduced on Friday, the new amendment from Democrat assembly member Avelino Valencia renames the bill as the Digital Assets Act, and adds several new clauses protecting the use of cryptocurrency in California.

Its main focus is on authorizing individuals and businesses within California to accept cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, as well as in payments between private individuals.

Added to this, the amendment also prohibits “public entities from prohibiting, restricting, or imposing any requirements on that use,” while also preventing the state of California from imposing taxes on the use of crypto as payment for goods and services.

Related to this is a clause which, as Satoshi Action Fund CEO and co-founder Dennis Potter told Decrypt, “explicitly affirms the right of individuals to self-custody their Bitcoin and digital assets.”

According to Potter, this ensures that residents can manage their cryptocurrencies independently, without being forced to send their tokens to a centralized wallet or custody service.

“New legal protections”

While the amended bill may not introduce anything that many cryptocurrency users aren’t doing already, Potter argued that its introduction is highly significant for California and its stance on crypto.

He explained, “These provisions introduce new legal protections and frameworks that were not previously codified in California law, thereby adding significant new elements to the state’s approach to digital assets.”

Other provisions in the bill include a stipulation that California’s Unclaimed Property Law would apply to crypto—meaning that exchanges, for example, would have to transfer crypto to the state in the event that the corresponding customer had been inactive and unresponsive for at least three years.

The amendment also widens the application of the Political Reform Act of 1974 to crypto, and as such prohibits “a public official from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a digital asset, security, or commodity.”

According to Potter, the intent of this provision “is to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the integrity of public office,” something that was important to Assemblymember Valencia.

Potter said, “By prohibiting public officials from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting digital assets, securities, or commodities, the bill aims to ensure that officials do not use their positions to unduly influence the market or benefit personally from such promotions.”

This latter section may also be the response of California—which is a predominantly Democrat-controlled state—to Official Trump (TRUMP), the Solana-based meme coin which U.S. President Donald Trump launched prior to taking office on January 20.

While there is no record of any state official in California openly promoting or launching a cryptocurrency, the ban’s inclusion could serve as a sweetener for Democrats who may otherwise be reluctant to promote the use of digital currencies.

A bill with a similar, albeit federal prohibition against crypto promotion has also been put before Congress, although with both chambers controlled by Republicans, it has almost zero chance of passing, at least not before the 2026 midterms.

In a tweet, the Satoshi Action Fund championed the bill, saying that if California passes it, “nearly 40 million Americans will have their right to self-custody protected.”

The Satoshi Action Fund, a non-profit Bitcoin advocacy organization founded by former alumni of the first Trump administration, has been instrumental in recent months in meeting with lawmakers and encouraging other states to pass pro-Bitcoin and -crypto legislation.

It recently had a hand in the passage of a law in Kentucky which establishes the right of individuals to self-custody crypto, while also confirming that neither mining rewards nor staking rewards are securities.

Similarly, it has taken credit for helping to shape the discussion surrounding a BTC strategic reserve bill in Oklahoma, which recently went to the state’s senate.

And for Dennis Potter, California’s introduction of the Digital Assets bill, along with other similar bills, “reflects a broader shift” in the US towards integrating cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin into legacy financial and legal systems.

“California, as the fifth-largest economy in the world with a gross state product of nearly $3.9 trillion in 2023, plays a pivotal role in setting regulatory trends,” he said. He added that the amended bill, “indicates an evolving attitude where digital currencies are increasingly seen as legitimate financial instruments, warranting regulatory frameworks that both protect consumers and foster innovation.”",decrypt

In February, North Korean hackers broke headlines with what is now regarded as the largest single hack in crypto history.

The Lazarus Group stole at least $1.4 billion from Bybit and later funneled those funds to crypto mixers.

""Someone had pulled off the biggest hack in [crypto] history, and we had a front-row seat,"" Samczsun, Research Partner at Paradigm, recalled in a blog post.

The researcher said they witnessed the theft in real-time and collaborated with Bybit to confirm the unauthorized access.

Samczsun was working with SEAL 911, an emergency response unit affiliated with the Security Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to securing decentralized systems.

But these attacks aren't all just about the Lazarus Group. There's more to North Korea's cyber offensives than previously thought.

There's a misconception about how to ""classify and name” the group's operations.

While the term ""Lazarus Group"" is ""colloquially acceptable,"" discussing how the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) runs its cyber operations on the offensive needs more rigor, Samczsun claimed.

Lazarus Group has become the preferred term by the media when describing DPRK cyberactivity. Cybersecurity researchers ""created more precise designations"" to show which ones are working on specific activities, they added.

A hacking bureau

The DPRK's hacking ecosystem operates under the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), which houses several distinct groups: AppleJeus, APT38, DangerousPassword, and TraderTraito

These groups operate with specific targeting methodologies and technical capabilities.

TraderTraitor, identified as the most sophisticated DPRK actor targeting the crypto industry, focuses on exchanges with large reserves and employs advanced techniques, successfully compromising Axie Infinity through fake job offers and manipulating WazirX.

AppleJeus specializes in complex supply chain attacks, including the 2023 3CX hack that potentially affected 12 million users.

Dangerous Password, meanwhile, conducts lower-end social engineering through phishing emails and malicious messaging on platforms like Telegram.

Another subgroup, APT38, spun out of Lazarus in 2016 and focused on financial crimes. It first targeted traditional banks before shifting attention to crypto platforms.

In 2018, the OFAC first mentioned ""North Korean IT workers,"" which in 2023 were identified by researchers as ""Contagious Interview"" and ""Wagemole,"" operating through schemes where the threat actors either pose as recruiters or attempt to get hired by target companies.

There's still hope

While the DPRK has shown its ability to deploy zero-day attacks, there have been ""no recorded or known incidents"" of it deploying directly against the crypto industry, Samczsun said.

The researcher urged crypto companies to implement basic security practices such as least privilege access, two-factor authentication, and device segregation. If preventive measures fail, connecting with security groups like SEAL 911 and the FBI's DPRK unit would also be helpful.

""DPRK hackers are an ever-growing threat against our industry, and we can't defeat an enemy that we don't know or understand,"" Samczsun wrote.

Smith has led the Blockchain Association for almost seven years — a dramatic period for the developing industry. Since late last year, the political grounds have solidified under the sector's feet as it finds allies running all levels of the U.S. government, where crypto advocates have long been trying to get a comprehensive set of regulations.

Cardano (ADA) trading around $0.67, with price correcting 10% over the past week

Whale holdings dropped to lowest level since February 2023, signaling reduced confidence

ADX surged to 40.19, confirming a strong bearish trend momentum

Critical support at $0.64 being tested, with next support at $0.58 if broken

Investment product inflows increased 500% week-over-week, suggesting possible renewed interest

Cardano (ADA) is currently trading above $0.67 after a slight recovery of 2.2% in the past 24 hours. This small gain comes amid a broader downtrend that has kept the cryptocurrency below the $1 mark for nearly a month.

The price has corrected by 10% over the past week. This continues the longer-term bearish pattern in ADA’s price movement throughout recent market activity.

Technical indicators point to growing downward pressure on Cardano. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has surged to 40.19 from 15.83 just four days ago, confirming that the bearish trend is not only present but gaining strength.

The ADX is a key trend strength indicator that measures momentum regardless of direction. With readings above 40, it shows the current downtrend is powerful and potentially accelerating.

Whale activity has also raised concerns for ADA supporters. The number of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA has dropped to 2,406, down from 2,421 just a few days ago.

This reduction brings whale holdings to their lowest level since February 2023. The behavior of these large holders often precedes broader market trends, suggesting reduced confidence in ADA’s short-term prospects.

Market Analysis

On the price chart, Cardano is positioned between immediate resistance at $0.69 and important support at $0.64. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.67, with the 20-day EMA hovering around $0.71.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in negative territory. This technical setup gives a slight advantage to bearish forces in the near term.

ADA recently retested the critical support level at $0.64 and managed to hold. This suggests that buyers are still defending this zone, which has become a major reference point for Cardano’s short-term outlook.

If this support level breaks on another test, it would likely push ADA toward the next support at $0.58. Such a move would indicate a continuation of the current downtrend.

Despite these bearish signals, not all news for Cardano has been negative. A CoinShares analysis shows that Cardano has seen a 500% week-over-week increase in inflows into digital asset investment products.

The total influx amounts to $0.6 million. This represents part of a larger trend of funds returning to altcoins, suggesting possible renewed investor interest in ADA.

Some critics have questioned Cardano’s fundamental value. The project ranks 18th in total value locked (TVL) with nearly $333 million, but its market capitalization stands at $23.1 billion – about 69 times its TVL.

This high ratio has led some to label Cardano as overvalued or even as a “zombie blockchain.” Critics point to the limited ecosystem growth compared to competitors like Solana.

Cardano Foundation executives have countered that the project focuses primarily on marketing the blockchain for real-world applications like identity verification and record-keeping rather than trending DeFi applications.

Looking at the daily chart, the hourly price action shows ADA has been on a downtrend since last Wednesday. The price has made three consecutive lower highs, briefly breaking below $0.660 support before retracing.

Some analysts remain optimistic about Cardano’s future despite the current warnings. There are projections of potential growth, possibly reaching higher price targets by 2025.

The prospect of listing Ripple’s $RLUSD stablecoin on the Cardano network is one factor fueling some optimistic forecasts. This connection could provide the Cardano ecosystem with added liquidity, potentially attracting more investors to ADA.",blockonomi

Goldman Sachs raised 12-month US recession probability to 35% due to anticipated Trump tariffs

Expects average US tariff rate to rise 15 percentage points in 2025, leading to higher inflation

Bank lowered 2025 GDP growth forecast to 1%, increased inflation projection to 3.5%

Trump plans to announce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs averaging 15% on April 2

Bitcoin and crypto markets are affected by these macroeconomic conditions, with BTC trading at $83,230

President Donald Trump’s planned tariff increases have prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its 12-month US recession probability to 35%, up from 20% previously. The bank warns that Trump’s trade policies could lead to slower growth, higher inflation, and rising unemployment.

Goldman Sachs economists released a note titled “US Economics Analyst: A Further Increase in Our Tariff Assumptions,” explaining their concerns. This marks the bank’s second upward revision to its 2025 US tariff expectations in March alone.

The bank now expects the average US tariff rate to rise by 15 percentage points in 2025. Most of this change comes from more aggressive “reciprocal” tariffs that Trump is expected to announce.

Trump is set to reveal across-the-board reciprocal tariffs on April 2. These are expected to average 15% on all US trading partners. After accounting for likely exclusions for certain countries and products, Goldman estimates the effective increase will be around 9 percentage points.

These tariff changes have led Goldman to cut its 2025 US GDP growth forecast to just 1%. This represents a 0.5 percentage point reduction from their previous prediction.

The bank also raised its year-end core PCE inflation forecast to 3.5%. This is 0.5 percentage points higher than earlier estimates and well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.

Unemployment projections were also increased to 4.5%. This is 0.3 percentage points higher than Goldman’s previous forecast.

Economic Warning Signs Flash Red

According to Goldman, three key factors are driving the rising recession probability. These include a lower growth baseline, worsening household and business confidence, and “statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness.”

Consumer confidence has plunged in recent months. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey showed the highest percentage of Americans expecting unemployment to rise since the Great Recession.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump is pushing his team toward even more aggressive levies. These could mean an across-the-board hit of 20% to US trading partners.

Peter Navarro, White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, told Fox News Sunday that Trump’s tariffs could raise as much as $600 billion a year. This would represent a major tax increase that could raise costs for many Americans.

In response to these economic challenges, Goldman now expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times this year. This is up from their previous prediction of two cuts.

The economic outlook presents what some analysts call a “stagflation” risk. This combines low growth and high inflation, similar to conditions seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The crypto market has not been immune to these macroeconomic concerns. Bitcoin and other digital assets edged lower following Goldman’s warning.

While cryptocurrencies were once viewed as uncorrelated to traditional economic factors, that narrative has changed. Bitcoin has become increasingly responsive to broader macro conditions, particularly liquidity, risk sentiment, and real yields.

Some experts see a potential silver lining for Bitcoin during economic downturns. Robbie Mitchnick, Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, suggested that recessions can actually benefit Bitcoin in the long term.

Mitchnick explained that recessions typically lead to more fiscal spending, debt accumulation, and monetary stimulus. These factors can support Bitcoin prices over time, even if there are short-term challenges.

At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading at $83,230. The cryptocurrency had recovered to trade above $83,000 after initial declines following the Goldman Sachs announcement.",blockonomi

Dogecoin is trading at $0.1649, down 3.6% in the past 24 hours

RSI indicators show extremely oversold conditions on multiple timeframes

DOGE is maintaining support above its long-term ascending channel dating back to 2015

Large wallet holders (whales) continue to accumulate despite price decline

Elon Musk confirmed the government has no plans to use Dogecoin despite the D.O.G.E. agency name

Dogecoin has been on a downward trend since early March, losing most of its late 2024 gains and breaking below key support levels. The popular meme cryptocurrency is now trading at $0.1649, showing a 3.6% decline in the past day.

Technical analysis reveals concerning metrics. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped into extreme oversold territory. On the 1-hour chart, RSI hovers between 25 and 27, while the 4-hour chart shows readings below 10, an uncommon occurrence that often precedes a bounce.

The daily RSI is currently at 32-33, approaching but not yet in oversold territory. These readings suggest heavy selling pressure but also indicate the potential for a price correction as buyers may see opportunity at these levels.

One analyst on TradingView gives a 30-40% probability of DOGE dropping further to the $0.158-$0.159 support area. However, they assign a higher probability (60-70%) to a near-term bounce that could target the $0.172-$0.175 range.

Despite the short-term bearish outlook, long-term technical indicators show reasons for optimism. Dogecoin continues to hold above its long-term ascending channel support, a trendline that has provided reliable support since 2015.

Market Analysis

The recent pullback brought DOGE to around $0.17, just above the critical 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.18395. If historical patterns repeat, this could mark a turning point before a move back toward the mid-range of the channel at approximately $0.56.

On-chain data provides another positive signal. The Accumulation/Distribution Line measured 20.28 billion DOGE recently, indicating that long-term holders continue to accumulate coins even as prices consolidate.

Wallet data from Santiment shows that large holders aren’t rushing to sell. Addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE, as well as those holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE, have shown steady accumulation throughout March. This suggests larger players may be positioning for potential upside.

However, Dogecoin faces near-term headwinds. It remains below both the 50 and 200-period moving averages on the 12-hour chart, with the 50 SMA acting as resistance at $0.176. A reclaim of the $0.18 level could signal the start of a reversal, especially if supported by increasing volume.

Elon Musk recently addressed speculation about government use of Dogecoin. Despite the playful naming of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), Musk confirmed the US government has no plans to use the cryptocurrency.

Musk has indicated he may end his role with D.O.G.E. by May, having set a goal to accomplish the agency’s mandate within 130 days. He told Fox News, “I think we will have accomplished most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that timeframe.”

Crypto analysts remain divided on DOGE’s future price action. Some point to the token’s history of strong rallies following major corrections, citing patterns from the 2017 and 2024 bull cycles.

Others note that potential catalysts could include SEC approval of proposed Dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). From a technical perspective, the four-hour RSI breaching “oversold” territory combined with a breakout from a months-long falling wedge pattern may signal a recovery in the short term.

For near-term price action, market watchers are focused on how Dogecoin reacts at the current $0.165 level. If buyers step in, a move toward $0.172 or higher could happen quickly. But if selling pressure continues, DOGE might extend its decline before attempting recovery.

Dogecoin finds itself at a key inflection point. While price holds above its decade-long ascending channel and large wallets quietly accumulate, confirming a bullish trend will require a sustained breakout above $0.18. If momentum builds, mid-range targets between $0.27 and $0.56 could come into play.",blockonomi

The company plans to release its first “open-weight” language model with reasoning capabilities in the coming months

OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year, but won’t be cash flow positive until 2029

The funding is connected to the $500 billion Stargate Project with SoftBank, Oracle, and others to build AI data centers

OpenAI has secured $40 billion in new funding, marking the largest private tech investment in history. The funding round was announced on Monday and values the ChatGPT maker at $300 billion.

Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led the investment with a $30 billion commitment. Microsoft and other investors including Coatue, Altimeter, and Thrive contributed the remaining $10 billion.

The deal structure includes an initial $10 billion upfront payment. The remaining $30 billion is expected to arrive by the end of 2025.

The funding comes with a notable condition. SoftBank’s investment could be reduced to as low as $20 billion if OpenAI fails to restructure into a for-profit entity by December 31.

OpenAI’s current structure includes a non-profit that controls a capped-profit limited partnership created in 2019. This unusual arrangement has been challenged in court by Elon Musk, one of OpenAI’s co-founders.

The valuation places OpenAI just behind Musk’s SpaceX, which is valued at $350 billion. It ties Chinese company ByteDance, owner of TikTok, among the world’s most valuable private companies.

OpenAI’s Roadmap: Putting $40 Billion to Work

OpenAI plans to use the fresh capital to advance AI research and expand its computing infrastructure. About $18 billion will likely go toward OpenAI’s commitment to the Stargate Project.

The Stargate Project is a $500 billion initiative announced in January. It aims to build AI data centers across the United States over the next four years in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank.

OpenAI revealed that ChatGPT now serves 500 million people every week. This represents a big jump from the 400 million users reported last month.

CEO Sam Altman shared on X (formerly Twitter) that ChatGPT added two million users over five days. He later noted that the platform gained one million users in a single hour.

The surge in usage followed a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image generation features. The new capability went viral for its ability to create Studio Ghibli-inspired AI art.

The tool proved so popular that Altman asked users to slow down. He said the high usage was “melting OpenAI’s GPUs” and announced temporary rate limits.

In addition to the funding news, Altman announced plans to release a new “open-weight” language model. This will be OpenAI’s first open model since GPT-2, featuring reasoning capabilities.

The investment comes amid changes in OpenAI’s leadership structure. Altman is shifting focus away from day-to-day operations to concentrate more on research and product development.

Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap will take on an expanded role. He will oversee business operations while Altman focuses on advancing the company’s AI capabilities.

Despite massive growth, OpenAI continues to burn through cash. The company expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year, up from $3.7 billion in annualized recurring revenue last year.

However, projections suggest OpenAI won’t become cash flow positive until 2029. By then, the company forecasts annual revenue of $125 billion.

The funding announcement emphasized OpenAI’s goal of building “AGI that benefits all of humanity.” AGI refers to artificial general intelligence, systems that can perform any intellectual task that humans can do.

Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital and an investor in OpenAI, has suggested the company may eventually go public. He told investors that OpenAI is among the next wave of anticipated IPOs in his portfolio.

The deal dwarfs previous private funding records. Ant Group’s $14 billion raise in 2018 previously held the title for largest private tech funding round.

OpenAI’s investment comes shortly after AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave made its public debut. However, CoreWeave has faced challenges, with its stock falling more than 7% on Monday after an unchanged first day of trading.

The funding reflects growing competition in the generative AI market. Companies from Google and Amazon to smaller players like Anthropic and Perplexity are racing to develop new products, especially AI agents.",blockonomi

Coinbase shares have fallen approximately 31%, marking their worst performance since the FTX collapse in late 2022

Bitcoin has dropped over 10% this quarter while Ethereum has plummeted about 45%

The crypto downturn correlates with economic concerns, including Trump’s trade war and recession fears

Crypto-linked stocks are experiencing sharper declines than Bitcoin itself due to higher volatility

Gold has emerged as the preferred hedge against risk, seeing its best quarterly return since 1986

Coinbase (COIN) shares have plunged about 31% this quarter, marking their steepest decline since the FTX exchange collapsed in late 2022. The drop extends a four-day losing streak that has seen the stock close at $172.23, down 1% in Monday’s session.

This downturn isn’t isolated to Coinbase. Nearly every major crypto-linked stock has tumbled alongside it. Bitcoin miners have been hit especially hard, with Core Scientific (CORZ) dropping 48% and Riot Platforms (RIOT) falling over 30%.

Bitcoin itself has retreated more than 10% during the quarter. This marks one of its weakest performances despite still showing a 16% gain over the past year. Ethereum has fared even worse, crashing approximately 45% year-to-date to around $1,800.

The crypto market’s struggles come amid growing economic concerns. President Donald Trump’s escalating global trade war has sparked fears about its impact on the U.S. economy. These worries intensified after recent economic data deepened recession concerns.

Investors have rapidly fled from risky assets. Cryptocurrency and related stocks, known for their volatility, have been among the first casualties. This pattern mirrors broader market trends, with the S&P 500 heading toward its worst quarter since mid-2022.

Coinbase faces extra pressure due to its revenue model. The exchange earns from trading volumes across multiple tokens. This includes altcoins like Ethereum that have sold off even faster than Bitcoin.

“Many people in the community understand that this is not driven by fundamental reasons,” said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau. “This is mainly driven by the macro reasons because of the tariffs, potential trade war, people worried about a recession coming in.”

Crypto-linked stocks carry higher risk than Bitcoin itself. An investment in a company adds the threat of bankruptcy, making these stocks prone to sell off even faster during economic uncertainty.

Post-Inauguration Reality Check

The current market climate presents a stark contrast to early 2025. Optimism ran high after Trump’s election, with Bitcoin hitting a record above $109,000 on Inauguration Day in January. The price has since fallen to around $82,000.

Gold has emerged as the main hedge against current risks. The precious metal has seen its best quarterly return since 1986, reaching new all-time highs. This challenges the narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold.”

Trump’s actions on crypto have disappointed some industry optimists. Bitcoin dropped earlier this month after he created a strategic reserve of the token. The plan did not authorize using taxpayer money to expand it, falling short of the industry’s wildest hopes.

Most crypto-linked stocks have given up their post-election gains. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) stands as one of the few still in the green since November 5.

Technical indicators for Coinbase paint a concerning picture. The stock has retreated within a descending broadening formation since last November. The 50-day moving average appears poised to cross below the 200-day moving average, forming a bearish “death cross” pattern.

Major support levels to watch include $146, near last year’s September swing low. If selling continues below this point, the stock could drop to around $115. Resistance levels to monitor include $206, near the March countertrend peak.

Analysts warn more challenges may lie ahead. President Trump’s “Liberation Day” approaches on April 2, when aggressive tariffs are set to take effect. These could further pressure risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

Despite these market struggles, the crypto industry continues gaining influence in Washington. It’s moving closer to integration with traditional finance. However, this progress hasn’t translated into a market rebound yet.

“What we saw a couple months ago, I don’t know how much crazier it can get than that,” said Connor Loewen, a cryptocurrency analyst at 3iQ, referring to the previous investor enthusiasm. “I think we’re going to have to be looking for new catalysts.”",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Coinbase CEO Advocates for Interest-Bearing Provisions in US Stablecoin Legislation,https://blockonomi.com/coinbase-ceo-advocates-for-interest-bearing-provisions-in-us-stablecoin-legislation/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 09:35:18 GMT","TLDR

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong advocates for legislation allowing stablecoin holders to earn “onchain interest”

Current stablecoin bills (STABLE Act and GENIUS Act) do not permit interest-bearing stablecoins

Armstrong argues consumers could earn around 4% yield compared to 0.41% average savings account interest

Enabling onchain interest could promote dollar dominance globally and benefit the US economy

Stablecoin issuers already hold reserves in US Treasuries but typically keep interest rather than distributing it to holders

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is calling for changes to proposed stablecoin laws that would allow holders to earn interest directly from their digital assets, similar to traditional bank accounts.

In a March 31 post on social media platform X, Armstrong argued that stablecoin issuers should be “allowed to, and incentivized to, share interest with consumers.” He believes this approach would be “consistent with a free market approach.”

Currently, two competing pieces of federal stablecoin legislation are working through the US legislative process. These are the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.

Neither bill currently allows for interest-bearing stablecoins. The STABLE Act includes language that explicitly prohibits “payment stablecoin” issuers from paying yield to holders.

Similarly, the GENIUS Act, which recently passed the Senate Banking Committee with an 18-6 vote, has been amended to exclude interest-bearing instruments from its definition of a “payment stablecoin.”

Armstrong pointed out that while stablecoins have found market fit by “digitizing the dollar and other fiat currencies,” adding onchain interest would allow “the average person, and the US economy, to reap the full benefits.”

He highlighted the gap between potential yields and what consumers typically receive. According to Armstrong, if legislative changes allowed stablecoin issuers to pay interest to holders, US consumers could earn a yield of around 4% on their holdings.

This rate would far outstrip the 2024 average interest yield on consumer savings accounts, which Armstrong cited as 0.41%. With inflation near 3%, many Americans are actually losing purchasing power with traditional savings accounts.

Why Stablecoin Interest Matters

Stablecoin issuers already hold US Dollar reserves in low-risk investments such as short-term US Treasuries. But unlike banks, they typically retain the interest earned rather than distributing it to stablecoin holders.

Armstrong defines onchain interest as “the ability of a stablecoin to function as a form of payment and directly deliver interest earned on reserve assets to the stablecoin holder, effectively an interest-bearing checking account.”

The Coinbase CEO argues that onchain interest could benefit the broader US economy by incentivizing global use of US dollar stablecoins. This could extend “dollar dominance in an increasingly digital global economy,” according to Armstrong.

He also suggested that the potential for higher yields than traditional savings accounts would result in “more yield in consumers’ hands means more spending, saving, investing — fueling economic growth in all local economies where stablecoins are held.”

Armstrong warned that without onchain interest, “the U.S. misses out on billions more USD users and trillions in potential cash flows.”

The push for interest-bearing stablecoins has gained support from others in the crypto industry. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan expressed support for Armstrong’s position, questioning opposition to yield-bearing stablecoins.

Hougan responded to arguments that suggested stablecoin issuers offering interest could affect bank deposits and their ability to offer mortgages. He countered that “free markets will develop a new way for customers to get loans to buy houses.”

Armstrong framed the issue as one of fairness. He stated, “Consumers deserve a bigger piece of the pie. Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers, and will keep this innovation onshore.”

Some regulatory experts have noted that yield-bearing stablecoins could face more complex regulation due to similarities with securities. This is likely why current legislation has avoided including provisions for interest-bearing features.

Representative Bryan Steil commented on the current state of the STABLE Act, telling Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, that the two pieces of legislation are positioned to “mirror up” following a few more draft rounds in the House and Senate.

“At the end of the day, I think there’s recognition that we want to work with our Senate colleagues to get this across the line,” Steil said about the path forward for stablecoin legislation.

Armstrong sees the current moment as a unique opportunity to modernize the financial system. With what he described as a “pro-crypto administration and Congress actively working on stablecoin regulation,” he believes now is the time to act.

According to Armstrong, lawmakers have a choice: “We can either modernize the system to benefit consumers — or protect an outdated one that enriches middlemen.”

The Coinbase CEO particularly emphasized the potential global impact of interest-bearing stablecoins. He noted that billions of people in underbanked regions could gain access to US dollars or alternatives to volatile local currencies.

Armstrong suggested that allowing interest-bearing stablecoins would help onboard a new wave of global users into “an instant, transparent, and accessible financial system with just an internet connection.”

“No branch visits, no excessive overdraft or remittance fees. It’s equal financial access for everyone, powered by crypto rails,” Armstrong wrote in his post.",blockonomi

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) purchased 22,048 Bitcoin worth $1.92 billion at an average price of $86,969 per BTC

The company now holds 528,185 BTC (2.55% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply) valued at $35.63 billion

The purchase was financed through a combination of stock offerings and preferred stock programs

Bitcoin price dropped to around $82,000 after the purchase, putting Strategy’s latest investment temporarily in the red

Market uncertainty is growing ahead of US President Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement

Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, has added 22,048 Bitcoin to its holdings in a massive purchase worth approximately $1.92 billion. The acquisition was completed between March 24 and March 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31.

The company paid an average price of $86,969 per Bitcoin, including fees and expenses. This purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 528,185 BTC, representing about 2.55% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.

The timing of the purchase coincided with Bitcoin moving upward, followed by a reversal that sent the price down to around $82,000. This drop means Strategy’s latest Bitcoin buy is currently down by over $100 million from its purchase price.

Strategy funded this large acquisition through several capital-raising methods. The company used proceeds from its at-the-market common stock offering, its ATM preferred stock program (STRK), and a new $711.2 million public offering of 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF).

The company’s Common ATM raised $1.20 billion during the reporting period. The STRK ATM contributed an additional $18.52 million to the funding pool.

The STRF offering closed on March 25 at $85.00 per share. This shows strong investor interest in equity tied to Strategy’s Bitcoin-focused treasury model.

Strategy’s total investment in Bitcoin now stands at $35.63 billion. The company has paid an average price of $67,458 per BTC across all its purchases.

This latest addition continues Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin buying pattern in 2025. The company made a $243 million purchase in early January and a $1.99 billion purchase in February.

Bitcoin Holdings Strategy

Strategy CEO Michael Saylor has outlined an ambitious vision for the company’s Bitcoin holdings. He has described Bitcoin as a long-term asset with potential values ranging from $3 million to $49 million per coin in various scenarios.

To support its ongoing Bitcoin acquisition goals, Strategy shareholders have approved expanding the company’s Class A common stock. The authorization increases shares from 330 million to 10.3 billion.

$MSTR has acquired 22,048 BTC for ~$1.92 billion at ~$86,969 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 11.0% YTD 2025. As of 3/30/2025, @Strategy holds 528,185 $BTC acquired for ~$35.63 billion at ~$67,458 per bitcoin. $STRK $STRF https://t.co/1sfyBIglnt — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 31, 2025

The company has also introduced its 21/21 Plan. This strategy aims to raise $21 billion through equity and another $21 billion through fixed-income instruments over time.

Strategy is currently showing an unrealized profit of over $7.7 billion on its Bitcoin holdings. This represents a gain of more than 21% based on current market prices.

Despite these gains, Strategy may face tax obligations on its unrealized profits. Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the company could be subject to a 15% “corporate alternative minimum tax” on its adjusted earnings.

The Bitcoin market is currently facing uncertainty ahead of US President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement. This announcement is expected to detail reciprocal trade tariffs targeting top US trading partners.

Some market observers believe the recent sell-off is not the end of the bull run. Andrei Grachev, managing partner of DWF Labs, called it “a healthy reset” and noted that “markets overreact to tariffs and macro headlines, but long-term fundamentals haven’t changed.”

Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize above the $80,000 level after dropping toward $76,000 for the first time since November 2024. Recent analysis from CryptoQuant suggests potential for price recovery based on trading volume patterns.

zkLend protocol was exploited for $9.6 million in February 2025

Hacker lost 2,930 ETH ($5.4 million) by accidentally sending funds to a fake Tornado Cash phishing site

The original exploit used flash loans to inflate the lending accumulator and exploit rounding errors

zkLend had offered the hacker a 10% bounty to return funds, then later offered $500,000 for information leading to recovery

This incident is part of a larger trend of crypto security breaches, with $1.64 billion stolen in Q1 2025

The hacker who stole $9.6 million from decentralized lending protocol zkLend in February has fallen victim to a phishing scam, losing most of the stolen funds in an ironic turn of events.

According to on-chain messages sent to zkLend through Etherscan on March 31, the hacker lost 2,930 Ether (ETH) worth about $5.4 million. The funds were sent to a fake website that was pretending to be Tornado Cash, a popular crypto mixing service.

“I tried to move funds to a Tornado, but I used a phishing website, and all the funds have been lost. I am devastated,” the hacker wrote in their message to zkLend. “I am terribly sorry for all the havoc and losses caused.”

On-chain data shows the hacker made several transfers of 100 ETH at a time to an address named “Tornado.Cash: Router.” They finished with three smaller deposits of 10 ETH each before realizing their mistake.

Another user had attempted to warn the hacker about their error, telling them “don’t celebrate” because the funds were sent to a scam Tornado Cash URL. “It is so devastating. Everything gone with one wrong website,” the hacker replied.

The original exploit of zkLend took place on February 11, 2025. The attacker used a combination of small deposits and flash loans to artificially inflate the protocol’s lending accumulator.

Flash loans allow users to borrow and repay funds within a single transaction block. In this case, the hacker used them to manipulate zkLend’s system and exploit rounding errors.

From Thief to Victim: A Crypto Reversal

After the initial attack, the hacker bridged the stolen funds to the Ethereum network. They later tried to launder the money through Railgun but failed when protocol policies returned the funds to the original address.

zkLend responded to the hack by offering terms to the attacker. The protocol proposed that the hacker could keep 10% of the funds as a bounty if they returned the rest, along with a promise not to pursue legal action.

zkLend Security Incident Post Mortem. To our users, Starting on 11th of February, zkLend suffered an attack resulting in the loss of around $9.6 million USD in funds. We would like to thank our users and partners for their patience and trust in this difficult time. In addition… — zkLend (@zkLend) February 14, 2025

When the February 14 deadline passed without a response, zkLend changed tactics. On February 19, the protocol announced a $500,000 bounty for information leading to the hacker’s arrest and the recovery of funds.

After learning about the hacker’s loss to the phishing scam, zkLend asked them to “Return all the funds left in your wallets” to the protocol’s address. However, blockchain records show another 25 ETH was then sent to a different wallet listed as “Chainflip1.”

The zkLend incident is part of a larger pattern of security issues in the cryptocurrency sector. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, losses to crypto scams, exploits, and hacks totaled over $33 million in March 2025 alone.

February 2025 was even worse, with crypto-related crimes resulting in nearly $1.53 billion in losses. The largest portion came from a $1.4 billion attack on Bybit by North Korea’s Lazarus Group on February 21, which now holds the record for the largest crypto hack ever.

This massive hack doubled the previous record of $650 million stolen in the Ronin bridge hack of March 2022, showing how the scale of crypto attacks continues to grow.

According to Immunefi’s Q1 2025 report, the first three months of 2025 saw the worst quarter for crypto security breaches in history. Hackers stole a total of $1.64 billion during this period, with the zkLend hack being the fifth-largest exploit.

The report found that decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols lost $106.8 million across 38 different incidents. Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most frequently targeted networks for these attacks.

While DeFi platforms experienced multiple smaller attacks, centralized finance platforms saw just two incidents. However, those two breaches resulted in a much larger total of $1.5 billion in losses.

Security experts point to this case as a reminder of the dangers that exist even for those who exploit vulnerabilities themselves. The hacker’s mistake highlights the need for caution when interacting with any crypto services, as convincing phishing sites can fool even technically skilled individuals.

The irony of a hacker losing stolen funds to another scam has not been lost on the crypto community. This case serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, affecting everyone from regular users to malicious actors.",blockonomi

SOL has dropped 12% in the past week, facing rejection at the $145 resistance level

Price is currently testing critical support around $117-$125, which has historically held firm

Technical indicators show bearish divergence on weekly RSI, suggesting weakening bullish momentum

Two possible scenarios: rebound from support to new highs or breakdown leading to extended decline

Current price action is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern that could determine near-term direction

Solana (SOL) is currently at a pivotal moment after experiencing a sharp decline in recent days. The cryptocurrency has fallen approximately 12% over the past week, with bears pushing the price below several key support levels.

The downward pressure began after SOL failed to maintain momentum above the $135 level. This decline mirrors similar movements seen in other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum during the same period.

The price action pushed SOL below the $125 support, touching a low of $122.64 before entering a consolidation phase. Bulls have made attempts to recover, but these efforts have faced strong resistance around the $126 level.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows SOL trading below its 100-hourly simple moving average. A rising channel has formed on the hourly chart with support near the $124 mark, suggesting some structure to the current price action.

Resistance levels have become clearly defined during this period of weakness. The $126 level represents the immediate resistance, followed by a stronger barrier at $128. The $132 level, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move, appears to be a major hurdle for bulls to overcome.

The current situation follows a significant milestone where SOL had previously reached a new all-time high near $295. However, the cryptocurrency failed to sustain that level, leading to the current correction phase.

Market watchers have noted a bearish divergence on the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI). This technical pattern occurs when price makes a higher high while the RSI prints a lower high, typically signaling declining bullish momentum.

Of particular importance is the $117 support zone. This level combines horizontal support with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension and has held firm for over a year. How SOL reacts to this support level may determine its medium-term direction.

The RSI currently stands at 40, a level that has aligned with local bottoms in previous corrections. Historically, this RSI zone has coincided with the beginning of upward movements for SOL.

#Solana – Unbiased Analysis Solana hit a new all-time high of $295 this cycle but failed to hold above it. A massive bearish divergence is in play on the weekly chart, and the price is now testing a key horizontal support that has held strong for the past year.

Adding to the bearish pressure, recent market data revealed that a large holder offloaded over $7.6 million in SOL. This selling activity has contributed to the negative sentiment surrounding the asset.

On the 4-hour chart, SOL price is confined within a symmetrical triangle pattern. This formation occurs when two trendlines with equal slopes converge. The resolution of this pattern – whether through a breakdown or breakout – will likely signal the next directional move.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has yet to close fully above the zero signal line, adding weight to the possibility of further downside in the near term.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has dropped to -0.01, indicating increasing selling pressure. If this metric continues to decline, SOL’s price recovery may be delayed, potentially keeping the cryptocurrency trading between $116 and $125 in the short term.

Two clear scenarios have emerged from the current technical setup. In the bullish case, SOL could rebound strongly from the $117 level, supported by improving momentum indicators and increasing volume. This could potentially lead to a renewed upward push toward fresh highs.

In the alternative bearish scenario, if support at $117 fails to hold, SOL may enter a more extended decline. A breakdown below this zone would weaken bullish sentiment and potentially trigger a move toward lower support levels, possibly reaching $112.15 and marking a new yearly low.

If the more optimistic scenario plays out and SOL breaks above the upper trendline of the triangle pattern, it could target the $155.24 level. Should buying pressure increase significantly, the price might even reach $180.90.

For now, SOL remains in this state of uncertainty, with traders and investors closely monitoring how price responds to these critical technical levels in the coming days.",blockonomi

Kentucky has dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase over staking services, following similar actions by Vermont and South Carolina

This dismissal came shortly after Kentucky passed pro-crypto legislation (House Bill 701) that protects digital asset rights

Seven states still have pending enforcement actions against Coinbase

Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal is advocating for federal market structure laws to replace state-by-state regulation

The dismissals follow the SEC’s February decision to drop its own case against Coinbase

Kentucky has become the latest state to dismiss its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase over its staking services. The Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions filed a joint stipulation of dismissal on Monday, effectively ending legal action that had claimed the exchange’s staking program violated state securities laws.

This dismissal makes Kentucky the third state in recent weeks to drop similar claims against Coinbase. Vermont was the first to exit on March 14, followed by South Carolina days later.

The legal retreat comes just days after Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed House Bill 701 into law. This bipartisan legislation protects digital asset rights in the state and clearly states that activities like mining and staking are not subject to securities laws.

Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, celebrated the dismissal on social media. “One by one, in just a few short months, states across the country and party lines are standing up for consumers and sound law,” Grewal told Decrypt.

@GovAndyBeshear’s Department of Financial Institutions has followed suit by dismissing Kentucky's staking lawsuit against @coinbase— just as Vermont and South Carolina recently did. Congress needs to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market… https://t.co/LyCy2iLS20 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 31, 2025

The case against Coinbase was part of a larger multi-state effort launched in June 2023. This coordinated action began the same day the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the exchange for alleged securities violations.

State regulators had argued that Coinbase’s staking program was an unregistered securities offering. They claimed the exchange was essentially acting as an investment vehicle without proper registration or investor disclosures.

When South Carolina dropped its case earlier, Grewal noted that residents had lost an estimated $2 million in staking rewards due to the ban. Within hours after South Carolina’s lawsuit was dismissed, Coinbase restored staking services for users in the state.

Federal Dismissal Sets Precedent for State Actions

The regulatory tide began to shift in February when the SEC voluntarily dismissed its own federal case against Coinbase. The agency stated this decision would help support broader efforts to reconsider its approach to crypto regulation.

These dismissals align with changing perspectives at the federal level. SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda has taken a more conciliatory stance toward the crypto industry compared to his predecessor.

Kentucky’s new law, House Bill 701, protects various crypto activities beyond staking. The legislation affirms that self-custody of cryptocurrencies is legal and protects node operators from certain regulations.

The bill also exempts staking rewards from state money transmitter rules. This comprehensive approach to crypto regulation passed unanimously in both the Kentucky House and Senate, showing rare bipartisan agreement.

Despite these wins for Coinbase, seven states still maintain legal actions against the exchange. California, New Jersey, Illinois, Washington, Alabama, Maryland, and Wisconsin all have pending enforcement actions related to staking services.

Grewal has expressed frustration with the current regulatory landscape. “Congress needs to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market structure law ASAP,” he posted following Kentucky’s dismissal.

This patchwork of state regulations creates challenges for crypto companies operating nationally. Each state currently determines its own staking rules, leading to inconsistent treatment across state lines.

Coinbase has been on a winning streak against regulators recently. Beyond these state-level victories, the exchange has filed Freedom of Information Act requests against the SEC and criticized the FDIC over similar requests.

The exchange is also expanding internationally, having recently re-entered the Indian market after exiting in 2023. Additionally, Coinbase is pursuing the purchase of Deribit, a move considered significant as it diversifies beyond its U.S. operations.

Kentucky lawmakers are considering additional crypto-friendly legislation. A separate proposal would allow the state to allocate up to 10% of its excess reserves into Bitcoin, further cementing Kentucky’s emerging position as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction.",blockonomi

Tether’s previous Bitcoin purchase occurred in December 2024, when it acquired 8,404 BTC. At that time, the addition brought its holdings to 83,759 BTC.

According to Spot On Chain data, Tether currently has unrealized profits of approximately $3.86 billion from its Bitcoin investments. This figure highlights the success of Tether’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy despite recent market volatility.

In addition to its Bitcoin purchases, Tether minted fresh $1 billion USDT on the Tron network. Tether CEO Paola Ardoino confirmed this transaction, describing it as authorized but not issued USDT that will serve as inventory for future issuance requests.

Since the beginning of 2025, Tether has minted $8 billion USDT on the Tron network. Looking back further, the company has created a total of $22 billion USDT on Tron over the past year.

Tether maintains its dominant position in the stablecoin market with a market capitalization of $144 billion. This represents 61% of the total stablecoin market, valued at approximately $234 billion.

Its closest competitor, USD Coin (USDC), has a market cap of $60 billion, less than half of Tether’s valuation. This gap highlights Tether’s continued leadership in the stablecoin sector.

Tether reported record profits of $13.7 billion last year in its Q4 2024 report. The company maintains $7 billion in excess stablecoin reserves to ensure that every USDT issued is fully backed.

Beyond cryptocurrencies, Tether has been expanding its investment portfolio. On March 27, the company increased its stake in Adecoagro, a Latin American agricultural firm, to 70%. Tether also plans to purchase a 30% stake in Be Water, an Italian media company.

Tether made waves in traditional markets by becoming the seventh-largest buyer of U.S. Treasury securities in 2024, with a $33.1 billion investment. This puts its holdings ahead of countries like Canada, Mexico, and Germany.

The current Bitcoin price stands at $83,112, showing a 1.94% increase amid rising market volatility. Despite the recent market declines, Tether’s continued Bitcoin acquisitions demonstrate its long-term confidence in the cryptocurrency.",blockonomi

Smart money traders are increasing their long positions on Ethereum futures

ETH price has been stagnant around $2,068 while Bitcoin has doubled over three years

Institutional investors predict ETH could reach $2,400 soon (22% increase)

Ethereum Foundation’s development priorities have frustrated holders and developers

Despite challenges, ETH maintains advantages in total value locked and stablecoins

Ethereum’s price has been stuck in a rut for months, but institutional investors are betting on a potential turnaround. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) suggests that “smart money” traders see the current price as oversold and are increasing their long positions on Ethereum futures.

Institutional trading interest in digital assets remains strong. Major firms like Citadel Securities, Susquehanna International, and Jane Street Capital are active participants in crypto markets.

The CFTC publishes a weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report that tracks crypto trading trends. This report helps bring transparency to the market.

According to the latest COT data ending March 25, smart money traders viewed Ethereum’s price of $2,068 as being oversold. They have increased their long positions for two of the past three weeks.

Technical Analysis

Ethereum’s price hasn’t moved much since March. This suggests that institutional investors continue to see now as a good time to buy ETH.

Compared to Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has underperformed. Over the last three years, Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled to $82,244. During the same period, ETH’s price has dropped by 32%.

Even though Ethereum’s price could fall further, futures data indicates that institutional traders believe it could soon reach $2,400. This would represent a 22% increase from its current price.

ETH holders have been unhappy with the Ethereum Foundation’s development priorities. Developers want speed and cheap transactions for their projects. They’ve also asked for more Ethereum-native projects to build momentum.

The Foundation has instead focused on research efforts that align with core values. These include open source, privacy, security, and censorship resistance. The Foundation has remained neutral about Ethereum-native projects.

In October 2024, during ETH San Francisco, there was brief optimism. The price of ETH rose as the community hoped the Foundation would become more responsive. Since then, the price has fallen back to late 2023 levels.

Rob Hadick, General Partner at crypto venture firm Dragonfly, commented on ETH’s performance. “The level of underperformance relative to BTC and SOL clearly shows market concerns about ETH’s relative performance.”

Hadick pointed to issues with “value accrual, protocol revenue and fees.” He noted that Layer 2 solutions are “parasitic” to Layer 1 chains. He also mentioned “a general lack of confidence in the Ethereum Foundation’s claims.”

Despite these challenges, Hadick believes there is still a case for buying ETH. “Ethereum still has an overwhelming advantage in terms of the notional value of TVL, value secured, stablecoins, and RWAs,” he said.

The COT report doesn’t name individual trading firms. However, it does show which groups are more active at a given time.

Dealer firms have increased their ETH futures contracts by 336%. They went from roughly 3,500 contracts in early November to more than 15,000 currently. President Trump’s election has triggered increased investor interest in cryptocurrency.

Leveraged firms include liquidity makers and quantitative trading firms. These groups typically sell crypto futures to dealer counterparties that buy them.

The growth in Ethereum futures that began with Trump’s election continues into 2025. There were 11,819 contracts added last year and another 2,700 contracts year to date. This increase shows that these savvy market participants are investing heavily in anticipation of an Ethereum price rally.",blockonomi

Bitcoin price rose to $83,210 after a difficult Q1 with 11% losses and 24% drop from January’s all-time high

Trump administration’s planned trade tariffs (scheduled for April 2) have increased market uncertainty

Bitcoin may still be in an “acceleration phase” according to Fidelity analyst Zack Wainwright

Major companies continue accumulating Bitcoin despite price volatility, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy and MARA Holdings

Technical indicators show mixed signals with some analysts warning of continued bearish short-term outlook

Bitcoin rose slightly to $83,210 on Tuesday, April 1, showing signs of recovery after a rough first quarter. The world’s largest cryptocurrency saw an 11% drop in value during Q1 2025 and remains about 24% below its January record high.

The modest price increase of 1.3% follows a period of heightened market anxiety. This anxiety stems from uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s planned trade tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.

Trump has repeatedly referred to April 2 as “liberation day.” This is when he plans to reveal more details about tariffs on sectors like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and select commodities.

Bitcoin’s price movements have tracked broader financial markets. Risk sentiment has weakened due to speculation about the scope and economic impact of these planned tariffs.

Market Analysis

Many analysts have raised their expectations for a U.S. recession this year. This outlook has hurt speculative assets like Bitcoin, which has underperformed compared to the S&P 500 and NASDAQ so far in 2025.

The Trump administration has maintained a pro-crypto stance since taking office. The President has named several crypto-friendly candidates to key regulatory positions, especially in the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Trump’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., will merge with and take a 20% stake in American Bitcoin. This Bitcoin mining operation is mostly owned by miner Hut 8.

This deal adds to other crypto ventures backed by Trump. These include the decentralized finance project World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP memecoin.

Despite these initiatives, Trump’s crypto policies have offered little support to prices. His plan to establish a strategic reserve from the government’s existing Bitcoin holdings failed to boost the market.

Fidelity analyst Zack Wainwright suggests Bitcoin might still be in an “acceleration phase.” This phase is marked by “high volatility and high profit,” similar to when BTC pushed above $20,000 in December 2020.

March 31 marked day 232 of the current cycle. Previous peaks lasted slightly longer before corrections began—day 244 in 2010-2011, day 261 in 2015, and day 280 in 2017.

Despite price volatility, large entities continue to add Bitcoin to their holdings. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced the acquisition of 22,048 BTC ($1.92 billion) at an average price of $86,969 per Bitcoin on March 31.

On the same day, Bitcoin miner MARA revealed plans to sell up to $2 billion in stock to acquire more BTC. Japanese firm Metaplanet issued bonds worth $13.3 million to buy more Bitcoin.

Technical indicators show mixed signals for Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. Trader Roman noted that while Bitcoin was retesting the $84,000 area, the relative strength index suggests a possible move lower.

Rekt Capital pointed to a support retest on daily timeframes. This comes after a key breakout from a multimonth downtrend in the relative strength index.

#BTC The $BTC RSI is trying to retest its Downtrend as support Meanwhile BTC's price action is also facing a Downtrend If the RSI successfully retests its Downtrend… That would display emerging strength & price would be able to break its own Downtrend#Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/btIyeARrck pic.twitter.com/ji1dNJNolP — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 31, 2025

Some market predictions now extend downward to $65,000. Bitfinex noted in its latest analytics report that 2025 has been Bitcoin’s worst first quarter in years, with buying momentum capped at $89,000.

According to Bitfinex, price action in recent weeks has formed a consolidation range between $78,000 and $88,000. They also observed that signs of capitulation are easing, with fewer reactive sellers present and long-term holders beginning to accumulate once more.

The cryptocurrency market continues to watch closely for further developments on trade policies. April 2 may bring more clarity on how Trump’s tariffs might affect risk assets like Bitcoin in the months ahead.",blockonomi

Now, a new contender is emerging to revolutionize the space once more.

RUVI, an innovative blockchain project, is aligning artificial intelligence with decentralized technology to create impactful solutions. With its token presale set to launch in just a few hours, the platform is positioning itself as the next milestone in crypto innovation.

Ethereum’s Legacy: The Foundation of Innovation

When Ethereum introduced smart contracts, it expanded blockchain’s potential beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions. This innovation birthed entire sectors, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, and demonstrated that cryptocurrencies could power real-world applications.

Ethereum’s vision pushed blockchain into mainstream conversations by solving real problems with decentralized trust mechanisms. However, as the space continues to evolve, other projects now stand on Ethereum’s shoulders to push those boundaries even further. RUVI is doing just that by pioneering the integration of AI into blockchain, setting the stage for the next wave of transformation.

RUVI’s AI Revolution: A New Frontier

RUVI’s unique proposition is its fusion of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. By providing decentralized AI tools, RUVI aims to serve a diverse set of stakeholders, including developers, businesses, and individuals. These tools have the potential to power smarter decision-making, optimize processes, and enhance data efficiencies.

What sets RUVI apart is its focus on real-world applications. From business resource optimization to intelligent application development, RUVI’s AI-driven ecosystem addresses tangible challenges. This forward-thinking approach positions the project as a leader in the next-generation blockchain movement, combining utility with innovation.

Presale Rewards: A Leaderboard Worth Competing For

RUVI’s presale features a robust bonus system designed to reward early participants generously. The VIP tier structure allows investors to multiply their holdings based on the volume of $RUVI tokens acquired. Notably, VIP 2 offers a 40% bonus.

For example, an investor acquiring 50,000 $RUVI tokens at $0.01 each would spend $500. With the VIP 2 40% bonus, they would receive an additional 20,000 tokens, bringing their total to 70,000. With RUVI’s projected listing price set at $0.07, this initial investment could yield $4,900, representing a return of 880%.

RUVI also embraces friendly competition with its Top Holder Rewards, which provide fixed bonuses to the top 1,000 investors based on total holdings. Here’s how the rewards are structured:

Top 10 holders receive 500,000 additional $RUVI tokens each.

Top 50 holders are rewarded with 250,000 tokens.

Top 100 holders gain 100,000 tokens each.

Top 200 holders claim 75,000 bonus tokens.

Top 500 holders secure 40,000 tokens.

Top 1,000 holders earn 20,000 extra tokens.

This dual reward system ensures a fair and engaging presale experience, creating opportunities for both substantial and moderate investors to maximize their earnings.

The $RUVI Token: Powering a Smarter Ecosystem

The $RUVI token is central to a decentralized ecosystem built for scalability and practicality. Token holders gain exclusive access to powerful AI-driven solutions, participation in governance decisions, and staking rewards that accumulate over time. RUVI’s infrastructure ensures that the token is more than just a speculative asset; it’s a utility powerhouse aimed at solving pressing industry challenges.

From supporting businesses in automating workflows to enabling developers with superior data solutions, $RUVI offers a unique value proposition unmatched by competitors focused solely on hype or short-term gains.

Conclusion

Ethereum paved the way for smart contracts and DApps, and now RUVI is taking blockchain to the next level with AI integration. Investors seeking to engage with innovation and practical utility should not overlook RUVI’s presale. With the presale opening in mere hours, now is the time to act.. The future of blockchain is here, and it’s driven by artificial intelligence.

Once again, the decentralized giant reminds investors of the industry’s inherent volatility. But as the market digests this correction, attention is shifting toward emerging projects offering more innovative and stable opportunities. One such project is RUVI, which aims to combine the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain to create a revolutionary ecosystem. Could RUVI’s innovation be the breakthrough the market craves?

Bitcoin’s Price Movement: A Market in Flux

Bitcoin’s value slipping to $82,000 may not sound like a crash compared to its phenomenal peaks, but it signals the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Market corrections often cause waves of uncertainty, but they also pave the way for new projects to capture the spotlight.

The dip in Bitcoin has prompted many investors to explore alternative ventures, with projects like RUVI stepping forward as potential beacons of growth. By merging tangible utility with decentralized technology, RUVI stands out as a promising contender, particularly for those seeking innovation beyond Bitcoin’s dominance.

RUVI’s AI-Driven Vision: A New Era for Blockchain

RUVI’s core innovation lies in its ability to integrate artificial intelligence into blockchain technology. Unlike speculative meme coins or traditional cryptocurrencies, RUVI provides a platform where AI-driven tools can be accessed by developers, enterprises, and individuals alike.

The decentralized ecosystem designed by RUVI looks to tackle real-world challenges with AI solutions that offer insights, data management, and resource optimization. This isn’t just a showpiece; it’s a forward-thinking approach to bringing blockchain into industries that rely on AI innovation. By doing so, RUVI positions itself as a solution provider in a rapidly digitizing world.

Presale Highlights: Rewards for Early Adopters

RUVI’s token presale is structured to attract and reward its early supporters generously. The presale features a tiered VIP bonus system, and the VIP 5 tier for example, offers one of the most compelling options.

At VIP 5, a buyer investing in 500,000 $RUVI tokens at the presale price of $0.01 each would spend $5,000. Along with their purchase, they would earn an impressive 100% bonus, which equates to an additional 500,000 tokens. This investor would walk away with a total of 1,000,000 tokens.

With RUVI’s projected listing price set at $0.07, this $5,000 investment could potentially generate $70,000 in value. That’s an astounding 1,300% ROI, effectively multiplying the initial investment by 14 times.

Additionally, RUVI offers Top Holder Rewards, allowing participants who claim high leaderboard positions to earn up to 500,000 extra tokens. Combining VIP bonuses with these additional rewards ensures that investors at every level have a chance to maximize their return, making the presale both competitive and inclusive.

The $RUVI Token: Bridging Innovation and Utility

At the heart of RUVI’s vision is the $RUVI token, which serves as the fuel for its ecosystem. Token holders gain access to a variety of utilities, including premium AI tools and voting rights within the platform’s governance system. Furthermore, staking opportunities allow holders to earn additional rewards, adding to the token’s inherent value.

Unlike many tokens that hinge entirely on market speculation, $RUVI is purpose-built for real-world applications. Businesses can leverage its ecosystem for smarter operations, while ordinary users can tap into its AI-powered features for greater efficiency. This emphasis on utility gives $RUVI staying power beyond the headlines of a booming presale.

Seize the Future with RUVI

Bitcoin’s recent price drop is a reminder of the crypto market’s volatility, but it also highlights the importance of diversification and seeking out projects with true innovation. RUVI’s AI-powered ecosystem and user-focused presale incentives offer investors an unparalleled opportunity to step into the future of blockchain.

With its presale already sparking interest, RUVI could set the stage for a new era of crypto innovation. Don’t miss your chance to join the presale and secure your position in RUVI’s decentralized revolution. The next chapter of blockchain innovation is here, and it’s waiting for you.

This shift underscores the rapidly changing dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, where even long-standing digital assets must contend with market forces and emerging competitors.

Amidst this volatility, a new project, RUVI AI, has captured the attention of investors with its promise of merging artificial intelligence and blockchain technology through its upcoming token launch. Could RUVI’s presale be the next big move in the decentralized space?

RUVI’s Mission: Blend AI and DeFi

RUVI represents a new direction in blockchain applications, blending artificial intelligence (AI) with a decentralized ecosystem. With its native token, $RUVI, the platform empowers users by offering access to cutting-edge AI tools designed to solve real-world challenges.

Whether it’s creative development, data analysis, or automation, RUVI aims to provide an integrated system that makes technology more accessible and interactive.

What sets RUVI apart is its emphasis on community-driven growth. RUVI’s innovative token system allows users not just to benefit from its technology but also to share in the platform’s success. This combination of utility and community engagement positions RUVI as a challenger in both the AI and blockchain sectors.

The Upcoming Presale: A Win for Early Supporters

RUVI’s presale introduces a thoughtfully designed bonus system to reward early adopters. One example is the VIP 2 tier, which offers an attractive 40% bonus for participants who purchase 50,000 $RUVI tokens. At the presale price of $0.01 per token, an investment of $500 would yield an additional 20,000 tokens as a bonus. This totals 70,000 tokens for VIP 2 participants. With a projected listing price of $0.07, this $500 investment would bring a total of $4900 to the investor’s pocket.

To enhance the excitement, RUVI introduces Top Holder Rewards that further incentivize active participation. Investors ranking among the top tiers in the presale leaderboard can secure substantial bonus allocations, with rewards as high as 500,000 tokens.

These bonuses are stackable with the VIP rewards, allowing committed investors to exponentially grow their holdings. This combination of tiered bonuses and rewards for prominent holders creates a dynamic and engaging presale experience unlike many others in the market.

Commitment to Integrity and Equity

RUVI takes transparency and fairness seriously, embedding these principles into its presale mechanics. A real-time leaderboard ensures that participants can monitor rankings and reward distributions openly. Additionally, RUVI has excluded team wallets from the reward system, ensuring a level playing field for all investors.

Flexibility is another hallmark of RUVI’s approach. Participants have the ability to increase their investments across presale phases without incurring penalties. This enables investors to adjust their contributions as their confidence in the project grows, making RUVI’s presale both beginner and veteran-friendly.

Utility Beyond Bonuses: The $RUVI Token Ecosystem

Holding $RUVI tokens isn’t just about earning bonuses; it’s about unlocking a wide range of utilities within the ecosystem. Token holders can participate in RUVI’s staking program, earning passive income simply by holding their tokens while contributing to the network’s stability.

Additionally, RUVI encourages active participation through its governance model, allowing token holders to vote on platform developments and strategic decisions. This democratization aligns the interests of the community with the platform’s future.

RUVI also incentivizes user contributions to its AI tools. For example, users who help train AI models or improve their functionality are rewarded with additional tokens. This dual approach of technological utility and financial reward makes $RUVI a token with long-term appeal, beyond speculative trading.

A Glimpse into the Future

XRP’s market struggles may reflect the growing challenges faced by established cryptocurrencies in adapting to evolving market demands. However, RUVI’s approach to combining AI and blockchain represents a shift towards innovation and community-driven platforms. With its transparent presale structure, enticing rewards system, and focus on utility, RUVI is positioned as a strong contender for investors seeking opportunities in the decentralized future.

For those looking to be part of this groundbreaking movement, RUVI’s presale offers an ideal gateway. Visit RUVI’s official platform to secure your tokens and contribute to the next wave of blockchain innovation. The future is being built now. Don’t miss your chance to be part of it.

Bitunix exchange has announced that it has launched the Ultra version of the K-line (candlesticks) on its mobile app integrated with TradingView. This advanced charting system transforms the mobile trading experience for cryptocurrency traders, allowing them to enjoy a smooth candlestick experience.

Bitunix is the first exchange in the industry to integrate TradingView professional-grade features on its app, making this an Industry-Leading feature integration. This launch marks a significant milestone for the crypto exchange on a journey that began nearly four years ago.

Users can set stop-loss and take-profit levels, place limit orders, and interact with charts in real time, easily syncing with the web platform. The app offers a smooth trading experience with easy-to-use charts that allow swiping, zooming, and dragging. Traders can customize their view with various chart styles, technical indicators, and drawing tools. Plus, a refined slider feature makes order placement even more precise and user-friendly.

Traders can activate the Ultra Version K-line by navigating to the settings in the Bitunix app and selecting the Ultra Version K-line option.

Commenting on the launch and integration of this version, KX Wu, COO of Bitunix, said that this is a unique feature that no one has offered before. “We are the first to offer this version to our users. This has come as a result of the fact that we are always looking to introduce new features for our traders. Now everything will be easier for them with our TradingView Integrated K-Line Ultra App Version,” he said.

All TradingView Functions Now Available on Bitunix Mobile App

With the Ultra Version K-Line offering improved tools, better customization options, and an improved interface, users can analyze the market more effectively and execute trades with greater ease. Here are some of the key upgrades and features:

Setting a New Industry Standard for Mobile Trading

Candlestick charts, or K-lines, are critical tools for cryptocurrency traders, enabling market analysis and strategic decision-making. Historically, mobile apps have struggled to match the sophistication of web-based charting tools. This version redefines mobile crypto trading by delivering a professional, web-level experience on mobile devices.

Bitunix continues to prioritize user experience, following the latest insights from the industry. According to a report on the importance of user experience in crypto trading apps, by Blockchain Magazine, improving the trading platform’s usability is crucial for attracting and retaining users in an increasingly competitive market hence the launch of the K-Line Ultra.

Breaking Records Since 2021

Since its launch in 2021, Bitunix has continuously improved its platform. Version 1 introduced spot and futures trading, followed by Version 2 in 2022, which added third-party fiat payment integration.

In 2023, Bitunix expanded with a P2P market, and in 2024, it introduced Convert and Copy Trading features along with a Multi-asset margin function.

https://blockonomi.com,XRP (XRP) Price: Technical Analysis Shows Potential for June 2025 Rally,https://blockonomi.com/xrp-xrp-price-technical-analysis-shows-potential-for-june-2025-rally/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 08:12:54 GMT","TLDR

XRP has experienced two consecutive monthly losses, currently trading around $2.05-$2.09

Analyst EGRAG Crypto predicts XRP could reach $27 in approximately 63 days (June 2025)

Dark Defender identifies $2.222 as a key breakout level to watch

Technical indicators show XRP in a “falling broadening wedge” pattern that typically precedes breakouts

Price targets range from a conservative $5-$8 to an ambitious $27, requiring 1,191% growth from current levels

XRP (XRP) has been experiencing significant volatility in recent months, following broader crypto market trends. The digital asset is currently trading around $2.05-$2.09, having fallen from above $3 earlier this year. Despite this downward pressure, several prominent analysts remain bullish on XRP’s future price potential.

The altcoin is on track to record a second consecutive monthly loss. March 2025 showed a 3.16% decline, following February’s larger 29.33% drop that saw XRP lose the important $3 psychological mark.

This recent bearish trend marks the first time since December 2022 that XRP has posted back-to-back monthly losses. The downward movement has caused some concern among investors who were hoping for continued upward momentum.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows XRP currently testing critical support around the $2 level. This price zone represents a key battleground between buyers and sellers that could determine the token’s short-term direction.

Market analyst EGRAG Crypto has maintained an ambitious target of $27 for XRP. Based on historical data and fractal analysis from the 2017 bull run, EGRAG believes this target could materialize within the next 63 days.

The analyst points to similarities between current market conditions and those seen in 2017. During that cycle, XRP consolidated for approximately 42 days before experiencing a breakout that led to a massive rally over 21 days.

From its lowest point to its all-time high in 2017-2018, XRP took exactly 9 weeks (63 days) to complete its bullish cycle. EGRAG believes this pattern could repeat, with June 2025 being the target timeframe for reaching $27.

Another respected analyst, Dark Defender, has identified $2.222 as a crucial resistance level. A breakout above this price point could trigger renewed bullish momentum and set the stage for higher prices.

Hi all! I hope you are well! #XRP has touched our lowest Fibonacci level. As stated, $2.222 is the key level and should be broken upwards. We set $2.04 as our last Fibonacci level, and we can visit there again! April-May will be hot, and our Targets of Wave 5 stand at… pic.twitter.com/j2JunirCkN — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) March 30, 2025

Dark Defender notes that XRP has reached its lowest Fibonacci level after the recent decline. While he acknowledges the possibility of further dips toward $2.04, he maintains a target range of $5 to $8 for the completion of the current Elliott Wave structure.

The current Elliott Wave count suggests April and May could be particularly strong months for XRP. This forecast comes despite most traders adopting increasingly bearish stances in the short term.

The crypto Fear and Greed Index currently sits at a fear level of 24. Interestingly, Dark Defender views this extreme bearish sentiment as a potentially positive sign, suggesting it could set the stage for a surprise reversal.

Technical charts reveal the formation of a “falling broadening wedge” pattern for XRP. This pattern typically indicates growing instability and historically precedes significant breakout movements.

For bulls to regain control, XRP must first reclaim the $2.30 level before targeting more ambitious resistance zones. A decisive move above $2.50 would signal renewed bullish momentum and potentially confirm the start of the next leg up.

In the immediate term, traders are watching whether XRP can hold above the critical $2.00-$2.07 support zone. Failure to maintain this level could trigger additional selling pressure before any potential rebound.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Pi Network (PI) Price: Technical Analysis Shows Double-Bottom Pattern Formation,https://blockonomi.com/pi-network-pi-price-technical-analysis-shows-double-bottom-pattern-formation/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 08:08:17 GMT","TLDR

Pi Network secured a major listing on BTCC Exchange, sparking market optimism

Token unlocks will hit monthly low in April (124.32 million tokens), potentially reducing selling pressure

Technical analysis shows a possible double-bottom pattern and bullish divergence indicators

PCM Wallet app received significant upgrades improving user experience and transaction capabilities

Despite recent price declines, some analysts predict potential recovery to $1 or higher based on chart patterns

Pi Network has recently secured a major listing on BTCC Exchange, sparking renewed optimism among investors. This development comes at a time when the cryptocurrency has experienced price challenges, falling to as low as $0.68 in the last 24 hours.

The Pi coin price has struggled over the past few weeks, with a 22% drop in the last seven days and a 60% decline over the monthly timeframe. Today’s price shows a modest 1% recovery to around $0.7184, with a 24-hour trading range between $0.6806 and $0.7535.

Market analysts have identified several factors behind Pi’s recent price slump. The most important factor was the massive token unlocks in March, which increased supply and put downward pressure on price.

The lack of major announcements from the Pi Core Team has also affected market sentiment. Particularly, the absence of updates regarding a potential Binance listing has left many investors uncertain about near-term prospects.

April may bring better news for Pi Network holders. According to PiScan data, token unlocks will reach their lowest point in April, with only 124.32 million tokens scheduled for release.

This represents a much smaller amount compared to upcoming months. May will see 182.37 million tokens unlocked, followed by 222.68 million in June, 233.37 million in July, and 132.52 million in August.

The daily token unlocks between April 7 and April 11 will be particularly low at around 1.5 million tokens per day. This reduced rate of new tokens entering the market could help ease selling pressure.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis of Pi Network’s price chart reveals some causes for optimism. The four-hour chart shows signs of a double-bottom pattern forming at $0.7663, which is often considered a bullish reversal indicator.

Further technical indicators suggest potential upward movement. Pi has settled at the 78.60% Fibonacci Retracement level, while oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD have formed a bullish divergence pattern.

Analyst Crypto Jex has shared a positive outlook for Pi Coin. Jex suggests Pi Network is forming an ABC Recovery Pattern within a key accumulation zone, with targets of $0.95-$1.00, $1.30-$1.50, and potentially $1.80+ upon trend confirmation.

Another analyst, DEXWireNews, has identified a falling broadening wedge pattern on Pi’s price chart. If this pattern holds true, they suggest Pi could reach as high as $2.52 in April, representing a 282% increase from current levels.

The RSI indicator shows near oversold conditions for Pi coin, suggesting the token may be undervalued at current prices. Additionally, the volume histogram displays green conditions, indicating increasing buying interest.

On the development front, the PCM Wallet app has received major upgrades. The wallet has been rebuilt using Flutter, streamlining the user interface and making Pi transactions more efficient.

Two key features have been added to the PCM Wallet. The first is the implementation of muxed accounts, allowing users to deposit and manage their tokens more effectively.

The second feature enables Pi token withdrawals, though currently with a 200 Pi limit. Pichain Global has clarified that this limit is temporary to ensure a stable launch for the wallet.

The PCM wallet functions as a non-custodial wallet, allowing for global transactions and payments with improved efficiency. Security remains a priority, safely connecting users to the PiChain ecosystem.

Pi Network currently stands as the 29th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at $5.163 billion. The token trades on 20 exchanges with a daily trading volume of $159 million.

One factor that could boost Pi Network’s value in the future is increasing exchange adoption. With its substantial market cap and trading volume, more exchanges may consider listing Pi in the coming months.

There has also been speculation about a potential token burn. Such a move would reduce the total supply of Pi coins, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens if demand remains constant or grows.

The most immediate candidates for burning would be unmigrated mined tokens. Removing these from future circulation could significantly reduce the total supply from its current maximum of 100 billion tokens.

Currently, there are 6.7 billion Pi coins in circulation. As the ecosystem’s applications become more popular, Pi Network may introduce fee burns, further reducing supply over time.

The recent PCM Wallet upgrades may increase Pi’s utility and adoption. By making the token more useful for everyday transactions, these improvements could strengthen the ecosystem and increase long-term investment appeal.

While near-term price movements remain uncertain, the combination of reduced token unlocks, technical indicators, and ecosystem developments provide reasons for cautious optimism among Pi Network supporters.",blockonomi
