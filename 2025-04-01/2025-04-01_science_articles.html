                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In January, the Trump administration ordered a broad pause on all US funding for foreign aid. Among other issues, this has significant effects on US funding for HIV. A large part of this is the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which oversees programs in low- and middle-income countries to prevent, diagnose and treat the virus. What’s more, recent funding cuts for international HIV assistance go beyond the US. In a new study, we found the worst-case scenario could see more than 10 million extra infections than what we’d otherwise anticipate in the next five years, and almost 3 million additional deaths. HIV can be transmitted at birth, during unprotected sex or thorough blood-to-blood contact such as shared needles. If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), a condition in which the immune system is severely damaged, and which can be fatal. There’s still no cure for HIV, but modern treatments allow the virus to be suppressed with a daily pill. People with HIV who continue treatment can live without symptoms and don’t risk infecting others. A sustained global effort towards awareness, prevention, testing and treatment has reduced annual new HIV infections by 39% (from 2.1 million in 2010 to 1.3 million in 2023), and annual deaths by 51% (from 1.3 million to 630,000). Most of that drop happened in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was worst. Today, nearly two-thirds of people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, and nearly all live in low- and middle-income countries. To do this, we used our mathematical model for 26 low- and middle-income countries. These 26 countries represent roughly half of all people living with HIV in low- and middle income countries, and half of international HIV spending. We set up each country model in collaboration with national HIV/AIDS teams, so the data sources reflected the best available local knowledge. For each country, we first projected the number of new HIV infections and deaths that would occur if HIV spending stayed the same. Finally, we modelled scenarios for the possible immediate discontinuation of PEPFAR in addition to other anticipated cuts. For children, there could be up to an additional 882,400 infections and 119,000 deaths. In the more optimistic scenario in which PEPFAR continues but 24% is still cut from international HIV funding, we estimated there could be 70,000 to 1.73 million extra new HIV infections and 5,000 to 61,000 additional deaths between 2025 and 2030. This would still be 50% higher than if current spending were to continue. The wide range in our estimates reflects low- and middle-income countries committing to far more domestic funding for HIV in the best case, or broader health system dysfunction and a sustained gap in funding for HIV treatment in the worst case. Some funding for HIV treatment may be saved by taking that money from HIV prevention efforts, but this would have other consequences. But most of our assumptions were cautious, so these results likely underestimate the true impacts of funding cuts to HIV programs globally. Sub-Saharan Africa will experience by far the greatest effects due to the high proportion of HIV treatment that has relied on international funding. In other regions, we estimate vulnerable groups such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and trans and gender diverse people may experience increases in new HIV infections that are 1.3 to 6 times greater than the general population. The Asia-Pacific received US$591 million in international funding for HIV in 2023, which is the second highest after sub-Saharan Africa. Notably, more than 10% of new HIV infections among people born in Australia are estimated to have been acquired overseas. But concern is greatest for countries that are most acutely affected by HIV and AIDS, many of which will be most affected by international funding cuts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The video, which was released March 26 by the European Space Agency (ESA), is sped-up footage originally taken over an eight-hour period on Oct. 12, 2022, by ESA's Solar Orbiter. This is the first time solar wind has been recorded "flying out from the sun in a twisting, whirling motion," ESA representatives wrote in a statement . Related: 10 supercharged solar storms that blew us away in 2024 Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors The sun is currently experiencing the peak in its roughly 11-year cycle of activity, known as solar maximum , which officially began in early 2024 . However, this video was captured before solar activity started ramping up, which surprised the scientists. Until recently, the origin and complex behaviors of solar wind have remained largely elusive. But a new generation of spacecraft is helping to unravel these mysteries. When the video was recorded, ESA's Solar Orbiter was the only probe capable of capturing solar wind in such great detail. However, ESA's Proba-3 mission, which launched in December 2024 , is also capable of viewing solar wind thanks to its ability to create artificial solar eclipses in space. NASA's Parker Solar Probe, meanwhile, was launched in 2018 and has helped to capture important solar wind data during its recent super-close flybys of our home star . Solar wind is expected to become more extreme over the next few years as we enter the solar "battle zone" — a period after solar maximum when magnetic instabilities on the sun cause large coronal holes to open up on the sun's surface and shoot out extreme solar gusts. These solar events will be much like a dark patch that showered Earth with charged particles last week , triggering significant aurora activity. Sun quiz: How well do you know our home star?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most powerful objects in the universe is a radio quasar — a spinning black hole spraying out highly energetic particles. Come too close to one, and you'd get sucked in by its gravitational pull, or burn up from the intense heat surrounding it. But ironically, studying black holes and their jets can give researchers insight into where potentially habitable worlds might be in the universe. Active black holes have a pancake-shaped structure around them called an accretion disk , which contains hot, electrically charged gas. Related: 'Very rare' black hole energy jet discovered tearing through a spiral galaxy shaped like our own When two galaxies collide and merge , gas is funneled into the central region of that merger. There is one supermassive black hole at the heart of every massive galaxy. But black holes are important to study because they produce enormous amounts of energy that can influence galaxies. How energetic a black hole is depends on different factors, such as the mass of the black hole, whether it rotates rapidly, and whether lots of material falls onto it. In spiral galaxies , for example, less gas tends to fall into the center, and the central black hole tends to have less energy. A black hole can pull in magnetic fields and energetic particles surrounding it, and then as the black hole rotates, the magnetic fields twist into a jet that sprays out highly energetic particles. Magnetic fields twist around the black hole as it rotates to store energy — kind of like when you pull and twist a rubber band. When you release the rubber band, it snaps forward. Similarly, the magnetic fields release their energy by producing these jets. CC BY) (Image credit: NASA, ESA, and A. Feild (STScI) Some black holes, however, rotate in a different direction than the accretion disk around them. Imagine a basketball that spins one way, but you keep tapping it to rotate in the other. If you continue to tap in the opposite direction, it will eventually spin up and rotate in the other direction. The change from counterrotation to corotation takes at least 100 million years. So, these black holes would produce powerful jets both early and later in their lifetimes, with an interlude in the middle where the jets are either weak or nonexistent. When the black hole spins in counterrotation with respect to its accretion disk, that motion produces strong jets that push molecules in the surrounding gas close together, which leads to the formation of stars . This tilt makes it so that the jet impinges directly on the gas, heating it up and inhibiting star formation. Cosmic X-rays are bad for life because they can harm organic tissue. For life to thrive, it most likely needs a planet with a habitable ecosystem , and clouds of hot gas saturated with X-rays don't contain such planets. So, astronomers can instead look for galaxies without a tilted jet coming from its black hole. This idea is key to understanding where intelligence could potentially have emerged and matured in the universe. It could point out environments with the right kind of black holes to produce the greatest number of planets without spraying them with X-rays. Life in such environments could emerge to its full potential. The answer is low-density environments where galaxies had merged about 11 billion years ago. These environments had black holes whose powerful jets enhanced the rate of star formation, but they never experienced a bout of tilted jets in corotation. In short, my model suggested that theoretically, the most advanced extraterrestrial civilization would have likely emerged on the cosmic scene far away and billions of years ago .

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some of the most famous types of bear are actually subspecies. Grizzly bears, for example, are a subspecies of brown bear found in parts of North America. There are many different subspecies of brown bear found all over the world, from Kodiak bears in Alaska to the Syrian brown bear in the Middle East. These bears can look quite different from each other, with distinct coat colors and body sizes. On average, polar bears weigh about 1,150 pounds (521 kg) and stand about 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall on their hind legs. The heaviest recorded polar bear was 2,210 pounds (1,002 kg). If you consider subspecies, the Kodiak bear generally matches polar bears' size, but some individual Kodiak bears have grown even more massive. The biggest-ever Kodiak bear was a giant named Clyde at the Dakota Zoo. At his heaviest measured weight, he was a whopping 2,130 pounds (966 kg) — about as heavy as a small car. These tiny bears weigh only 60 to 145 pounds (27 to 66 kg), and are only 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) tall standing on their hind legs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recent release of DeepSeek sent shock waves through markets and acted as a Sputnik moment for the United States. After the news broke that China's artificial intelligence (AI) model achieved comparable or better results than Silicon Valley's best AI models, the U.S. suddenly faced a harsh reality: The country was not assured of being a forerunner in the AI race. In response, the Trump administration is considering imposing even tighter export controls and banning the use of DeepSeek on government devices, while OpenAI has accused DeepSeek of inappropriately copying ChatGPT. He studies extreme events, which range from organizational disasters to radical innovation. The United States and China belong to fundamentally different paradigms of thinking, as is reflected in their formal and informal institutional structures. Each way of thinking seeks dominance in the world. There was only one superpower: the United States. Now, that dominance is no longer taken for granted. China would like to usurp that position and thinks achieving AI dominance is its appropriate approach — so it has been investing heavily in the sector over the past decade. China moved quickly to secure rare earth minerals in Africa and worldwide. The U.S. only recently responded, by trying to secure mineral rights in Ukraine and elsewhere. China has also made moves to attract its U.S.-educated Chinese students back to the country by offering them housing, tax benefits, children's education and a lax regulatory environment while also setting up new AI schools at home. America's primary response has been to develop a tiered system that imposes restrictions on AI diffusion. This tiered system groups countries into three main categories: "friends," "neutrals" and "rivals." Export of U.S.-made ICs to "rivals" like China is heavily restricted. For "neutrals," like India and Singapore, there are conditions. Similar restrictions limit where AI firms can establish data centers, which require a tremendous amount of land, capital investment and energy. Similar agreements to develop data centers cannot be made with U.S. rivals, or at least not without U.S. permission. Such restrictions are meant to constrain Chinese development of AI. But one might say it is evolutionary, not revolutionary. America's competitive edge comes from constant innovation and a supportive institutional structure that fosters fair competition, protects property rights , encourages broad participation and challenges authority. In contrast, the Chinese institutional setup leans toward protecting authority, unfair competition (although recent changes in Chinese law aim to address this problem) and insecure property rights, which, in the long run, is not conducive to radical innovation. A Stand up for Science rally held in Minnesota to protest against science funding cuts — cuts that could impact the influx of research talent to the U.S. (Image credit: UCG/Getty Images) These would-be-entrepreneurs come to the U.S. from India, China, South Africa and Russia, among other places. Currently, the United States remains an attractive destination, including for Chinese immigrants . But recent moves to restrict their entry, possibly by developing a tiered visa-granting system , amounts to reducing an import of human capital into America and their inadvertent export elsewhere. Restrictions on funding for universities also undermine U.S. attractiveness; some universities have curtailed hiring doctoral students , who serve a key role in driving research forward. European universities are attempting to leverage the situation by recruiting American colleagues with offers of a convivial research environment with more stable funding sources. Herbert Simon, a Nobel laureate and key early contributor to the development of AI, once said , "any direction you proceed in [is probably wrong], so it is good if other people are exploring in other directions." In other words, diversity of ideas is needed, and a more diverse pool of competent human capital (e.g., with different educational backgrounds from different countries), as well as funding for the development of ideas, is critical. The Chinese would like to out-innovate Silicon Valley, but they are currently unable to do so because of the stream of raw talent into a hospitable U.S. (and Western) institutional environment. Diluting the basis of competition seems myopic. Ironically, "winning" the artificial intelligence race rests on human intelligence that the U.S. seems to be actively undercutting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only one person, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, has ever served more than two terms as president of the United States. First, prior to Roosevelt’s election to a third term in 1940 there was a longstanding American tradition that presidents not serve more than two terms. This tradition was established by the decisions of early presidents such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison not to seek a third term. Second, after Roosevelt died in office in 1945 during his fourth term, Congress and the people of the United States decided to turn the long-standing tradition that presidents should not serve more than two terms into a part of constitutional law. No one is supposed to serve more than two full terms as president. The only way someone can serve more than two terms is if they served less than two years in a previous term in which they weren’t elected president. But that exception is still meant to bar anyone from serving more than a total of 10 years as president. Political scientist and term limit scholar Michael Korzi gives a lot more credit to the nation’s third president, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was outspoken in favor of the two-term tradition. Jefferson saw a president who was willing to break the two-term tradition as power hungry, and he hoped that the American people would not elect such a president. election, I trust he would be rejected on this demonstration of ambitious views.” Jefferson also worried that without term limits, presidents would stay in office too long into their old age and after they had lost their ability to govern effectively. Subsequently, presidents tended to abide by the two-term tradition. And in the few cases where presidents decided to seek a third term, their own parties would not give them the nomination. That remained true until Roosevelt ran for, and won, both a third and a fourth term as president during World War II. Similarly, Rep. Edward McCowen from Ohio said that the 22nd Amendment would be “a great step toward preventing a dictatorship or some totalitarian form of government from arising.” And Rep. John Jennings Jr. from Tennessee stated that only by adoption of the 22nd Amendment “can the people be assured that we shall never have a dictator in this land.” In the 1980s, political scientist Juan Linz identified that presidential systems are less stable than other forms of democracy, such as parliamentary systems. This makes it easier to remove the checks and balances that democracies depend on. Law professor Mila Versteeg and her colleagues have shown that in recent years presidents around the globe have used various tactics to try to violate presidential term limits. They note that most of the time when a president’s attempt to violate term limits fails it is “because the attempt encountered widespread popular resistance.” They conclude that this finding implies that “broad resistance movements” may be the best means to prevent violation of presidential term limits.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is tempting to explain these puzzling events as products of mental disorders. The same types of explanations are frequently heard for the unorthodox decisions of United States President Donald Trump. But are these explanations legitimate, or even a good idea? Trump’s second term in power, which has focused on stoking people’s anger, has given rise to numerous interpretations of this kind. Critics have analyzed Trump’s shocking decrees and statements (for example, “cleaning out” the Gaza Strip) as symptoms of mental illness. Though they might disagree on its substance, some analysts are taking the Trump administration’s “shock and awe” approach to governance seriously. Thousands of subscribers already receive The Conversation’s Canada Daily newsletter. Pathologization refers to the act of explaining actions by presuming or diagnosing an individual pathology. It is a common reflex to explain extreme acts, one that also serves as a catch-all for violent and apparently inexplicable actions. But what is the social function of pathologizing political violence and violent policies? As a doctoral student in political philosophy, my research focuses on specific collective traumas and their political dimensions. In a context of increased polarization, I am particularly interested in how trauma and other mental pathologies are used to explain political phenomena such as violence. However, on the one hand, using it this way risks depoliticizing actions that are part of a clear political agenda. And on the other, it risks overshadowing the social pathologies that actually emerge from violent policies (such as the collective traumas that result from colonization and war). In the case of Donald Trump, pathologizing him is likely to generate confusion about the real motives behind his policies. Indeed, although his incendiary statements are explained as the product of psychological instability, they are, in fact, well thought out. His statements also feed into the collective traumas that fuel political conflicts. As he wrote in his suicide note, the explosion was “not a terrorist attack,” but rather meant as a “wake-up call” for an American public that has become thirsty for “spectacles of violence.” Several media outlets were quick to note the author’s diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a major issue among American veterans. So, this spectacular gesture took place at a unique meeting point: it was certainly a political gesture, but one with motivations explicitly linked to psychological suffering. Firstly, because the tendency to pathologize violent acts has long favoured white men: several studies on mass killings, for example, show that violent white men receive more empathetic media treatment than do men of colour. Khaled Diab, a Belgian and Egyptian journalist for the Guardian who specializes in Middle Eastern politics, pointed out in a 2023 article that collective trauma is the cornerstone of the Israeli-Palestinian war. It nurtures a mistrust that poisons the idea of coexistence “by investing violence with a hypnotic redemptive value.” Explaining violent actions and policies in terms of individual pathologies can mask their real causes, namely divisive discourses and conflicts. What’s more, reducing violence to a pathology can conceal the other function of these very discourses and conflicts by presenting the use of violence as “redemptive.” This rhetorical tool is used in Trump’s agenda and in other cases of fascism centred on popular anger. Now, more than ever, we must remember that while individual pathologies can be treated — provided that therapies are accessible, an ideal far from being achieved everywhere — overcoming collective traumas requires much more time, resources and resilience.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mounting threats to Canadian sovereignty, particularly — but not exclusively — from United States President Donald Trump, have sparked renewed calls for national resilience. Historically, Canada has provided refuge to those who have risked everything to oppose authoritarian regimes, including activists living in exile. Activists-in-exile are individuals who have been forced to flee their countries due to their work defending human rights, advocating for democratic governance, rooting out corruption, peacebuilding, demanding environmental protection and practising independent journalism, among other endeavours. These individuals bring with them not only their personal stories and attitudes of resilience, but also their expertise in governance, human rights and social justice. Despite their displacement, activists-in-exile continue to play a crucial role in global democratic movements. Unlike traditional diaspora groups focused on cultural preservation, activists-in-exile engage in direct political advocacy and often work to expose foreign interference, counter disinformation and support democratic movements from afar. Despite their potential, activists-in-exile are often overlooked or met with skepticism in Canada. Some Canadian politicians, like federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, have framed their views of patriotism as a matter of national security and economic self-sufficiency, warning against foreign influences. Poilievre recently said immigrants should “leave the war behind” when coming to Canada, implying their past struggles should be forgotten upon arrival. This is certainly easier said than done, especially in an age where technology can keep people instantly connected across borders. They are also unlikely to surrender ongoing interests or their basic values. Through our work with Voices in Exile, we have learned that many newcomers involuntarily leave behind family, livelihoods and status, only to face significant hurdles re-establishing themselves in Canada. While some activists-in-exile persist and continue to be impactful, they often do so under unnecessary constraints that limit their full potential. If legitimate concerns about professional qualifications and social stability exist, they can be addressed through tailored support systems. While Canada provides resettlement for a limited number of human rights defenders, there is no program to engage with them once they arrive. At the same time, activists-in-exile should not be treated solely as victims or as potential risks, particularly in light of growing transnational repression. Instead, their specialized knowledge and skills should be recognized as a force to strengthen democracy both in Canada and their countries of origin. Recognizing and supporting activists-in-exile would be a strategic investment for Canada, not an act of charity. Others have founded organizations, launched media platforms and built networks that support democracy movements globally. Beyond being a matter of principle, welcoming activists-in-exile is a move that would strengthen Canada’s leadership in the global fight for democracy. Their integration into Canadian society aligns with Canada’s longstanding role in promoting democratic ideals on the world stage. Yet, despite their vast potential, there is no tailored public policy or dedicated institution to harness this human capital in a way that aligns with Canada’s democratic commitments. Canada should support exiled activists by facilitating collaboration among these individuals and Canadian public, academic, community, government and civil society organizations. A dedicated fund should also be created that offers financial support for their activist efforts. As global authoritarianism continues to rise, the question is not whether we should acknowledge activists-in-exile — it is whether we have the wisdom to lead by example and invest in recognizing and supporting them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada is now stuck between two giants with divergent interests: the United States and China. It undergoes the counterpouss of trade and geopolitical tensions which oppose these two powers. On the one hand, an unpredictable and less reliable American neighbor, on the other, a little conciliatory China, which regularly imposes economic sanctions on strategic agricultural products such as soy or pork. This context exposes the geopolitical vulnerability of Canada, too dependent on its traditional partners. Added to this is the impasse of trade negotiations between Washington and Brussels, illustrating the growing differences on international trade rules and the protection of strategic industries. In retaliation, China arrested two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spaval, arousing a lively diplomatic crisis. Since then, distrust has been deeply rooted, fueled by persistent tensions around cybersecurity, foreign interference and commercial restrictions, but also by the recent execution in China of four Canadian citizens, condamized for drug trafficking. In this global context, the European Union is increasingly confronted with the need to build strategic autonomy, both military and economic, to guarantee its sovereignty and long -term stability. To become a stabilizing center, the European Union must meet three conditions: having sufficient economic power, showing a political will to act collectively, and be perceived as a legitimate and credible actor by other democracies. In this perspective, Canada appears as a natural and reliable partner. In 2023, exchanges of goods and services combined between Canada and the EU reached a value of $ 157.3 billion Canadian dollars. The overall economic and commercial agreement (AECG), in force provisional since 2017, has abolished 98 % of customs duties between the two partners, promoting sustained growth in trade. Already thousands of subscribers to the conversation newsletter. But further integration would offer full access to the European single market, harmonization of standards, and synergies in key sectors: green technologies, artificial, pharmaceutical or cybersecurity. Canada could also access major European programs such as Horizon Europe, a research fund of 95.5 billion euros (almost $ 148 billion can). In addition, Canada holds (natural resources for the European energy transition): lithium, cobalt, nickel. Reinforced collaboration would ensure a secure and sustainable supply while promoting strategic industries on both sides of the Atlantic. Defense and security: to a transatlantic pillar It develops a common defense policy, supported by a budget of 800 billion euros (1237 G $ can) and reinforced by the Draghi report, which calls for reinforced strategic autonomy, including by consolidating an industrial and technological defense base. Europe no longer only wants to defend itself alongside the United States, but also emancipate itself from an unpredictable America. However, this perspective should not be addressed in a binary manner. It is not necessary to aim for immediate formal membership. A structuring strategic partnership, inspired by Norwegian or Swiss models, but adapted to Canadian realities, could offer a more flexible path. Such cooperation could include reinforced access to European markets, participation in common research, defense or energy transition projects, and increased coordination in multilateral institutions. The objective would not only be economic, but also political and symbolic: to affirm a common commitment to democracy, international cooperation and respect for the global legal order. In a recomposition world, Canada can no longer count solely on its North American anchoring. The transatlantic link, if it is redesigned in a modern and flexible perspective, can offer this alternative. A rapprochement with Europe could also contribute to revitalizing democratic debate in Canada, strengthening national cohesion around a common project and its ability to deal with future crises, whether economic, security or climatic. The time has come to open this debate, not as a fantasy, but as a strategic prospective exercise.</p>

A volcanic fissure has opened up near the town of Grindavík on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula following a significant uptick in earthquake activity. Images show lava breaching the town's defensive barrier, as Icelandic Met Office (IMO) representatives warn the fissure could continue to grow. A nearly 4,000-foot-long (1,200 meters) fissure opened up at 9:45 a.m. local time north of the town of Grindavík , and it continues to extend southward toward the town. Southwesterly winds are expected to carry volcanic gas northeastwards and could reach the capital, Reykjavík, 25 miles (40 kilometers) away. At 11:00 a.m., IMO representatives said that a new eruptive fissure had opened up inside the protective barriers around Grindavík.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This requires understanding how individuals feel included and valued in the places they live, and responding to their needs by emphasizing genuine inclusivity. For people with mobility challenges, it means feeling no different from others. This applies both to navigating urban spaces and engaging in social interactions. Despite efforts to improve accessibility in Canada, many urban spaces still fall short, leaving wheelchair users facing subtle but persistent barriers. We wanted to understand the different challenges and barriers people with disabilities face when using mobility aids. To do this, we interviewed 12 experienced physiotherapists in Iran to identify gaps in how mobility aid serve the needs of those who use them, and offer recommendations based on their extensive interactions with users. Level 3 aims to minimize mismatches between users and design, promoting human flourishing through seamless interaction among individuals, the design and their environment. We highlight gaps in users’ needs and provide recommendations to address them. Through this analysis, we identified four key themes that offer valuable insights for enhancing inclusivity. For some, mobility aids can be an added financial burden. Globally, only five to 35 per cent of the 80 million people who need a wheelchair have access to one depending on where they live, with high costs being a primary barrier. The high cost of advanced electric wheelchairs further restrict access. This marks a gap at the first level of inclusivity in the DARE framework, where market-driven prices fall short of meeting mobility aid users’ needs. This framework offers 48 options across six domains to translate political goals into action, such as reallocating health-care funds to expand rehabilitation and improve inclusivity. In using mobility aids, a user will typically evaluate two aspects: the design features of the aids themselves and how well they function in their environment. If the mobility aid is slightly mismatched with their requirements, the user may find alternative solutions, such as adding padding to a wheelchair to relieve pressure. However, severe mismatches can lead to negative outcomes and result in unmet mobility needs. Furthermore, inadequate anthropometric and ergonomic adjustments can lead to discomfort. Similarly, environmental mismatches, such as barriers that disrupt navigation, can reinforce negative stereotypes and condescending attitudes. However, integrating new technologies requires careful consideration, as assistive devices can also attract social stigma. Therefore, it is important to identify which technological or esthetic features of mobility aids evoke positive emotions and minimize stigma. Mobility aid users, like everyone, deserve equal consideration in design and planning. Programs like Europe’s Design for All (DfA) and Singapore’s Barrier-Free Accessibility (BFA) promote barrier-free design for all abilities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Physiotherapists, as trusted experts, can remarkably shape users’ perceptions and acceptance of mobility aids. Ensuring trustworthy designs is also crucial, as perceived fragility can undermine user trust. Validating experiences, building trust across environments — including trust in physiotherapists and mobility aid products — is essential to alleviating doubts about how effective they might be. This highlights the critical role of esthetics in shaping public perceptions and social interactions. For example, incorporating esthetic refinements into the design can help counter negative perceptions. Raising public awareness is key to challenging stereotypes and building empathy. Achieving this requires a multi-disciplinary effort, and the active participation of people who use mobility aids.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, high-resolution time-lapse videos of tiny bits of living plants show how they assemble their protective cell walls, researchers report March 21 in Science Advances. The image sequences provide new insights into how this cell structure forms, which could lead to innovations in plant-derived products such as renewable biofuels. But “we still don’t know how it’s synthesized.” Scientists want to understand how cellulose is made not only because it’s useful for many human-made materials including paper and cloth, but also so it can be more efficiently broken down into products like biofuels, says Rutgers plant biologist Eric Lam. Fibers of cellulose (illustrated in brown), which clumped together after short pieces were pumped out by plant cell enzymes (green), overlap to form a mesh over a round cell before morphing into a rigid, typically rectangular, cell wall. Fourteen wall-less cells were imaged every six minutes for about 24 hours as they regenerated their protective barriers. Some of the process was so speedy that additional cells were imaged at 20-second intervals for one to two hours. Fourteen cells from the Arabidopsis thaliana plant were imaged every six minutes for about 24 hours as they regenerated their cell walls. First, enzymes in the cell’s outer layer pump out short pieces of cellulose that “swim around” on the cell’s surface, Lam says. Finally, that mesh of cellulose keeps rearranging itself and compacting until it becomes a rigid, stable cell wall. Details about these steps, particularly the first that shows cellulose isn’t produced as long strings, have remained a mystery since cell walls were first viewed through a microscope more than 300 years ago, says Rutgers biophysicist Sang-Hyuk Lee.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In medicine, its ability to produce custom-made, complex structures is changing the way doctors treat injuries and diseases – especially when it comes to rebuilding bones and other body tissues. In medicine, this technology is being used to make inert objects like implants and prosthetics, but it can also create living tissues that help the body repair itself. This exciting new development, known as bioprinting, uses tiny structures (called scaffolds) embedded with the patient’s own cells to guide the growth of new tissue. It also helps the new tissue to heal faster and work more effectively. In the future, this technology might even be used to print full organs for transplant, helping solve the worldwide shortage of donor organs. Healing large or complex bone defects is one of the toughest challenges in surgery. Whether caused by accidents, cancer surgery or birth conditions, these defects often do not heal well with traditional bone grafts. One big problem is that the body struggles to grow new blood vessels inside the graft, which is essential for proper healing. Researchers in Europe are currently at the forefront of developing innovative, groundbreaking new technology to tackle this problem, with initiatives spread across the continent. Researchers at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) have created 3D-printed scaffolds using polylactic acid and calcium phosphate that support bone growth and blood vessel formation. These have shown strong results in lab and animal tests, where scaffolds have encouraged stem cells to grow and release growth factors, successfully attracteing blood vessels into the healing area. At the University of Bergen, the Tissue Engineering Group is working on two major projects that use a patient’s own stem cells to print bone replacements. The design also incorporates sensors to monitor implant performance, providing real-time data on bone growth and potential complications. Their custom-made system uses a high-speed, precise printing process that meets international medical manufacturing standards (ISO 13485). Such collaborations between academic institutions and private companies are essential. They help speed up the process of turning research discoveries into real-life treatments available in hospitals. These partnerships also ensure that safety, quality, and effectiveness remain a priority in every stage of development. The European cases mentioned above show how this technology is already helping patients heal better and faster. They are also paving the way for a new era of personalised and regenerative medicine. New medical tools must also meet strict safety rules, which takes time, but helps protect patients and build trust. Progress will depend on close teamwork between scientists, doctors, engineers, and regulators. As research and trials move forward, 3D printing is likely to become a routine part of surgery. Personalised, cell-based implants could soon be a standard option for repairing bone and tissue, bringing us closer to a future where treatments are safer, faster, and made just for you.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marine Le Pen, the figurehead of France’s far-right National Rally (RN) party and a three-time presidential candidate, has been found guilty of misappropriating public funds and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and five years of ineligibility for public office, with immediate effect. Despite her decision to appeal, the March 31 ruling in a Paris court will probably eliminate her from the 2027 presidential race. The Conversation: Marine Le Pen’s sentence of immediate ineligibility came as a surprise and a shock. Luc Rouban: Yes, it’s a surprise and I don’t think the RN was expecting this decision. That’s what we were used to during the Jacques Chirac and François Mitterrand periods, when there were dangerous links between politicians and certain members of the business class. It also brings to mind – of course – the more recent Nicolas Sarkozy affair. Today we are witnessing a historic turnaround. But this sentence is not symbolic at all. Or is it a problem, as RN president Jordan Bardella, right-wing members of parliament Eric Ciotti and Laurent Wauquiez, and left-wing political leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon have said – and as Elon Musk, Viktor Orban, Geert Wilders, Matteo Salvini and the Kremlin have also said? Luc Rouban: This ruling represents an effort to make democracy better. Reaffirming the rule of law is absolutely essential and legitimate. The French democratic system is very fragile, much more so than in other European countries. One way of doing this is to ensure that the law is applied to public figures who embezzle millions of euros, not just to supermarket cashiers who are fired and prosecuted for stealing a chocolate bar. The conviction of Marine Le Pen is undeniable progress for our democracy: it’s a sign that the relationship with politics is changing, that politics has become a professional activity like any other, subject to regulations and laws. Of course, there will be attacks on the judiciary, we will have the Trumpist argument of “government by judges”. But it’s important to remember that judges simply apply the law. We must also remember that the figures, including Marine Le Pen, who are criticising ineligibility penalties, had applauded the Sapin 2 law, which passed unanimously in 2016 following the Cahuzac affair (editor’s note: ex-budget minister Jérôme Cahuzac was ruled guilty of tax fraud in a Paris court). Is Jordan Bardella capable of replacing her? Luc Rouban: Barring the uncertain scenario of a favourable ruling on appeal before the presidential election, Marine Le Pen is likely to hand over her position as RN candidate to Bardella. But is Bardella capable of replacing her? The party’s “normalisation” could involve a form of “de-lepenalisation”. The Le Pen family has totally structured the party, which is very vertical, very organised around itself and its immediate entourage. Other RN leaders, such as Sébastien Chenu or Jean-Philippe Tanguy, who have established themselves in the media, may try to overtake him in the presidential race. However, this would require a break with Marine Le Pen in a party where dissidents are quickly excluded. The likelihood of such a challenge therefore remains low. The RN electorate is too attached to France’s sovereignty, and has evolved toward a form of labour rights that is far removed from hard-line liberalism. Will the RN benefit from this verdict or lose voters? Luc Rouban: It is possible that some abstentionist voters whose backgrounds are similar to those of RN voters will express their dissatisfaction with Marine Le Pen’s conviction by choosing to vote for the future candidate of the RN. Furthermore, for whoever becomes the future candidate of the RN, there will be a problem of support. But dragging around a party whose main leaders have been convicted of criminal offences is not a good look. It could be even more so tomorrow. How might public opinion react to this major event, which deprives millions of voters of their candidate? Should we expect large-scale responses, possibly violent ones? Luc Rouban: As far as society in general is concerned, there may be hostile reactions for a while, isolated incidents, but I don’t think there will be mass movements like in the 1930s. The lack of enthusiasm for political life is obvious: who is going to take physical risks and engage in violent action to defend a political party and its representative?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story contains spoilers about the Netflix series ‘Adolescence.’ From an educational psychology angle, the show is ripe for analysis. One could comment on the premature sexualization of young girls and boys or the obsolete sense, for parents, that they can assume kids are safe when they’re at home in their rooms. However, as a doctoral student in educational psychology, I am mostly concerned with human learning — both the cognitive development that must accompany successful learners, and how children and youth understand the world through relationships. For parents, this show raises serious questions about the crisis in parent-child communication and how the internet is shaping children’s behaviour and minds. I suggest turning to the practice of dialogue as a way for parents to strengthen their communication with their children and learn about each other and the world. Children can’t be recruited to join the Armed Forces, sign legal contracts, drive, vote, marry, drink alcohol and so on. As adults, we understand that these prohibitions not only protect them but also us. Setting aside ethical reasons why children shouldn’t do any of these things, the major reason is due to the developmental state of their minds. To better understand this, we must consider executive function, also called cognitive control. Think of executive control as interconnected paths in the brain. In an adolescent’s brain, these paths resemble more of a labyrinth, with difficult and sometimes non-working passages. Besides not having full control of their thought processes, research has also shown that abstract and more “neutral” cognitive skills develop earlier than those that involve motivated or emotionally charged actions. This is precisely the ability that adolescents are still developing. When adolescents engage with social media, they can be exposed to a threatening environment where they must assert their virtual selves and deal with bullying and inappropriate content, while lacking full control of their thought processes. With maturing cognitive capabilities, teens are at risk in an online environment that thrives on extreme views and hijacks emotions. As a victim of cyberbullying, Jamie was probably not equipped with the cognitive abilities to step back from the situation and seek help. At its core, Adolescence is a painful wake-up call to the effects of unregulated internet usage in teens, and how the communication abyss that separates Gen X from Gen Z gives way to calamity. Nowhere in the show is this distance more evident than when police detectives move cluelessly through Jamie’s school trying to understand his motives, while the students seem cynically aware of what really happened. In a typical moment reflecting contemporary intergenerational dynamics in which the Gen Zs explain stuff to their analog parents, Bascombe’s son is the one to enlighten him about incel subculture and what certain emojis represent. It becomes clear that pop-cultural references mean different things to a younger generation. For example, “red pill” was appropriated from The Matrix and is now used for those who “see the truth” and reject feminism. In contrast, teens’ discomfort with face-to-face conversations is explicit in the last episode of Adolescence, when the Miller family drives to a hardware store. The parents play a song from their prom and reminisce. This ancient practice is based on the view of the world as becoming, with infinite internal and external contradictions that must be overcome so that new understandings of reality may emerge. Dialogue was famously advanced as an educational practice by philosopher of education, Paulo Freire. For parents, this means that without trying to understand what teens are saying and, importantly, how they are saying it, we can’t possibly create a better future for all of us. Engaging in dialogue involves two things: asking and answering questions. It is not a matter of merely extracting information (although knowing what children are doing is important), but rather of mutually sharing interests and letting it guide discovery. With renewed urgency, dialogue that validates the interests and knowledge of both parents and children can offer a way out of the polarization created between them by long hours spent online.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA's Terra satellite When was it taken? This striking satellite image reveals a giant, near-perfect cloud circle that formed in the heart of the Pacific Ocean more than a decade ago. While this type of cloud is not uncommon, it is extremely rare to find one isolated and in the middle of nowhere, experts say. The strange structure, which is approximately 280 miles (450 kilometers) wide, was spotted "a few thousand kilometers southwest of the Hawaiian Islands" by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite, according to NASA's Earth Observatory . The fluffy ring is made up of cumulus clouds that have been sculpted into a Rayleigh-Benard convection cell — a meteorological phenomenon powered by the rising and falling of air that's been warmed or cooled to different temperatures, known as convection. There are two types of cloud cells: closed cells, which occur when cold air sinks around the cells' border, causing clouds to form at their centers; and open cells, which occur when cold air sinks at the cells' center, triggering clouds to form around their borders, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Cloud cells are normally hexagonal and usually appear alongside other cells of the same type, creating noticeable patterns in the sky. Open-cell clouds often form wispy honeycomb-like lattices, but for some reason, this cell appears to be all on its own. Related: See all the best images of Earth from space This 2016 satellite image shows a band of open-celled clouds (top) next to a band of closed-celled clouds (bottom).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coconut trees are iconic plants found across the world’s tropical regions. They’re called “nature’s supermarket” or the “tree of life” in several cultures because every part of the coconut tree is used. The refreshing liquid found within a young green coconut is a highly prized component of the coconut palm. Coconuts are unique in the world of fruits because they have a large internal cavity filled with water. Other fruits typically store water within individual cells or pulp. I’m a food scientist who has carried out research on the properties of coconuts. All coconut palms produce water, though some, like tall varieties, will produce more than others, like dwarf varieties. So, how is this water reservoir created, and what factors influence it? The coconut tree’s extensive root system, ranging from 1 to 5 metres deep, absorbs groundwater – with dissolved nutrients – from the surrounding soil. Therefore, coconut water is neither rainwater nor seawater stored inside, but carefully filtered and nutrient-rich clear liquid formed by the tree itself. Read more: Is coconut water good for you? Many factors can influence the amount and quality of water in a coconut. Immature, green coconuts (six to eight months) are usually full of water: between 300 millilitres and 1 litre. Mature coconuts (12 months and older) have low water levels as the liquid is partially absorbed by the endosperm. High rainfall encourages greater accumulation of water, while drought conditions reduce the amount of water that can be transported to the fruit. Healthy soils packed with minerals lead to high-quality and nutrient-rich coconut water. Poor or salty soils, lacking in minerals that can travel up the coconut tree to the fruit, will lead to low quality water. Finally, unhealthy or diseased trees produce smaller-sized coconuts with little water. Coconut trees and coconut water are important to tropical economies across south-east Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean Sea territories, as well as the coastlines of central America and Africa. Conserving the trees and their environment is therefore essential. Sustainable farming practices, like soil management – including soil testing and organic composting – should be implemented to maintain the proper nutrient profile, which results in high-quality coconut water. The world's trendiest nut is under threat of species collapse Additionally, protecting freshwater aquifers from saltwater intrusion along coastlines where coconuts grow is crucial for preserving the quality of this refreshing fluid. Drip irrigation and mulching can help maintain soil moisture for the required coconut water production. Pest and disease management techniques (like intercropping coconuts with bananas or legumes), as well as integrated pest management, can contribute to healthy trees that produce large coconuts with ample water.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the planet gets hotter and freshwater sources dry up, cities and towns will not be able to continue the global norm of using millions of litres of clean, drinkable water to flush toilets. South Africa’s Water Research Commission recently commissioned a study into using seawater to flush toilets in Cape Town. Water engineering lecturer Teboho Mofokeng researches water management and reuse in South Africa and she co-authored the study. It is treated at wastewater plants to remove harmful germs before being pumped back into rivers. Read more: With engagement and education, reusing wastewater can become the norm The second problem is that in some Cape Town communities (as well as the coastal cities of Durban and Gqeberha in South Africa), wastewater is discharged into the sea with little treatment to remove harmful germs. The third problem is that as demand for housing grows, so does the need for water and sanitation. When more and more wastewater is discharged into the sea, it is a lost opportunity to keep the water within the urban water management system, and use it again. South Africa’s water supply network is ageing, has not been well maintained and is due for replacement or repairs. Toilet water could be treated to remove harmful bacteria and reused for flushing. This would need a closed water system for flushing toilets. How do people feel about using seawater instead? However, our study is the first to investigate how people feel about flushing with seawater. We also asked how they felt about toilet wastewater being discharged into the sea. Overall, 90% of people were willing to move away from using drinking water for toilet flushing, but only if the new water source did not stain the toilet bowl, was clear and had no smell. Read more: How to provide reliable water in a warming world – these cities are testing small-scale treatment systems and wastewater recycling However, there were differences in preference according to income, gender and household size. About 45% of the people we interviewed earned more than R12,800 (US$697) per month. But females with a higher education qualification were more likely to pay extra for both seawater and recycled water options. On average, 10%%-15% of Capetonians’ municipal bills goes to paying for water. They were also willing to use water with a slight odour if they got a discount of up to 60% on their monthly water bills. Treating wastewater before discharging it into the sea would cost money. We found that people were not willing to foot this bill. They were in favour of the city treating wastewater only if it reduced their water bill by up to 7%. Firstly, it would need a duplicate network to be set up. This would mean that both new and ageing water systems would be set up or replaced by systems with a duplicate pipe network. Usually water supply networks use concrete, steel or plastic pipes. Read more: A new strategy for drought-stressed cities: graywater recycling Since South Africa’s energy is still electricity made by burning coal, using up more energy in a duplicate water system would increase global warming significantly. So, a renewable energy system would need to be set up. Despite these drawbacks, a duplicate system has worked well in Hong Kong. Using less freshwater also benefits the environment more. Climate change will result in a drier south-western Africa. Unpredictable rainfall and frequent droughts will mean less freshwater available for people to drink. Therefore, it is crucial that coastal cities like Cape Town, whose populations are growing, start investing now in water supplies from unconventional sources. Increasing public awareness and education about the benefits of using alternative water can help people to accept that they won’t be able to flush their toilets with clean, drinkable water for much longer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is common for nations to have myths, or narratives, that form the basis of their nationalism, or their ideas of themselves as a political community. Such popular narratives are often rooted in a romanticised or idealised view of the past. The idea of urban modernity has its roots in colonial times. At the time of independence in 1980, following a liberation war from 1965 to 1979, Zimbabwe’s economy was looking strong. Urban residents, especially, could think of themselves as modern: they had middle- and working-class lifestyles, social protection, social mobility opportunities and fixed working hours. Zimbabwe’s economy was exceptional in sub-Saharan Africa: diversified and robust. However, rapid socio-economic changes followed in the 1990s and 2000s. Zimbabwe was hit by a series of economic, financial and political crises. By 2004, over 80% of people had informal livelihoods in Zimbabwe. My PhD thesis (2021) examined Harare’s shift to informality and the impact of this on people’s everyday experiences of citizenship. The respondents in interviews carried out between 2016 and 2018 included vendors, cross-border traders, manufacturers, residents’ associations, informal sector organisations, local authorities and urban planners. These interviews also form the basis of my recent research paper. My analysis sought to examine how people deal with the fact that current circumstances don’t support their myths of urban nationalism. During a crisis, people rethink old ideas and adjust them to fit their new situation. As they do this, their notions of urban modernity and economic exceptionalism change. At the same time, they remember a past when their country was economically successful. This memory shapes how they think about the country’s future - and it also makes them question the government, which hasn’t lived up to those past ideals. So, what do the myths of urban modernity and economic exceptionalism mean in Zimbabwe today? But there are others who challenge altogether the view that street vending is not modern and formal enough. The prevalent informality was seen as a temporary phenomenon which would end soon. Then the country would return to having a modern urban lifestyle and strong economy. Read more: How informal sector organisations in Zimbabwe shape notions of citizenship Some respondents drew a line between economic activities that were acceptable in the city centre and those that were not. They suggested, for example, that street vending had no place in the city centre. They dressed smartly to emphasise that street vending could also be done in a “modern” way and be a part of the mainstream economy. The same with economic and social activities it deemed undesirable. Today, over 32% of Zimbabweans live in urban areas. Read more: Education in Zimbabwe has lost its value: study asks young people how they feel about that Everyone was free to enter and use the urban space. It effectively punished all those considered “unproductive” and not deserving to be in the city. Those high and, frankly, brutal standards of urban modernity have a long history in Zimbabwe and became a part of its urban nationalism. Despite the economic decline, it is still a common narrative that Zimbabwe’s industrial sector was second only to South Africa’s in sub-Saharan Africa and that Zimbabwe was “the breadbasket” of Africa. However, manufacturing in colonial Zimbabwe benefited a small number of white industrialists. They could not own profitable manufacturing businesses or access finance. The early postcolonial ideas about urban modernity and economic exceptionalism were severely undermined in Zimbabwe. There is ongoing reluctance to accept that informality altered Zimbabwe for good. And many of my respondents wanted to find ways that the myths of modernity and economic exceptionalism could keep their meaning in the changed circumstances. In this case, it is about legitimacy of informal economic practices and legitimacy of the government that did not uphold the myths. Ideas can be very powerful in explaining people’s understanding of the political community they belong to. And when such ideals cannot be upheld, people will find new meanings in their material reality that let them hold on to old ideas or reinterpret them.</p>

A gigantic iceberg that broke off of an Antarctic glacier has revealed a thriving never-before-seen ecosystem in the depths beneath. Just 12 days later, they arrived to find a never-before-seen ecosystem filled with giant sponges, fish, enormous sea spiders and octopuses exposed to the open air for the first time. "We seized upon the moment, changed our expedition plan, and went for it so we could look at what was happening in the depths below," expedition co-chief scientist Patricia Esquete , a marine biologist at the University of Aveiro in Portugal, said in a statement . "We didn't expect to find such a beautiful, thriving ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After climbing for decades, the percentage of Americans with no religion has leveled off. For the past few years, the share of adults who identify as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” has stood at about 29%, according to a major study the Pew Research Center released Feb. 26, 2025. But this hardly means that the “nones,” or their impact on American life, are going away. It will presumably come as no surprise that many secular voters lean to the political left. It may, however, be surprising to learn that a fairly large number of nonreligious voters supported President Donald Trump in the 2020 and 2024 elections. If the above paragraph is a head-scratcher, that is because “nonreligious” and “secular” are often treated as two ways of saying the same thing. But as political scientists who study religion – and the lack thereof – we have found that there is a fundamental difference between the two. While conventional wisdom holds that religious voters are Republicans and nonreligious voters are Democrats, the reality is more complicated. In our surveys, many people without a religious affiliation do not cite any particular worldview or philosophy when asked what guides their life. Secular people, on the other hand, define themselves by what they are: someone who has embraced a humanistic and even scientific worldview. That is, when asked about where they find truth, they turn to sources such as science and philosophy instead of scripture and religious teachings. Often, they identify as atheist, agnostic or humanist. There are secular people, however, who also embrace some aspects of faith. Religiosity and secularity are not in a zero-sum relationship: more of one does not necessarily mean less of the other. In our research, we found many cases of people who belong to a religious congregation yet have a secular worldview: This describes many Jews, mainline Protestants and even Catholics, for example. To get a better sense of Americans’ views, for over a decade we have worked on developing questions to identify people with a secular outlook, while also asking about religious commitment, such as how often someone attends services. The Religionists category includes people of all faiths. Another 14% of Americans are what we call Religious Secularists: people who identify with and participate in a religious community, yet have a secular worldview. Some Religious Secularists may describe themselves as agnostic or even atheist. Finally, 18% of Americans are Nonreligionists: These are people we described above as not having any religion in their lives, but neither do they have a secular worldview. In 2021, we conducted a second wave of that survey. According to data from that survey that we analyzed for this article, Religionists and Secularists are about equally likely to get involved in politics: roughly 30% of both groups reported doing something political in the past 12 months, such as attending a rally, volunteering for a candidate or donating money. In fact, no matter the form of civic engagement – voting, volunteering – Nonreligionists were consistently the least likely to be involved. It would be wrong, however, to call the Nonreligionists an ideologically conservative group. For three of the groups, support for Sanders was the mirror opposite of their feelings toward Trump, a Republican. Secularists, for instance, gave the Vermont senator a relatively high score of 66, on average; Religionists’ feelings toward him are much cooler, at 32 points. By contrast, Nonreligionists gave a nearly identical rating to Trump and Sanders. We suspect it is because both figures challenge the status quo. In 2024, the Trump campaign worked to mobilize “low-propensity voters”: political jargon for people with the low levels of civic engagement often found among Nonreligionists. Not only are they politically disengaged, they are the most likely to combine being young, male, white and without a college degree. But in other ways they are very different from Nonreligionists. Typically, they are also liberal and highly engaged in politics. The answer may depend on whether Secularists cohere into a movement – a secular left to parallel the religious right. A generation ago, however, they were a disparate group of people from different Christian denominations, from Baptists to Pentecostals. Many of the religious groups that now march in common cause once had sharp disagreements. It remains to be seen whether secular voters will organize in a similar way. Either way, it is safe to say America’s religious composition has changed significantly. We’d caution that the story is more complicated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Conversation U.S. asked Tracy Roof, a political scientist who has researched the history of government nutrition programs, to explain what’s going on and why the effort to reduce spending on SNAP benefits, which can be used to purchase groceries, could falter. Why does it look like the federal government may cut SNAP spending? Federal spending on SNAP, however, has been falling since it peaked at $119 billion in 2022, before extra pandemic-related benefits ended. Some Republican lawmakers are calling for new changes that would cut spending on the program. Today, SNAP helps nearly 42 million people put food on the table, including 1 in 5 children. Americans can usually qualify for SNAP benefits if their income is under 130% of the federal poverty line. In 2025, that would be $41,795 for a family of four and they have limited savings. Most adults under the age of 60 are subject to work requirements if they are “able-bodied” and not caring for a child or incapacitated adult. If adults between the ages of 18 and 54 don’t log at least 20 hours of work or another approved activity, their benefits can be cut off. Immigrants without authorization to reside in the U.S. aren’t eligible for SNAP. Despite those restrictions on who can get SNAP benefits, there is no set limit to what the federal government can spend on the program. As more people become eligible due to their low incomes and therefore obtain benefits during economic downturns, this spending automatically increases. States administer the program under federal government guidelines. How can the federal government try to cut SNAP spending? There are two main paths to program cuts. One is through the farm bill, a legislative package Congress typically renews every four or five years that sets policies for SNAP and programs that support farmers’ incomes. Congress has passed multiple one-year extensions on the measure because lawmakers have been unable to pass a new one. Right now, the primary Republican plan calls for extending $4.5 trillion in tax cuts passed in the first Trump administration and making up to $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. This plan requires the House Agriculture Committee to cut $230 billion in spending over 10 years. Most Republicans appear to favor changing how benefits are calculated and imposing stricter work requirements. A family of four, for example, can get benefits of up to $939 a month if they have no income. This would cut current benefits and save $274 billion over a decade. One hitch is that House Agriculture Committee Chair G.T. Thompson has promised no cuts to monthly SNAP benefits. Many Republicans would like to stiffen the work requirements by requiring work of recipients who are up to age 65 or are the parents of children who are more than six years old. They also could limit the ability of states to make exceptions in places that don’t have enough jobs. Other proposals would crack down on fraud and benefit overpayments. How popular do you think these changes would be? The food insecurity rate, which reflects the number of people who worry about getting enough to eat or who report skipping meals or buying less nutritious food because of costs, has been high in recent years. Polls show most Americans support increasing SNAP benefits, not cutting them. Angry constituents have recently turned out to protest potential benefit cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP at town hall meetings held by members of Congress. Food banks, already struggling to meet demand and facing federal spending cuts, have warned they will not be able to fill gaps caused by reduced SNAP spending or new limits on benefits. Republicans have a very small majority in the House and they would need almost every vote. There are seven House Republicans from areas where over 20% of all residents get SNAP benefits, making it hard for them to vote for changes that would reduce or restrict the program’s scale. Other House Republicans, especially those expressing concerns about the national debt, are likely to insist that this spending be cut. It is unclear who will win this tug-of-war. If substantial SNAP cuts are made in the current budget process, it could make reaching a compromise on a new farm bill even harder than it’s been in recent years. And while the budget can be passed without any votes from Democrats in Congress, the farm bill will require some bipartisan support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Are you prepared for when the power goes out? To prevent massive wildfires in drought-prone, high-wind areas, electrical companies have begun preemptively shutting off electricity. These planned shutdowns are called public safety power shutoffs, abbreviated to PSPS, and they’re increasingly common. So far this year, we’ve seen them in Texas, New Mexico and California. Unlike regular power failures, which on average last only about two hours while a piece of broken equipment is repaired, a PSPS lasts until weather conditions improve, which could be days. I am a business school professor who studies how people pay for things, including during emergencies. As I point out in my new book “The Power of Cash: Why Using Paper Money is Good for You and Society,” many people have abandoned paper money and switched to electronic payments such as credit cards and mobile apps. This can become a big problem during an emergency, since these systems need electricity to operate. So if a public safety power shutoff strikes and you don’t have any cash, you may be doubly vulnerable. Why do they keep turning off the power, anyway? The world has experienced a number of very destructive wildfires recently. In 2025, large parts of Los Angeles burned to the ground, with over 18,000 buildings destroyed or damaged. Massive wildfires have also occurred recently in South Korea, Portugal and Australia. Governments, people whose houses burned and insurance companies are all looking for someone to blame and pay for the damage. Climate change, which is increasing the world’s average temperatures and drying out trees and grass, is setting the conditions. Since Mother Nature cannot be sued, utilities make handy scapegoats with deep pockets. Electrical utilities are sued because their power lines, transformers and other equipment often start blazes. So to prevent lawsuits as well as fires, power companies are increasingly turning off the power when the conditions are ripe for a catastrophic blaze. There’s no uniform set of standards for when to impose a shutdown, but in general, power companies do it when there are hot, dry and windy conditions. For example, a PSPS is triggered in Hawaii if there’s a drought, wind gusts are over 45 miles per hour and relative humidity is under 45%. Since then, power companies across the entire western U.S. from Texas to Hawaii have adopted these plans. Shutoff plans also stretch from southern border states such as Arizona to northern border states such as Idaho and Montana. Shutting off the power is a huge problem, since it causes massive disruption to communities. People depend on power to run medical equipment, work and keep communities safe. Even people with a desperate need for electricity, such as those on medical life support, are not immune to a safety shutoff. Having solar panels won’t protect you: Utilities shut off customers with solar panels to block those panels from pushing power onto the grid, since the whole goal is to shut off the grid. The only way for you to still have power is to buy a battery storage system and a transfer switch, which allows you to take your system completely off the grid. Plus, generators run very hot, which creates its own fire risk. It’s also important to use paper money before a shutoff happens. I have all too frequently seen gas station attendants, supermarket checkout clerks and restaurant servers have no idea how to handle cash. Recently at my local supermarket, for example, I paid with a $20 bill. As the world warms, public safety power shutoffs will occur more frequently. These shutoffs show there are no easy solutions – only hard choices. One is to understand that during one of the very moments you might really need to spend money, modern payment systems fail.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Or else, they are swatted away as too complex to implement, legally and practically. These efforts show how working locally to grapple with the complexity of land-based reparations is a necessary and feasible part of the nation’s healing process. Evanston, Illinois, launched the country’s first publicly funded housing reparations program in 2019. In its current form, Evanston’s Restorative Housing Program has provided disbursements to more than 200 recipients. The goal is to redress the harm Evanston caused during these 50-plus years of racial discrimination in public schools, hospitals, buses and segregated residential zoning. “I always said you can keep the mule,” program beneficiary Ron Butler told NBC News in 2024. Reparations that focus on land, housing and property are about more than making amends for centuries of racial discrimination. They help to restore people’s self-determination, autonomy and freedom. Following Evanston’s lead, in 2021 a group of 11 U.S. mayors created Mayors Organized for Reparations and Equity, a coalition committed to developing pilot reparations programs. The cities act as sites to generate ideas about how reparation initiatives could be scaled up nationally. Each mayor is advised by committees made up of representatives from local Black-led organizations. Indigenous people often call this process rematriation; it’s part of a broader effort to restore sovereignty and sacred relationships to their ancestral lands. In 2019, after years of petitioning by members of the Wiyot people, the Eureka City Council returned 200 acres of Tuluwat Island, a 280-acre island in Humboldt Bay where European settlers in 1860 massacred about 200 Wiyot women and children. Minneapolis’ sale of city lots to the Red Lake Nation for $1 in 2023 is another example of how city governments can make amends for past Indigenous displacement and removal. Plans to develop the low-cost lots include a cultural center for Red Lake people, an opioid treatment center and potentially housing. These initiatives may sound like a drop in the bucket considering the vast harms committed over centuries of slavery and colonization. They also tackle a frequent critique of reparations, which is that slavery and colonialism happened centuries ago. Yet their effects continue to harm Black and Native communities generations later. One explanation for this racial disparity is that Black households earn 20% less than their white counterparts. But a more meaningful driver is what scholars call the “intergenerational transmission chain” – that is, the role that gifts and inheritance play in wealth generation. That’s why reparations – with both land and money – are so critical to creating racial equity. Still, reparations programs do raise a host of complex, practical questions. Reparations don’t have to come from the government. In recent years, more than a hundred community-based organizations across the U.S. have introduced their own initiatives to redistribute land and wealth to make amends for past injustices. Makoce Ikikcupi, in the Minnesota River Valley, is a community reparations program led by Dakota peoples. One revenue source is voluntary contributions from descendants of Europeans who colonized that land. The group purchased its first 21-acre parcel of land in 2019, where it is building traditional earth lodges, with plans for several self-sustaining Dakota villages. Many communities are also working together to repair the legacies of anti-Black racism. Paying below market value, it demolished an entire Black neighborhood called Linnentown. In early 2021, following petitioning from former Linnentown residents who’d lost their homes, the City Council unanimously passed a resolution recognizing their neighborhood’s destruction as “an act of institutionalized white racism and terrorism resulting in intergenerational Black poverty.” The result is Athens Reparations Action, a coalition of churches and community organizations. Formed in 2021, it had raised $120,000 by 2024 to distribute among the 10 families who are Linnentown survivors and descendants. Our research also tracks legal challenges to the reparations initiatives we are studying. Conservative groups such as Judicial Watch have filed dozens of retaliatory lawsuits against several of them, including Evanston’s Restorative Housing Program. These legal challenges are part of the broader front of conservative-led assaults on voting rights, affirmative action and critical race theory. Attacking those initiatives is an attempt to preserve what scholar Laura Pulido calls “white innocence.” We expect more of them under a second Trump term already defined by its assault on antidiscrimination policies and programs. So far, none of Trump’s decrees has targeted reparations specifically.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since recreational cannabis was legalized across Canada in 2018, researchers have been studying what that decision changed for Canadians. We’ve learned, for example, that some patients immediately left the medical cannabis system, presumably to use recreational products instead. Conversely, legalization appeared to have no effect on Canadian alcohol sales. We’ve similarly seen how cannabis retailing has evolved since it became legal. Retailers suffered from product shortages during legalization’s first six months, but steadily expanded soon after. Québec still has 10 times fewer stores per capita than Ontario does as a result. Other provinces have set minimum prices to discourage people from overindulging. For example, Ontario won’t let wholesale prices drop below $2.28 per gram. I wanted to understand what effect retail expansion had on cannabis use. My analysis suggests this was related to the increasing affordability of cannabis, not its retail convenience. Cannabis use among Canadians aged 25 and over crept upward from 21 to 23 per cent. That increase again seemed related to falling prices rather than expanding stores. Meanwhile, usage among those aged 16 to 24 varied year-to-year, but remained around 46 per cent. This finding also seemed correlated with both falling prices and expanding stores. One thing that didn’t change much was frequency of use. About one-quarter of cannabis consumers used it five or more days per week in both 2019 and 2023. Both changes seemed related to prices rather than the number of retail stores. Consumers seemingly traded-up from basic dried cannabis to processed edibles as prices fell. So overall, Canada’s substantial retail developments came with only modest usage growth. Product selection and quality also improved, so they likely contributed too. But falling prices do seem to be a plausible explanation for the increased cannabis consumption that was seen. The lack of relationship between stores and usage might seem surprising. But this finding correlates with what my previous research found; it showed that between 2018 and 2020, there was a similar non-relationship between retail expansion of cannabis stores and usage. Read more: Cannabis store openings in Canada only slightly affected the number of users But this effect would have been too small to appear in province-level measurements. The findings from my study suggests some tentative lessons for regulators. If opening more stores has minimal impact on usage, there’s little need to limit their numbers. But since price declines tempt more consumers, it’s important for policymakers to prevent prices from getting too low. Other countries who are considering legalizing cannabis may want to consider these points, too. And Australia’s Green Party is campaigning for recreational legalization in the upcoming federal election. If that election produces a coalition government, legalization might be on its agenda. They could look at our policies and hopefully improve on them. Meanwhile in Germany, the previous government legalized recreational use, but not sales. So, Germans must grow their own plants or join a club that does. Commercial products are sold only through the country’s medical cannabis system. Based on what my research suggests, Germany will likely see similar usage growth, whether it allows stores or not. But allowing stores would mean consumers could buy products from licensed sources instead of illicit dealers. But some Canadians say it has become a memorable part of Justin Trudeau’s complicated legacy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When United States President Donald Trump first floated the idea of annexing Canada, many observers rolled their eyes. The common assumption was that this proposal, like much of Trump’s bombast, amounted to little more than a fleeting soundbite. Yet, amid continuing public remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state and suggestions of genuine intent, the idea has become part of a broader conversation about North America’s future. But any serious analysis of this proposition quickly reveals that annexation would be far more complicated — and far less one-sided — than the label “51st state.” As we argue in our newest self-published book Make America Greater? Based on population and the distribution of power in U.S. Congress, Canada’s 10 provinces and three northern territories would almost certainly be carved into multiple states, perhaps nine or more. America’s unique electoral arithmetic grants each state two senators, while seats in the House of Representatives depend on population size. Critically, the new country formed via unification might end up looking far more like Canada than many Americans imagine. Canadian voters lean more centrist — or even centre-left — than the average American does. Over time, that could tilt congressional priorities in favour of policies reflecting Canada’s taste for universal health care, stricter gun control and robust social welfare. Each new measure escalates anxieties, threatening to derail one of the world’s largest bilateral trading relationships. Some might argue that if tariffs are putting negative pressures on the economy and roiling the markets, perhaps deeper integration — or even full-blown unification — could serve as a release valve. But the path towards a friendly merger is best taken step-by-step and starts with stronger economic integration, not alienation. Read more: Canada's response to Trump's tariffs was strategic, but there is room for improvement Forging a genuine union goes well beyond removing trade barriers. Canada and the U.S. differ on far more than just economics: from bilingualism laws to gun regulations, from health care to environmental policy, the two countries embody contrasting visions of how society should function. Canadians would expect to preserve elements of their social contract that many regard as superior to American norms — particularly their single-payer health-care system and comparatively strict firearms restrictions. A process genuinely aimed at integrating the two countries would take this into account. Even if the American Electoral College were reimagined — or scrapped — Canadian provinces transformed into states would wield significant power, influencing everything from budget allocations to Supreme Court appointments. Read more: As Joe Biden becomes president, here's an easy proposal for Electoral College reform Younger Americans show a growing appetite for social safety nets, while Canadians remain broadly wedded to their publicly funded health-care model. Over a few election cycles, these forces could converge into a more expansive welfare regime, something that would astonish traditional conservatives across the current 50 states. A combined North America would boast one of the largest economies on Earth, including abundant natural resources and technological innovation. Constitutional arrangements, Indigenous rights, linguistic protections and environmental regulations — all areas in which Canadian norms diverge significantly from American precedents — would have to be reconciled. Canadians, proud of their universal healthcare, progressive climate policies and lower rates of gun violence, would worry about being subsumed by a more rambunctious, militarized neighbour. Americans, meanwhile, would fear they would be forced to adopt new taxes and policies at odds with their historic emphasis on individual freedoms. It reminds us that North America’s two largest nations remain economically interlocked and geographically co-located, though culturally distinct. With tariffs in place and cross-border tensions mounting, creative solutions are worth examining, even if a merger can — at best — be seen as a long-term vision.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI models struggle to form analogies when considering complex subjects, like humans can, meaning their use in real-world decision making could be risky. We know that artificial intelligence (AI) can't think the same way as a person, but new research has revealed how this difference might affect AI's decision-making, leading to real-world ramifications humans might be unprepared for. The study, published Feb. 2025 in the journal Transactions on Machine Learning Research , examined how well large language models (LLMs) can form analogies. They found that in both simple letter-string analogies and digital matrix problems — where the task was to complete a matrix by identifying the missing digit — humans performed well but AI performance declined sharply. Altogether, the study concluded that AI models lack “zero-shot” learning abilities, where a learner observes samples from classes that weren't present during training and makes predictions about the class they belong to according to the question.

Why it matters that AI can't think like humans Most AI applications rely to some extent on volume — the more training data is available, the more patterns are identified. But Lewis stressed pattern-matching and abstraction aren't the same thing. To give a sense of the implications, AI is increasingly used in the legal sphere for research, case law analysis and sentencing recommendations. Given this lack of robustness might affect real-world outcomes, the study pointed out that this served as evidence that we need to carefully evaluate AI systems not just for accuracy but also for robustness in their cognitive capabilities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There’s a newfound mismatch between matter and antimatter. And that could bring physicists one step closer to understanding how everything in the universe came to be. For the most part, particles and their oppositely charged antiparticles are like perfect mirror images of one another. But some particles disobey this symmetry, a phenomenon known as charge-parity, or CP, violation. Now, researchers at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva have spotted CP violation in a class of particles called baryons, where it’s never been confirmed before. Sign up for our newsletter We summarize the week's science breakthroughs every Thursday. The most famous examples of baryons are protons and neutrons. This difference indicates CP violation, the researchers report in a paper submitted March 21 to arXiv.org and in a March 25 talk at the Rencontres de Moriond meeting in La Thuile, Italy. A better understanding of CP violation could help explain how matter came to dominate over antimatter. CP violation is thought to have given matter the upper hand. But known processes don’t violate CP enough to account for the matter-antimatter imbalance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some fungi, including Candida auris, have developed resistance to some highly effective antifungal drugs which have been in use for decades. So scientists have been searching for new drugs to keep fungi in check. Mandimycin killed fungal infections in mice more effectively than amphotericin B and several other commonly used antifungal drugs. Sign up for our newsletter We summarize the week's science breakthroughs every Thursday. “There’s been this war raging for 2 billion years,” he says. In one such mission, Zongqiang Wang of China Pharmaceutical University in Nanjing and colleagues combed more than 300,000 bacterial genomes looking for possible weapons against fungi. The antifungal has a backbone structure similar to some other antifungal drugs but has two sugar molecules tacked onto its tail. Some existing antifungal drugs like amphotericin B clump together to form large spongelike structures on fungi’s cell membranes, Burke and colleagues previously found. Ergosterol helps maintain fungal membranes’ stability, crucial for protecting a cell’s inner workings. Extracting this membrane component eventually kills the fungus. Though it’s good at killing fungi, amphotericin B has drawbacks. Mandimycin may also be a sponge, Burke and Arun Maji of the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy in Lexington speculate in a commentary also published March 19 in Nature, but it sops up different membrane components. While intact mandimycin proved to be a potent fungi killer, it was far less toxic to mice’s kidneys and to human kidney cells grown in lab dishes than amphotericin B. Bacteria escaped mandimycin unscathed. The ability to destroy fungi but not harm human and bacterial cells has Burke puzzled. “This is the wild part about mandimycin that I don’t understand,” he says. Only fungi have ergosterol in their membranes, so other cells aren’t harmed by drugs that soak it up. But fungi, bacteria and mammals all have phospholipids, which means pulling those out of membranes should be damaging across the board, including to the mandimycin-making bacteria. Wang and colleagues suggest that mandimycin’s attacks might be specific to phospholipids found in fungi, but not in other types of cells. That is just one of the mysteries researchers will need to solve before mandimycin can be tested in people, Burke says. “It’s one of those exciting papers that opens a lot of doors, [and] pretty much behind every one is another question.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But what are the implications of this for Yemen? Yemeni civilians are caught in an impossible position. They have suffered from years of ruthless violence in a civil war that began with the Houthi capture of the capital, Sana'a, in 2014. Each of these have caused further civilian casualties and harm. Vice President JD Vance (14 March, 08:16am ET): The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth (14 March, 08:27am ET): This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But a more substantial intervention — one that combines a coalition of local forces with guaranteed air support from Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates (with US support) — would pose a far greater threat to the Houthis. With this apparently not being considered, the Houthis may now feel emboldened to press-gang more people into military service before a fresh assault on the strategically important oil fields in Marib. This is the last major city in northern Yemen still under government control. The Houthis have tried to take Marib before, but were prevented by Yemeni troops supported by Saudi air cover. While the Trump administration claims the chat did not compromise sources and methods, Goldberg noted a US-based intelligence officer was named. The Atlantic removed their name for security reasons. The publication’s decision to remove this detail is a stark reminder of whose security matters — and whose doesn’t. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz (15 March, 13:48pm ET): VP. Had multiple positive ID… Waltz (15 March, 14.00pm ET): Typing too fast. The first target – their top missile guy – we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed. Putting aside the fact this was a residential building — it should not be an aside, but this is how most news coverage has been treating it — this detail is important to the Houthis. This is because Waltz confirms “multiple” sources had positively identified a target, which the Houthis may use to justify further crackdowns, forced disappearances and even executions of those they accuse of being spies. The Trump administration was clearly reckless in divulging this detail. Experts on the Houthis – and their methods of subjugation – could have quickly highlighted this point if they were consulted. From a Yemeni perspective, a named source may have even been preferable to the hazy, but authoritative, confirmation of US operational methods and sources. These are typically aid workers, academics, minorities, journalists and members of civil society who are not vocally aligned with the group. These abductions have been occurring for years, but ramped up in the middle of 2024. This has helped the Houthis consolidate their control over the flow of humanitarian assistance (particularly food), which they divert based on political, rather than needs-based, calculations as a means of coercing compliance. Yemeni civilians are seldom, if ever, a consideration in the geopolitical machinations that concern their country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff last week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica. Sign up for ProPublica’s The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines: “People should consult with their health care provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.” ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. One campaign was called “Get My Flu Shot.” The agency’s website told medical providers they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’” Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and last Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal health care decisions.” Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.” The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.” In late February, for example, forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1 bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. Last week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.” The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously. During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump. As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles. Still, the CDC added an entry on Vitamin A to its measles website for clinicians. Some at the CDC felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced. Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20 percent of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. The virus can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it. Last week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease in March when a passenger with measles rode one of its trains from New York City to Washington, D.C.
