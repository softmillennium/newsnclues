The study also found that some types of heart disease are more sensitive to heatwaves than others and that different types of heatwaves may impact heart health in distinct, nonlinear ways.

The research highlights the special risks of compound heatwaves and potential nonlinear relationships between different heatwave types and cardiac mortality. It finds that previous studies using traditional binary definitions-without accounting for different types of heatwaves and their cumulative heat load-may have underestimated this risk by as much as 54%. The findings could help improve clinical guidelines for cardiovascular patients and could also be used to improve public health adaptations to climate change, researchers said.

Compound heatwaves impose a significantly higher risk to cardiac health than either daytime-only or nighttime-only heatwaves. Traditional heatwave definitions fail to capture the full scope of these risks."" Renjie Chen, PhD, coauthor of Fudan University

Previous research has found a link between short-term exposure to heatwaves and an increase in heart disease mortality using conventional binary definitions, but the shape of the risk curve and the role of different heatwave patterns were not well understood.

For the new study, researchers analyzed data for nearly 2.4 million heart disease deaths across mainland China over six years. They compared deaths across daytime-only, nighttime-only, and day-night compound heatwaves and introduced a new metric for measuring heatwave impact called Excess Cumulative Temperatures in Heatwaves, or ECT-HW.

""Unlike traditional binary indicators, ECT-HW captures the full spectrum of heatwave characteristics, including intensity, duration and timing within the season,"" Chen explained. This provides more precise risk assessment, especially for high-intensity, high-duration and compound heatwaves.

Researchers found that the mortality risk associated with compound heatwaves increased steadily with exposure, without a clear threshold. Daytime-only and nighttime-only heatwaves displayed nonlinear patterns, with effects emerging only beyond specific thresholds and plateauing at moderate intensities.

They also found that risk was not equal across different heart disease subtypes. Sudden cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction and heart failure were especially sensitive to compound heatwaves, while pulmonary heart disease only showed elevated risk under high-intensity exposures.

Conventional studies of heatwave deaths that look only at whether a heatwave is present or not significantly underestimate mortality risks, they said.

The findings have several clinical and public health implications, Chen said.

Since different types of heatwaves affect cardiac conditions differently, prevention measures should consider heatwave type and intensity. In addition, given their higher impact, compound heatwaves should be explicitly considered in risk assessment and early warning systems for cardiovascular patients.

The findings also highlight the importance of urban heat mitigation strategies, such as cooling shelters and improved housing infrastructure to protect vulnerable populations.

""As climate change accelerates, the shifting and emerging heatwave exposure pattern demands better metrics and targeted interventions,"" Chen said. ""Given the increasing frequency and intensity of compound heatwaves due to climate change, our findings highlight the need for disease-specific prevention strategies and revised public health guidelines to better protect at-risk populations.""

Next, the team is planning follow-up research, including studies to project the future burden of heatwave-related cardiac mortality under different climate change scenarios.",news-medical

By analyzing the environmental conditions in the clinics' laboratories using AI, researchers at Malmö University believe they can improve the chances of a successful outcome.

There are many factors that can influence a successful IVF treatment. Not only the biological and medical conditions, but also factors in the actual lab environment, so-called external factors. These can include temperature, air pressure, humidity, microparticles.



""Ideally, the laboratory should be completely closed, but as the sample will need to be taken in and out of the incubator during the treatment, this is not practical. The fertilisation and embryo development in the laboratory lasts for a full six days; however, the whole IVF cycle lasts around 6-8 weeks), so a lot can affect the outcome during that time,"" says researcher Reza Khoshkangini, who is leading the project.



Through collaboration with industry, the research team has developed advanced sensors for data collection. These measuring instruments are installed at the reproduction centre, continuously monitoring environmental factors at ten-minute intervals. In addition, high-resolution images captured during embryo development provide valuable data for AI-driven analysis, enhancing the potential for improved IVF success rates.



""What we hope AI can do is find a link, a repeating pattern, between variations in environmental conditions and what happens in the sample. If we can understand the effect of the lab environment in a negative way, we can adjust and optimise the labs accordingly,"" says Khoshkangini, who continues:



""Through AI, and in this case through machine learning, we can use the data collected to predict a future outcome; simply put, which circumstances will produce a qualitative outcome.""



In addition to the clinic in Malmö, Khoshkangini and his research team hope to initiate collaborations with clinics outside Europe to see how much the local climate and environment affect the outcome. According to Khoshkangin, not having a baby affects not only the parents, but society. Improving IVF outcomes offers a significant opportunity to address critical global issues related to fertility, family planning, mental health, and socio-economic equality.",news-medical

Previous research has mostly focused on non-pregnant adults affected by Long COVID- a condition lasting for months after a person recovers from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The study, published April 1 in Nature Communications, helps fill a critical gap about Long COVID in women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. ""This population is so important and vulnerable, but we had no evidence about their Long COVID risk to guide their care,"" said Dr. Chengxi Zang, an instructor in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, who co-led the research. ""We hope this new data will help clinicians develop better Long COVID prevention and treatment strategies for pregnant women and help those most at risk.""

Digging into data

The researchers tapped into real-world data collected in two large electronic health record-based studies, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), under the National Institutes of Health RECOVER initiative. They analyzed data on approximately 72,000 women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy between March 2020 and June 2023 and about 208,000 age and demographically matched controls who were not pregnant but developed the infection during this period. They looked for signs of Long COVID 180 days after the women recovered from infections.

The team found that the rates of long-term complications related to COVID-19 are lower among pregnant women than comparably matched women who were not pregnant during their infection. The findings were consistent across both large databases and held true even when the researchers used different methods to define Long COVID. This consistency adds confidence to the results.

In the PCORnet cohort, Dr. Zang and his colleagues found that about 16 out of 100 pregnant women developed Long COVID compared with about 19 out of 100 non-pregnant women. Long COVID is defined as having any of the following symptoms: cognitive problems, encephalopathy, sleep disorders, acute pharyngitis, shortness of breath, pulmonary fibrosis, chest pain, diabetes, edema, malnutrition, joint pain, fever, malaise and fatigue. Similar findings were replicated in the N3C cohort.

Though we observed that pregnant women have a significant risk of Long COVID, it was surprisingly lower than those who were not pregnant when they had SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, some subgroups seemed especially vulnerable."" Dr. Chengxi Zang

Groups at higher risk

Among the pregnant women, the researchers found that certain groups had higher Long COVID risks than others. For example, pregnant women who identified as Black, or were of advanced maternal age (age 35 or older at delivery), or had obesity or other metabolic conditions were more likely to develop Long COVID than pregnant women who weren't part of these groups. However, this risk was still lower than their matched non-pregnant controls.

""Further research on factors such as inequitable healthcare access, socioeconomic factors and structural racism may help us understand the elevated Long COVID risk in these groups and find ways to protect them,"" said Dr. Zang.

""We hypothesize that the altered immune and inflammatory environment lasting about six weeks after giving birth might contribute to lowering the risk of Long COVID,"" Dr. Zang said, ""The observed risk differences in this analysis suggest future dedicated studies of Long COVID in pregnant individuals are needed."" For instance, differences in COVID infection by trimester may be informative for patient counseling.

Dr. Zang and his colleagues at Weill Cornell Medicine are also using electronic health records to study how existing medications may be repurposed to protect pregnant women from Long COVID.

Over the next five years, each researcher will receive a total of $1 million in funding from the Association, a global force changing the future of health for all.

The American Heart Association's Merit Award is one of the most prestigious competitive research awards given by the Association, the largest non-government funder of cardiovascular research in the United States. The Merit Award supports scientists who have consistently performed highly promising, novel research with the potential to move cardiovascular science forward quickly, with high impact. The recipients of the 2025 award are:

Ann Marie Schmidt, M.D., the Dr. Iven Young Professor of Endocrinology in the Department of Medicine, the Holman Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism and a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and the Department of Pathology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City; and

Elizabeth (Liz) Selvin, Ph.D., M.P.H., FAHA, Director of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research and a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. She holds a joint appointment in the Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Each year, the American Heart Association recognizes recipients of the Merit Awards as investigators with established track records of success in major research challenges in the areas of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health. Their scientific exploration has the potential to produce unusually high impact toward the Association's mission to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives. Diabetes is one of the major controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and as prevalence of both conditions rise, it's become imperative that we learn all we can about the ways they're connected. This year's recipients are already renowned for their work in identifying the important connections between cardiovascular disease and diabetes and I'm excited to see where their future exploration will take us in learning how to better manage these chronic conditions that take the lives of too many people each year."" Keith Churchwell, M.D., FAHA, American Heart Association volunteer president, an associate clinical Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut and adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee

Schmidt's research will focus on the large white blood cells that are part of the body's immune system and are known to contribute to diabetic complications. Her research team will expand on their discovery of a protein molecule called the 'receptor for advanced glycation end products' (RAGE) that may be one of the ways that diabetic white blood cells damage the body. Studying diabetic and non-diabetic mouse and human white blood cells, the team will look for ways to disrupt this damaging molecular process and, in turn, potentially develop new treatment therapies.

""Diabetes damages the body head-to-toe and this happens slowly over many years. We know people with diabetes have more strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, blindness and kidney problems, yet the reasons for this connection are not fully known,"" Schmidt said. ""We surmise that learning how large white blood cells in diabetes cause damage will show us new ways to stop their bad actions and decrease harm to the body. As diabetes robs people of good health and years of life, our work may help to fulfill the American Heart Association mission to improve health, especially for people with diabetes.""

Selvin's research will focus on improving cardiovascular health in people with diabetes. Her seminal studies on the association between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes complications helped establish the scientific foundation and clinical criteria for using HbA1c to diagnose diabetes. This Merit Award will support new research focusing on wearable continuous glucose monitors and their association with cardiometabolic risk in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

""An important part of our work will be providing opportunities for trainees to engage in research with direct implications for policy and clinical practice,"" Selvin said. ""Helping to grow the next generation of scientists is critical to our ongoing work to save lives through improvements in the screening, diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.""

https://news-medical.net,Research highlights rising risk of human-to-human mpox transmission,https://news-medical.net/news/20250401/Research-highlights-rising-risk-of-human-to-human-mpox-transmission.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Mpox has the potential to become a significant global health threat if taken too lightly, according to scientists at the University of Surrey.

In a letter published in Nature Medicine, researchers highlight how mpox – traditionally spread from animals to humans – is now showing clear signs of sustained human-to-human transmission.

Mpox is a viral infection caused by a virus that belongs to the same family as smallpox. The virus can cause a painful rash, fever, and swollen glands and, in some cases, lead to more serious illness. Mpox usually spreads through close contact with an infected person or animal.

The most recent outbreaks show that intimate contact is now a significant way the virus spreads. That shift in how it's transmitted is leading to longer transmission chains and lasting outbreaks."" Carlos Maluquer de Motes, Reader in Molecular Virology, University of Surrey

The article notes that this change coincided with the rapid spread of clade IIb (a clade is a group of viruses that share a common ancestor) mpox viruses, but different clade I variants are now on the rise too. Researchers are also concerned because clade I viruses are thought to be more aggressive. These viruses appear to be accumulating specific genetic mutations – driven by enzymes in the human body – that may be changing viral properties, so the longer these viruses circulate amongst us, the higher the chances these mutations help mpox adapt to humans.

Although mpox was once mainly seen in Central Africa, the virus caused an outbreak worldwide in 2022 and is now causing outbreaks in multiple sub-Saharan countries. While it currently affects adults the most, the researchers stress that it has the potential to spread among other groups, including children, a group at greater risk of serious illness – although sustained transmission in children has not yet been reported.

Dr Maluquer de Motes added:

""Mpox control has to climb up the global health agenda. We have limited diagnostic tools and even fewer antiviral treatments. We urgently need better surveillance and local or regional capacity to produce what we need – otherwise, we are at risk of future epidemics.""

Unlike smallpox, mpox has an animal reservoir, meaning it can't be fully eradicated. The authors warn that unless international action is taken now – including investment in point-of-care testing and new treatments – mpox will continue to re-emerge and threaten global health.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Study links childhood air pollution exposure to weaker brain connections,https://news-medical.net/news/20250401/Study-links-childhood-air-pollution-exposure-to-weaker-brain-connections.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A new study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by the ""la Caixa"" Foundation, has found that children exposed to higher levels of air pollution in early and mid childhood have weaker connections between key brain regions. The findings, published in Environment International, highlight the potential impact of early exposure to air pollution on brain development.

The research showed reduced functional connectivity within and between certain cortical and subcortical brain networks. These networks are systems of interconnected brain structures that work together to perform different cognitive functions, such as thinking, perceiving and controlling movement. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that air pollution may be associated with changes in the functional connectivity of brain networks, particularly in children. However, it is not yet fully understood how air pollution affects the development and maturation of these brain networks.

The study analyzed data from 3,626 children from the Generation R cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Exposure to air pollution at the participants' residence, including particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ), was estimated using statistical models that combine actual measurements with environmental characteristics. Brain connectivity was then assessed both between and within networks, including 13 cortical networks and three subcortical regions: the amygdala - responsible for processing emotions and triggering survival responses -, the hippocampus - key for memory formation and spatial orientation -, and the caudate nucleus - involved in movement regulation, memory and decision-making.

The children were evaluated using resting state neuroimaging, meaning their brains were scanned while not performing any active task, at two time points: around the age of 10 and again at an average age of 14. Exposure to air pollution was analysed over two periods: from birth to three years of age and in the year before the neuroimaging assessment.

This is one of the first studies to explore how air pollution affects brain connections at rest, using brain scans taken multiple times in a large group of children from birth."" Michelle Kusters, ISGlobal researcher and first author of the study

Persistent associations during adolescence

The results show that greater exposure to air pollution from birth to three years old is associated with lower connectivity between the amygdala and the cortical networks involved in attention, somatomotor function - which coordinates body movements - and auditory function. Additionally, higher exposure to PM 10 particles in the year before the neuroimaging assessment was associated with lower functional connectivity between the salience and medial-parietal networks, which are responsible for detecting stimuli in the environment and for introspection and self-perception.

""These associations persist throughout adolescence, which may indicate persistent disruptions in the normal development of brain networks due to pollution exposure. This could affect emotional processing and cognitive functions,"" explains Mònica Guxens, ICREA researcher at ISGlobal and lead author of the study. ""However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand their exact impact on brain development,"" she adds.

Changes in brain volume

Another recent study by the same team examined the relationship between exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and childhood, and changes in brain volume through adolescence. The study was based on data from 4,243 children from the same Generation R cohort, who underwent repeated assessments of white matter, cortical grey matter, the cerebellum, and seven subcortical volumes.

The results revealed that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy, particularly to fine particles (PM2.5) and copper, was associated with a smaller volume of the hippocampus, a crucial brain structure for memory function, at age 8. However, as the children grew, ""compensatory growth"" in the hippocampus was observed, suggesting that brain plasticity, particularly in this area, may counteract some of the initial negative effects of pollution exposure. Despite the early effects on hippocampal volume, no significant associations were found between air pollution and other brain volumes, such as white matter, cortical grey matter, or the cerebellum.

Importance of policy changes

According to the research team, these findings together underscore the potential long-term impact of early-life air pollution exposure on brain connectivity and development. ""While some brain regions may exhibit compensatory growth, the persistent disruptions observed in functional networks highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms behind these changes. Given the widespread exposure to air pollution, these results reinforce the importance of policies aimed at reducing pollution levels, particularly in urban environments, to safeguard children's brain development,"" says Michelle Kusters.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,How PFAS Are Impacting Human Health,https://news-medical.net/health/How-PFAS-Are-Impacting-Human-Health.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 04:55:00 GMT","What are PFAS, and why are they a problem?

Human exposure pathways and health risks

Global regulations and industrial backlash

Innovations in PFAS removal and detection

Future perspectives and public health strategy

In many regions of the world, including developed nations, drinking water is contaminated with invisible chemicals linked to cancer, immune disorders, and developmental delays.

Across the globe, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — often called ‘forever chemicals’ due to their persistence in the environment — have seeped into drinking water, soil, and even the human bloodstream.

PFAS are synthetic chemicals that have been widely used since the mid-20th century. These chemicals were valued for their resistance to heat, water, and oil.

However, their persistence in the environment and bioaccumulation in living organisms have raised serious health concerns, with a growing body of research linking PFAS exposure to serious health concerns, including thyroid dysfunction, developmental issues, immunotoxicity, and cancer.1–4

This article explores pathways of human exposure to PFAS, current epidemiological findings, regulatory developments in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US), industrial accountability, ongoing lawsuits, remediation technologies, and emerging PFAS detection tools.

What are PFAS, and why are they a problem?

PFAS are a diverse group of synthetic compounds used in industrial applications and consumer products, such as firefighting foams, non-stick cookware, water-resistant textiles, and food packaging.

Their strong carbon-fluorine bonds make them highly resistant to environmental degradation, leading to widespread contamination of water supplies and ecosystems.1–3

The persistence of PFAS in terrestrial and aquatic environments has resulted in bioaccumulation in plants, animals, and humans, raising concerns about long-term exposure. Furthermore, PFAS come in thousands of distinct types, further complicating regulatory efforts and scientific research.1,2

Due to their stability and mobility, PFAS have been detected in some of the most remote regions, from Arctic ice to deep-sea environments, illustrating their global impact.

The challenge of addressing PFAS pollution is exacerbated by the fact that many industries continue to manufacture and use these substances despite growing evidence of their harm.3

Human exposure pathways and health risks

Humans are exposed to PFAS through contaminated drinking water, diet, household pollutants, consumer products, and occupational settings. Drinking water contamination is a significant concern, particularly in communities near industrial sites, military bases, and areas where PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been used.1

Studies have shown that even low-level PFAS exposure through drinking water can lead to significant health effects over time. Additionally, PFAS have been found in food packaging, where they can leach into food and increase dietary exposure.1,3

Substantial research has also linked exposure to PFAS to numerous diseases in humans. Epidemiological studies have found that PFAS exposure can increase the risk of kidney and testicular cancer.

The exact mechanisms are still being studied, but oxidative stress, immune suppression, and endocrine disruption are suspected contributors. Researchers have also found associations between PFAS exposure and pancreatic, breast, and liver cancers, indicating the need for further investigation.1,2,4

Additionally, PFAS exposure has also been associated with interference with thyroid hormone regulation, potentially leading to hypothyroidism and other endocrine disorders.

Disruption of thyroid function also affects metabolism, growth, and development. Some studies suggest that even low levels of PFAS can alter thyroid hormone levels, increasing the risk of metabolic disorders.1,2

Prenatal and early-life exposure to PFAS is also associated with low birth weight, developmental delays, immune dysfunction, and behavioral issues. Studies have shown that PFAS can cross the placenta and get transferred through breast milk, resulting in early-life exposure.

Research has also linked PFAS to decreased fertility, with evidence suggesting that they may disrupt hormone regulation critical for reproductive health.1–3

Moreover, PFAS exposure has been shown to weaken immune responses, reducing vaccine efficacy and increasing susceptibility to infections. Research indicates that PFAS may impair immune cell function and disrupt immune signaling pathways. A growing body of evidence suggests that children exposed to PFAS may have a reduced immune response to routine vaccinations.1,2,5

Among PFAS, long-chain PFAS, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), are more bioaccumulative and toxic due to their longer half-lives in the human body.

However, short-chain PFAS still pose environmental and health concerns, as they may have similar toxic effects. Some regulatory bodies are now calling for a ban on both long-chain and short-chain PFAS due to their persistent nature and potential for harm.1–3

Global regulations and industrial backlash

Recognizing the dangers of PFAS, governments worldwide have begun implementing numerous regulatory measures for the production and use of PFAS. The EU has restricted the use of PFOS since 2006 and continues to push for broader bans on PFAS substances.

A proposed PFAS restriction under the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals or REACH regulation is aimed at achieving one of the most comprehensive PFAS bans globally.1

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also issued health advisories and is moving toward enforceable limits for PFAS in drinking water. Some states have enacted stricter regulations than federal guidelines.

Moreover, litigation against PFAS manufacturers has resulted in multi-million-dollar settlements, with companies such as Dupont/Chemours and 3M being held accountable for environmental contamination.1,4,6

However, despite regulatory progress, enforcement remains challenging due to industry resistance, economic considerations, and scientific uncertainties. Internal documents from chemical manufacturers reveal that companies were aware of PFAS toxicity decades ago but withheld this information from the public, delaying regulatory action.4

Moreover, industrial stakeholders continue to challenge regulations, arguing that alternative materials may be costly and lack the same functional properties as PFAS.1,7

PFAS health effects and CDC guidelines on how to reduce PFAS exposure with Aaron Bernstein, MD, MPH Play

Innovations in PFAS removal and detection

The widespread contamination of the environment by PFAS and the growing evidence of its impact on human health has highlighted the necessity for effective remediation and detection technologies.

Remediation technologies for the removal of PFAS from contaminated water have evolved significantly in recent times. Traditional methods such as activated carbon filtration and ion exchange resins, which function on the principles of membrane filtration and adsorption, have been commonly used but have limitations in capturing smaller PFAS molecules.2

Researchers are now exploring metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are porous crystalline solids that have an ordered structure with extremely large internal surface areas, for selectively adsorbing PFAS from contaminated water.2

Emerging techniques in electrochemical and plasma-based degradation are also focusing on breaking down PFAS at the molecular level, offering potential solutions for the destruction of these compounds. These methods are promising but require further optimization for large-scale applications.2

However, new analytical advancements are also improving PFAS monitoring and risk assessment. Total fluorine measurements provide a more comprehensive picture of PFAS exposure by assessing overall fluorine content rather than focusing on individual compounds.3

Meanwhile, high-resolution mass spectrometry allows for suspect screening of PFAS precursors and previously unidentified organofluorine compounds, aiding regulatory efforts.

Additionally, portable testing kits are being developed to facilitate on-site PFAS detection, enabling communities to assess water quality in real-time.1

5 Biohacking Secrets to Help You Live Longer

Future perspectives and public health strategy

Addressing PFAS contamination requires a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach that incorporates scientific research, policy changes, and public engagement. Expanding research efforts is essential to fully understand PFAS toxicity, including cumulative exposure risks and interactions between different PFAS compounds.

Additionally, enhancing detection methods through globally standardized and accessible testing techniques will improve monitoring and regulatory enforcement.2

Stronger regulations are also needed to establish enforceable limits on PFAS in water, soil, and air while promoting safer industrial alternatives. At the same time, investment in advanced remediation technologies is crucial to mitigate contamination and prevent further environmental damage.1

Public awareness and advocacy play a key role in driving policy changes and ensuring industries remain accountable for their role in PFAS pollution. Since PFAS contamination is a global issue, international cooperation is necessary to standardize regulations, share scientific advancements, and develop sustainable solutions.

The urgency and seriousness of PFAS-related health risks underscores the need for coordinated efforts to limit exposure, enhance scientific understanding, and establish effective mitigation strategies.

Increased public pressure, legal actions, and regulatory momentum may pave the way for a future where PFAS pollution is effectively managed, safeguarding the health of both humans and ecosystems.

Among the many pump types available, piston pumps and peristaltic pumps are frequently compared due to their distinct operating mechanisms and suitability for different tasks.

Image Credit: Fluid Metering, Inc.

In this article, we’ll highlight the advantages of Fluid Metering’s valveless piston pumps over peristaltic pumps, focusing on their low maintenance requirements and exceptional repeatability—key factors that make them a preferred choice.

Precision and Accuracy

One of the most important benefits of Fluid Metering piston pumps is their precision. Known for their capacity to distribute fluids with great accuracy and consistency, their precision is especially critical in applications where even minor deviations in fluid administration can have serious repercussions, such as medical dosage or chemical processing.

On the other hand, the repeated squeezing and releasing of the peristaltic pump tubing diminishes its precision over time and increases pulsation, making it unsuitable for several applications.

High Pressure Capabilities

Fluid metering pumps can produce much higher pressures than peristaltic pumps. This makes them perfect for applications requiring high-pressure delivery, such as hydraulic systems and high-pressure cleaning.

Unlike piston pumps, which can handle these demanding jobs without compromising performance, peristaltic pump designs have a maximum flow rate limit.

Durability and Longevity

Fluid Metering's valveless piston pumps are more durable and have fewer moving parts than peristaltic pumps.

Fluid Metering piston pumps are often made of materials that can withstand harsh conditions and abrasive fluids, making them a dependable choice for long-term use in medical settings.

Due to the pressures and wear on peristaltic pump tubes, they often require replacement anywhere from a few hundred hours to several thousand hours of operation.

Versatility in Fluid Handling

Fluid Metering piston pumps can handle a variety of fluids, such as those with varying viscosities and abrasive particles. This versatility makes them suitable for diverse applications.

However, peristaltic pumps tend to struggle with highly viscous fluids or those containing solid particles, which limits their applicability.

Efficiency and Performance

Another strong reason to use piston pumps is their efficiency. These pumps are designed to reduce energy loss while increasing fluid delivery efficiency.

This not only reduces costs over time but also provides consistent performance even under changing operational conditions. Peristaltic pumps, while helpful in some situations, consume more energy and have lower efficiency due to friction between the tube and rollers.

Reduced Maintenance

Fluid metering piston pumps usually require less frequent maintenance than peristaltic pumps. The design of Fluid Metering piston pumps lowers wear and strain on components, resulting in fewer breakdowns and downtime.

In contrast, the repeated compression of tubing in peristaltic pumps (image below) can cause them to degrade with time, necessitating regular replacement and increasing maintenance requirements.

Conclusion

While both Fluid Metering valveless piston pumps and peristaltic pumps have their uses in fluid handling, the benefits of piston pumps make them the better choice for many demanding applications.

For more than 60 years, Fluid Metering engineers have designed and manufactured dependable, high-precision pumps. Their precision, high-pressure capabilities, durability, versatility, efficiency, and low maintenance requirements make them the ideal solution for industries that require dependable and consistent fluid delivery.

Fluid Metering’s experts can help you select a pump that meets your specific speed and pressure needs, ensuring reliable performance.

This article outlines the importance of selecting a pump that meets a specific application’s speed and pressure needs.

The Importance of Choosing a Pump Able to Accommodate High Speed and High Pressure

It is important to choose a pump that is able to administer the application’s required speed and flow rate. High speeds are also key to dispensing volumes at the microliter scale.

Fluid also has a tendency to adhere to dispense tips when dispensing over air, but a pump able to accommodate high speeds can help to shear fluid off the tip, enabling the release of smaller volumes of fluid over air.

However, higher speeds frequently cause pressure buildups within a system. It is important to work with a pump motor able to sufficiently manage each of these risk factors.

Pump speed and pressure are key performance characteristics considered in the majority of industries, including diagnostic, industrial, biomedical, and agricultural settings. Not employing the right type of pump will cause issues with any type of fluid being pumped at high speeds.

Risks of Pumps Unable to Accommodate High Speed and High Pressure

A pump’s motor, and therefore the pump itself, will stall out if it is unable to accommodate high speeds and pressure. A stalled-out pump will be unable to dispense any more fluid, resulting in lost productivity, unplanned downtime, and excessive maintenance costs.

Too much pressure may also result in fluid pumping backward within the pump, creating backflow. Too much pressure can also lead to incorrect dispensing volumes, which is an issue especially prevalent with viscous fluids.

Choosing and Maintaining a Pump Able to Accommodate High Speed and High Pressure

In any industry with any fluid being pumped, applications must find the right balance between speed and pressure. There are a number of key considerations when choosing the right pump for an application.

It is important to consider any restrictions that could impact pump performance; for example, elbow bends, tubing connectors and other system features can create extra pressure.

Motor type selection is also critical, and it is important to select a motor with enough torque to overcome any potential pressure restrictions in the system makeup.

Tubing sizes and seals must also be considered, with a range of different tubing sizes and seals available for pumps designed to accommodate high pressure and high speeds.

Fluid Metering offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions designed to ensure pump performance in line with end users’ expectations. There are a range of pump series available to manage high speeds and high flow, including:

If you're unsure which pump best fits your needs, reach out to the experts at Fluid Metering for a professional consultation. They can help you select the right pump to ensure optimal device performance and reliability.

Factors to Consider When Selecting Pump Speed and Pressure

Beyond speed and pressure, several other factors should be considered when selecting the right pump for your application.

Chemical compatibility is a key concern, especially with high-speed pump heads. The construction material must be suitable for the fluid being dispensed—some fluids, for example, may not be compatible with stainless steel.

Dispensing requirements also play a crucial role. As mentioned earlier, users handling small fluid volumes often require high-speed pumps to ensure precise dispensing and prevent fluid from adhering to the dispense tip.

Pump drive type is another important factor.

Pumps can be driven by various motors, such as stepper or DC motors, and not all motor types work for every application. If a particular motor isn’t compatible, a different pump assembly may be necessary. Understanding this before making a purchase is essential to ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.

It typically begins as noncancerous growths called polyps in the colon or rectum, which can become cancerous over time. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving survival rates.

Stages of colorectal cancer

Understanding the various stages of CRC is essential for identifying the most efficient treatment strategy.

Stage 0 colorectal cancer

At this earliest stage, abnormal cells are found only in the innermost lining of the colon or rectum and have not spread to surrounding tissues. This stage is also referred to as carcinoma in situ.

Stage 1 colorectal cancer

At this stage, cancer has spread into the deeper layers of the colon or rectum but has not reached the lymph nodes.1 Around 34.8 % of CRCs are identified at this localized stage, with a 5-year relative survival rate of 91.1 %.2

Stage 2 (A-C) colorectal cancer

Cancer has spread through the wall of the colon or rectum but has not reached the surrounding lymph nodes. Approximately 75 % of individuals with stage II A colon cancer will be cancer-free five years post-treatment without additional chemotherapy. However, 25 % will experience recurrence.3

Stage 3 (A-C) colorectal cancer

CRC has progressed to nearby lymph nodes but has not metastasized to distant organs. According to the SEER Training Modules, the 5-year survival rate for stage III CRC ranges from 35 % to 55 %, depending on the extent of lymph node involvement.4

Stage 4 (A-C) colorectal cancer

At this advanced stage, CRC has spread to distant organs, most commonly the lungs or liver. The five-year relative survival rate is around 13 %, although advances in treatment are improving outcomes for some patients.5

For individuals whose cancer has spread only to the lungs or liver, surgery may offer a potential cure. More patients with stage IV cancer are now living longer than two years.

Treatment options for colorectal cancer

Surgery

Polypectomy : Removal of polyps during a colonoscopy

: Removal of polyps during a colonoscopy Colectomy: Removal of part or all of the colon containing cancer

Surgery is most beneficial when the cancer is still in its early stages and has not spread to other parts of the body.

Chemotherapy

Powerful chemicals are used to kill cancer cells. This is a systemic treatment that targets cells throughout the body.

Radiation therapy

High-energy rays are used to target and destroy cancer cells, especially in cases of rectal cancer. These rays damage the DNA within the cells, limiting their ability to divide and replicate. Radiation affects all cells, but it is particularly harmful to rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.

Targeted therapy

Targeted therapies are designed to attack specific characteristics of cancer cells, preventing their growth while causing minimal damage to healthy cells.

Examples include drugs that target epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), such as Panitumumab; drugs that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), such as Bevacizumab; and drugs like Encorafenib, which target cancer cells with BRAF gene mutations.

Immunotherapy

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are used to enhance the immune system’s ability to target and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy is effective only in a subset of patients whose tumors have specific genetic alterations, such as high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mutations in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes.

Colorectal cancer screening

Early detection of colon cancer can significantly reduce mortality rates and improve 5-year survival probabilities.6 In the United States, the 5-year relative survival rate for stage I colon cancer is approximately 92 %. For stage IIB CRC, the 5-year relative survival rate drops to 65 %.7

Individuals rarely experience symptoms in the early stages of CRC, making regular screening essential. Incidence and mortality rates of CRC have decreased significantly in the United States following the implementation of effective CRC screening technologies.8 Screening can remove pre-cancerous polyps and help prevent the development of CRC.9

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends that individuals aged 45 to 75 undergo regular CRC screening. Those with a higher risk of CRC due to family history, certain conditions, or genetic diseases should begin screening earlier.10

Colonoscopy, a direct visualization test, is currently the most commonly used CRC screening method in the United States.11 Other visualization tests include virtual colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. All three are invasive and involve the injection of air into the colon.12

CRC stool tests are widely used around the world. Since polyps and CRC may bleed, tests such as the guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT or iFOBT) can detect even small amounts of blood in the stool.13

Multitarget stool DNA testing (Cologuard) is an FDA-approved, stool-based test that detects both hemoglobin and specific DNA biomarkers.14

Innovative colorectal cancer detection

Biomarkers from blood

Colorectal cancer research breakthroughs are revolutionizing CRC diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the FDA has approved two blood-based assays for CRC screening.

Epi proColon 2.0 is approved for screening individuals aged 50 and older. This test detects methylated SEPT9, a biological biomarker released by CRC cells.

Shield is approved for screening individuals aged 45 and older. It analyzes plasma DNA for the presence of harmful gene mutations and other alterations.

Biomarkers from stool

Stool tests are a non-invasive, safe, cost-effective, and simple method for screening CRC. Increasing evidence supports the effectiveness of fecal indicators in CRC screening.

Proteins, DNA mutations, epigenetic markers, microorganisms, and volatile chemical compounds have all been identified and studied as potential CRC biomarkers in stool. These biomarkers are low-risk and show great promise for transforming CRC screening and early diagnostic testing.15

The image below is adapted from an article by Quan Ding et al.15 It highlights several stool biomarkers associated with CRC.

Stool DNA biomarkers

DNA mutations are among the most extensively studied and widely used indicators for CRC. For example, mutated KRAS genes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, eventually resulting in cancer.

KRAS mutations are found in approximately 40 % of CRC cases. Mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway can also serve as CRC biomarkers. This pathway promotes the generation of new cells to replace those lost over time, which is essential for maintaining intestinal function.

Mutations in the Wnt pathway cause dysregulated cell growth and division, which can lead to cancer. Such mutations are present in more than 90 % of CRC patients. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is the most frequently altered gene in this pathway.16

Stool RNA biomarkers

Fecal microRNAs (miRNAs) show promise as non-invasive diagnostic and screening biomarkers. These miRNAs remain stable and detectable in stool samples because they are packaged in exosomes, which protect them from degradation.

Notably, fecal miRNA detection typically requires only 1 gram of stool, making the method well-suited for clinical use. Recent studies have linked specific miRNAs to CRC.

Ahmed et al. observed significant changes in miRNA expression in the feces of CRC patients. The study reported increased expression of miR-21, miR-106a, miR-96, miR-203, miR-20a, miR-326, and miR-92, along with decreased levels of miR-320, miR-126, miR-484-5p, miR-143, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-125b.17

These findings support the effectiveness of fecal miRNAs as biomarkers for CRC detection and monitoring.

Another intriguing discovery that has opened new possibilities for CRC screening is the ability to profile small RNA in addition to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT).18

Birkeland et al. published a study in the journal Molecular Cancer. Using Norgen Biotek's RNA stabilizing solution and Stool Total RNA Purification Kit, the researchers demonstrated that the human miRNome can be detected in residual FIT samples across populations, and that small RNA biomarker analysis can supplement FIT in large-scale screening settings.

The researchers also found that miRNAs from residual FIT samples show varying abundances between CRC patients and healthy individuals.18

Stool microbiome biomarkers

Associative studies using metagenomic approaches have identified bacterial species that are enriched in CRC. These microorganisms may serve as biomarkers for disease screening, prognosis, and response to therapy.19

Next-generation sequencing technology has enabled the analysis of microbiomes from sources such as the human gut, allowing researchers to explore taxonomic and metabolomic links between the microbiome and cancer.

The relationship between colon cancer and the human gut microbiome has been studied extensively, with varying results. However, these studies consistently show that microbiota associated with a plant-based diet are linked to a reduced risk of colon cancer.

A plant-based diet promotes the growth of microbiota that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These SCFAs have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inducing T-regulatory cells in colonic tissues.20

Stool microbiome biomarkers

Norgen Biotek is a market leader in stool DNA/RNA preservation and isolation systems, specifically designed for biomarker research.

Norgen’s advanced reagents effectively stabilize nucleic acids for extended periods, resulting in consistent and reliable cancer diagnostics and research outcomes. Independent studies have shown that Norgen Biotek's stool preservative outperforms competitors in maintaining gut flora from stool samples.21,22

Additionally, the preservative supports metabolomic studies, such as SCFA analysis.23 Norgen Biotek's cutting-edge technology for stool DNA, RNA, and nucleotide isolation addresses two of the most common challenges in working with stool samples: the presence of humic acid and DNA fragmentation. As a result, these kits efficiently isolate high-quality DNA or RNA from fecal samples.

Beyond preservation, Norgen Biotek also offers comprehensive next-generation sequencing services for small RNA, miRNA, and metagenomics applications. Each service includes a detailed, project-specific bioinformatics report, providing researchers with actionable insights tailored to their study’s objectives.

Conclusion: A path forward

Colorectal cancer is a serious but preventable disease if detected early. Advances in diagnostics, such as biomarker analysis and innovative solutions from Norgen Biotek, are paving the way for improved outcomes. Prioritizing screenings, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and staying informed can help reduce your risk of developing colorectal cancer.

Norgen Biotek offers diagnostic tools and solutions tailored to colorectal cancer research.

https://news-medical.net,The evolution of OCT for retinal imaging and disease intervention,https://news-medical.net/news/20250401/The-evolution-of-OCT-for-retinal-imaging-and-disease-intervention.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Thought Leaders Dr. Yifan Jian Associate Professor Oregon Health and Science University

In this interview, industry expert Dr. Yifan Jian discusses advancements in ultrawide-field optical coherence tomography (OCT), challenges in retinal imaging, AI’s role in biophotonics, and the future of high-speed, high-resolution ophthalmic imaging.

Can you tell us about your career path and what led you to specialize in biophotonics and optical coherence tomography (OCT)?

I started my academic journey in China, where I completed my undergraduate degree in optics in Shanghai. After that, I moved to Vancouver, Canada, for my PhD, where I specialized in biophotonics. That’s when I was first introduced to OCT, its applications in eye imaging, and adaptive optics. My supervisor was one of the early researchers in OCT, so I had the opportunity to work with various OCT and imaging systems designed for the anterior and posterior eye segments.

After completing my PhD in 2014, I stayed in Vancouver for a few years before being recruited by Dr. David Huang—one of the co-inventors of OCT—at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). I joined the faculty to continue developing OCT and other eye imaging systems there. My career has remained rooted in academia, focusing entirely on advancing research in this field.

How have these fields evolved since you began your research?

OCT has always had a strong translational focus. Since its invention and early patenting, it has been rapidly commercialized, leading to numerous companies producing and deploying OCT systems worldwide. Today, OCT is one of the most important diagnostic tools in ophthalmology, particularly for retinal diseases. Its rise coincided with the development of new treatments for retinal conditions, such as anti-VEGF therapy. It allows doctors to determine precisely when to begin these highly effective treatments.

From a technology perspective, one of the key advancements has been the dramatic increase in OCT speed. Early systems could capture tens to hundreds of scans per second, while modern systems operate at millions of scans per second. Researchers have also worked on enhancing resolution axially and transversely using techniques such as adaptive optics.

Beyond structural imaging, new contrast mechanisms have emerged, such as OCT angiography for visualizing blood vessels and optoretinography to study how photoreceptors respond to light. Other emerging techniques include using OCT to measure oxygen saturation at the capillary level, particularly with visible light OCT.

When I moved to OHSU, my focus shifted towards expanding the field of view. Instead of zooming in to capture tiny cellular details, I worked on imaging the entire retina, providing a comprehensive view of the retinal health which is critical for clinical applications.

What were some key challenges in developing ultrawide-field OCT systems, and how do they advance imaging for complex retinal conditions?

Developing ultrawide-field OCT comes with multiple challenges. The first is scan time - as you increase the field of view, the system needs more time to scan the entire area and collect data. This prolongs imaging sessions, increasing the likelihood of motion artifacts and patient discomfort. The solution is higher-speed OCT systems, which we achieve using advanced laser technology.

The second challenge is the depth of imaging. The eyeball is curved, so we need a deeper imaging range as we expand the field of view. Swept-source OCT systems require high-speed digitizers and sophisticated data processing tools. We address this using GPUs to process data in real-time.

The third and biggest challenge has been optics. We needed a high-quality optical system with custom-designed lenses to effectively direct light across the entire retina. Off-the-shelf components were not designed for ultrawide-field OCT, so they did not provide the image quality we needed.

Initially, we tried adapting ophthalmic lenses used in other imaging modalities, but they were not optimized for OCT, so they lacked the necessary optical quality and performance for our ultra-wide-field imaging goals.

How did your collaboration with Avantier start, and what drew you to working with them?

When we realized that existing ophthalmic lenses were insufficient for ultrawide-field OCT, we knew we had to design and manufacture our custom optics. This required a deep dive into optical design and simulation software to develop high-performance lens systems.

As we began searching for a manufacturing partner, Avantier stood out for its ability to produce high-quality optics while remaining cost-effective. Compared to other companies, Avantier offered a reasonable and affordable approach, which was crucial for us as we ventured into custom lens design for the first time.

The results have been outstanding—our systems now provide high-quality, ultrawide-field images that are being used in clinics for conditions like diabetic retinopathy and in neonatal intensive care units to screen premature infants for retinopathy of prematurity.

This collaboration has enabled us to push the boundaries of ultrawide-field OCT, ensuring our systems achieve the highest possible performance for both research and clinical applications.

Could you discuss the significance of ultrawide-field OCT systems in retinal imaging and any recent developments from your lab in this area?

Our ultrawide-field OCT systems have significantly expanded the scope of retinal imaging. Handheld and desktop configurations allow comprehensive analysis of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, which has important applications in conditions like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration.

One of the biggest advancements in my lab has been developing a system that can capture a near-complete 3D reconstruction of the entire eyeball in a single scan. This technology is particularly valuable for myopia management, allowing us to track how eye shape changes.

We are also using ultrawide-field OCT in ocular oncology to precisely measure tumors inside the eye. Traditional imaging methods like MRI or ultrasound lack the resolution necessary, whereas OCT provides highly detailed structural information.

Another major focus has been increasing imaging speed. We have developed novel systems that project entire lines of light instead of scanning single spots. This allows us to acquire images in parallel, significantly speeding up the process. We are also exploring different illumination schemes to improve tissue contrast, revealing retinal layers that were previously difficult to distinguish.

What advancements do you foresee AI bringing to biophotonics?

AI has the potential to transform retinal imaging. One promising application is using AI to analyze OCT scans for signs of systemic health conditions like cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s, and other neurological disorders.

The retina provides a unique window into overall health - AI algorithms can extract subtle biomarkers from OCT images that are difficult for human observers to detect, which could massively enhance diagnostic capabilities.

However, for this to reach its full potential, we need widespread access to affordable OCT systems. If low-cost devices became available in places like pharmacies or optical retail stores, AI-powered OCT screening could become a routine part of healthcare, making early disease detection far more accessible.

Among your numerous publications, are there any particular studies or findings that have significantly impacted your field or hold personal significance to you?

One of my earliest and most impactful works was on GPU-accelerated OCT image processing. OCT generates massive amounts of data, and processing it in real time is crucial, especially for applications like neonatal imaging, where infants won’t stay still for long. Traditional CPUs weren’t fast enough, so we developed a system that uses GPUs—specifically NVIDIA video cards—to dramatically speed up the process.

This real-time image processing capability changed how we use OCT. It allows clinicians to see cross-sectional and 3D retina views instantly while scanning, providing immediate feedback for diagnosis. The software we developed over a decade ago is still widely used in research labs worldwide today.

My research on adaptive optics for high-resolution imaging was another significant contribution. We developed a system that does not rely on wavefront sensors but instead iteratively optimizes image quality. This technique has been successfully applied to small-animal imaging.

My work on retinopathy of prematurity has been particularly meaningful more recently. Using ultrawide-field handheld OCT, we have redefined the disease’s diagnostic criteria, identifying new biomarkers that were previously undetectable with conventional imaging—this could improve early diagnosis and treatment.

What’s your vision for the future of OCT and other imaging technologies in the next 5–10 years?

I see speed as the defining factor in the future of OCT. Current commercial systems are still relatively slow compared to research-grade devices. Higher-speed OCT will allow for larger field-of-view imaging and functional assessments such as optoretinography, which can evaluate photoreceptor function in real time.

In research, we will continue pushing for higher resolution and better contrast mechanisms, such as oxygen saturation mapping. Thoughtful optical design will be critical to push the limits of what OCT can reveal.

What advice would you give students or early-career researchers interested in biomedical imaging?

https://news-medical.net,Supercharging Next-Gen Antibody Discovery with AI and High-Throughput Experimentation,https://news-medical.net/news/20250401/Supercharging-Next-Gen-Antibody-Discovery-with-AI-and-High-Throughput-Experimentation.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","insights from industry Mohammad Akhlaq Head of Automation LabGenius Therapeutics

In this interview, News Medical speaks with Mohammad Aklaq at LabGenius Therapeutics about how automation and machine learning are pioneering the discovery of complex antibodies following the company’s recent expansion of its EVA™ platform.

To start, can you tell us a little about your role at LabGenius Therapeutics and what excites you most about working on automation in antibody discovery?

At LabGenius Therapeutics, I’m focused on applying my expertise and experience in automation and assay development to increase our experimental throughput while maintaining data quality.

This is exciting because this high-quality, disease-relevant data fuels our active learning process. The more experimental data we generate, the stronger our ML-enabled antibody discovery process becomes.

LabGenius has recently expanded its platform with a high-throughput workcell. Can you walk us through what this expansion involved and what makes this new system unique?

I’ll start by giving a brief overview of the platform. The EVA™ platform works by combining active learning with automated functional screening in a closed loop. This approach, which is largely free from human bias, allows us to explore large areas of antibody design space and ultimately discover high-performing molecules, often with non-intuitive designs.

The recent expansion further automates the wet-lab steps, enabling us to produce and purify greater numbers of multispecific/multivalent antibodies and assess their characteristics in the final format using disease-relevant, cell-based assays.

With our platform, we’re now able to design, produce (in mammalian cells), purify, and characterize panels of up to 2,300 multispecific/multivalent antibodies in just 6 weeks. We believe this capability to be world-leading.

Scientist explains how AI can accelerate medical discovery Play

You’ve tripled experimental throughput with this expansion. What specific technical improvements or automation advancements made that possible?

Working with Beckman Coulter as our preferred integration partner has been instrumental — bringing together a considered selection of over 33 devices onto a single platform is no trivial task.

The partnership has enabled us to build a highly complex molecular biology workflow that delivers purified and sequence-verified DNA, ready for mammalian cell transfection.

Primarily, the utilization of large labware and reagent storage capacity, coupled with state-of-the-art automated liquid handling technologies — such as the Echo acoustic dispensing and Bomek i7 liquid handling robot — gives us the ability to carry out near 24/7 process run time.

Increasing experimental throughput directly strengthens your machine learning-driven discovery process. Can you explain how this additional data improves the predictive power of your models?

The more antibody designs we can evaluate experimentally in the wet lab, the more ML-grade data we can feed our models. This not only increases the accuracy of our models but also expands the size of the design space that we can explore in silico. This is important because many high-performing molecules have non-intuitive designs.

In other words, there often isn’t an obvious relationship between a molecular design and its function, so many of our high-performing molecules wouldn’t have been discovered by a human protein engineer.

Scaling up data generation is one part of the equation, but how do you ensure that the data remains high-quality and disease-relevant as throughput increases?

As throughput increases, it’s important that we maintain the integrity of the data we collect.

We achieve this by automating not only the hundreds of discrete experimental steps in the wet lab but also the computational steps that bookend the process. For instance, all experimental data are automatically uploaded to the cloud and processed using purpose-built data pipelines that address processes like QC, normalization, and curve fitting.

This reduces the chances of introducing human error and frees up our scientists’ time to focus on more fruitful experimental work.

With this increased capacity, LabGenius can now run more antibody discovery programs in parallel. How does this impact the speed and efficiency of bringing potential therapeutics to development?

Although the EVA™ platform is modality- and format-agnostic, our internal pipeline focuses on developing selectivity-enhanced antibodies for the treatment of solid tumors. With the expansion of the new platform, we are able to run multiple lead optimization programs simultaneously. This means we can collaborate with pharmaceutical partners on joint programs while also keeping the momentum behind our wholly-owned pipeline of assets.

What were some of the biggest challenges in scaling up the platform, and how did you and your team overcome them?​​​​​

Putting together such a sophisticated platform inevitably has its challenges. As we anticipated, the biggest hurdle was ensuring its mechanical and biological robustness. Working collaboratively with the team at Beckman Coulter enabled rigorous testing to ensure reproducible results.

Another challenge was automating the colony-picking process using the integrated Amplius imaging system and the Biomek i7 robot.

The ability to pick colonies printed by the Echo accurately and precisely has been overcome with the help of excellent scripting support by the Beckman applications team. This enables efficient colony picking and inoculation, which enables the completion of the molecular biology process within 7 days for 2,300 designs.

Looking ahead, how do you see automation and machine learning continuing to shape the future of antibody discovery?

As antibodies become more complex, the relationship between their design and function will become less intuitive.

Our high-throughput characterization data, when combined with ML, allows us to co-optimize these increasingly complex multispecific/multivalent antibody formats with sophisticated modes of action, ultimately setting a new standard for safety and efficacy.

Are there any upcoming innovations or improvements you’re particularly excited about in LabGenius’ pipeline?

We’re really excited by our molecules’ ability to overcome on-target, off-tumour toxicity, a drawback too often associated with approved anti-tumour therapies. By leveraging avidity-driven selectivity, the antibodies in our pipeline can differentiate between healthy and diseased cells based on differential TAA expression.

This is exciting because, with conventional methods, we see only a marginal widening of the therapeutic window, whereas our approach achieves complete on/off killing selectivity. (Watch our recent data presentation at PEGS here).

As LabGenius continues to scale its capabilities, what do you see as the next big milestone for the EVA platform?

There are always new opportunities to enhance our platform and keep up with the latest scientific innovations. The next milestone we are working towards is the onboarding of increasingly more sophisticated antibody designs — for example, we’re currently onboarding tri- and tetra-specific antibodies with complex modes of action.

https://news-medical.net,Do lifetime body weight patterns affect kidney cancer risk?,https://news-medical.net/news/20250401/Do-lifetime-body-weight-patterns-affect-kidney-cancer-risk.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Excess weight in mid-life is a known risk factor for kidney cancer, but new research indicates that weight patterns throughout life may also affect an individual’s likelihood of developing this malignancy. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

To assess weight patterns and their associations with kidney cancer and its different subtypes, investigators analyzed information on 204,364 individuals from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, including body mass index (BMI) data when participants entered the study (an average age of 61.6 years), and prior BMI recordings at 18, 35, and 50 years of age. The team noted that there were 1,425 cases of kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), among the study’s participants, with 583 having aggressive RCC and 339 having fatal RCC. The researchers also recorded the different subtypes of RCC, including clear cell RCC (541 patients), papillary RCC (146 patients), and chromophobe RCC (64 patients).

Higher BMI at any of the ages assessed was linked with higher risks of overall RCC and all subtypes (except chromophobe RCC), with a 10-40% higher risk for each 5-unit increase in BMI. Similar increased risks were linked to weight gain during adulthood that resulted in overweight or obesity, compared with maintaining normal BMI.

Also, long-term excess weight was associated with higher risks of overall RCC, aggressive RCC, fatal RCC, and clear cell RCC, but not papillary RCC and chromophobe RCC. Weight loss in which BMI was reduced by at least 10%, particularly later in life, was associated with a lower risk of RCC. Specifically, weight loss from age 18–35 years and after age 50 years was associated with 21% and 28% reductions in RCC incidence, respectively.

These findings emphasize that maintaining a healthy weight across one’s lifetime is important for reducing RCC risk. More importantly, weight loss, even later in life, may offer protective benefits,” Zhengyi Deng, PhD, lead author, Stanford University School of Medicine

“We should support initiatives that promote healthy weight maintenance and weight loss strategies. Some of these include lifestyle interventions, weight-loss programs, and emerging medical treatments for obesity; however, individuals should consult with their healthcare providers prior to initiation of any plan.”",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Scientists discover key genes for regenerating cells in the ear and eye,https://news-medical.net/news/20250401/Scientists-discover-key-genes-for-regenerating-cells-in-the-ear-and-eye.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The same genes could hold the key to regenerating cells in the ear and eye, according to a new mouse study from the USC Stem Cell laboratory of Ksenia Gnedeva, PhD, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

The proliferation of progenitor cells in response to injury is a crucial step in the regeneration of sensory receptors, but this process is blocked in the mammalian inner ear and retina. By understanding the genes that enforce this block, we can advance efforts to restore hearing and vision in patients."" Ksenia Gnedeva, PhD, Assistant Professor in the USC Tina and Rick Caruso Department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, and the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC

In the study, first authors Eva Jahanshir and Juan Llamas from the Gnedeva lab focused on a group of interacting genes called the Hippo pathway, which serve as a ""stop growing"" signal that the lab has shown to inhibit cell proliferation in the ear during embryonic development. In their experiments, the scientists demonstrated that the Hippo pathway also suppresses the regeneration of damaged sensory receptors in the ear and eye of adult mice.

The scientists used an experimental compound that the lab earlier developed to inhibit a key protein in the Hippo pathway: Lats1/2. When exposed to this drug-like compound in a Petri dish, the progenitor cells known as supporting cells responded by proliferating in the utricle, which is a sensory organ in the inner ear that helps with balance. However, the same cells did not respond in the organ of Corti, which is the hearing sensory organ.

The scientists next identified what was blocking this important step towards sensory cell regeneration in the organ of Corti - a gene encoding a protein called p27Kip1 - and showed that this inhibitory protein was also high in the retina. They created a transgenic mouse in which the level of p27Kip1 could be reduced in the inner ear and the retina to see how that would impact the proliferation of progenitor cells in response in both organs.

In these mice, inhibiting the Hippo pathway effectively caused supporting cells proliferation in the organ of Corti, an important step towards the regeneration of the ear's sensory cells. In the retina, inhibiting the Hippo pathway induced the proliferation of progenitor cells known as Müller glia. Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that some of the Müller glia progeny, without further manipulation, converted to sensory photoreceptors and other neuronal cell types in the retina.

""There have been reports that p27Kip1 levels drop following injury, so that might offer a brief window of opportunity for using a drug-like compound to inhibit the Hippo pathway and encourage regeneration in the ear and the eye,"" said Gnedeva. ""Alternatively, it could be possible to develop another drug-like compound to reduce p27Kip1 levels. So, our discoveries have identified potential new targets for stimulating the regeneration of both hearing and vision.""

https://news-medical.net,Is left-handedness genetic? A full scientific explanation,https://news-medical.net/whitepaper/20250401/Is-left-handedness-genetic-A-full-scientific-explanation.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","On average, only 10 % of the human population is left-handed. Interestingly, five out of the last nine American presidents have been left-handed: Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford (approximately 55 %).

This macro-scale human motor asymmetry has intrigued researchers for centuries. In ancient civilizations, including those of Greece, Rome, China, and Mesopotamia, right-handedness was prevalent, dominant, and revered. It was considered a privilege to sit to the right of someone.

In Latin, the word for left is ""sinister,"" while the word for right is ""dexter."" Even in antiquity, these terms carried dual meanings of awkward and skillful, respectively.

Today, ""sinister"" has taken on an even more negative connotation. During the Middle Ages, being left-handed was deemed sinful and associated with the devil. During the Inquisition, mere left-handedness was sufficient to condemn a woman as a witch, leading to the execution of numerous innocent left-handed individuals.1

Researchers have long sought clues to this asymmetry, with some proposing that the greater mortality of left-handers in battles has contributed to the higher prevalence of right-handedness today.

Beyond myths, understanding handedness is also pertinent to understanding brain lateralization, and recent research indicates that this macro-scale asymmetry can be traced down to the molecular level.

Right versus left-brain

The brain is divided into two hemispheres: the right and the left. Experiments and imaging demonstrate that the brain is ""cross-wired,"" with movement on the left side of the body primarily controlled by the right hemisphere and vice versa. Furthermore, different regions of the brain are responsible for distinct functions.

Research from the 1960s characterized the left side of the brain as more logical and mathematical, while the right side was associated with creativity and emotion. However, more recent studies indicate that although each hemisphere has different specializations, there is extensive communication through the nerve fibers of the corpus callosum, allowing both halves to work collaboratively.

For example, the left hemisphere has traditionally been linked to processing mathematical equations; however, research shows that the right hemisphere also contributes to spatial awareness during complex calculations, understanding numbers with zeros, and representing numbers in a nonverbal manner.

Similarly, language processing has been attributed to the left brain, yet the right hemisphere plays a significant role in comprehending context and non-literal language, including metaphors and irony.

The importance of the right hemisphere in the emotional and contextual aspects of language may explain why left-handed individuals often excel as orators and are frequently found in successful political roles.

While it is tempting to categorize individuals as left-brained or right-brained, as creativity and logic are often perceived as opposites, the reality is far more nuanced.

Understanding left-handedness is more significant than merely defining personality types; gross motor lateralization may be part of molecular-based cues within a larger developmental framework.

Molecular handedness

As we look more closely at the human body, asymmetry reveals itself at every level. Major organs, such as the stomach and liver, are typically located on the left and right sides of the body, respectively, except in very rare instances.

Within specific organs, asymmetry is also evident, for example, the heart exhibits left-to-right asymmetry. Upon further examination, it becomes clear that most biomolecules are asymmetric or chiral.

Chirality refers to the three-dimensional molecular asymmetry that prevents a molecule from being superimposed on its mirror image. Chiral molecules can be categorized as left-handed or right-handed, with a clockwise spiral identified as right-handed.

Most DNA exists as right-handed double helices; imagine walking down a DNA staircase, where one would turn to the right. A molecule's handedness significantly influences its function.

For instance, nearly all organisms exclusively produce and metabolize left-handed amino acids while utilizing right-handed sugars, highlighting the importance of chirality in biological processes. Current research is uncovering the mechanistic connections between genetics and asymmetry at the cellular, organ, and organism levels.

Is being left-handed genetic?

Research indicates that genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and social factors all contribute to handedness. Notably, while the proportion of left-handed individuals among twins aligns with that of the general population, studies have shown a higher concordance rate of handedness among monozygotic (identical) twins compared to dizygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on handedness.2

Initial Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) faced challenges in identifying statistically significant genetic markers for left-handedness. However, advancements in biobanks have facilitated studies with larger population sizes, leading to statistically significant findings.

Recent GWAS studies have identified associations between left-handedness and microtubule-associated genes (e.g., TUBB, MAP2, and MAPT). Furthermore, a GWAS study analyzed brain imaging and genome sequencing data from over 32,000 UK Biobank participants and discovered 27 independent genetic variants significantly associated with structural brain asymmetry.

Nearly half of these loci were associated with genes that code for tubulins or microtubule-associated proteins. However, the majority of the regions fell outside of protein-coding genes and were instead involved in regulating gene expression.

A recent study based on exome data from over 350,000 individuals in the UK Biobank has also identified rare coding variants that may be linked to left-handedness.3

Difference between exome-wide and genome-wide association studies

The primary population-wide genomic methodologies for assessing genetic variation related to specific diseases or conditions include genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and whole-exome sequencing (WES).

GWAS typically involves targeted genotyping of pre-selected variants utilizing microarrays or selective sequencing. These studies can identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or structural variations within intronic or exonic regions of the genome.

WGS involves decoding the entire genome, while WES focuses specifically on sequencing only the exons—the coding regions of genes. Although the exome makes up just 1–2 % of the genome, it's estimated to account for roughly 85 % of the mutations identified in Mendelian diseases.4

Exome-wide studies are particularly useful for detecting rare variants, as they allow for greater sequencing depth at a similar cost.

Traditionally, whole-exome sequencing has been conducted on tissue samples; however, there is now a noticeable shift toward utilizing plasma and other bodily fluids. Analyzing plasma from a liquid biopsy is significantly less invasive than a tissue biopsy, and whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) from liquid biopsies has demonstrated the capability to uncover tumor-associated biomarkers and potential clues regarding the tissue of origin.5

Whole-exome sequencing reveals a rare protein-coding variant associated with left-handedness

A recent study has also utilized the extensive resources of the UK Biobank to analyze exome data from 38,043 left-handed individuals and 313,271 right-handed individuals. The analysis identified rare coding variants in TUBB4B, a tubulin protein, which were found to be significantly more prevalent in left-handed individuals (2.7 times higher than in their right-handed counterparts).

Previous research has linked TUBB4B variants to sensorineural and ciliopathic disorders. Across the population studied, most TUBB4B variants were identified as heterozygous missense alterations.

Notably, this study observed two frameshift mutations occurring exclusively in left-handed individuals, both predicted to induce degradation of the TUBB4B RNA transcript through nonsense-mediated decay.

Consequently, these frameshift variants are anticipated to result in haploinsufficiency. Additionally, variants of two other genes, DSCAM and FOXP1, were associated with left-handedness, albeit with lower statistical significance. These genes warrant further investigation, as they have been previously implicated in autism and schizophrenia through exome screening.

While individuals carrying these rare coding variants are more likely to be left-handed, burden heritability analysis estimated the contribution of these variants to left-handed heritability at only 1 %.

Although the precise mechanism by which microtubules influence human handedness remains unclear, evidence suggests that microtubules may play a role in cellular chirality during early brain development, subsequently affecting the formation of the brain’s left-right axis.

Health implications of left-handedness

One study has indicated that left-handed individuals may face a slightly elevated risk of accidental injuries and death, likely due to the predominance of tools and devices designed for right-handed usage.6

Others have suggested that while left-handed attackers may possess an advantage by striking from the left side, left-handed defenders may be at a disadvantage, leading to a higher risk of injury in self-defense situations.

Although some research has proposed that left-handed individuals have shorter lifespans, more recent studies indicate that factors such as changing societal pressures, such as the historical coercion of left-handed individuals to switch to right-handedness, have influenced these findings.7

When models account for the increasing proportion of left-handed individuals over time, there is no significant difference in lifespan between left-handed and right-handed individuals. This increase in left-handedness over time also serves as a confounding factor in studies examining the effects of left-handedness on diseases that impact longevity.

There appears to be a notable association between left-handedness and certain psychotic disorders. Among patients with mental disorders, approximately 40 % of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder are left-handed, a figure four times higher than the prevalence of left-handedness in the general population.8

Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have also revealed reduced expression levels of certain tubulin-associated genes (e.g., TUBA1B) and proteins in specific brain regions. However, individuals receiving treatment with antipsychotic medications did not exhibit lower levels of TUBA1B. These results contribute to the hypothesis that a disruption in cytoskeletal homeostasis may play a role in the development of schizophrenia.

This notion is further supported by research on clozapine, one of the few effective medications for schizophrenia, which directly binds to α and β tubulin heterodimers, inhibiting their polymerization during microtubule formation and disrupting the microtubule network.9,10

Recent research indicates that left-handed individuals face a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Studies have demonstrated that left-handed individuals exhibit lower vascular endothelial function and an inverse relationship between artery dilation, specifically flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and mean arterial pressure. FMD refers to the widening of an artery in response to increased blood flow, and low FMD is a strong predictor of CVD.

In left-handed individuals, as mean arterial pressure rises, FMD decreases; conversely, right-handed individuals show no correlation, with FMD remaining stable across a range of arterial pressures.

While the overall impact of handedness on life expectancy remains a topic of debate, data suggests a higher prevalence of certain health conditions among left-handed individuals compared to their right-handed counterparts.11

https://news-medical.net,High-throughput functional validation of CAR-T cells using microfluidic picodroplets,https://news-medical.net/whitepaper/20250401/High-throughput-functional-validation-of-CAR-T-cells-using-microfluidic-picodroplets.aspx,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Interest in cell therapy has increased in recent years, with additional focus on leveraging this as a strategy to fight tumors by harnessing the immune system.

Cell therapy technologies include reprogramming patients’ own T cells to produce personalized medicines. T-cell therapy capitalizes on the immune system’s capacity to recognize and kill tumor cells- an ability that may be overwhelmed or lost as cancer develops.

Extracting and manipulating T-cells from a patient enables potential restoration of the patient’s ability to attack cancer cells. Rapid, accurate assays to qualify engineered T-cells’ potency against the target tumor cell are critical.

These assays are key to supporting the effective and efficient development of therapeutics.

This article examines a new picodroplet approach specifically designed for the functional validation of CAR-T cells. This robust and user-friendly method combines the advantages of a granzyme B assay suitable for studying cell-mediated cytotoxicity with Sphere Bio’s advanced high-throughput picodroplet technology (Figure 1).

This method sees engineered T cells and target cells co-encapsulated in picoliter-volume aqueous droplets (picodroplets) in an oil emulsion. A granzyme B substrate is also included.

Granzyme B can be understood as a readout of the cells’ ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. This can be captured as it is released by the T cell, enabling determination of the level of potential anti-cancer activity. This allows the rapid acquisition of cell product efficacy readouts, enabling streamlined, quality-controlled release of cell product.

An introduction to picodroplet technology

Picodroplet-based technology is a highly promising microfluidic-based technique designed for single-cell functional analysis.

This technology offers a range of advantages over traditional tools. For example, picodroplets provide a distinct microenvironment suitable for high-throughput cell-cell interaction studies and cell secretion analysis at the single-cell level.

The use of miniaturized picoliter volumes enables rapid mixing and minimal sample dilution, factors key to increasing detection sensitivity while reducing reaction time and sample requirements.

Granzyme B detection in picodroplets

A commercially available granzyme B assay kit (SensoLyte® Granzyme B Activity Assay Kit, Anaspec, Fremont, CA) was adapted for use in picodroplets, allowing it to be used to detect the release of granzyme B in picodroplets.

The assay cleaves a granzyme B substrate peptide and labeling this with a 5-FAM fluorophore and a QXL®-520 fluorophore quencher. No fluorescence is emitted upon excitation of the fluorophore while it is in its intact, uncleaved state.

This is due to the nearby QXL®-520 molecule’s quenching effect (Figure 2A). The peptide substrate is cleaved in the presence of granzyme B, however, releasing the quenching molecule and prompting a fluorescent signal to be released (Figure 2A and Figure 2B).

No fluorescence is detected on excitation due to Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) from 5-FAM to QXL®-520 (left side). On cleavage with Granzyme B the quenching molecule is removed, and fluorescence is emitted from 5-FAM (right side). B) Application of Granzyme B activity assay to CAR-T cell/target cell interaction.

Granzyme B detection in picodroplets

Two populations of picodroplets at approximately 450 pL volume were initially generated using the Pico-Capture® instrument to demonstrate the assay’s general feasibility.

One of these populations contained just the fluorogenic granzyme B substrate peptide, forming a negative control, while the other population co-encapsulated recombinant granzyme B along with the substrate peptide.

Figure 3 features micrographs of both populations in brightfield (left) and green fluorescence (right) following 2 hours’ incubation at 37 ºC. It can be observed that only picodroplets containing both granzyme B and the substrate peptide (bottom) exhibit clearly detectable fluorescence after the 2-hour incubation period. In contrast, picodroplets with substrate peptide only (top) exhibit very low to no background fluorescence.

Granzyme B detection with T cells and target cells

Next, co-encapsulated polyclonal human donor T cells were genetically modified to express a CAR directed against Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA). This involved target cells expressing PSMA (PC3-LN3-PSMA) and the fluorogenic granzyme B substrate peptide.

An in-house custom-made biochip was employed, featuring two separate aqueous inlets to ensure that CAR T and target cells were kept separate until immediately prior to encapsulation.

Cell concentrations were adjusted, with approximately 20% of picodroplets containing a CAR T cell, and more than 75% of these receive at least one target cell (according to a Poisson distribution).

It is important to note that 150,000 out of 1 million generated picodroplets contained one CAR-T cell and at least one target cell, with around 15% (0.75 x 0.2) of picodroplets containing at least one CAR-T and one target cell.

CAR T cells with PC3-LN3 cells lacking PSMA expression were also co-encapsulated as a control. This was done alongside the fluorogenic peptide substrate under otherwise identical conditions.

An Eppendorf tube was used to collect picodropets, and these were imaged under a fluorescence microscope after 2, 4, and 24 hours of incubation to detect granzyme B activity. Figure 4 features fluorescent micrographs of picodroplets containing non-expressing control cells (top) and PC3-LN3-PSMA target cells (bottom), as these were imaged after 2, 4, and 24 hours (left to right).

Picodroplets containing PC3-LN3 control cells were seen to demonstrate very little granzyme B activity after 2-4 hours. Multiple fluorescent picodroplets are indicative of granzyme B released by CAR-T cells in response to encountering one or more target cell(s) in the case of picodroplets with PC3-LN3-PSMA cells.

Increased fluorescence was observed in the negative control following prolonged incubation (24 hours), potentially due to granzyme B leaking from dead or apoptotic CAR-T cells or from other unspecific stimulation.

Granzyme B detection using Cyto-Mine®

Once it had been established that it was possible to detect granzyme B-released CAR-T cells using the 5-FAM/QXL®-520 fluorogenic peptide substrate, it was necessary to detect and sort granzyme B-positive picodroplets.

This was done using Sphere Bio’s Cyto-Mine® Single Cell Analysis System. CAR-T cells were co-encapsulated with PC3-LN3-PSMA target cells and the 5-FAM/QXL®-520 peptide substrate in 450 pL-sized picodroplets. This was done using Sphere Bio’s Pico-Capture® instrument.

The resulting emulsion was collected and loaded into a Cyto-Cartridge® to enable injection, analysis, and sorting via the Cyto-Mine® platform.

It was possible to detect the fluorescence signal immediately following the injection of all picodroplets into the Cyto-Mine® (t=0), as well as after an additional incubation of 1 hour and 2 hours at 37 ºC inside the instrument.

Figure 5 features scatter plots of picodroplet size (y-axis) versus green fluorescence (x-axis) obtained at the specified time points.

A clear fluorescent signal was detectable in around 1.25% of picodroplets at the earliest time point, with this positive population increasing over time to 2.95% of picodroplets after a 2-hour period.

Because just 15% of picodroplets contain both a CAR-T cell and at least one target cell, this figure corresponds to an actual positive rate of around 20%.

A total of 5,000 positive picodroplets were then sorted to visually confirm the presence of a fluorescent signal. The Cyto-Cartridge® was carefully removed from

the instrument after sorting, and this was placed under a fluorescence microscope in order to image the picodroplets in the dispensing chamber.

Figure 6 features both a brightfield (left) and fluorescent micrograph (right) of picodroplets in the Cyto-Cartridge®’s dispensing chamber. A clear enrichment of fluorescent picodroplets is apparent.

Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software and a Hough Circle Transform algorithm, resulting in 1,112 picodroplets. It was determined that 170 of these picodroplets contained little to no fluorescence (for example, a false positive, or based on near background signal and a dark picodroplet border), while 942 picodroplets (around 85%) were deemed to be true positives.

This result corresponds to a 28-fold enrichment versus the non-sorted population with 2.95% positives after 2 hours of incubation.

Conclusions

The study presented here demonstrated the viability of picodroplet technologies in the monitoring of CAR-T activation at relevant early timepoints following co-culture and that established assays can be successfully adapted to the picodroplet format.

Current strategies depend on screening in bulk cultures to establish CAR-T cell product profiles. Cytotoxicity readouts can be time-consuming and are not currently included in all cell products’ release criteria. This data is gathered after the fact or not at all.

The capacity to acquire a readout of a cell product’s potential efficacy fitness via a short assay is anticipated to provide significant value to cell therapy development.

Picodroplet technology enables rapid, high-throughput screening at the single-cell level, and linking this utility to granzyme B release through the co-encapsulation of CAR-T and target cells enables the development of highly functional products with the best chance of impact for patients.

Cell therapy developers could also leverage this co-encapsulation approach to interrogate other readouts of cellular fitness and cytotoxicity. These could include direct cytotoxicity of the target cells or other proteomic markers of cytotoxicity.

Bulk T cell cultures exhibit a range of phenotypic and metabolic subsets. Investigating cytotoxic efficacy at the single T cell level could provide useful data on each of these subsets individually, guiding T cell engineering towards more potent subsets.

Co-encapsulation in picodroplets could also enable the rapid screening of candidate CAR/TCR gene-modified cells for drug development.
