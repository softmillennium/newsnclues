                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dogwifhat organizers have given up on their goal of advertising the prominent Solana meme coin on the Las Vegas Sphere, over a year after nearly $700,000 worth of crypto was raised for the campaign. Late Monday, pseudonymous organizer GamesMasterFlex, also known as Edward, took to X (formerly Twitter) to state that the push to put the pup on the Sphere has ended, and that contributors will start to be refunded as early as Tuesday. @dogwifcoin x @SphereVegas update: Contributions are being refunded. I know it‚Äôs been a frustrating year, but at least we can say we gave it our best shot. We had contracts signed through a‚Ä¶ ‚Äî GamesMaster.wif üá¨üáß‚Ä£üá∫üá∏‚Ä£üá®üá¥ (@GamesMasterFlex) March 31, 2025 Days later, however, a Sphere spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt that no deal had been signed and that it only accepted advertising from crypto exchanges and about Bitcoin. ‚ÄúWe have never had a deal with Dogwifhat, and our agency at the time only had one very preliminary conversation early last year,‚Äù a Sphere spokesperson told Decrypt in January. ‚ÄúThere was and is no plan for Dogwifhat to appear on the Exosphere, and we are distressed they are using our name for fraudulent purposes.‚Äù Edward claimed this statement ‚Äúspooked‚Äù the fashion brand. If any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin was included in an ad‚Äîincluding the likes of Ethereum, not just WIF‚Äîthen the content would be flagged and not approved to run. Edward said that the team then moved on to working with a musician set to play at the Sphere to include Dogwifhat in their visuals, but could not execute this in the previously announced timeframe. The team was working with an agency that claimed to have a ‚Äústrong relationship‚Äù with Sphere CEO James Dolan, Edward said, and had pitched an art installation featuring the hat‚Äîbut ultimately, this proposal also failed to come to fruition. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs been a frustrating year, but at least we can say we gave it our best shot,‚Äù Edward said on X. ‚ÄúYou'll see refunds going out from [Tuesday]. When Decrypt reached the Sphere for comment, a spokesperson said that nothing had changed since the venue's previous statements. Since raising nearly $700,000 in March 2024, the advertisement has become a shadow looming over the token as its community grew restless‚Äîwith many sending hate and insults to the organizers on social media. Pressure continued to mount when Crypto.com advertised Bitcoin on the Sphere last July, and again when rival Solana meme coin BONK was featured in a drone light show above the venue in December. That said, the funds had been moved to an external wallet when the Q1 announcement was made, presumably to pay for the signed contract, but were moved back two weeks later. Refunds are set to start as early as Tuesday; Edward told Decrypt that organizer Mihir is in charge of the refund process. Edward explained that the process will be automatic for contributors aside from those who sent funds via a centralized exchange. ‚ÄúGetting WIF on the Sphere would‚Äôve been a net positive for all memes,‚Äù pseudonymous organizer and multi-sig owner Quasi said on X. ‚ÄúInstead you guys ridiculed us and called us scammers for trying (and holding funds in the most transparent way possible).‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, a new contender is emerging to revolutionize the space once more. RUVI, an innovative blockchain project, is aligning artificial intelligence with decentralized technology to create impactful solutions. With its token presale set to launch in just a few hours, the platform is positioning itself as the next milestone in crypto innovation. When Ethereum introduced smart contracts, it expanded blockchain‚Äôs potential beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions. Ethereum‚Äôs vision pushed blockchain into mainstream conversations by solving real problems with decentralized trust mechanisms. RUVI‚Äôs unique proposition is its fusion of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. By providing decentralized AI tools, RUVI aims to serve a diverse set of stakeholders, including developers, businesses, and individuals. These tools have the potential to power smarter decision-making, optimize processes, and enhance data efficiencies. What sets RUVI apart is its focus on real-world applications. From business resource optimization to intelligent application development, RUVI‚Äôs AI-driven ecosystem addresses tangible challenges. RUVI‚Äôs presale features a robust bonus system designed to reward early participants generously. For example, an investor acquiring 50,000 $RUVI tokens at $0.01 each would spend $500. With the VIP 2 40% bonus, they would receive an additional 20,000 tokens, bringing their total to 70,000. With RUVI‚Äôs projected listing price set at $0.07, this initial investment could yield $4,900, representing a return of 880%. This dual reward system ensures a fair and engaging presale experience, creating opportunities for both substantial and moderate investors to maximize their earnings. The $RUVI token is central to a decentralized ecosystem built for scalability and practicality. Token holders gain exclusive access to powerful AI-driven solutions, participation in governance decisions, and staking rewards that accumulate over time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Switch is Nintendo‚Äôs best-selling home console of all time, and widely beloved for its rich library of games‚Äîa dramatic turn from the middling Wii U before it. But it‚Äôs been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo‚Äôs next big thing. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025. From what we know officially and what's been widely reported, the Switch successor will pack in more power than the original while maintaining its winning blend of home console and handheld functionality. It's official: Nintendo is making a successor to its wildly popular Switch console. Nintendo shared the first official teaser video below on January 16, 2025, sharing many key details for the Switch 2 while still playing coy on others. But this isn't the first time that Nintendo has officially commented. On May 7, 2024, Nintendo's official corporate account tweeted the following statement: We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation." We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. Even ahead of the May 2024 announcement, Nintendo was clearly planning for what‚Äôs next. In response to a fan question in June 2023, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said, ‚ÄúAs for the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next-generation machine, we want to do as much as possible in order to smoothly transition our customers, while utilizing the Nintendo Account.‚Äù Reports had long pointed to a late 2024 release target, but that didn't happen. Now, with the official trailer launch, all we have is a "2025" release window. The #NintendoDirect: Nintendo Switch 2 ‚Äì 4.2.2025 livestream will be approximately 60 minutes long. Watch it here: https://t.co/Rw1wnp5Xbr pic.twitter.com/eF7jJ2dDxj ‚Äî Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 1, 2025 We can make some educated guesses here, however. Nintendo will hold an hourlong Direct livestream on April 2, 2025 at 9am ET to presumably share much more about the console. After that, on April 3-4, Nintendo's "Treehouse" team will host livestreams showcasing hours of gameplay from Switch 2 games. Go hands-on with #NintendoSwitch2 at Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas! Find out more: https://t.co/EECzR6hCk3 pic.twitter.com/Ky1NUaiDah ‚Äî Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) January 16, 2025 Nothing is official, but a June release target has been widely reported, including in a late March report from Insider Gaming citing retailer launch documents. In an investor-centric Q&A from June 2024 translated from Japanese by IGN, Shuntaro Furukawa said that Nintendo is thinking ahead to supply issues and looking into how local laws and regulations could help stymie the resale market that many consoles get snapped up and sold into at inflated prices. Furthermore, the firm doesn't anticipate significant component shortages that could slow console manufacturing. ‚ÄúAlthough we were unable to produce sufficient quantities of Nintendo Switch hardware last year and the year before due to a shortage of semiconductor components, this situation has now been resolved," he said. ‚ÄúWe will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date (regarding scalpers and the like). We are making preparations," he said, per Nikkei (via VGC). Even with Nintendo's preparations, however, there's concern that launch supplies won't meet demand. The unnamed "large U.S. retailer" that provided documents to Insider Gaming is expecting a day-one pre-order sellout, for example. With some premium enhancements (including a larger, bolder screen), the Nintendo Switch OLED model shipped for $350 in 2021. In October 2023, a leaker‚Äîwho WCCF Tech said has previously shared reliable information‚Äîclaimed that the price point for the Switch 2 will be $449 for the base model and $400 for a version that is fully digital without cartridge support. The official Switch 2 trailer did not showcase or point to any fully digital model, however, so that may not actually be in the works. The Switch 2 will launch into an increasingly competitive handheld landscape that includes many PC gaming devices. Valve's popular Steam Deck, for example, starts at $399 for the base model with an LCD screen, while more robust models with OLED panels start at $549. After a whole ton of speculation, much of which was right on-target, we can finally say: The Switch 2 looks like a bigger Switch, mostly. Nintendo thankfully isn't ditching the Switch's smash-success hybrid design, delivering a handheld that can easily be docked for TV use. At its core, the Switch 2 doesn't change too much. First off, the screen and Joy-Con attachment controllers are definitely larger. If we had to guess on screen size, we'd estimate somewhere around 7-8 inches, compared to 6.2 inches on the normal Switch. Instead of having these Joy-Con controllers slide into place, they'll plug in via an adapter port and be held in place with what appear to be magnets. Furthermore, there appears to be a new sensor on the Switch 2 Joy-cons that lets them be used like a computer mouse on a flat surface, once plugged into the wrist strap attachments. This appears to confirm speculation regarding mouse-like functionality, enabling more advanced control schemes for games like shooters, strategy sims, and maybe even creative apps. Is the extra one meant to enable potentially new accessories? Nintendo hasn't shared official specs yet, and the one game from the trailer didn't give a great sense of a visual upgrade. But we certainly expect a notable step up from what the original Switch could handle. Reports suggest that Nintendo will not try to compete with the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X as the standard-bearers for home consoles and instead deliver a gaming experience with a bit less fidelity. That's been the standard Nintendo approach for a few generations now. Even so, it sounds like a significant improvement over the Switch. While those are 10-year-old home consoles, it still would be a notable step up from what the original Switch can handle. The Switch‚Äôs hybrid home-plus-handheld model also means that Nintendo has to keep in mind a slim form factor and battery life expectations, so it‚Äôs unlikely that we‚Äôd even see a Switch-like device with top-end internals at a reasonable price. VGC supported that report and added that Nintendo also used Epic Games‚Äô The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, with capabilities like ray tracing (realistic lighting effects) and AI-driven visual upscaling tricks enabled. All told, this may point to hardware that is actually more capable than the PS4 or Xbox One, even if it doesn‚Äôt quite match the benchmarks of the current-gen PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It could be relatively well equipped in terms of RAM, however, with noted leaker Felipe Lima suggesting that the device with have 12GB onboard‚Äîthat's more than the Xbox Series S console at 10GB. According to a January 2024 report from Bloomberg, Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase says that Nintendo has picked a sizable 8-inch display for the Switch 2, and the display will use LCD tech as other reports have previously noted. Mobapad also points to an 8-inch display, which it says it be upgraded from 720p HD resolution on the original Switch to 1080p Full HD resolution on the successor. We know one for sure: a new Mario Kart, revealed in the Switch 2 trailer. We don't have an official name yet; Mario Kart 9 would make sense based on the series' mainline entries, though earlier rumors pointed to a name of Mario Kart X to account for the mobile game Mario Kart Tour launching since Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (and later Switch). You can bet that we‚Äôll see Nintendo‚Äôs tried-and-true franchises like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and many others in the mix before long, though Nintendo hasn't shown anything else besides Mario Kart just yet. Previous rumors have pointed to games like a new Donkey Kong or Ubisoft's next as-yet-unannounced Far Cry sequel, but those remain unconfirmed for now. The long-delayed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still set to launch on the original Switch in 2025, Nintendo confirmed in February‚Äîbut it's been widely rumored to also launch on Switch 2. In fact, many gamers have suspected that the game's trailer is actually showing Switch 2 footage, but that hasn't been confirmed. But really, why wouldn't Nintendo release it across both consoles? There's precedent too: Nintendo launched The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the same date across Switch and Wii U, and Zelda: Twilight Princess just weeks apart across Wii and GameCube. Electronic Arts appears to be onboard with the Switch 2, and while that might sound obvious, EA hasn't put a new Madden NFL game on a Nintendo console since 2012. "Any time a new console comes into the marketplace, that's of a benefit to us," EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during an earnings call in February 2025, per GameSpot. "It gives us the ability to access and acquire new players. Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past." Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January 2025 that he's "really looking forward to supporting" Nintendo's next console with games. After Rockstar Games' official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is currently announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, it begs the question: Will it come to Switch 2, too? And perhaps more pressingly, will the Switch 2 be powerful enough to run it? There's no official word for now, of course, and there wouldn't be until Nintendo actually reveals its next console. I don‚Äôt think it will, realistically," said Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter in a YouTube video (via IGN). We‚Äôve seen a lot of amazing things on the Switch 1. But the stuff they seem to be rolling out for GTA 6 is possibly beyond that." "It seems a step beyond," he added, "and out of character with what we know about Rockstar‚Äôs M.O." Nintendo tweeted on November 5, 2024 that the "successor to the Nintendo Switch" will also be able to play original Switch software. This had been rumored and reported previously, but the gaming giant cleared up any questions about Switch owners making a graceful transition to the new device. At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. A physical copy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was shown in the trailer. However, there was a caveat: Some games may not be supported or work in full. While we don't know for sure yet, it's likely that some games designed for the size and shape of the original Joy-Cons‚Äîlike fitness game Ring Fit Adventure, which had players snap their controllers into an accessory shell‚Äîsimply won't work with the Switch 2 controllers. The other lingering question about backwards compatibility is whether the Switch games will simply run as-is, or if they will take advantage of the Switch 2's expected performance bump‚Äîwhether that's an automatic upgrade, or one that developers may need to code and patch in. A report from Eurogamer in February 2024 suggested that Nintendo will let users play their original Switch games (both physical and digital) in the Switch 2 hardware with enhancements. Developers will reportedly need to update their games to unlock such upgrades, however, which means not every game will necessarily take advantage of the Switch 2's improved power.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As stablecoin legislation races toward the finish line in both chambers of Congress, crypto leaders have issued increasingly direct appeals to make those bills more favorable to their industry‚Äîbut they're encountering resistance from lawmakers. One emergent sticking point has been whether U.S.-regulated stablecoins should be allowed to generate interest for holders moving forward. On Coinbase, for instance, users can currently earn 4.1% APY on their USDC deposits‚Äîan attractive feature that could at scale make stablecoins competitive with traditional bank savings accounts, which offer much lower interest rates. But as currently written, bills in the House and Senate on the subject forbid stablecoins from offering users interest or yield to their holders. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar that allow crypto traders to enter and exit positions without the need to access dollars directly, and underpin the entire crypto economy to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in daily volume. In a sharp statement posted to X, Armstrong argued that if Congress prevented stablecoins from generating interest, the government would effectively be ‚Äúput[ting] it‚Äôs thumb on the scale to benefit‚Äù the banking industry over crypto. Within hours, however, the top Republican lawmaker shepherding stablecoin legislation through the House poured cold water on that argument, shutting down Armstrong‚Äôs request. ‚ÄúIt's not going to be an investment per se. In response to a question from Decrypt about Armstrong and Coinbase‚Äôs position‚Äîthat such a law as written could unfairly benefit banks‚ÄîRep. Hill and the House Financial Services Committee are set to mark up their stablecoin bill, the STABLE Act, on Wednesday. Decrypt reached out to Coinbase regarding Hill‚Äôs position on the subject, but did not immediately receive a response. As stablecoin issuers have jockeyed to prepare offerings in the expectation of the passage of related legislation, interest and yield have emerged as key selling points for such products. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre giving these people this unchained banking apparatus that allows them to have dollars that are maybe earning 4%, 5%, 6%, right in their account, where they can pay directly at any source of consumerism,‚Äù Chase Herro, a co-founder of World Liberty, said onstage, referring to stablecoins. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve looked past the most simple idea,‚Äù Herro said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The token, whose proponents use the tagline ‚Äúhot air rises‚Äù when promoting its glide higher, has reclaimed a $500 million market cap after crashing to approximately $200 million in early March. However, FARTCOIN still remains about 78% off its all-time high of $2.48 from February. Fartcoin‚Äôs place as the top meme coin leader on April Fool‚Äôs Day may be a coincidence, but the token‚Äôs rebound of more than 108% in the last month comes amid an apparent sentiment shift among Solana meme coin traders as they hope for another potential run for the token. Nothing else like this is happening in the meme coin space,‚Äù posted pseudonymous crypto personality Artchick on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday. She added that Fartcoin could be ‚Äúa Trojan horse for the entire meme coin sector.‚Äù The token‚Äôs mindshare is growing, as well, based both on X activity and on-chain data. The name for Fartcoin was dreamed up by an AI chatbot, and data related to its mindshare is being tracked alongside other AI agent tokens via analytics platform Cookie.fun. Will the Fartcoin bounce help propel a potential meme coin comeback? It may be too early to tell, but Pump.fun token launchpad co-founder Alon Cohen told Decrypt in late March that he believes meme coins are here to stay. The meme category has jumped by more than 5% in the last 24 hours while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained approximately 2% and 4% respectively, according to data from CoinGecko.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin‚Äôs recent tumble to $82,000 has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market. But as the market digests this correction, attention is shifting toward emerging projects offering more innovative and stable opportunities. Bitcoin‚Äôs value slipping to $82,000 may not sound like a crash compared to its phenomenal peaks, but it signals the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the crypto market. The dip in Bitcoin has prompted many investors to explore alternative ventures, with projects like RUVI stepping forward as potential beacons of growth. By merging tangible utility with decentralized technology, RUVI stands out as a promising contender, particularly for those seeking innovation beyond Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. RUVI‚Äôs AI-Driven Vision: A New Era for Blockchain RUVI‚Äôs core innovation lies in its ability to integrate artificial intelligence into blockchain technology. Unlike speculative meme coins or traditional cryptocurrencies, RUVI provides a platform where AI-driven tools can be accessed by developers, enterprises, and individuals alike. The decentralized ecosystem designed by RUVI looks to tackle real-world challenges with AI solutions that offer insights, data management, and resource optimization. RUVI‚Äôs token presale is structured to attract and reward its early supporters generously. This investor would walk away with a total of 1,000,000 tokens. With RUVI‚Äôs projected listing price set at $0.07, this $5,000 investment could potentially generate $70,000 in value. That‚Äôs an astounding 1,300% ROI, effectively multiplying the initial investment by 14 times. Combining VIP bonuses with these additional rewards ensures that investors at every level have a chance to maximize their return, making the presale both competitive and inclusive. Token holders gain access to a variety of utilities, including premium AI tools and voting rights within the platform‚Äôs governance system. Unlike many tokens that hinge entirely on market speculation, $RUVI is purpose-built for real-world applications. This emphasis on utility gives $RUVI staying power beyond the headlines of a booming presale. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price drop is a reminder of the crypto market‚Äôs volatility, but it also highlights the importance of diversification and seeking out projects with true innovation. RUVI‚Äôs AI-powered ecosystem and user-focused presale incentives offer investors an unparalleled opportunity to step into the future of blockchain. With its presale already sparking interest, RUVI could set the stage for a new era of crypto innovation. The next chapter of blockchain innovation is here, and it‚Äôs waiting for you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UK police recovered approximately $671,000 (¬£520,000) in crypto that was fraudulently obtained from an 80-year-old man, in what lawyers involved with the retrieval are describing as a British first under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Working in collaboration with legal firms Edmonds Marshall McMahon and 5SAH, as well as professional services company Grant Thornton, police were able to trace the misappropriated crypto via wallet addresses supplied by the victim, known only as Mr A. Mr A had sent upwards of 9.1 BTC to fraudsters posing as exchange operators, with authorities able to establish that the Bitcoin had been converted into USDT by the perpetrators and sent on to an account with an ‚Äúoverseas exchange.‚Äù At least $7.7 million (¬£6 million) in misbegotten crypto has now been retrieved by British police using the new crypto freezing orders, according to data from the HM Courts & Tribunals Service. Fairbrother also explained that the process of retrieval operates within a civil regime but in criminal courts, which is unusual for the UK and which also means it requires lawyers with ‚Äúvery particular expertise‚Äù to execute properly. However, this is where challenges can arise, given that police forces in the UK can be uncertain about how much support to provide to victims beyond specific criminal investigations. ‚ÄúBut if the Police are willing to collaborate closely with victims and their legal representatives, as was the case here, this new legislation could be the silver bullet to addressing cross-border crypto fraud on a much larger scale in this country,‚Äù Fairbrother added. He said, ‚Äúgiven the unique nature of blockchain public distributed ledgers, it can actually be easier to recover crypto assets compared to traditional fiat asset recovery.‚Äù Yet ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù legislative work may be needed in order to facilitate more cooperation between the police and victims, while Fairbrother also suggests that forces would benefit from ‚Äúthe creation of dedicated cyber pursuit teams.‚Äù Despite these challenges, Fairbrother is optimistic that this recent case marks the opening of a new phase in crypto law enforcement in the UK.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings purchased 8,888 Bitcoin in the first quarter, adding $735 million worth of the asset to its reserves on Tuesday alongside its latest attestation report. Three months ago, Tether padded its reserves with $777 million worth of Bitcoin. Tether meanwhile reported record-breaking profits of $4.5 billion the first quarter, saying $1 billion flowed from massive holdings of U.S. Treasuries in a new attestation report. The El Salvador-based firm said it now holds $90.87 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries, which mirrors Germany‚Äôs holdings of U.S. debt in early 2024, per U.S. Treasury Department data. Within the company‚Äôs reserves, which includes cash equivalents and other investments, Tether says it holds $5.4 billion worth of Bitcoin and $3.65 billion worth of gold. The company said in May 2023 that it would allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits to the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency. At the time, its Bitcoin holdings were worth around $1.5 billion. Bitcoin‚Äôs price fell 12% over the same period, according to the crypto data provider CoinGlass, suggesting gold played a major part in what Tether says is a new high-water mark. In addition to the stablecoin Tether, which has a total value of around $144 billion, the company issues Tether Gold, which is worth $780 million, according to CoinGecko. For years, Tether has published attestation reports, while competitors and critics have consistently pointed out that they are not audited financial statements. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Reuters this month that a full audit is the company‚Äôs top priority. They are often backed by a mix of cash and U.S. Treasuries. Tether‚Äôs record-breaking profits come as lawmakers debate stablecoin legislation on Capitol Hill, which may provide a pathway to legality for stablecoin issuers in the U.S. for the first time. Based on the bill‚Äôs draft language, JP Morgan analysts also think Tether may have to change the structure of reserves backing its leading stablecoin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although some collectors have left NFTs for dead, Canary Capital believes the asset class could find fans on Wall Street. In a recent interview with Decrypt, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg suggested the NFT market could soon experience a revival, with chatter about funds tracking NFT prices potentially stoking investor interest in digital art collectibles. Although an NFT-backed ETF might have been unthinkable a few years ago, the likelihood that such a fund could become available to U.S. investors has increased as federal regulators embrace new, crypto-friendly regulations and as ‚Äúmore liquid‚Äù NFTs have come to market, McClurg told Decrypt. ‚ÄúToday's SEC is more open to actively managed products, and more liquid ‚Äòdigital art‚Äô has been created,‚Äù McClurg said. The executive‚Äôs comments come just 10 days after Canary Capital filed to launch a Pudgy Penguins and PENGU ETF in the U.S.‚Äîa move that divided Crypto Twitter. Experts previously told Decrypt that putting NFTs into ETF wrappers could present structural and technical issues, with the relative illiquidity of NFTs also posing market-making problems. However, digital art proponents have expressed hope that an NFT-based ETF could revitalize the languishing NFT market. Last year, the NFT market slumped to a three-year low, with both sales and trading volumes slumping nearly 20% compared to the year prior, according to Web3 data provider DappRadar‚Äôs 2024 Industry report. Meanwhile, popular NFT collections such as Pudgy Penguins, Crypto Punks and Milady Maker have lost 30%, 7% and 17% of their values in the past year, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. Despite that market downturn, McClurg is optimistic digital art is on a path toward wider adoption in the near future.</p>

Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed firm Metaplanet just grabbed another 696 Bitcoin (BTC)‚Äîits most recent step in a bid to build one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in the world. The Japanese investment company said it had acquired the coins as part of its Bitcoin Income Generation strategy, which involves selling put options and using the collateral to purchase Bitcoin at an effective discount, in a statement released Tuesday. Metaplanet acquired 645.74 BTC when cash-secured put options they sold were exercised, and received 50.26 BTC as premiums from selling those options‚Äîbringing the total to 696 BTC added in the quarter, the company said. That strategy generated over $5.1 million (¬•770 million) in premiums in Q1 2025 alone‚Äîan 11.4% increase from the previous quarter‚Äîwhile also enabling the company to acquire Bitcoin at an effective price of just $88,800 per coin (¬•13.48 million), below market rates at the time of execution. Tuesday‚Äôs announcement is the latest in a string of moves that point to Metaplanet‚Äôs transformation into a full-blown Bitcoin treasury. The company has now amassed 3,896 BTC through a mix of strategic options trading and capital raises. At current prices, its Bitcoin holdings are worth over $324 million. To fund its accumulation, Metaplanet approved a $13.3 million (¬•2 billion) zero-coupon bond issuance on March 31. That followed a $25.9 billion raise completed in February through unsecured bonds and stock acquisition rights issued to EVO FUND.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China‚Äôs Communist Party announced today in a surprise move that it would be reversing its stance on Bitcoin mining, legalizing mining for Chinese entities and individuals. In 2021, the Chinese government banned Bitcoin mining, citing risks of capital flight, environmental challenges, and competition to their nation‚Äôs digital currencies. Allegedly, Bitmain skirted US sanctions on providing companies such as Huawei with AI chips. Latley, US based Bitcoin miners have been facing seizures by customs of Bitmain miners without much explanation, as reported on by Blockspace. With rising tensions in trade wars, combined with the legalization of Chinese mining, many are fearful that China will restrict exports of Bitcoin mining machines to the west, meaning that the United States would be at a serious disadvantage. Luxor estimates that the United States currently has roughly 36% of the world‚Äôs hashrate with 17% of it estimated to be located in Texas. China has been facing many economic headwinds due to the fall out of their restrictive Covid- 19 response, the deflation of their real estate bubble and the general global economic downturn and may be looking at Bitcoin as a way to help jump start their faltering economy. There are some hopes though for preventing complete network centralization. ‚ÄúTSMC, based in Taiwan, could stop providing ASIC chips to Chinese manufacturers,‚Äù said Jason Les, CEO of Riot Platforms. ‚ÄúThis would hurt Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralization and could escalate tensions with China.‚Äù he explained. In recent yrars, China has been floating the idea of invading Taiwan. If China were to invade the island nation, that would only raise tensions with the west who has been on and off on whether they would provide military protections to Taiwan in the case of military conflict. Chinese premier Xi Xinping has reportedly been meeting with Kim Jong Un in recent months, learning about the North Korean Bitcoin strategy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, the Atlantic released a series of unredacted messages from a Signal chat including various Trump administration officials discussing the administration‚Äôs desire to nationalize Strategy (formally Microstrategy) as a way to bolster the United States Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in a ‚Äúbudget neutral‚Äù manner. Saylor is prepared to run damage control from potential fallout. 1045: Discussing strategies with social media influencers to spin narrative away from this being an executive order 6102 like event. 1055: President is concerned David Bailey will uninvite him from the Bitcoin conference if he makes this move. 1130: Brian Armstrong is also asking for Coinbase to be nationalized as well. 1145: POTUS is advising to hold off until more research can be done on potential implications to his meme coin prices. Why defense secretary Pete Hegseth is involved: Bitcoin seems to be a growing part of the Trump Administration‚Äôs national security policy. Financial sovereignty is a substantial part of national defense. Some speculate that Donald Trump is very proud of the way that Hegseth handled the bombing of Yemen last week. Why it matters: Many Bitcoin users have been critical of Strategy, due to its close proximity to Langley, VA as well its choice to custody funds with Coinbase, who also custody funds for the United States government. The leaked Signal group chat log suggests that Strategy may have been operating as a front for the US government to amass a large portion of Bitcoin. A common saying in the Bitcoin community is ‚ÄúNot your keys, not your coins,‚Äù pointing to how the digital currency could be arbitrarily confiscated by governments if held by 3rd parties. What Hegseth is saying: It appears Hegseth understands this will likely be an unpopular move both in the business world and the Bitcoin ecosystem. When a government nationalizes a company in order to take control of their assets, it can cause uncertainty in the business world. It seems that the Trump administration is working with a series of media personalities and influencers to try and craft a narrative in an effort to manage any tensions or fallout that could result from this move. How this could impact Bitcoin Price: Analysts we have talked with are ambivalent on how the nationalization of Strategy could impact the price of Bitcoin. In the short term it may cause fear and uncertainty leading to a sell off, but many believe that it‚Äôs good for price in the long term as once again, it would be a vote of confidence in the digital currency from the world‚Äôs most powerful government. In 1962 the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented a plan to President Kennedy called Operation Northwoods in which acts of terrorism carried out by US intelligence agencies would be committed on US soil in an attempt to manufacture consent for the invasion of Cuba.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week rumours circulated that Swan‚Äôs HR department advised their C Suite to take a mental health day following the shocking ‚ÄòMaxi Madness‚Äô results of X (Previously Twitter). During the seven rounds of polling, Bitcoin maximalists followed in horror as Twitter villain and rumored felon Teddy Bitcoin overtook the prestigious news agency‚Äôs race with a wild voter turnout that put to shame Biden‚Äôs 2020 successful US elections sweep. In the PODCONF sponsored showdown, Teddy Bitcoin beat legendary Bitcoin maximalists including Greg Zaj, Hodl Magoo, Adam Back, the lovely Lyn Alden and defending champion Yellow, concluding the ‚ÄòMaxi‚Äô championship by defeating Strategy CEO Michael Saylor by a large margin.The final poll drew over 90 thousand votes, a record in the championship‚Äôs history. The social media platform increasingly roared with ‚Äòrees‚Äô and accusations as Bitcoin purists searched for who to blame. Swan‚Äôs C Suite was seen protesting Teddy Bitcoin in numerous online posts, calling him a scammer, before simmering down during the alleged mental health day. Text for image: Swan co-founder tweeted in support of inventor of proof-of-work Adam Beck competing agiainst his fellow $MSTR enthusiets Teddy Bitcoin Ashley Marchetta, Swan‚Äôs head of Culture and People answered our request for comment: ‚ÄúIdentity is central not only to Swan Bitcoin‚Äôs marketing and sales strategy but to our culture as a Bitcoin company. In our team‚Äôs view, The Bugle has slandered Bitcoin Maximalism by letting shitcoiners like Jason Williams and Teddy Bitcoins into this prestigious Maxi only tournament. These outcomes created immense mental damage to our community. We know this has been tough on the ecosystem, and are now providing community crisis counseling.‚Äù Marchetta added that they would be tasking Swan‚Äôs HR department with offering their counseling services to the broader community to help reaffirm their identities as Bitcoin maxis. Is this good use of the firm‚Äôs resources? Many expect this move will help gain favor for Swan in the Bitcoin community which has seen a rise of Antiswanitism over the last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decrypt‚Äôs Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Grayscale Investments, one of the largest Bitcoin ETF issuers, filed to convert its existing private Digital Large Cap Fund to a publicly available exchange traded fund (ETF). It currently contains Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The existing private fund, which is only available to accredited investors through private placement, heavily leans towards Bitcoin with a 79.4% weighting, at the time of writing. If successful, the conversion of this fund into an ETF would enable everyday investors to gain exposure to the crypto market. Currently only qualified investors could access Grayscale‚Äôs Digital Large Cap Fund. This has included Ethereum ETFs that passed in May before a hybrid Bitcoin-Ethereum fund was also approved. At the time of writing, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs contain $97.27 billion worth of assets under management and Ethereum ETFs have $8.59 billion assets under management, according to CoinGlass. With Donald Trump winning the U.S. Presidential election, many issuers have seen it as the start of a new regulatory environment and have filed for more experimental crypto funds. As such, we‚Äôve seen ETF filings for the likes of Dogecoin, Bonk, and even the official Donald Trump meme coin‚Äînone of which have been approved as of yet. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas speculated that the DOGE and TRUMP ETFs could hit the market in early April, due to the specific filing type compared to other crypto ETF filings. However, predictors on Myriad Markets believe this is unlikely with 93% of voters believing there will not be a TRUMP ETF by the end of April.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This shift underscores the rapidly changing dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, where even long-standing digital assets must contend with market forces and emerging competitors. Amidst this volatility, a new project, RUVI AI, has captured the attention of investors with its promise of merging artificial intelligence and blockchain technology through its upcoming token launch. Whether it‚Äôs creative development, data analysis, or automation, RUVI aims to provide an integrated system that makes technology more accessible and interactive. What sets RUVI apart is its emphasis on community-driven growth. RUVI‚Äôs innovative token system allows users not just to benefit from its technology but also to share in the platform‚Äôs success. RUVI‚Äôs presale introduces a thoughtfully designed bonus system to reward early adopters. One example is the VIP 2 tier, which offers an attractive 40% bonus for participants who purchase 50,000 $RUVI tokens. To enhance the excitement, RUVI introduces Top Holder Rewards that further incentivize active participation. Investors ranking among the top tiers in the presale leaderboard can secure substantial bonus allocations, with rewards as high as 500,000 tokens. These bonuses are stackable with the VIP rewards, allowing committed investors to exponentially grow their holdings. This combination of tiered bonuses and rewards for prominent holders creates a dynamic and engaging presale experience unlike many others in the market. RUVI takes transparency and fairness seriously, embedding these principles into its presale mechanics. A real-time leaderboard ensures that participants can monitor rankings and reward distributions openly. Additionally, RUVI has excluded team wallets from the reward system, ensuring a level playing field for all investors. Participants have the ability to increase their investments across presale phases without incurring penalties. This enables investors to adjust their contributions as their confidence in the project grows, making RUVI‚Äôs presale both beginner and veteran-friendly. Token holders can participate in RUVI‚Äôs staking program, earning passive income simply by holding their tokens while contributing to the network‚Äôs stability. Additionally, RUVI encourages active participation through its governance model, allowing token holders to vote on platform developments and strategic decisions. RUVI also incentivizes user contributions to its AI tools. For example, users who help train AI models or improve their functionality are rewarded with additional tokens. This dual approach of technological utility and financial reward makes $RUVI a token with long-term appeal, beyond speculative trading. With its transparent presale structure, enticing rewards system, and focus on utility, RUVI is positioned as a strong contender for investors seeking opportunities in the decentralized future. For those looking to be part of this groundbreaking movement, RUVI‚Äôs presale offers an ideal gateway. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Saylor, you were forced to realise that all the store-of-value assets are defective and pushed you to focus on the only asset that is not. That does not make you immune to seeing the medium of exchange case. You will see how the housing market is huge when you watch it from one point of view and horrible from another. But if you experience pain driving you to keep your billions of dollars purchasing power, housing is a decent tool to keep it. Even though the fiat system increasingly separates money‚Äôs functions, that doesn‚Äôt mean it should. I get that saying Bitcoin is a medium of exchange is kicking the hornet‚Äôs nest, and all the other currency lords will try to stop Bitcoin. That will give all the billionaires certainty that they can put money in it, but simply using Bitcoin just to store value is attacking it. That approach will turn it into digital gold 2.0, captured. That value is there exactly because it can move and still can be used as a medium of exchange. An oxygen tank is vital for reserves, but breathing matters more. Without that, the store of value means nothing. Michael, you learned this firsthand when your million-dollar holdings in Argentina were diluted by 90%. You struggled to preserve the value not because you did not see it coming but because you couldn‚Äôt use it as a medium of exchange. True, a poor store of value weakens the medium of exchange, but why does the latter take priority? Because the ability to exchange is what lets you respond. By now, most people exposed to Bitcoin know the chart from Jesse Mayers that you popularized. You claim there‚Äôs no better idea than a $900 trillion clean store of value, then immediately call Bitcoin one of the world‚Äôs most liquid markets, running 24/7/365. Regulations and taxes make trading real estate even tougher. Still, since it‚Äôs more than 100 times better as a store of value, billionaires prize it, increasingly dominating the market and pricing out younger generations. A house might be valuable, but its worth grows not just from what it is but from its ties to nearby utilities. Build a road to it, and the value rises. Add a superstore or a gas station, or connect it to the electrical grid, and the value climbs again. But I see the flip side: if you‚Äôre a billionaire and everyone‚Äôs after your resources, you don‚Äôt want a big network around your house. It‚Äôs better than houses in that sense, but the numbers still show people primarily use it as a store of value. Take your MicroStrategy stock‚Äîyou know it better than anyone. How much value did it store last year, and how much was exchanged through it? The art industry‚Äôs yearly transactions are so minor that they don‚Äôt even register on the chart. Meanwhile, the cars and collectibles sector sees trading volumes of nearly $4 trillion annually. This highlights that they‚Äôre mostly seen as a store of value each year, but it also reveals how poorly the housing market performs as a medium of exchange‚Äîoutdone even by the car market. Gold bugs rave that it‚Äôs been around for over 5,000 years, calling it the ultimate store of value for whatever reason‚Äîyet it‚Äôs just 1.78% of the store of value market. This shows that once its medium of exchange role was stripped away, it became vulnerable to capture and manipulation. Sorry, gold bugs, that genie‚Äôs not going back in the lamp. Gold holds $16 trillion in value, and the gold bugs claim it could store the $120 trillion worth of money in it. Is gold a better medium of exchange, then? It trades at $54 trillion yearly, boosted by derivatives, making its medium of exchange use 3.5 times its store of value role. Money might not dominate as a store of value among assets, but it‚Äôs the leading medium of exchange by far. Other stores of value assets don‚Äôt even come close. What would the medium of exchange value be if 2 billion unbanked people were included? How many more transactions would that spark? Where does Bitcoin fit into all of this? The prevailing narrative urges holders never to sell, positioning Bitcoin solely as a store of value. Yet, the market tells a different story. Factor in the Lightning Network (though its exact figures remain elusive), and the total likely approaches $4 trillion. So, what happens if that long-standing ‚Äúhold forever‚Äù propaganda narrative begins to fade? Bonds and equities are financial ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù that pretend to be money because fiat currency is flawed. This creates a market that shuts out much of the population from safeguarding their wealth, further splitting money‚Äôs store of value role. Or are they just tools to siphon value from the fiat medium of exchange, channeling it to privileged individuals and billionaires and others alike with a need to hoard? Globally, only 10-20% of people have exposure to bonds, mostly indirectly through pension or investment funds, not directly. For equities, 15-25% of the population has some access. That leaves at best 80% of humanity without these tools to protect themselves, making them vulnerable to exploitation. This amplifies the ‚Äúcantillion effect‚Äù: those who can print the medium of exchange buy up store-of-value assets, sidelining 80% or more of people. It‚Äôs a feedback loop that weakens the system, widening the gap between haves and have-nots. That is creating so much friction in the whole system, and it contributes to excluding the have-nots from storing their value. At this point, the medium of exchange turns more and more into the medium of extraction rather than for exchange. This is also a reason why the store of value case is more appealing in the fiat system. Bitcoin is not pretending to be money like everything else; it is the first engineered money that doesn‚Äôt erode like a melting ice cube and doesn‚Äôt discriminate. Moving away from chasing money to store in something and instead building whatever enriches their lives on top of Bitcoin. The biggest idea isn‚Äôt storing value‚Äîit‚Äôs moving it. Meanwhile, those starting their careers focus more on receiving value than storing what they don‚Äôt yet have. Why does the store of value case draw so much attention? One reason could be the effort involved. With a store of value, you buy and hodl‚Äîno work needed to improve your life. With a medium of exchange, you must work to grow your savings, persuading others to pay for your goods or services in Bitcoin. That shift isn‚Äôt tough for much of the world‚Äôs population, who lack savings or assets anyway. This might explain why the current system resists letting them exit, pushing dependency by offering to custody their Bitcoin‚Äîtrading one reliance for another. Even ossification ties into the need for more mediums of exchange use. You, Michael, strongly support ossification, but if Bitcoin isn‚Äôt used to reach more people, you‚Äôre delaying it. Unlike you, America knew that to make the dollar the world‚Äôs reserve currency, they had to distribute it widely to lock in the network effect. They saw the network as the key to ossification, and it worked easily since printing and sharing bills cost little. With Bitcoin, its absolute scarcity requires balancing how much to spread versus store. True, but it overlooks the need for a steady food income to stay alive before storing fat. Without income, there‚Äôs nothing to store‚Äîso exchange comes first. Yet, for someone not worried about hunger, the focus shifts to storing food to prevent spoilage. I keep hammering this point to highlight your bias toward the store of value, which skews your judgment and misleads others. At this stage of my Bitcoin journey, I‚Äôm certain of this: chasing money corrupts you. With Bitcoin, that‚Äôs entirely possible, and every Bitcoiner should be ready with an answer for when it happens. Chasing money, though, is a bottomless pit you can‚Äôt fill. I agree, but how does it play out? Saylor, you‚Äôre not attacking the dollar as some believe‚Äîyou‚Äôre bolstering it by boosting your stock and its ecosystem. Instead, you‚Äôre speculatively hitting those who fund your Bitcoin buys. You‚Äôre not just hurting them; by strengthening the dollar, you‚Äôre amplifying the pain for other currency holders. I wonder if people would want to invest their Bitcoin in your securities. I‚Äôm sure true Bitcoin maximalists wouldn‚Äôt trade their perfect store of value asset for a fiat ‚Äúinstrument.‚Äù Ask yourself: at this point, would you spend your Bitcoin to buy Apple stock? You did invest in them before, after all. It makes no sense‚ÄîI‚Äôd give you Bitcoin just for you to turn it into some fiat thing, pay fiat fees, bolster fiat custodians and third parties, only so you can buy Bitcoin again on the other end. Though it‚Äôs written to you, Michael, it‚Äôs aimed at those who see you as the new Bitcoin Jesus, blindly following without questioning your actions. They make reckless bets in their own lives‚Äîbets that could wipe out their Bitcoin‚Äîlacking the financial safeguards and interest rates you have. Your messages, which they echo, don‚Äôt apply to most of humanity. Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just another asset or financial tool‚Äîit‚Äôs borderless, permissionless money for the people. Treating it otherwise diminishes its true worth. Merely storing it won‚Äôt bring freedom. Letting sats flow fosters cooperation for a better future. Store some for tomorrow, but do not be the richest man in the grave‚Äîsave them for plans that keep them moving later. This is a guest post by Ivan Makedonski.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six of the top eight cryptocurrencies by market cap have seen modest gains Tuesday morning, with crypto majors led by Dogecoin and Cardano (ADA) notching gains of up to 5.2% and 5.9% each. Data on CoinGecko also shows green over the past 24 hours across Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and Solana. Despite this, data from DefiLlama shows that Solana is catching up, with a 32% uptick over the week against Ethereum's 14%. Still, Dune data shows that Solana-based meme coin volume has dropped to just below $100 million from up to $390 million in January. Those modest gains show "renewed optimism for the new quarter," driven by "a market rebound as Trump's tariff concerns have been fully absorbed," Dominick John, an analyst at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. Users on MYRIAD, the decentralized prediction market launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, mirrored that sentiment. If no "fresh tariff developments or macroeconomic shocks" show up within the week, such a trend could persist. The broad-based rally, while modest, comes after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and tech equities indexed in the S&P 500 "logged their worst quarterly performance in three years," according to research from QCP Capital. Some risk over a "broad and aggressive regime" may also "deepen recession fears," QCP noted. Broader macroeconomic factors, such as President Donald Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs, are expected to draw persisting volatility by Wednesday, followed by the release of the jobless claims report on Thursday. These numbers could trigger a broader risk-off response that would drive crypto markets alongside risk assets.</p>

Bella said tensions began in October 2024 during the launch of BoGX‚Äôs Ethereal NFT Collection, which promised exclusive staking rights and gameplay benefits. BoGX: A Confession After weeks of silence while exploring every possible avenue to save the project and consulting with legal advisors, I must finally share the truth behind what's happened with BoGX. Being suddenly blocked on all communication channels by @BladeofgodX founder,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/5v02wBdfq6 ‚Äî AmberBella.eth (@0xAmberBella) April 1, 2025 Amber Bella has not responded to Decrypt‚Äôs request for additional comment. Despite being funded primarily by Web3 contributions, Bella said the development team rejected NFT utilities and community proposals. During the game‚Äôs third test phase, her team discovered internal developer accounts competing on public leaderboards and winning real-money prizes meant for players. Backed by some of the biggest names in the crypto investment space‚ÄîOKX Ventures, Delphi Ventures, BreederDAO, Eden Holdings, and others‚ÄîBoGX was marketed as a hybrid action RPG that merged blockchain mechanics with advanced AI. Bella said BoGX‚Äôs founder sidelined Web3 entirely, leading to ‚Äúdelayed payments turning into no payments‚Äù and creating ‚Äúfinancial strain on professionals who devoted months to the project.‚Äù To address the situation, the ex-CMO announced she will use her personal 24.2 ETH to distribute partial compensation via ‚ÄúARB transfers,‚Äù based on an end-of-March snapshot of NFT holders. Blade of God X remains available in early access on the Epic Games Store. The game blends dark Nordic themes with ‚ÄúSouls-like‚Äù combat mechanics and supports optional blockchain features through Immutable X and Ethereum Virtual Machine chains. Void Labs and Tnise Liu Yang have not yet commented publicly on the allegations. Bella closed her thread with a direct message to Liu Yang, ‚ÄúYou've abandoned the project without explanation or basic settlement‚Ä¶ The Web3 community deserves better than promises that evaporate once funding is secured.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardano (ADA) trading around $0.67, with price correcting 10% over the past week Whale holdings dropped to lowest level since February 2023, signaling reduced confidence Cardano (ADA) is currently trading above $0.67 after a slight recovery of 2.2% in the past 24 hours. This continues the longer-term bearish pattern in ADA‚Äôs price movement throughout recent market activity. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has surged to 40.19 from 15.83 just four days ago, confirming that the bearish trend is not only present but gaining strength. The ADX is a key trend strength indicator that measures momentum regardless of direction. With readings above 40, it shows the current downtrend is powerful and potentially accelerating. Whale activity has also raised concerns for ADA supporters. This reduction brings whale holdings to their lowest level since February 2023. The behavior of these large holders often precedes broader market trends, suggesting reduced confidence in ADA‚Äôs short-term prospects. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in negative territory. This technical setup gives a slight advantage to bearish forces in the near term. ADA recently retested the critical support level at $0.64 and managed to hold. Despite these bearish signals, not all news for Cardano has been negative. The project ranks 18th in total value locked (TVL) with nearly $333 million, but its market capitalization stands at $23.1 billion ‚Äì about 69 times its TVL. Cardano Foundation executives have countered that the project focuses primarily on marketing the blockchain for real-world applications like identity verification and record-keeping rather than trending DeFi applications. The price has made three consecutive lower highs, briefly breaking below $0.660 support before retracing. Some analysts remain optimistic about Cardano‚Äôs future despite the current warnings. There are projections of potential growth, possibly reaching higher price targets by 2025. This connection could provide the Cardano ecosystem with added liquidity, potentially attracting more investors to ADA.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump plans to announce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs averaging 15% on April 2 Bitcoin and crypto markets are affected by these macroeconomic conditions, with BTC trading at $83,230 The bank warns that Trump‚Äôs trade policies could lead to slower growth, higher inflation, and rising unemployment. This marks the bank‚Äôs second upward revision to its 2025 US tariff expectations in March alone. Most of this change comes from more aggressive ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs that Trump is expected to announce. The bank also raised its year-end core PCE inflation forecast to 3.5%. This is 0.5 percentage points higher than earlier estimates and well above the Federal Reserve‚Äôs 2% target. According to Goldman, three key factors are driving the rising recession probability. These include a lower growth baseline, worsening household and business confidence, and ‚Äústatements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness.‚Äù The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump is pushing his team toward even more aggressive levies. These could mean an across-the-board hit of 20% to US trading partners. Peter Navarro, White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, told Fox News Sunday that Trump‚Äôs tariffs could raise as much as $600 billion a year. This would represent a major tax increase that could raise costs for many Americans. The economic outlook presents what some analysts call a ‚Äústagflation‚Äù risk. The crypto market has not been immune to these macroeconomic concerns. Bitcoin and other digital assets edged lower following Goldman‚Äôs warning. While cryptocurrencies were once viewed as uncorrelated to traditional economic factors, that narrative has changed. Bitcoin has become increasingly responsive to broader macro conditions, particularly liquidity, risk sentiment, and real yields. Some experts see a potential silver lining for Bitcoin during economic downturns. Robbie Mitchnick, Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, suggested that recessions can actually benefit Bitcoin in the long term. Mitchnick explained that recessions typically lead to more fiscal spending, debt accumulation, and monetary stimulus. These factors can support Bitcoin prices over time, even if there are short-term challenges.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DOGE is maintaining support above its long-term ascending channel dating back to 2015 Large wallet holders (whales) continue to accumulate despite price decline Dogecoin has been on a downward trend since early March, losing most of its late 2024 gains and breaking below key support levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped into extreme oversold territory. The daily RSI is currently at 32-33, approaching but not yet in oversold territory. These readings suggest heavy selling pressure but also indicate the potential for a price correction as buyers may see opportunity at these levels. One analyst on TradingView gives a 30-40% probability of DOGE dropping further to the $0.158-$0.159 support area. Despite the short-term bearish outlook, long-term technical indicators show reasons for optimism. The Accumulation/Distribution Line measured 20.28 billion DOGE recently, indicating that long-term holders continue to accumulate coins even as prices consolidate. Wallet data from Santiment shows that large holders aren‚Äôt rushing to sell. This suggests larger players may be positioning for potential upside. Elon Musk recently addressed speculation about government use of Dogecoin. by May, having set a goal to accomplish the agency‚Äôs mandate within 130 days. He told Fox News, ‚ÄúI think we will have accomplished most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that timeframe.‚Äù Crypto analysts remain divided on DOGE‚Äôs future price action. #Dogecoin $DOGE continues to hold above the lower boundary of this channel.

For near-term price action, market watchers are focused on how Dogecoin reacts at the current $0.165 level. If buyers step in, a move toward $0.172 or higher could happen quickly. But if selling pressure continues, DOGE might extend its decline before attempting recovery. While price holds above its decade-long ascending channel and large wallets quietly accumulate, confirming a bullish trend will require a sustained breakout above $0.18. If momentum builds, mid-range targets between $0.27 and $0.56 could come into play.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led the investment with a $30 billion commitment. The deal structure includes an initial $10 billion upfront payment. SoftBank‚Äôs investment could be reduced to as low as $20 billion if OpenAI fails to restructure into a for-profit entity by December 31. This unusual arrangement has been challenged in court by Elon Musk, one of OpenAI‚Äôs co-founders. The valuation places OpenAI just behind Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, which is valued at $350 billion. It ties Chinese company ByteDance, owner of TikTok, among the world‚Äôs most valuable private companies. About $18 billion will likely go toward OpenAI‚Äôs commitment to the Stargate Project. The Stargate Project is a $500 billion initiative announced in January. OpenAI revealed that ChatGPT now serves 500 million people every week. This represents a big jump from the 400 million users reported last month. CEO Sam Altman shared on X (formerly Twitter) that ChatGPT added two million users over five days. He later noted that the platform gained one million users in a single hour. The surge in usage followed a major upgrade to ChatGPT‚Äôs image generation features. The new capability went viral for its ability to create Studio Ghibli-inspired AI art. The tool proved so popular that Altman asked users to slow down. He said the high usage was ‚Äúmelting OpenAI‚Äôs GPUs‚Äù and announced temporary rate limits. This will be OpenAI‚Äôs first open model since GPT-2, featuring reasoning capabilities. The investment comes amid changes in OpenAI‚Äôs leadership structure. Altman is shifting focus away from day-to-day operations to concentrate more on research and product development. Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap will take on an expanded role. He will oversee business operations while Altman focuses on advancing the company‚Äôs AI capabilities. Despite massive growth, OpenAI continues to burn through cash. However, projections suggest OpenAI won‚Äôt become cash flow positive until 2029. By then, the company forecasts annual revenue of $125 billion. Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital and an investor in OpenAI, has suggested the company may eventually go public. He told investors that OpenAI is among the next wave of anticipated IPOs in his portfolio. Ant Group‚Äôs $14 billion raise in 2018 previously held the title for largest private tech funding round. OpenAI‚Äôs investment comes shortly after AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave made its public debut. However, CoreWeave has faced challenges, with its stock falling more than 7% on Monday after an unchanged first day of trading.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase shares have fallen approximately 31%, marking their worst performance since the FTX collapse in late 2022 The crypto downturn correlates with economic concerns, including Trump‚Äôs trade war and recession fears Crypto-linked stocks are experiencing sharper declines than Bitcoin itself due to higher volatility Gold has emerged as the preferred hedge against risk, seeing its best quarterly return since 1986 Coinbase (COIN) shares have plunged about 31% this quarter, marking their steepest decline since the FTX exchange collapsed in late 2022. This marks one of its weakest performances despite still showing a 16% gain over the past year. The crypto market‚Äôs struggles come amid growing economic concerns. President Donald Trump‚Äôs escalating global trade war has sparked fears about its impact on the U.S. economy. Cryptocurrency and related stocks, known for their volatility, have been among the first casualties. This pattern mirrors broader market trends, with the S&P 500 heading toward its worst quarter since mid-2022. This includes altcoins like Ethereum that have sold off even faster than Bitcoin. ‚ÄúMany people in the community understand that this is not driven by fundamental reasons,‚Äù said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau. An investment in a company adds the threat of bankruptcy, making these stocks prone to sell off even faster during economic uncertainty. The current market climate presents a stark contrast to early 2025. Optimism ran high after Trump‚Äôs election, with Bitcoin hitting a record above $109,000 on Inauguration Day in January. Gold has emerged as the main hedge against current risks. The precious metal has seen its best quarterly return since 1986, reaching new all-time highs. Bitcoin dropped earlier this month after he created a strategic reserve of the token. The stock has retreated within a descending broadening formation since last November. Major support levels to watch include $146, near last year‚Äôs September swing low. If selling continues below this point, the stock could drop to around $115. Resistance levels to monitor include $206, near the March countertrend peak. President Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù approaches on April 2, when aggressive tariffs are set to take effect. Despite these market struggles, the crypto industry continues gaining influence in Washington. However, this progress hasn‚Äôt translated into a market rebound yet. ‚ÄúWhat we saw a couple months ago, I don‚Äôt know how much crazier it can get than that,‚Äù said Connor Loewen, a cryptocurrency analyst at 3iQ, referring to the previous investor enthusiasm.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Added to this, the amendment also prohibits ‚Äúpublic entities from prohibiting, restricting, or imposing any requirements on that use,‚Äù while also preventing the state of California from imposing taxes on the use of crypto as payment for goods and services. Related to this is a clause which, as Satoshi Action Fund CEO and co-founder Dennis Potter told Decrypt, ‚Äúexplicitly affirms the right of individuals to self-custody their Bitcoin and digital assets.‚Äù While the amended bill may not introduce anything that many cryptocurrency users aren‚Äôt doing already, Potter argued that its introduction is highly significant for California and its stance on crypto. He explained, ‚ÄúThese provisions introduce new legal protections and frameworks that were not previously codified in California law, thereby adding significant new elements to the state‚Äôs approach to digital assets.‚Äù While there is no record of any state official in California openly promoting or launching a cryptocurrency, the ban‚Äôs inclusion could serve as a sweetener for Democrats who may otherwise be reluctant to promote the use of digital currencies. A bill with a similar, albeit federal prohibition against crypto promotion has also been put before Congress, although with both chambers controlled by Republicans, it has almost zero chance of passing, at least not before the 2026 midterms. In a tweet, the Satoshi Action Fund championed the bill, saying that if California passes it, ‚Äúnearly 40 million Americans will have their right to self-custody protected.‚Äù Once passed, nearly 40 million Americans will have their right to self-custody protected! The Satoshi Action Fund, a non-profit Bitcoin advocacy organization founded by former alumni of the first Trump administration, has been instrumental in recent months in meeting with lawmakers and encouraging other states to pass pro-Bitcoin and -crypto legislation. It recently had a hand in the passage of a law in Kentucky which establishes the right of individuals to self-custody crypto, while also confirming that neither mining rewards nor staking rewards are securities. Similarly, it has taken credit for helping to shape the discussion surrounding a BTC strategic reserve bill in Oklahoma, which recently went to the state‚Äôs senate. And for Dennis Potter, California‚Äôs introduction of the Digital Assets bill, along with other similar bills, ‚Äúreflects a broader shift‚Äù in the US towards integrating cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin into legacy financial and legal systems. He added that the amended bill, ‚Äúindicates an evolving attitude where digital currencies are increasingly seen as legitimate financial instruments, warranting regulatory frameworks that both protect consumers and foster innovation.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong advocates for legislation allowing stablecoin holders to earn ‚Äúonchain interest‚Äù Armstrong argues consumers could earn around 4% yield compared to 0.41% average savings account interest Enabling onchain interest could promote dollar dominance globally and benefit the US economy Stablecoin issuers already hold reserves in US Treasuries but typically keep interest rather than distributing it to holders In a March 31 post on social media platform X, Armstrong argued that stablecoin issuers should be ‚Äúallowed to, and incentivized to, share interest with consumers.‚Äù He believes this approach would be ‚Äúconsistent with a free market approach.‚Äù Currently, two competing pieces of federal stablecoin legislation are working through the US legislative process. The STABLE Act includes language that explicitly prohibits ‚Äúpayment stablecoin‚Äù issuers from paying yield to holders. He highlighted the gap between potential yields and what consumers typically receive. This rate would far outstrip the 2024 average interest yield on consumer savings accounts, which Armstrong cited as 0.41%. But unlike banks, they typically retain the interest earned rather than distributing it to stablecoin holders. Armstrong defines onchain interest as ‚Äúthe ability of a stablecoin to function as a form of payment and directly deliver interest earned on reserve assets to the stablecoin holder, effectively an interest-bearing checking account.‚Äù This could extend ‚Äúdollar dominance in an increasingly digital global economy,‚Äù according to Armstrong. Armstrong warned that without onchain interest, ‚Äúthe U.S. misses out on billions more USD users and trillions in potential cash flows.‚Äù Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan expressed support for Armstrong‚Äôs position, questioning opposition to yield-bearing stablecoins. Some regulatory experts have noted that yield-bearing stablecoins could face more complex regulation due to similarities with securities. This is likely why current legislation has avoided including provisions for interest-bearing features. It‚Äôs equal financial access for everyone, powered by crypto rails,‚Äù Armstrong wrote in his post.</p>

The funds were sent to a fake website that was pretending to be Tornado Cash, a popular crypto mixing service. ‚ÄúI tried to move funds to a Tornado, but I used a phishing website, and all the funds have been lost. I am devastated,‚Äù the hacker wrote in their message to zkLend. ‚ÄúI am terribly sorry for all the havoc and losses caused.‚Äù On-chain data shows the hacker made several transfers of 100 ETH at a time to an address named ‚ÄúTornado.Cash: Router.‚Äù They finished with three smaller deposits of 10 ETH each before realizing their mistake. Another user had attempted to warn the hacker about their error, telling them ‚Äúdon‚Äôt celebrate‚Äù because the funds were sent to a scam Tornado Cash URL. Everything gone with one wrong website,‚Äù the hacker replied. The original exploit of zkLend took place on February 11, 2025. Flash loans allow users to borrow and repay funds within a single transaction block. In this case, the hacker used them to manipulate zkLend‚Äôs system and exploit rounding errors. To our users, Starting on 11th of February, zkLend suffered an attack resulting in the loss of around $9.6 million USD in funds. When the February 14 deadline passed without a response, zkLend changed tactics. However, blockchain records show another 25 ETH was then sent to a different wallet listed as ‚ÄúChainflip1.‚Äù According to blockchain security firm CertiK, losses to crypto scams, exploits, and hacks totaled over $33 million in March 2025 alone. According to Immunefi‚Äôs Q1 2025 report, the first three months of 2025 saw the worst quarter for crypto security breaches in history. The report found that decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols lost $106.8 million across 38 different incidents. Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most frequently targeted networks for these attacks. Security experts point to this case as a reminder of the dangers that exist even for those who exploit vulnerabilities themselves. The hacker‚Äôs mistake highlights the need for caution when interacting with any crypto services, as convincing phishing sites can fool even technically skilled individuals. This case serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, affecting everyone from regular users to malicious actors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) has announced a new round of grants from its Bitcoin Development Fund, distributing 1 billion satoshis (10 BTC) to over 20 projects worldwide. The grants aim to support open-source Bitcoin development, mining decentralization, privacy tools, and educational initiatives for individuals living under authoritarian regimes, with a focus on Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The latest cohort includes diverse projects advancing Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a financial and human rights empowerment tool. NetBlocks, a digital rights watchdog organization, monitors and reports on internet shutdowns in real-time. TollGate, a project developed by ISP c03rad0r, transforms ordinary WiFi routers into decentralized internet service providers using Bitcoin and ecash. With HRF funding, TollGate will continue advancing its mission of building a censorship-resistant internet that empowers individuals to communicate freely. Vinteum is a nonprofit Bitcoin research and development center based in Latin America. With support from HRF, Vinteum plans to expand its developer education programs, sponsor contributors, and strengthen Latin America‚Äôs Bitcoin development community, helping the region build financial alternatives to fragile fiat systems. This is especially critical in regimes where payment processors are weaponized to silence NGOs and activists. ABI conducts research and provides policy recommendations to promote financial autonomy. Bitcoin-core/gui-qml, a project supported by developer Go Qu, modernizes the Bitcoin Core interface to make it more intuitive, especially for mobile users in developing regions. Rkrux is a Bitcoin Core contributor focused on code review, bug testing, and improving documentation. HRF‚Äôs grant will allow Rkrux to continue his work, ensuring that the Bitcoin network remains robust, secure, and censorship-resistant for users around the world. Elsat is a developer contributing to the Nostr ecosystem, including projects like Damus, Nostrability, and Zap.store. These tools offer decentralized messaging, improved app interoperability, and peer-to-peer software monetization. HRF‚Äôs grant will support ongoing development aimed at strengthening free expression and financial independence for users under authoritarian regimes. These relays are essential to decentralized communication on the Nostr protocol. HRF‚Äôs grant will advance development and deployment of this tool. Waye is a support initiative co-founded by Bitcoin Core developer Amiti Uttarwar and operational architect Anna Sides. It provides psycho-social support for open-source developers building freedom tech. By addressing burnout and isolation among contributors, Waye strengthens the ecosystem‚Äôs human foundation. HRF funding will help Waye expand its reach, especially to developers from the Global South. Rather than relying on centralized entities, miners are rewarded with ecash tokens, enabling instant, private payouts. HRF‚Äôs grant will support further development, reinforcing financial privacy protections for vulnerable users. His findings will inform new tools and education that make secure, private Bitcoin usage more accessible. HRF‚Äôs grant will fund this research and the development of educational resources. Stable Channels is a project by Tony Klausing that introduces fiat-pegged balances to the Lightning Network, helping users avoid Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility while maintaining full custody. With HRF support, the project will expand its integrations and user outreach, enabling individuals to transact freely without relying on centralized stablecoin issuers. Bitsacco, developed by okjodom, is a Fedimint-based platform that modernizes Kenya‚Äôs SACCO (Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization) model using Bitcoin and Fedimints. It allows community-based financial groups to operate independently of banks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Price is currently testing critical support around $117-$125, which has historically held firm Technical indicators show bearish divergence on weekly RSI, suggesting weakening bullish momentum Current price action is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern that could determine near-term direction This decline mirrors similar movements seen in other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum during the same period. Technical analysis shows SOL trading below its 100-hourly simple moving average. Resistance levels have become clearly defined during this period of weakness. Market watchers have noted a bearish divergence on the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI). This technical pattern occurs when price makes a higher high while the RSI prints a lower high, typically signaling declining bullish momentum. This level combines horizontal support with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension and has held firm for over a year. How SOL reacts to this support level may determine its medium-term direction. The RSI currently stands at 40, a level that has aligned with local bottoms in previous corrections. Historically, this RSI zone has coincided with the beginning of upward movements for SOL. Adding to the bearish pressure, recent market data revealed that a large holder offloaded over $7.6 million in SOL. On the 4-hour chart, SOL price is confined within a symmetrical triangle pattern. This formation occurs when two trendlines with equal slopes converge. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has dropped to -0.01, indicating increasing selling pressure. If this metric continues to decline, SOL‚Äôs price recovery may be delayed, potentially keeping the cryptocurrency trading between $116 and $125 in the short term. Two clear scenarios have emerged from the current technical setup. In the bullish case, SOL could rebound strongly from the $117 level, supported by improving momentum indicators and increasing volume. This could potentially lead to a renewed upward push toward fresh highs. In the alternative bearish scenario, if support at $117 fails to hold, SOL may enter a more extended decline. Should buying pressure increase significantly, the price might even reach $180.90. For now, SOL remains in this state of uncertainty, with traders and investors closely monitoring how price responds to these critical technical levels in the coming days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kentucky has dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase over staking services, following similar actions by Vermont and South Carolina This dismissal came shortly after Kentucky passed pro-crypto legislation (House Bill 701) that protects digital asset rights Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal is advocating for federal market structure laws to replace state-by-state regulation This dismissal makes Kentucky the third state in recent weeks to drop similar claims against Coinbase. Vermont was the first to exit on March 14, followed by South Carolina days later. The legal retreat comes just days after Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed House Bill 701 into law. Paul Grewal, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, celebrated the dismissal on social media. @GovAndyBeshear‚Äôs Department of Financial Institutions has followed suit by dismissing Kentucky's staking lawsuit against @coinbase‚Äî just as Vermont and South Carolina recently did. Congress needs to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market‚Ä¶ https://t.co/LyCy2iLS20 ‚Äî paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 31, 2025 The case against Coinbase was part of a larger multi-state effort launched in June 2023. State regulators had argued that Coinbase‚Äôs staking program was an unregistered securities offering. They claimed the exchange was essentially acting as an investment vehicle without proper registration or investor disclosures. When South Carolina dropped its case earlier, Grewal noted that residents had lost an estimated $2 million in staking rewards due to the ban. Within hours after South Carolina‚Äôs lawsuit was dismissed, Coinbase restored staking services for users in the state. SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda has taken a more conciliatory stance toward the crypto industry compared to his predecessor. The legislation affirms that self-custody of cryptocurrencies is legal and protects node operators from certain regulations. This comprehensive approach to crypto regulation passed unanimously in both the Kentucky House and Senate, showing rare bipartisan agreement. Despite these wins for Coinbase, seven states still maintain legal actions against the exchange. California, New Jersey, Illinois, Washington, Alabama, Maryland, and Wisconsin all have pending enforcement actions related to staking services. ‚ÄúCongress needs to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market structure law ASAP,‚Äù he posted following Kentucky‚Äôs dismissal. Additionally, Coinbase is pursuing the purchase of Deribit, a move considered significant as it diversifies beyond its U.S. operations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tether purchased 8,888 BTC worth $735 million on the last day of Q1 2025 Tether‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings now stand at between 92,647-100,521 BTC (worth $7.64-8.29 billion) This acquisition was made despite Bitcoin experiencing a 12% price drop during the quarter, one of its worst performances in seven years. This transaction further strengthens Tether‚Äôs position in the cryptocurrency market. The latest acquisition aligns with Tether‚Äôs May 2023 commitment to allocate 15% of its profits toward Bitcoin purchases. This strategy aims to bolster the company‚Äôs reserves through regular Bitcoin investments. Among private companies, it ranks as the second-largest Bitcoin holder, behind only investment firm Block.one. ‚Äì $7 billion in Tether's excess stablecoin reserves (36% increase YoY),‚Ä¶ https://t.co/izYONstKuF ‚Äî Paolo Ardoino ü§ñ (@paoloardoino) January 31, 2025 Tether‚Äôs previous Bitcoin purchase occurred in December 2024, when it acquired 8,404 BTC. At that time, the addition brought its holdings to 83,759 BTC. According to Spot On Chain data, Tether currently has unrealized profits of approximately $3.86 billion from its Bitcoin investments. This figure highlights the success of Tether‚Äôs Bitcoin acquisition strategy despite recent market volatility. In May 2023, Tether announced plans to allocate 15% of its profits each quarter to #Bitcoin purchases for its reserves, with BTC acquired gradually throughout the quarter and settled at the end. In addition to its Bitcoin purchases, Tether minted fresh $1 billion USDT on the Tron network. This represents 61% of the total stablecoin market, valued at approximately $234 billion. This gap highlights Tether‚Äôs continued leadership in the stablecoin sector. Tether reported record profits of $13.7 billion last year in its Q4 2024 report. The company maintains $7 billion in excess stablecoin reserves to ensure that every USDT issued is fully backed. On March 27, the company increased its stake in Adecoagro, a Latin American agricultural firm, to 70%. Tether also plans to purchase a 30% stake in Be Water, an Italian media company. This puts its holdings ahead of countries like Canada, Mexico, and Germany. The current Bitcoin price stands at $83,112, showing a 1.94% increase amid rising market volatility.</p>

Major firms like Citadel Securities, Susquehanna International, and Jane Street Capital are active participants in crypto markets. The CFTC publishes a weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report that tracks crypto trading trends. According to the latest COT data ending March 25, smart money traders viewed Ethereum‚Äôs price of $2,068 as being oversold. They have increased their long positions for two of the past three weeks. Over the last three years, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has more than doubled to $82,244. During the same period, ETH‚Äôs price has dropped by 32%. ETH holders have been unhappy with the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs development priorities. They‚Äôve also asked for more Ethereum-native projects to build momentum. The Foundation has instead focused on research efforts that align with core values. Since then, the price has fallen back to late 2023 levels. Rob Hadick, General Partner at crypto venture firm Dragonfly, commented on ETH‚Äôs performance. He also mentioned ‚Äúa general lack of confidence in the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs claims.‚Äù Despite these challenges, Hadick believes there is still a case for buying ETH. However, it does show which groups are more active at a given time. They went from roughly 3,500 contracts in early November to more than 15,000 currently. President Trump‚Äôs election has triggered increased investor interest in cryptocurrency. These groups typically sell crypto futures to dealer counterparties that buy them. The growth in Ethereum futures that began with Trump‚Äôs election continues into 2025. This increase shows that these savvy market participants are investing heavily in anticipation of an Ethereum price rally.</p>

The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency saw an 11% drop in value during Q1 2025 and remains about 24% below its January record high. This anxiety stems from uncertainty around President Donald Trump‚Äôs planned trade tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Trump has repeatedly referred to April 2 as ‚Äúliberation day.‚Äù This is when he plans to reveal more details about tariffs on sectors like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and select commodities. Risk sentiment has weakened due to speculation about the scope and economic impact of these planned tariffs. Many analysts have raised their expectations for a U.S. recession this year. The Trump administration has maintained a pro-crypto stance since taking office. Despite these initiatives, Trump‚Äôs crypto policies have offered little support to prices. Fidelity analyst Zack Wainwright suggests Bitcoin might still be in an ‚Äúacceleration phase.‚Äù This phase is marked by ‚Äúhigh volatility and high profit,‚Äù similar to when BTC pushed above $20,000 in December 2020.

They also observed that signs of capitulation are easing, with fewer reactive sellers present and long-term holders beginning to accumulate once more. The cryptocurrency market continues to watch closely for further developments on trade policies. April 2 may bring more clarity on how Trump‚Äôs tariffs might affect risk assets like Bitcoin in the months ahead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Technical indicators show XRP in a ‚Äúfalling broadening wedge‚Äù pattern that typically precedes breakouts The digital asset is currently trading around $2.05-$2.09, having fallen from above $3 earlier this year. Despite this downward pressure, several prominent analysts remain bullish on XRP‚Äôs future price potential. The altcoin is on track to record a second consecutive monthly loss. March 2025 showed a 3.16% decline, following February‚Äôs larger 29.33% drop that saw XRP lose the important $3 psychological mark. This recent bearish trend marks the first time since December 2022 that XRP has posted back-to-back monthly losses. The downward movement has caused some concern among investors who were hoping for continued upward momentum. This price zone represents a key battleground between buyers and sellers that could determine the token‚Äôs short-term direction. Market analyst EGRAG Crypto has maintained an ambitious target of $27 for XRP. The analyst points to similarities between current market conditions and those seen in 2017. EGRAG believes this pattern could repeat, with June 2025 being the target timeframe for reaching $27. Another respected analyst, Dark Defender, has identified $2.222 as a crucial resistance level. A breakout above this price point could trigger renewed bullish momentum and set the stage for higher prices.

The current Elliott Wave count suggests April and May could be particularly strong months for XRP. This forecast comes despite most traders adopting increasingly bearish stances in the short term. Technical charts reveal the formation of a ‚Äúfalling broadening wedge‚Äù pattern for XRP. For bulls to regain control, XRP must first reclaim the $2.30 level before targeting more ambitious resistance zones. Failure to maintain this level could trigger additional selling pressure before any potential rebound.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pi Network secured a major listing on BTCC Exchange, sparking market optimism Token unlocks will hit monthly low in April (124.32 million tokens), potentially reducing selling pressure Technical analysis shows a possible double-bottom pattern and bullish divergence indicators PCM Wallet app received significant upgrades improving user experience and transaction capabilities Despite recent price declines, some analysts predict potential recovery to $1 or higher based on chart patterns Pi Network has recently secured a major listing on BTCC Exchange, sparking renewed optimism among investors. Market analysts have identified several factors behind Pi‚Äôs recent price slump. Particularly, the absence of updates regarding a potential Binance listing has left many investors uncertain about near-term prospects. According to PiScan data, token unlocks will reach their lowest point in April, with only 124.32 million tokens scheduled for release. This represents a much smaller amount compared to upcoming months. This reduced rate of new tokens entering the market could help ease selling pressure. Technical analysis of Pi Network‚Äôs price chart reveals some causes for optimism. Analyst Crypto Jex has shared a positive outlook for Pi Coin. Jex suggests Pi Network is forming an ABC Recovery Pattern within a key accumulation zone, with targets of $0.95-$1.00, $1.30-$1.50, and potentially $1.80+ upon trend confirmation. Another analyst, DEXWireNews, has identified a falling broadening wedge pattern on Pi‚Äôs price chart. Additionally, the volume histogram displays green conditions, indicating increasing buying interest. Pichain Global has clarified that this limit is temporary to ensure a stable launch for the wallet. Security remains a priority, safely connecting users to the PiChain ecosystem. Pi Network currently stands as the 29th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at $5.163 billion. The token trades on 20 exchanges with a daily trading volume of $159 million. One factor that could boost Pi Network‚Äôs value in the future is increasing exchange adoption. With its substantial market cap and trading volume, more exchanges may consider listing Pi in the coming months. There has also been speculation about a potential token burn. The most immediate candidates for burning would be unmigrated mined tokens. As the ecosystem‚Äôs applications become more popular, Pi Network may introduce fee burns, further reducing supply over time. The recent PCM Wallet upgrades may increase Pi‚Äôs utility and adoption. While near-term price movements remain uncertain, the combination of reduced token unlocks, technical indicators, and ecosystem developments provide reasons for cautious optimism among Pi Network supporters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Lazarus Group stole at least $1.4 billion from Bybit and later funneled those funds to crypto mixers. "Someone had pulled off the biggest hack in [crypto] history, and we had a front-row seat," Samczsun, Research Partner at Paradigm, recalled in a blog post. But these attacks aren't all just about the Lazarus Group. There's more to North Korea's cyber offensives than previously thought. There's a misconception about how to "classify and name‚Äù the group's operations. Cybersecurity researchers "created more precise designations" to show which ones are working on specific activities, they added. TraderTraitor, identified as the most sophisticated DPRK actor targeting the crypto industry, focuses on exchanges with large reserves and employs advanced techniques, successfully compromising Axie Infinity through fake job offers and manipulating WazirX. AppleJeus specializes in complex supply chain attacks, including the 2023 3CX hack that potentially affected 12 million users. Dangerous Password, meanwhile, conducts lower-end social engineering through phishing emails and malicious messaging on platforms like Telegram. Another subgroup, APT38, spun out of Lazarus in 2016 and focused on financial crimes. It first targeted traditional banks before shifting attention to crypto platforms. In 2018, the OFAC first mentioned "North Korean IT workers," which in 2023 were identified by researchers as "Contagious Interview" and "Wagemole," operating through schemes where the threat actors either pose as recruiters or attempt to get hired by target companies. While the DPRK has shown its ability to deploy zero-day attacks, there have been "no recorded or known incidents" of it deploying directly against the crypto industry, Samczsun said. The researcher urged crypto companies to implement basic security practices such as least privilege access, two-factor authentication, and device segregation. If preventive measures fail, connecting with security groups like SEAL 911 and the FBI's DPRK unit would also be helpful. "DPRK hackers are an ever-growing threat against our industry, and we can't defeat an enemy that we don't know or understand," Samczsun wrote.</p>

However, investor sentiment towards AI-related stocks seemed to have changed on Tuesday after AI powerhouse OpenAI announced on Monday that it had closed a $40 billion funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion. The move appears to have assured investors that there continues to be a strong appetite for AI companies, even in the current rough market. This positive outlook has also spread to digital assets, as AI-related tokens were boosted on Tuesday. The broader digital assets market, CoinDesk20 Index, also rose 3%. Meanwhile, the shares of Core Scientific (CORZ), the bitcoin miner and data center with a large partnership with CoreWeave, have also risen more than 9% on Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The so-called block trade carried a premium of more than $1 million for 1,180 contracts of the $70,000 put option expiring April 25, according to data tracked by Amberdata. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . A put buyer is essentially bearish on the market, in this case, anticipating a price drop to below $70,000 from the current $84,000. A block trade is a large, privately negotiated transaction executed outside the public market, typically by institutions, to avoid affecting the going market rate. Other notable trades included a put ratio spread, featuring long positions in the $75,000 strike put and double short positions in the $70,000 put; and a risk reversal, involving a long position in the $90,000 call and a short position in the $70,000 put, as Pelion Capital founder Tony Stewart noted. The bearish flow in the $70,000 put follows purchases of put options expiring April 4 in the $78,000 to $85,000 range last week and increased demand for the $76,000 put option expiring on April 25. Broadly speaking, BTC puts are trading at a premium to calls, exhibiting downside sentiment out to the May-end expiry, as evident from the negative values in risk reversals. The bias for puts offering downside protection likely reflects investor anxiety surrounding President Donald Trump's expected reciprocal tariffs announcement on Wednesday. An aggressive move could weigh on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple tokens cratered as much as 50% within 30-minutes on crypto exchange Binance on Tuesday, with market watchers wondering if a misconfigured trading bot could have caused the declines. Act I, the Prophecy (ACT) slumped 50%, DeXe (DEXE) dropped 30% and dForce (DF) fell nearly 20% within minutes after 1031 UTC on Tuesday, data from Binance shows, with no immediate catalyst or explanation behind the sudden fall. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . The drop led to $6.28 million worth of longs being liquidated on ACT-tracked futures across exchanges, Coinglass data shows, with a single trader hit with a $3.2 million liquidation. Around 18:30, multiple altcoins on Binance experienced sharp declines. The sudden dips were triggered by large sell orders executed in a short time frame,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/tdmPKMfR3l ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 1, 2025 Meanwhile, HIPPO, BANANA31, TST and LUMIA posted similar declines shortly after 1100 UTC, though not as large as ACT, with dips in some tokens like KAVA getting quickly purchased by fast-fingered traders. Data showed a surge in selling volumes roughly around the same time, with no other tokens on Binance seeing similar spikes in selling volumes. That likely spurred position adjustments by trading bots, leading to price volatility in perpetuals, which quickly spilled over to spot prices. Early reactions on X ranged from surprise to speculations of a market-making bot possibly causing the declines due to a misconfiguration on how they trade, though CoinDesk could not independently confirm the allegations as of writing time. "Otherwise I cannot explain why too many unrelated assets dumped." Traders using cross-margin setups or running arb strategies were likely forced to unwind both sides. Panic from the perp cascade also spread, algos and discretionary players alike started exiting spot just to stay ahead of the move," pseudonymous observer Game said in an X post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese hotel company Metaplanet (3350) has purchased an additional 696 BTC ($58.5 million), taking its total stash to 4,046 BTC. Metaplanet purchased the bitcoin for an average purchase price of nearly 14.6 million yen ($97,500) for a total spend of 10.15 billion yen. Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . The company's total BTC holdings were bought for an average price of around $86,500.57 per coin. Metaplanet financed its purchases in Q1 through the sale of cash secured BTC put options - futures contracts which bet on the price of the underlying asset going down. These options were written at the beginning of the quarter, when BTC was scaling all-time highs above $100,000. Metaplanet said it earned 770.3 million yen in revenue using this method. "Relative to direct spot purchase at that time, the strategy enabled the company to acquire more bitcoin per yen deployed - benefitting from premium income and a reduced effective cost basis," Metaplanet said in a statement on Tuesday. Metaplanet's latest BTC purchase makes it the ninth largest public holder of bitcoin, according to data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, Ethereum reclaimed its title as the leading smart contract blockchain for decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, as the market swoon dampened activity on Solana, the go-to platform for memecoin traders. Ethereum-based DEXes registered an industry-leading cumulative trading volume of $64.616 billion in March, beating Solana's tally of $52.62 billion by 22%, according to data source DefiLama.

The change in leadership happened as the total crypto market capitalization fell 4.2% to $2.63 trillion, extending February's 20% loss, as macroeconomic uncertainty and disappointment over the lack of fresh BTC purchases in the U.S. strategic reserve saw bitcoin slip below $80,000. Throughout March, Raydium did not log a single day with trading volume exceeding $1 billion, highlighting a considerable decrease from its record-high of $13 billion on Jan. 18, DefiLlama data show. Additionally, daily volume on the Solana-based memecoin launch pad averaged less than $100 million in March, down significantly from the peak of $390 million in mid-January. Meanwhile, Ethereum's outperformance was driven by Uniswap, which achieved over $30 billion in trading volume, with Fluid taking the distant second spot with $9 billion in activity. Still, Ethereum's ether token fell over 18% to $1,822 in March, registering bigger losses than Solana's SOL token, which fell by 15.8%, per data source TradingView and CoinDesk. Per observers, ether's inflationary tokenomics and the growing popularity of Layer 2 solutions, which supposedly siphon activity from the main chain, are responsible for ether's poor performance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S.' crypto-friendly stance could increase the level of risk in financial markets by deepening the connections between traditional finance (TradFi) and the digital asset economy, according to regulator the European Securities and Markets Authority. "This crypto-friendly stance has the potential to accelerate crypto adoption, including by institutional investors," a spokesperson for the European Union's financial markets regulator said in an interview. "This would in turn increase interconnectedness and, failing relevant safeguards, risks of negative spillover effects between crypto and traditional markets."

Since becoming president on Jan. 20, Donald Trump has ordered his administration to set up a bitcoin reserve and urged it to establish crypto friendly policies. The crypto market had already reacted positively to Trump's election victory in November, and bitcoin (BTC) climbed to a record high around $109,000 on the day he was sworn in, CoinDesk data showed. In a joint report published Monday, ESMA, the European Banking Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority identified "volatile crypto-asset valuations, driven by expectations of U.S. deregulatory policy agenda; increasing interconnections to traditional financial markets," as a key driver in financial markets. Separately, Piero Cipollone, an executive board member of the European Central Bank urged for a digital euro, an ECB-backed digital version of the single currency, to substitute for crypto assets, which he described as being "highly volatile and speculative in nature." "Furthermore, the United States‚Äô push to maintain the dollar‚Äôs global dominance through the promotion of stablecoins worldwide presents its own set of challenges," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It doesn‚Äôt have a real memory layer. Blockchains today don‚Äôt look completely alien compared to traditional computers, but a core foundational aspect of legacy computing is still missing: A memory layer built for decentralization that will support the next iteration of the internet. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . After World War II, John von Neumann laid out the architecture for modern computers. Commonly known as RAM, this architecture has been the foundation of computing for decades. At its core, Web3 is a decentralized computer ‚Äî a ‚Äúworld computer.‚Äù At the higher layers, it‚Äôs fairly recognizable: operating systems (EVM, SVM) running on thousands of decentralized nodes, powering decentralized applications and protocols. But, when you dig deeper, something‚Äôs missing. Instead, it's a mashup of different best-effort approaches to achieve this purpose, and the results are overall messy, inefficient and hard to navigate. Here‚Äôs the problem: if we‚Äôre going to build a world computer that‚Äôs fundamentally different from the von Neumann model, there better be a really good reason to do so. Scaling for mass adoption with this current approach is nigh impossible. And, that‚Äôs not what decentralization was supposed to be about. A lot of people in this space are trying their best to work around this limitation and we're at a point now where the current workaround solutions just cannot keep up. This is where using algebraic coding, which makes use of equations to represent data for efficiency, resilience and flexibility, comes in. The core problem is this: how do we implement decentralized code for Web3? This is why I took the leap from academia where I held the role of MIT NEC Chair and Professor of Software Science and Engineering to dedicate myself and a team of experts in advancing high-performance memory for Web3. I saw something bigger: the potential to redefine how we think about computing in a decentralized world. My team at Optimum is creating decentralized memory that works like a dedicated computer. Our approach is powered by Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC), a technology developed in my MIT lab over nearly two decades. It‚Äôs a proven data coding method that maximizes throughput and resilience in high-reliability networks from industrial systems to the internet. Data coding is the process of converting information from one format to another for efficient storage, transmission or processing. RLNC is the modern approach to data coding built specifically for decentralized computing. This scheme transforms data into packets for transmission across a network of nodes, ensuring high speed and efficiency. With multiple engineering awards from top global institutions, more than 80 patents, and numerous real-world deployments, RLNC is no longer just a theory. RLNC has garnered significant recognition, including the 2009 IEEE Communications Society and Information Theory Society Joint Paper Award for the work "A Random Linear Network Coding Approach to Multicast." RLNC's impact was acknowledged with the IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award in 2022. RLNC is now ready for decentralized systems, enabling faster data propagation, efficient storage, and real-time access, making it a key solution for Web3‚Äôs scalability and efficiency challenges. Because we need memory for the world computer that‚Äôs not just decentralized but also efficient, scalable and reliable. Currently, blockchains rely on best-effort, ad hoc solutions that achieve partially what memory in high-performance computing does. What they lack is a unified memory layer that encompasses both the memory bus for data propagation and the RAM for data storage and access. ‚ÄúGossip‚Äù is the common method for data propagation in blockchain networks. It is a peer-to-peer communication protocol in which nodes exchange information with random peers to spread data across the network. In its current implementation, it struggles at scale. Imagine you need 10 pieces of information from neighbors who repeat what they‚Äôve heard. This is how blockchain gossip works today ‚Äî efficient early on, but redundant and slow when trying to complete the information sharing. With RLNC, we get around the core scalability issue in current gossip. This RLNC-powered gossip is our first product, which validators can implement through a simple API call to optimize data propagation for their nodes. It helps to think of memory as dynamic storage, like RAM in a computer or, for that matter, our closet. Items stay in the order they were placed ‚Äî you might see an older version, but never a wrong one. And, unless moved, everything stays put; data doesn‚Äôt disappear. Instead of the closet, what do we have? If we think of data management in blockchains as managing clothes in our closet, a mempool is like having a pile of laundry on the floor, where you are not sure what is in there and you need to rummage. Current delays in transaction processing can be extremely high for any single chain. Citing Ethereum as an example, it takes two epochs or 12.8 minutes to finalize any single transaction. Without decentralized RAM, Web3 relies on mempools, where transactions sit until they‚Äôre processed, resulting in delays, congestion and unpredictability. In computers, the RAM keeps what is currently needed, while less-used data moves to cold storage, maybe in the cloud or on disk. Full nodes are like a closet with all the clothes you ever wore (from everything you‚Äôve ever worn as a baby until now). This is not something we do on our computers, but they exist in Web3 because storage and read/write access aren‚Äôt optimized. With RLNC, we create decentralized RAM (deRAM) for timely, updateable state in a way that is economical, resilient and scalable. DeRAM and data propagation powered by RLNC can solve Web3‚Äôs biggest bottlenecks by making memory faster, more efficient, and more scalable. It optimizes data propagation, reduces storage bloat, and enables real-time access without compromising decentralization.</p>

The regulatory Environment Globally is converging, and it is converging on an operating model that permits a against Range of Products and Services. Companies that Were Sitting on the Sidelines are Jumping in And Those Already in Are Working Through How To Bring A Range of New Products to Market.

In Most Technology Markets, The Early Winners Are Determined Long Before Mass-Market Adoption. As we‚Äôre Now Entering the mass adoption era for blockchain (my Opinion), the options facing some companies Now are Ether Act Quickly or Spend the Next FeW Decades Playing Catch-Up. People are Always Forgetting that ‚ÄúMove Fast‚Äù Came With ‚ÄúBreak Things.‚Äù That‚Äôs Why for Those Rushing Ahead in This Market, Risk Management Has Never Been A More Critical Skill. Done Correctly, there are Several Ways for Companies that Want to Sprint Ahead in This Market to Minimize the Risk of Catastrophic Failure. There are three i have in at least. The first step is to put in place controls and operations that close the door on past problem that other firms have experience. This may strike you as bolting the barn door after the Horse has Already Left, but it is necessary because IF you don‚Äôt, you risk repeating history and that‚Äôs way more humiliating Than Communting Entirely Novel Mistakes. Nor are the Basics Particularly Difficult: External Auditors, Business Controls, and Standard Best Practices. We are so fortunate to live in an era where, for the first time, we have a good supply of experience blockchain and crypto people who can applly real-life lessons learned. Secondly, I Think It is critical for Companies to Think Strategaly and Explicitly About the Kind and Number of Risks They Want to Take. There is technology risk (very relevant with smart contracts and defi). You can learn critical lessons from all Three, but it Often Makes Sense to have controlled learning environments. One of my frustration has been watching people Jump to wildly Incorrect Conclusions When Things Go Wrong, Sometimes Because they Too many risk at the same time and cannot separate out what the causes were. Lastly, It Makes a Lot of Sense to be strategic about what you do internally and what Gets Done Externally. It‚Äôs More Fun Than Managing a Vendor. Beast in Business, but as he Said, ‚ÄúConsultants are a cheat code.‚Äù It‚Äôs that Simple: Someone Else Has Done IT Before. Take Advantage of that to reduce your risk and complexity. Therefore, for firms Seeking Accelerated Growth, Particularly in Ecosystems powered by emerging technology, good risk management policies are a must.</p>

Earlier this week, Miller Whitehouse-Levine founded the organization and announced his position as CEO shortly after stepping down from the Defi Education Fund. Though the group hasn't yet clarified its source of funding, its website said it will focus its message on "how decentralized networks like Solana are the future of the digital economy." Since late last year, the political grounds have solidified under the sector's feet as it finds allies running all levels of the U.S. government, where crypto advocates have long been trying to get a comprehensive set of regulations. The organization said its board is now conducting a search to replace Smith. "Innovators deserve to have the clarity they need to build a frictionless, Internet-based global economy ‚Äî a future we believe is achievable with the right laws, rules and frameworks," he said in a statement during this week's launch of the Solana group.

"Her leadership comes at a pivotal time as we expand into key markets such as Europe and U.A.E," OKX said.

The announcement comes the day after CoinDesk reported that Lacewell's predecessor, Mauricio Beugelmans, had left OKX, with his departure related to the exchange's penalties of over $500 million paid to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), according to a source familiar with the matter.

Other notable transactions included a sales ratio spread, including long positions on the put at exercise prices of $ 75,000 and short double positions on Put at $ 70,000; And a risk reversal, involving a long position on the CALL at $ 90,000 and a short position on the Put at $ 70,000, as the founder of Pelion Capital said Tony Stewart. The PUT flower flower at $ 70,000 follows purchases of sale deoptions expiring on April 4 in the range of $ 78,000 to $ 85,000 last week and increased request for the $ 76,000 sale option expiring on April 25. In general, the BTC sales options are negotiated with a bonus compared to the purchase options, displaying a feeling of decline until the end of May, as evidenced by the negative values ‚Äã‚Äãof risk inversions. An aggressive decision could weigh on risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.</p>

The data has shown a sharp increase in sales volumes at the same time, no other binance token having recorded similar peaks. Volatility decor has probably been planted by Binance's announcement at 10:30 am UTC, which introduced changes in leverage effect requirements and margin levels for perpetual contracts for several tokens, including Act/ USDT. This probably prompted trading robots to adjust their positions, resulting in perpetual prices volatility, which quickly repercussions on cash prices. "It looks like someone was hacked, banished, or I don't know," said Andrei Grachev, founder of DWF Labs, on X. "Otherwise, I cannot explain why so many unrelated resources have been disclosed. Traders using cross -margin configurations or ARB strategies have probably been forced to unravel both sides.

‚ÄúWhile we were negative on several respects upon initiation, we have gained incremental confidence that the convertible issuance strategy is likely tapped,‚Äù wrote Monness Crespi analyst Gus Gala, downgrading MSTR to sell just two weeks after initiating coverage at neutral.

Strategy currently holds 528,185 BTC on its balance sheet and has been buying sizable quantities nearly every week for the past few months, mostly funded by common share issuance and also sales of its initial preferred series STRK.

Gala's price target of $220 suggests just shy of 30% downside from the current price in the $300 area.

Gala argued that it will become increasingly more difficult for Strategy to raise money to buy bitcoin via share issuance, forcing the company to shift towards fixed income vehicles.

‚ÄúIf fixed income securities do not become a greater portion of issuance, the BTC treasury strategy will look increasingly challenged.‚Äù

Gala noted that MSTR has already used $18.6 billion of its $21 billion common share at-the-market offering. The company also raised another $711 million last week via STRF, its second series of preferred stock.</p>

Earlier this week, Miller Whitehouse-Levine founded the organization and announced his position as CEO shortly after stepping down from the Defi Education Fund. Though the group hasn't yet clarified its source of funding, its website said it will focus its message on "how decentralized networks like Solana are the future of the digital economy." Since late last year, the political grounds have solidified under the sector's feet as it finds allies running all levels of the U.S. government, where crypto advocates have long been trying to get a comprehensive set of regulations. The organization said its board is now conducting a search to replace Smith. "Innovators deserve to have the clarity they need to build a frictionless, Internet-based global economy ‚Äî a future we believe is achievable with the right laws, rules and frameworks," he said in a statement during this week's launch of the Solana group.
