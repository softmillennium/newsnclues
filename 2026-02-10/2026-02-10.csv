            Analilia Mejia will win the special primary in New Jersey's 11th Congressional District in a tight race over former Rep. Tom Malinowski, a major win for an ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders and other progressives.
    


            Malinowski conceded on Tuesday in a statement in which he gave Mejia “unequivocal credit for running a positive campaign and for inspiring so many voters on Election Day.”
    


            Notably, Malinowski blamed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which helped fund a group that spent roughly $2 million on ads targeting him. The group, United Democracy Project, sought in its ads to portray Malinowski as supportive of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, pointing to a 2019 vote for a bipartisan spending bill that provided funding to the agency.
    


            “I wanted so much to be able to tell you today that this effort, which was meant to intimidate Democrats across the country, failed in NJ-11,” Malinowski said in his statement. “But the huge difference between the early vote, which we were winning comfortably, and the Election Day vote, suggests that it had a major effect. I met several voters in the final days of the campaign who had seen the ads and asked me, sincerely: ‘Are you MAGA? Are you for ICE?'”
    


AIPAC allies picked a candidate to target in New Jersey. They may have boosted a stronger critic of Israel



            Thursday's primary to replace now-Gov. Mikie Sherrill was seen as an early testing ground for the debates that will shape the Democratic push to retake the US House in this year's midterms.
    


            A win by Mejia, who served as political director on Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, is a major success for national progressive leaders who had backed her run, like Sanders as well as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Mejia was the former head of the Working Families Alliance in New Jersey and is currently serving as one of the executive directors of Popular Democracy, a network of grassroots organizations.
    


            “Like many Democrats in this moment, I am not only appalled at MAGA, at Trumpism, at Donald Trump's administration – their overreach, their corruption, their blatant hypocrisy – but I'm also ticked off at my own Democratic leadership,” she told CNN during the campaign.
    


            Malinowski is a moderate who had been supported in the past but expressed openness for conditioning aid to Israel as the national Democratic Party shows more skepticism about the Israeli government in the wake of its offensive following Hamas' October 7, 2023, attacks.
    


            Mejia, meanwhile, was the only person at a candidate forum who raised her hand when asked if she agreed with human rights groups that say Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.
    


            A source close to AIPAC told CNN that there was concern that Malinowski, with his profile, seniority, and likelihood of a long career, would be worse for Israel allies than a progressive in Mejia who they see as less influential.
    


            The source also says they are assessing closely whether to spend money and run ads again in the district in June, when there will be a primary for the next two-year term, or in the November general election.
    


            United Democracy Project launched a new ad campaign Wednesday in Illinois' 7th District backing Melissa Conyears-Ervin.
    


            Trailing the top two vote-getters in New Jersey were former Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way and Essex County commissioner Brendan Gill, among a ballot of more than a dozen Democratic primary candidates.
    


            Meija will face Republican Randolph Township councilman Joe Hathaway, who ran unopposed, in the general election on April 16, and will be favored in a district that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly nine percentage points in 2024.

            McDonald's is offering a few customers a special Valentine's meal this year – Chicken McNuggets and caviar.
    


            Starting at 11 am ET on Tuesday, McDonald's is giving away a limited number of kits including caviar and a gift card for McNuggets at mcnuggetcaviar.com/countdown.
    


            The giveaway underscores the lengths restaurants and retailers are going to grab customers' attention, hoping the dollars will follow, as consumers remain gloomy about the economy and keep a tighter hold on their paychecks.
    


            McDonald's said in a statement each kit has all you need for “an upscale yet effortless celebration” including a 1oz tin of “McNugget Caviar,” crème fraîche and a Mother of Pearl caviar spoon, along with a $25 gift card.
    


            Targeted campaigns can help boost brand awareness, and sales. A McDonald's tie-in last year with “A Minecraft Movie” helped turn around sales after two quarters of sinking numbers. (The movie was released by CNN's sister company Warner Bros. Pictures.)
    


            And with consumer sentiment at its lowest in well over a decade, businesses have been looking for ways to get customers in the door. In that sense, a free giveaway might not generate immediate revenue, but it can build notice and serve as potentially viral marketing.
    


            While McDonald's clearly made its name selling burgers, its chicken sales are now on par with beef sales at its restaurants, CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors in 2024.
    


            McDonald's told Food & Wine magazine that the caviar offer was due to customer choice. For years, fans on social media have lauded the “high lowbrow” pairing. Popstar Rihanna even gave it a taste during a TikTok video in 2024
    


            “They've been pairing Chicken McNuggets with caviar long before we made it official,” the chain told the gourmet magazine.
    


            McDonald's reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday. For the first nine months of the year, sales globally were up 1%, excluding the impact of currency exchange rates. Sales at US stores open at least a year were up 2.4% in the third quarter.

            It was the photo of a loved one nobody wants to receive.
    


            When the partner of a 35-year-old magistrate in France checked his phone last week, he saw a picture of his partner accompanied by a stark warning: pay a ransom in cryptocurrency or we will mutilate her.
    


            The man – an associate in a start-up that has cryptocurrency activities – reported the demand to French police on Thursday morning, sparking a multi-agency manhunt involving as many as 160 officers, local authorities said.
    


            The magistrate and her elderly mother were held for 30 hours in a garage in southern France's Drôme region before escaping, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.
    


            The case renews focus on the recent rise in crypto-linked kidnappings in France and elsewhere, often involving high-profile individuals and those linked to them. Searches are ongoing in the United States after the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie. Purported ransom notes have demanded millions in bitcoin for her return, CNN has reported.
    


            In France, the mother and daughter duo managed to escape from the garage in the municipality of Bourg-lès-Valence without a ransom being paid, assisted by a neighbor, Lyon prosecutor Thierry Dran said Friday in a press conference.
    


            “They were able to take advantage of the absence of their captor to free themselves, to call for help, in particular by banging forcefully on the garage door,” Dran said. “Alerted by the noise, a neighbor then intervened. He was able to open the door and thus allow our two victims to escape.”
    


            The unnamed man who discovered the two women told local media they were grateful for his intervention.
    


            “I just came to take my car when I heard women hitting and screaming. I opened the door and two women came out; they were a little dirty. I was happy, they said thank you,” he told BFMTV.
    


            The women were immediately transported to hospital, Dran said.
    


            On Sunday, six people were arrested in relation to the kidnapping, including a minor, according to BFMTV. The main suspects are in their twenties and were arrested in the cities of Lyon and Chambéry, the outlet said.
    


            The latest kidnapping follows similar incidents in France linked to the world of cryptocurrency – either due to the individuals involved or the currency of the ransom.
    


            Some believe bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are untraceable – and therefore useful in ransom demands – but experts say this is a misconception. “Crypto works on a blockchain, and the blockchain is a public registry where everything is visible, everything is trackable and everything is auditable,” Renaud Lifchitz, a French IT senior security consultant, told CNN last year.
    


            Last week, Juan Andrés Guerrero-Saade, vice president for intelligence and security research at SentinelOne, told CNN that bitcoin is one of the “most traceable currencies we've ever had.”
    


            In December 2024, the wife of crypto investor and influencer Stéphane Winkel was kidnapped from the couple's home in Belgium. She was rescued after her kidnapper crashed his car in a dramatic police chase.
    


            The following month, David Balland, cofounder of the crypto wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped with his wife from their home in central France. Before the couple was freed, the assailants sent a video of Balland's severed finger to his business partner Eric Larchevêque and demanded ransom money.
    


            Later in 2025, the daughter of the CEO of French cryptocurrency platform Paymium was saved by passers-by from a daylight kidnapping attempt in Paris.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Bangladesh heads to the polls: What's at stake for a nation rocked by Gen Z upheaval?","https://www.rt.com/news/632238-bangladesh-heads-to-polls-whats/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:24:00 GMT","

General elections will be held in Bangladesh on February 12, the first voting after a violent uprising, led by Gen Z protesters, in 2024 that ousted the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

The polls will be a pointer to the trajectory of a nation in flux, its governance in the future, and the power equilibrium in its South Asian neighborhood.

The Hasina-led Awami League had ruled Bangladesh for 15 years from 2009 until August 2024, when the former prime minister and many ministers of her government had to flee the country. Now, the party is banned from participating in the election, raising questions over polling legitimacy.

In a country with a population of around 173 million, there are 127.7 million registered voters, according to Election Commission figures. About 56 million, 44% of the electorate, are between 18 and 37, and nearly 5 million are voting for the first time. Voting will be conducted across 42,761 polling centers.

Bangladesh has 59 registered political parties, excluding the banned Awami League. Of these, 51 are fielding candidates in the upcoming election. In total, 1,981 candidates are running, including 249 independents. The national parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 350 seats: 300 are filled through direct elections, and 50 are reserved for women and allocated to parties in proportion to their share of the vote.

The polls are a result of the 2024 uprising, which Hasina and former officials of her government alleged was instigated by external forces as a “foreign-funded, meticulously planned regime change operation.”

Hasina, the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's founding president and the principal orchestrator of Bangladesh's separation from Pakistan in 1971, resigned on August 5, 2024. Within three days of her ousting, an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, widely known as the “banker to the poor,” was sworn in.

Yunus had formed a political party, Nagarik Shakti, or Citizens' Power, in 2007. Two years later, the Hasina government launched a series of probes against microfinance pioneer Grameen Bank, founded by Yunus. In 2011, Bangladesh's central bank removed Yunus from the post of managing director of Grameen Bank, after allegations of “irregularities” in its operations.

When he was appointed chief adviser of the interim administration in August 2024, Yunus pledged to hold free and fair elections and to introduce structural reforms. “Tomorrow, with the rising sun, democracy, justice, human rights, and full freedom of fearless expression will be enjoyed by all, regardless of party affiliation,” Yunus said in a televised address to the nation on the day he took office.

Today, there is mounting criticism of the interim government for failing to deliver on its promises. Economically, GDP growth is projected to fall to 3.7% in fiscal year (FY) 2025, down from 4.2% in FY2024, amid production disruptions, while consumer inflation remains stubbornly high at more than 8.5%. 

Bangladesh's garment exports, widely seen as the bellwether of its economy, have been declining for the past two years. In the first half of FY2025-26 (July-December), exports fell 2.63% to $19.36 billion, with a sharp 14.25% year-on-year drop in December 2025 alone, according to local media reports.

Political instability, restrung violence, and attacks on religious minorities have increased since the fall of Hasina's government. There are 13 million Hindus in Bangladesh, forming nearly 8% of the population. After the August 2024 regime change, minority communities have reported feeling increasingly under attack, citing incidents of violence, killings, and arson targeting their homes and businesses.

Authorities, however, maintain that the majority of these episodes were not driven by religious animosity. This climate has deepened anxiety in the run-up to the February 12 election, even as major political parties attempt to court minority voters and reassure them of their safety.

The ban on Awami League has effectively left the country with three key political formations vying for power. These are:

The Bangladesh National Party (BNP) – one of Bangladesh's two major traditional parties, which positions itself as a nationalist and conservative alternative to the Awami League. It ruled the country from 2001 to 2006. The BNP is aiming for a comeback and is leading a coalition of ten parties in its bid to capture power.

The BNP boycotted the general elections in 2014 and 2024, and rejected the results of the 2018 vote, alleging that the polls were rigged.

BNP leader Tarique Rahman is the son of former prime minister and bitter Hasina rival Khaleda Zia, who died in January after prolonged illness. Rahman has since returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in exile in the UK, and is reportedly seen as a frontrunner for the top post in the country. His opponents cite his long absence from the country as a political plank to thwart his chances. The other argument used against him is that he is the scion of a political dynasty.

Another of the old guard enjoying a comeback is Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamist party, which was banned under Hasina's rule.

Jamaat-e-Islamiis considered the main second contender to the BNP in the absence of the Awami League. Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman is spearheading a coalition of parties that hopes to cash in on a conservative base. But Jamaat's radical Islamic leanings are seen as a spoiler, as it would not be able to sway undecided and liberal voters, especially those who had backed the Awami League. Jamaat's opponents also seek to tag the organization with leanings to Pakistan, another red flag for a section of voters.

In 1971, Jamaat-e-Islami, in what was then East Pakistan, adopted a strong, active position against the Bangladeshi liberation struggle, backing the idea of a united Pakistan grounded in Islamic ideology. Convinced that partition would weaken the Muslim community, the party worked directly with the Pakistani military to help suppress the independence movement.

The BNP and Jamaat earlier had an alliance against the Awami League, which collapsed after the 2024 uprising. By late 2025, the two parties are essentially archrivals, and the political fallout of that rupture is already reshaping alliances and even the broader ideological orientation of Bangladesh politics.

The National Citizen Party, a party created at the beginning of 2025 from a group that led the anti-Hasina movement in July-August 2024, is in alliance with Jamaat. Positioning itself for the 2026 polling, NCP leaders maintained that the party was formed “to uphold the spirit of the July movement among students.” The NCP declares its core goals as delivering “governance without corruption” and fostering national unity. However, its alliance with Jamaat has been seen as controversial in Bangladesh and has prompted some members to resign over ideological disagreements.

Jamaat's partnership with the NCP was seen as a tactical move as both parties hope that an alliance can clinch the decisive young vote. But opponents say the NCP's alliance with Jamaat itself is testimony to the lack of credible leadership for the protagonists of the uprising that necessitated the election.

The Islami Andolan Bangladesh and the Jatiya Party are the other political formations that are contesting in the general elections. The Islami Andolan had broken ties with the Jamaat alliance. The Jatiya Party was a former alliance partner of the Hasina-led Awami League.

What is key is whether the absence of a major political party, the Awami League, from elections will raise concerns in Western quarters, just like it did in January 2024 when general polling, boycotted by the BNP, was seen as not free and fare as well as “weakening the credibility of Hasina's government” and “hampering Bangladesh's cooperation with the US and the EU.”

For Western powers, Bangladesh, a relatively small country in South Asia, plays an important role given its strategic location next to India and China, as well as on the Indian Ocean.

Soon after she was removed from power, Hasina claimed she could have stayed in office “if I had surrendered the sovereignty of Saint Martin's Island and allowed America to hold sway over the Bay of Bengal.” Saint Martin's Island, just 3 sq km in size, lies in the northeastern Bay of Bengal and is viewed by strategic experts as an ideal vantage point for monitoring activities by China, Myanmar, and India. The US State Department has publicly denied any intention of acquiring an island in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh's general election is also seen as crucial for the future of its relations with China and India, especially given that ties with New Delhi have been under strain since Hasina's ouster and her subsequent exile in India. 

The interim administration has been demanding her extradition after she was sentenced to death in absentia for a crackdown on protesters. India has reportedly made overtures to the BNP and Jamaat.

The Awami League is widely seen as pro-India, and Pakistan is keen to cash in on its absence from the political spectrum.

On Monday, three days ahead of the election, Dhaka secured a 19% tariff rate (from previous 20%) with the US under a trade agreement, which would see Bangladesh open its markets to a wider range of American goods. The deal grants exemptions for some textiles and garments manufactured using US raw materials.

Yunus, the chief adviser of the interim government, said Washington had “committed to establishing a mechanism for certain textile and apparel goods from Bangladesh using US-produced cotton and man-made fibre to receive zero reciprocal tariff in [the] US market.” Yunus said the agreement followed nine months of negotiations that began in April last year.

Bangladeshi media reported last week that the “rushed” deal with the US was questioned by local business communities because of the timing and the secrecy surrounding it. Importantly, the deal came days after the US signed an agreement with India, Dhaka's key competitor for exports of garments to US and other global markets. Dhaka's stakes in the matter are huge as textiles account for 96% of its shipments to the US, worth nearly $8 billion. Hence the urgency for Bangladesh.

Along with the general elections, Bangladesh on Thursday will also hold a referendum on reforms that require changes to the constitution. The package of reforms is based on the July National Charter, a political declaration of 30 political parties and the interim administration, which has 84 proposals. A ‘Yes' vote on the July charter will mean the parliament will be responsible for implementing the reforms mentioned in the document.

The proposals include constitutional changes as well as the structure of the state, executive power, electoral procedures, and judiciary. A ‘No' vote will entrust the party winning the polls to implement its own reforms rather than the proposals in the broad charter. Essentially, the referendum will be a pointer to governance in the South Asian nation's future.

The suspects in an assassination attempt on Russian General Vladimir Alekseyev had monitored several other high-ranking Defense Ministry officials, the country's Federal Security Service (FSB) has said.

Alekseyev, the first deputy chief of Russia's military intelligence agency GRU, was shot on Friday in the corridor of his apartment building in Moscow.

The prime suspect in the case is 65-year-old Ukrainian-born Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba. He was arrested in the United Arab Emirates at Russia's request and transferred to Moscow over the weekend. Kiev has denied any involvement in the attack.

A third suspect in the attempt on Alekseyev's life has been detained, the FSB said in a statement on Tuesday.

The agency identified him as Pavel Vasin, a Russian citizen in his mid-40s and the son of Korba's other alleged accomplice, Viktor Vasin, who had been arrested earlier.

The younger Vasin's confession “helped identify two more high-ranking officials in the Russian Defense Ministry who had been monitored by Korba and Viktor Vasin on behalf of Ukrainian intelligence, with the aim of carrying out further acts of sabotage and terrorism,” the statement read.

According to the FSB, Pavel Vasin purchased surveillance equipment for his father and Korba, while also providing vehicles that they used to surveil Russian Defense Ministry officials and pick up the gun used in the attack on Alekseyev from a cache.

He also assisted the other suspects in collecting data online about the targets that had been “selected by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU),” it said.

Korba earlier told investigators that he had been recruited by the SBU last August and promised $30,000 for killing the general.

Alekseyev, who had four shots fired at him, remains in hospital in stable condition. He is conscious and is able to talk, TASS reported on Monday, citing medical sources.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week that the attack on the general was an attempt by the Ukrainian government to sabotage the peace process.

Representatives of Moscow, Kiev, and Washington held a second round of trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi aimed at settling the Ukraine conflict last Wednesday and Thursday, with the Russian delegation being headed by Alekseyev's boss, Admiral Igor Kostyukov, who heads the GRU.

Eritrea has rejected Ethiopia's accusations that it is engaging in military aggression and backing armed groups, describing the claims as “false” and “deplorable.” Tensions between the two countries have risen in recent years, partly over Addis Ababa's efforts to secure access to the Red Sea.

Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedion Timothewos addressed a letter to his Eritrean counterpart, Osman Saleh Mohammed, on Saturday, accusing Eritrean forces of occupying Ethiopian territory for a “considerable period” and alleging that Asmara has been providing direct material assistance to militant groups.

“We have been calling for this violation of our territorial integrity and sovereignty to be rectified. These repeated calls have gone unheeded,” Timothewos wrote, adding that the Eritrean government had instead “chosen the path of further escalation.”

In a statement on Monday, Eritrea said the allegations were “fabricated” and formed part of what it described as a “pattern and spiral of hostile campaigns against Eritrea for more than two years.”

“The government of Eritrea has no appetite for, or desire to, engage in meaningless acrimony to add fuel and exacerbate the situation,” the Ministry of Information in Asmara stated.

The two countries fought a border war between 1998 and 2000 that left tens of thousands of people dead. A peace agreement signed in 2018 formally ended the conflict and restored diplomatic ties. Eritrean forces later backed Ethiopia's federal troops during the Tigray war from 2020 to 2022.

However, bilateral ties have deteriorated in recent months amid claims from Addis Ababa that Asmara is preparing for war and coordinating with rebel groups operating in Ethiopia's northern Amhara region.

The Eritrean government has also opposed Ethiopia's longstanding push to secure access to the Red Sea, warning that the move could destabilize the Horn of Africa and undermine prospects for cooperation.

Last October, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he had sought international mediation, including discussions with China, Russia, the US, the African Union and the European Union, to help broker a “lasting solution” between Addis Ababa and Asmara.

On Saturday, Foreign Minister Timothewos reiterated Ethiopia's preference for dialogue to end the “cycle of violence and mistrust” that has been a “defining feature” of relations between the two countries “for more than half a century.”

MOSCOW, February 10. /TASS/. Moscow is indeed in contact with Paris, which could allow for a fairly rapid establishment of dialogue at the highest level, if it is wanted, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing.

""Indeed, contacts have taken place (we can confirm this), which, if it is desired and necessary, could help for a fairly rapid establishment of dialogue at the highest level. So far, we have not received any indication that this desire exists,"" he said.

However, Moscow took note of French President Emmanuel Macron's statements about the need to resume relations with Russia, Peskov said, adding that these statements appealed to Kremlin.

Earlier, Macron stated that Paris had re-established technical communication channels with Moscow.

MINSK, February 10. /TASS/. Western countries view Belarus solely as a state they want to exploit and separate from Russia, Oleg Gaidukevich, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Commission on International Affairs of Belarus's House of Representatives, told TASS, commenting on a statement by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).

On Monday, the SVR said Western non-governmental organizations were accumulating resources to once again try to destabilize the situation and ""change the constitutional order"" in Belarus.

""This is an absolute truth. They will test the ground and, at any moment they consider suitable, they will strike,"" Gaidukevich said adding that since 1994, when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko came to power, all Western actions against the country have been linked to opposition to Minsk's geopolitical choice.

""This has nothing to do with democracy, freedom, some standards, or human rights. It is solely about geopolitics and Belarus's choice. The choice of Belarus and its people is an alliance with Russia. Lukashenko has led Belarus into an alliance with Russia, which strengthens our sovereignty and statehood. This is precisely what the West will never forgive,"" he said. ""They view Belarus exclusively as a country they would like to plunder, as they did Ukraine, to strip of sovereignty, turn it against Russia and pull it away from Russia,"" Gaidukevich added.

According to the lawmaker, the West seeks to weaken Russia through these actions. ""This is all a struggle against Russia, and Belarus is considered in this context. They will keep preparing. Nothing will end this year or in five years. An especially active phase will be in 2029, on the single election day, and in 2030, with the presidential election. They are preparing for these events and will use all available methods,"" he emphasized.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Local police assisted federal immigration agents by repeatedly searching school cameras that record license plate numbers, data show

Police departments across the US are quietly leveraging school district security cameras to assist Donald Trump's mass immigration enforcement campaign, an investigation by the 74 reveals.

Hundreds of thousands of audit logs spanning a month show police are searching a national database of automated license plate reader data, including from school cameras, for immigration-related investigations.

The audit logs originate from Texas school districts that contract with Flock Safety, an Atlanta-based company that manufactures artificial intelligence-powered license plate readers and other surveillance technology. Flock's cameras are designed to capture license plate numbers, timestamps and other identifying details, which are uploaded to a cloud server. Flock customers, including schools, can decide whether to share their information with other police agencies in the company's national network.

Multiple law enforcement leaders acknowledged they conducted the searches in the audit logs to help the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enforce federal immigration laws. The Trump administration's aggressive DHS crackdown, which has grown increasingly unpopular, has had a significant impact on schools.

Educators, parents and students as young as five have been swept up, with immigrant families being targeted during school drop-offs and pick-ups. School parking lots are one place the cameras at the center of these searches can be found, along with other locations in the wider community, such as mounted on utility poles at intersections or along busy commercial streets.

The data raises questions about the degree to which campus surveillance technology intended for student safety is being repurposed to support immigration enforcement.

“This just really underscores how far-reaching these systems can be,” said Phil Neff, research coordinator at the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR). Out-of-state law enforcement agencies conducting searches that are unrelated to campus safety but include school district security cameras “really strains any sense of the appropriate use of this technology”.

Flock devices have been installed by more than 100 public school systems nationally, government procurement records show, and audit logs from six Texas school districts show campus camera feeds are captured in a national database that police agencies across the country can access.

School police officers use Flock cameras to investigate “road rage”, “speeding on campus”, “vandalism” and “criminal mischief”, records show. There is no evidence school districts themselves use the devices for immigration-related purposes – or that they're aware other agencies do so.

Research by UWCHR and reporting by the technology news outlet 404 Media previously revealed that police agencies nationwide were tapping into Flock camera feeds to help federal immigration officials track targets. In some cases, local law enforcement agencies enabled direct sharing of their networks with the US border patrol.

Immigration officials' unprecedented use of surveillance tactics to carry out its controversial mission has faced sharp criticism. That school district cameras are part of that dragnet has not been previously reported.

At the Huffman independent school district north-east of Houston, records reveal it was the campus police chief's administrative assistant who granted the border patrol access to district Flock Safety license plate readers in May.

Police departments nationwide also routinely tapped into the eight Flock cameras installed at the 30,000-student Alvin independent school district south of Houston. Over a one-month period from December 2025 through early January, more than 3,100 police agencies conducted more than 733,000 searches on the district's cameras, the 74's analysis of public records revealed. Of those, immigration-related reasons were cited 620 times by 30 law enforcement agencies including ones in Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee.

Flock offers a list of standardized reasons that agencies must choose from when running a search. For the Alvin school district's cameras, immigration-related reasons identified by the 74 include “Immigration (civil/administrative)” and “Immigration (criminal)”.

The data put into focus the scale of digital surveillance at school districts nationally and “just how dangerous these tools are”, said Ed Vogel, a researcher and organizer with the No Tech Criminalization in Education (Notice) Coalition – a national network of researchers and advocates seeking to end mass youth surveillance.

“The scale of it is phenomenal, and it's something that I think is difficult for individual people in their cities, towns and communities to fully appreciate,” Vogel said.

The Flock camera audit logs and other public records about their use by school districts were provided exclusively to the 74 by the Notice Coalition. The 74 also filed public records requests to obtain information on schools' use of Flock cameras and conducted an analysis to reveal the extent of the immigration-related searches. Those findings were shared with the law enforcement agencies and school districts mentioned in this story.

Three of the 10 agencies that conducted the most immigration-related searches in the Alvin school district logs participate in the 287(g) program, which deputizes local officers to perform certain immigration enforcement functions and has also become a point of controversy. The program has grown by 600% during Trump's second term.

Michael Putnal, Alvin school district police chief, directed all questions to district spokesperson Renae Rives, who provided public records to the 74 but did not acknowledge multiple requests for comment.

Amanda Fortenberry, the spokesperson for the Huffman school district, said in an email the district was “reviewing the matters you referenced”, but declined to comment further.

Flock Safety, which operates about 90,000 cameras across 7,000 networks nationally, didn't respond to the 74's requests for comment, nor did the DHS.

Camera settings information obtained by the 74 through public records requests suggests that Alvin school district police officers are unable to search their own devices for immigration-related purposes. But the school system allows such queries routinely from out-of-state police officers, audit logs reveal.

Flock searches for civil immigration reasons that appeared in the Alvin school logs, such as trying to locate someone who is unlawfully present in the US, were more than two times more frequent than those conducted for investigations involving immigrants suspected or convicted of committing a crime.

Also included among the reasons given for immigration-related searches are “ICE”, in reference to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “ERO proactive crim case research”, an apparent reference to ICE's enforcement and removal operations division and “CBP Investigation”, an apparent reference to US Customs and Border Protection.

In Carrollton, Georgia, officers routinely use Flock's nationwide lookup to track suspects outside their jurisdiction, Lt Blake Hitchcock said in an interview. Immigration-related searches that appear in the Alvin school district's audit log by the Carrollton police department were conducted to assist federal agents at the request of the DHS, Hitchcock said. He declined to elaborate on specifics.

Federal agents “were working directly” with a Carrollton police officer who had access to the Flock cameras “and they asked him to run it and they did”, Hitchcock said. If federal agents ask his office to help them with an immigration case, Hitchcock said, “we will assist them – no questions asked.”

Flock searches are typically broad national queries, and officers do not select individual cameras, he explained. Instead, with each search request, the system automatically checks every camera that Flock customers share with the nationwide database, including those operated by school districts.

Because a school district is part of the national lookup, Hitchcock said, its cameras will be searched any time another participating agency conducts a nationwide search. He said Flock's nationwide search was helpful to track people who “go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction to commit crimes”. He pointed to a high-profile child abduction case in 2020 when Carrollton officers used Flock cameras to rescue a one-year-old who was kidnapped at gunpoint about 60 miles away.

In Galveston, Texas, Constable Justin West confirmed that immigration-related searches that appeared in the Alvin school district's audit logs from his department were tied to the county's participation in the federal 287(g) program.

County deputies with federal immigration enforcement powers “have been working on arresting targeted criminal illegal aliens”, West wrote in an email, and use Flock cameras “to determine locations and travel patterns of the illegal aliens being sought”.

Galveston police's Flock searches that appeared in the Alvin school district audit logs led to several arrests, West said, while several of the investigations remain ongoing. Flock logs show the Galveston county searches were conducted for both criminal and civil immigration investigations.

While the Trump administration maintains its immigration crackdown centers on removing dangerous criminals, ICE arrests of people without criminal records surged to 43% in January. US citizens and immigrants with no pending civil immigration actions against them have similarly been detained.

It's not clear whether every search tagged as immigration-related necessarily was. The police department in Texas City, Texas, denied it used the system to enforce federal immigration laws. While the agency monitors “several thousand Flock cameras across the United States”, captain Brandon Shives said his department's searches in the Alvin school district log should not have been categorized as immigration-related and that was the result of a “clerical error”.

Flock Safety has repeatedly stated that it does not provide the DHS with direct access to its cameras and that all data-sharing decisions are made by local customers, including school districts.

“ICE cannot directly access Flock cameras or data,” the company said in a recent blogpost. “Local public safety agencies sometimes collaborate with federal partners on serious crimes such as human trafficking, child exploitation or multi-jurisdictional violent crime,” but decisions about “how data is shared are made by the customer that owns the data, not by Flock”.

The company acknowledged in August it ran pilot programs with the DHS to assist federal human trafficking and fentanyl distribution investigations but that “all ongoing federal pilots have been paused” after the initiative faced scrutiny and legal pushback.

Public records provided by the Alvin school district, which began purchasing Flock cameras in 2023 and has since spent more than $50,000 on eight devices, include Flock marketing materials that tout the ability to share data with other police agencies.

“Not only do we place cameras where you need them,” the document notes, “we offer access to available cameras in your community and beyond your jurisdiction.”

Adam Wandt, an attorney and associate professor at New York City's John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said license plate readers could be invaluable tools for solving serious crimes and finding missing persons.

But he also acknowledged the devices present significant privacy concerns and questioned whether the broad sharing of school-controlled camera data violates federal student privacy rules. The revelation that school-owned Flock cameras are being queried for immigration enforcement purposes, he said, “will cause significant discussions to be had in the near future within many school districts” that contract with the company.

“School districts are in a unique position, they have a unique level of responsibility to protect their students in specific ways”, including their privacy, Wandt said.

House Republican says ‘This is all unacceptable and preventable' of violence amid Trump's immigration crackdown; DHS funding set to lapse after 13 February

Local police aid ICE by tapping school cameras amid Trump's immigration crackdown

On Capitol Hill, leaders for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will answer questions from the House homeland security committee.

“We sit here today at an inflection point,” said committee chair Andrew Garbarino, a Republican congressman from New York. After the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Nicole Good in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers, fervent outrage at the excessive use of force by ICE and border patrol agents has spread across the country.

“This is all unacceptable and preventable. The safety and law enforcement and the communities they serve and protect must also always come first,” Garbarino said in his opening remarks. “When officials or elected leaders rush to conclusions about law enforcement or their fellow Americans, public trust suffers. There must be complete and impartial investigation.”

This hearing comes as members of Congress continue to negotiate guardrails for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ahead of another possible partial shutdown when funding for the department lapses in three days. “Shutting down DHS makes America less safe,” Garbarino said, while noting that other agencies like Transportation Security Agency (TSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also fall under DHS's mandate.

In a particularly heated exchange between LaMonica McIver and Todd Lyons. The Democratic congresswoman asked the acting ICE director if he was a “particularly religious man”. After Lyons said he was, McIver went further.

“How do you think judgment day will work for you with so much blood on your hands?” she asked Lyons, who refused to “entertain” the question.

She then said: “Do you think you're going to hell, Mr Lyons?”

The committee's Republican chair Andrew Garbarino quickly interjected and asked McIver to suspend her line of questioning. “While oversight is important, aggressively attacking those witnesses personally is inappropriate,” he said.

New York Democrat Dan Goldman asks what guidance ICE agents have been given about asking people on American streets to show proof of citizenship.

Todd Lyons says ICE “conducts targeted, intelligence-driven operations. We don't walk around the streets asking people about their American citizenship.”

Goldman asks if that means all the American citizens who have been randomly asked are lying.

Lyons concedes that if ICE are conducting an investigation they'll ask someone their nationality (which … isn't the same thing).

Goldman makes the point that that, by definition, isn't “targeted”, because “they're asking all sorts of American citizens, including off-duty law enforcement officers.”

Seth Magaziner then makes a broader point, which I think is worth posting in full.

There has been no accountability in your agency under the Trump administration – none.

Your agency has repeatedly been caught on tape using unnecessary violence against civilians and you can't even tell me if any of these agents have been investigated and disciplined.

You're supposed to be making people safer and instead your agents are being unnecessarily violent, and that is why the Trump administration has lost the trust of the American people on immigration.

Understand, it's not just the actions of the agents in the field; it's the lack of accountability from the top that has caused public trust to erode, and there need to be major reforms before we vote to give any of you any funding.

Your agencies need to act like other law enforcement agencies. Take off the masks, wear badge numbers, enforce discipline with real standards of conduct – but accountability starts at the top.

Kristi Noem is completely unfit and should be removed from office. And all of the operations we have just seen were overseen by commander Gregory Bovino who himself engaged in excessive use of force.

He even admitted that he lied to a federal judge when he claimed he had been hit by a rock when he threw a teargas canister at a crowd of civilians, but after the footage came out and that turned out to not be true, he admitted that he lied about it.

He asks what disciplinary action they are going to take against Bovino, to which Rodney Scott says he can't comment.

Asked if there was an investigation, Scott gives a vague answer about every allegation regarding use of force being investigated and reviewed.

Magaziner now highlights an incident in which a federal agent sprayed pepper spray directly into the face of an individual who had already been pinned to the ground by three other agents (here's the clip, via CNN).

Is this proper procedure for the use of pepper spray, he asks.

Scott says he can't comment on that because “you're only showing one piece and that subject is clearly not compliant – ”.

Magaziner interrupts to reiterate that this is not the intended use of pepper spray. Scott says the intended use is to de-escalate.

Magaziner says being pinned to the ground by three other agents would suggest the individual had been de-escalated.

He then asks if there has been any investigation into the agent that did this, to which Scott says there are many open investigations and he'll get back to him.

Magaziner turns to an incident from last year in which an Illinois man and his US citizen family – including his one-year-old daughter – were pepper-sprayed in their car by federal immigration agents during a shopping trip in a Chicago suburb.

Is it proper procedure to aim pepper spray into the window of a moving vehicle, he asks.

At first, Rodney Scott, commissioner of CBP, says he's not familiar with all the details on this and it's an ongoing investigation, before conceding, “we try to avoid that - no, it's not proper procedure.”

Scott begins to talk about intentional vs unintentional, before Magaziner says that “from the video, this was clearly intentional”.

Asked if any of the agents involved were ever investigated and disciplined, Scott says the investigation is ongoing.

Todd Lyons is asked by Rhode Island Democrat Seth Magaziner whether ICE has hired anyone who was charged with a crime related to the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol.

After a brief pause, Lyons says he doesn't have that information, “but I would say no.”

Magaziner asks if him to find out and please report back, to which Lyons agrees.

Asked if he would hire someone who had attacked police officers on January 6, even if they were “unfortunately” pardoned by the president, Lyons replies:

Sir, we take assault on law enforcement very serious and we have a good, strenuous vetting program.

In response to a line of questioning by California Democrat Lou Correa, Todd Lyons said that an American citizen “shouldn't feel the need” to carry a passport to prove their legal status in the country. This comes amid several instances of US citizens being profiled, searched and detained by federal immigration officers during the crackdown in Minnesota and across the country.

“The number of cases of Americans being detained, being taken in, some being held for five days …What do we do with those people in that situation? What do we tell them?” Correa said.

Lyons was resolute that he was unaware of any examples of Americans detained by ICE.

Correa pushed Lyons on whether immigration enforcement is surveilling citizens, particularly protesters. “I can assure you, there is no database that's tracking United States citizens,” Lyons replied.

Asked if there were plans to release any footage from body cameras worn by federal agents in Minnesota, in the spirit of transparency to regain public trust, Todd Lyons said:

100%, sir. One thing I'm committed to is full transparency, and I fully welcome body cameras all across the spectrum and all of our law enforcement activities. Yes sir, body camera footage will be released.

ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, did not confirm how many agents have been fired under his leadership when probed by Democratic lawmaker Eric Swalwell.

“I'm not going to speak about personnel actions, but I'll get you that data,” Lyons said.

“Are you telling us you can't even say one person's been fired?” Swalwell pushed back.

Later, Lyons refused to comment when Swalwell asked if the he would apologize to the family of Renee Good, after Trump administration officials labelled her a “domestic terrorist”, after she was fatally shot by an ICE agent. The president, for his part, called Good a “professional agitator” and “very violent”, despite video footage showing her driving away from law enforcement when she was killed.

“I welcome the opportunity to speak to the family in private, but I'm not going to comment on any active investigation,” Lyons said at today's oversight hearing.

Lyons responded to questions from Andrew Garbarino about the training that ICE agents and officers receive.

“They are taught in defensive tactics, personal safety, but as well as laws to include first, second, fourth, fifth, 10th, 14th amendment,” Lyons said. “The officers are trained before they go out into the field. And then while they're in the field, there are specialized training when disturbance control and other special tactics.”

Rodney Scott, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said that agents go through a 117 day Academy, while officers attend a 103 day training program.

Bennie Thompson pressed both Lyons and Scott about the body-warn cameras by federal immigration enforcement. The acting ICE director said that roughly 3,000 officers out of around 13,000 wear cameras. While Scott said around half of CBP's 20,000 agents are fitted with cameras.

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, spoke about “the dangers that ICE agents and officers face nationwide” during his opening remarks today.

“I'm encouraged that some Minnesota officials are finally signaling the willingness to cooperate with ICE. Let me be clear, promises are not enough,” he said. “We need action in the wake of the unprecedented border crisis of the previous administration. ICE stepped into the breach to enforce the law. This commitment has a cost. We're facing the deadliest operating environment our agents agencies history.”

In his opening remarks today, Bennie Thompson, the homeland security committee's ranking member, said that Kristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security has the “blood of American citizens on its hand”. Thompson is one of several Democrats who have called on Noem to resign or risk impeachment.

The Democratic lawmaker also listed, what he sees, as several examples of indiscriminate use of force and profiling by federal law enforcement as the immigration crackdown continues in Minnesota. This included the detention of five-year-old Liam Ramos and his father – who were taken from Minneapolis, and sent to a facility in Texas.

“DHS personnel are now forcing their way into private homes without a judicial warrant, in violation of the fourth amendment,” Thompson said. “Secretary Noem is a liar with no concern for the lives of Americans killed by the department she runs. She must go.”

On Capitol Hill, leaders for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will answer questions from the House homeland security committee.

“We sit here today at an inflection point,” said committee chair Andrew Garbarino, a Republican congressman from New York. After the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Nicole Good in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers, fervent outrage at the excessive use of force by ICE and border patrol agents has spread across the country.

“This is all unacceptable and preventable. The safety and law enforcement and the communities they serve and protect must also always come first,” Garbarino said in his opening remarks. “When officials or elected leaders rush to conclusions about law enforcement or their fellow Americans, public trust suffers. There must be complete and impartial investigation.”

This hearing comes as members of Congress continue to negotiate guardrails for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ahead of another possible partial shutdown when funding for the department lapses in three days. “Shutting down DHS makes America less safe,” Garbarino said, while noting that other agencies like Transportation Security Agency (TSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also fall under DHS's mandate.

One note for today, the Rules committee will take up the SAVE America act, paving the way for a possible House floor vote. A reminder, this is the legislation – backed by the president and many Republican members of Congress – that would require proof of citizenship in order to vote.

Voting rights experts have long warned this requirement would act as a barrier to participating in elections, and noncitizens voting is both illegal and extremely rare.

Donald Trump has spent recent weeks reviving his baseless claims that US elections are “rigged,” even urging GOP lawmakers to “nationalize” voting, despite states running election administration, not the federal government.

The Trump administration has launched TrumpRx, but there are other sites offering discounts on more medications, and the new government site will appeal to a very limited group of patients, experts say.

Trump has promised reforms on the unusually high drug prices in the US, and he called the announcement “the largest reduction in prescription drug prices in history” at a press conference on Thursday. Yet the site only lists 43 medications, more than half of which are available in generic form at significantly cheaper prices elsewhere.

The site may make some weight loss and fertility drugs not covered by insurance more accessible, but overall “it is not a solution for high drug prices in the United States”, said Sean Sullivan, professor of health economics and policy and former dean of pharmacy at the University of Washington.

“Consumers can probably get a cheaper version of these medicines through insurance and their pharmacies, or via cash pay services like Cost Plus Drugs than by the deals offered through TrumpRx,” Sullivan said.

“Healthcare is really complicated in America, and even the supply of prescription drugs is really complicated in America, and this has added to the complexity, instead of reducing complexity,” said Rena Conti, associate professor of markets, public policy, and law at Boston University's Questrom School of Business.

The best course is likely still to “ask your local pharmacist what the best deal is”, Conti said.

On Capitol Hill, negotiations on a full year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continue with little success in sight.

A reminder, short of passing another continuing resolution, DHS funding lapses after 13 February.

In order to prevent a shutdown in the coming days, Republicans would need seven Democrats on board for either another stopgap measure, or to agree to a full appropriations bill.

Later today we'll hear from both House GOP and Democratic leaders at their respective press conferences to get a sense of how this back-and-forth is playing out.

Earlier, we reported that House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, and the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said that the initial GOP response to Democrats' demands – which includes the need for judicial warrants and for immigration officers to no longer wear masks –  is “both incomplete and insufficient in terms of addressing the concerns Americans have about ICE's lawless conduct”. We've yet to see the memo or document outlining what the Republicans' counter offer actually looks like.

Donald Trump is in Washington today. As of now, he'll have time signing time in the Oval Office, followed by a policy meeting. However, none of these events will be open to the press. We will hear from press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who will brief reporters at 1pm ET.

Seamus Culleton describes conditions as ‘torture' as he pleads with taoiseach to raise his case with Donald Trump 

An Irish man who has been held by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for five months despite having a valid work permit and no criminal record says he fears for his life and has appealed for help from Ireland's government.

Seamus Culleton said conditions at his detention centre in Texas were akin to “torture” and that the atmosphere was volatile. “I'm not in fear of the other inmates. I'm afraid of the staff. They're capable of anything.”

Speaking from the El Paso facility to Ireland's RTÉ radio, Culleton implored the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, to raise his case with Donald Trump when he visits the White House next month for St Patrick's Day celebrations.

“Just try to get me out of here and do all you can, please. It's an absolute torture, psychological and physical torture,” Culleton said, adding he did not know how much more he could take. “It's just a horrible, horrible, horrible place.”

Originally from County Kilkenny, Culleton, 42, runs a plastering business in the Boston area. After buying supplies at a hardware store on 9 September 2025 he was followed by ICE agents and arrested.

Culleton entered the US in 2009 on a visa waiver programme and overstayed the 90-day limit but after marrying a US citizen, Tiffany Smyth, and applying for lawful permanent residence, he obtained a statutory exemption that allowed him to work, according to his lawyer, Ogor Winnie Okoye.

The detention prevented him from attending the final interview in October for his green card that would have confirmed his legal status, said Okoye. “It's inexplicable that this man has been in detention.”

Culleton's wife in Massachusetts and family in Ireland went public with his story this week in hope of galvanising support for his release.

Culleton told RTÉ he had been locked in the same room with 71 other detainees in squalid conditions and with insufficient food and negligible time outside for fresh air, sunshine or exercise.

“You don't know what's going to happen on a day-to-day basis. You don't know if there's going to be riots, you don't know what's going to happen. It's a nightmare down here.” Showers and toilets were “filthy” and daily meals were child-sized, he said. “So everybody is hungry.”

Culleton said he was trying to stay positive. “I try my best. I talk to my wife every day, she's my rock. I talk to my mother and sister most days. They're all rooting for me.”

Culleton appealed to Irish authorities to intervene. “My own family in Ireland is also suffering, my mother especially, she is heartbroken. Just do as much as you can to try and get me out of here, please. I just want to get back to my life, we were so desperate to start a family.” He asked the taoiseach to raise his case with Trump at the White House next month. “I'll take any help I can get now at this point.”

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance via the Irish consulate in Austin, Texas, and that the embassy in Washington was engaging with the US Department of Homeland Security at a “senior level”.

Speaking to reporters on his way to a cabinet meeting, the taoiseach said he hoped Culleton would be released and expressed concern at the conditions of his detention. Martin did not say whether he would raise the case with Trump.

The case could complicate Dublin's effort to avoid provoking the White House, which has lambasted Ireland over its record on corporate tax, trade and immigration. Some opposition parties have urged the taoiseach to shun the US president in protest at his domestic and foreign policies.

Culleton's lawyer said US authorities were threatening to deport him “any day” and that the fifth court of appeals in Texas, which was handling his case, was the “least immigrant-friendly” court. “There's no reason why the government shouldn't just release him and allow him to attend the [green card] interview that will confirm his legal status,” said Okoye.

Figures released on Monday showed that less than 14% of almost 400,000 immigrants arrested by ICE in the first year of Trump's second term had charges or convictions for violent criminal offences, undercutting an administration claim to be targeting “the worst of the worst”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) yesterday reiterated Taiwan's support for nuclear power as the world's chipmaking hub looks to secure a stable electricity supply.

“We will fully embrace advanced nuclear technologies from around the world,” Cho said at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Industrial Technology Research Institute's advanced semiconductor research and development base.

They would complement efforts to expand renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and storage, and strengthen the power grid, he said.

The new technologies include small modular reactors, designed to be manufactured in factories and assembled on site. The smaller reactors have gained significant momentum globally and have attracted investment from established nuclear players and a host of start-ups.

Taiwan is home to some of the world's largest chipmakers, whose operations consume vast amounts of energy. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is adding further strain to the nation's power supply. The government is exploring the possibility of restarting two nuclear power plants and procedures to revive one of them could begin in 2028 if safety reviews proceed smoothly.

However, for Taiwan, the small modular reactor technology might be a longer-term solution.

The reactors are still at an early stage worldwide, with most projects in the start-up phase and unlikely to be commercially ready before 2030. Wide-scale deployment could take decades due to lengthy regulatory processes.

While the aim of the reactors is to cut costs and speed up construction, the strategy remains untested.

“We will carefully assess whether traditional nuclear power can offer greater reassurance to industry,” Cho said, adding that the goal is to ensure a stable and sufficient energy supply.

The airline said that it has confirmed that the planned industrial action by its international wide-body cabin crew would go ahead on Thursday and Friday next week.

Barcelona's eternally unfinished Basilica de la Sagrada Familia has grown to become the world's tallest church, but a conflict with residents threatens to delay the finish date for the monument designed more than 140 years ago.

Swathed in scaffolding on a platform 54m above the ground, an enormous stone slab is being prepared to complete the cross of the central Jesus Christ tower.

A huge yellow crane is to bring it up to the summit, which will stand at 172.5m and has snatched the record as the world's tallest church from Germany's Ulm Minster.

The basilica's peak will deliberately fall short of the 177m of Barcelona's Montjuic hill, in accordance with the devout Catholic faith of famed Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi, who took charge of the project in 1883.

“Gaudi did not want to exceed that height,” because the Montjuic hill was the work of God, said Mauricio Cortes, a senior architect working on the construction site.

When the structure is completed and the scaffolding dismantled, the tower is to be blessed on June 10 to coincide with the centenary of the death of Gaudi, whose body lies in the basilica's crypt.

The Vatican has not yet confirmed whether Pope Leo XIV would accept an invitation to the tower's inauguration.

“Once the cross is installed, the project will be nearly 80 percent complete,” said Jordi Fauli, the architect who has led the work for more than a decade.

The construction board, a private canonical foundation, had intended to complete work on the Sagrada Familia, considered the world's most famous unfinished building, this year.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic paralyzed the tourism industry — and with it the key source of income of the most-visited of Spain's monuments that charge an entrance fee.

Tourists from around the world are now flooding back: 4.8 million visitors arrived in 2024, boosting the coffers of the basilica, which relies on the takings as well as private donations.

Yet the board is reticent to set a new finish date for the remaining work, including the divisive Glory Facade and its four bell towers.

The board's plan to precede the front entrance by a large flight of steps and a square would entail destroying up to two blocks of homes.

The residents have spent years fighting to halt the plan.

“Our houses are legal,” reads a sign hanging from one of the threatened buildings.

“The Sagrada Familia owns a plot of land; it does not own the rest. So why should it reach my home?” said Salvador Barroso, president of an association for residents affected by the construction work.

Residents say their apartments were purchased legally, and no one warned them that the area could form part of the Sagrada Familia site.

Barroso acquired his home in the late 1980s and only started hearing about the stairway project from 1992, when the Barcelona Olympics transformed the city's image as a tourist magnet.

“What this is really about is business,” Barroso said of the expansion.

The residents have also questioned the stairs' place in Gaudi's original plan. Critics frequently point out that the architect's models were mostly destroyed during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and say the church has lost its creator's essence.

Lead architect Fauli, speaking to AFP next to various models of the Sagrada Familia in a room away from the droves of tourists, said that “we are, in all parts of the project, faithfully following what Gaudi wanted.”

Other documents were saved, and a portion of the models were reconstructed afterward by Gaudi's disciples, he added.

“Gaudi was an extraordinary architect, and it is worth following his project and finishing it,” said Fauli, who hopes to find “a fair solution” for the Glory Facade.

Barcelona's town hall will mediate the conflict and says any agreement must guarantee a solution for the residents, in a city already undergoing a severe housing crisis.

However, after years of disagreements, an end to almost a century and a half of work at the Sagrada Familia seems closer than ever.

“I hope the dispute is resolved. What I cannot say is whether it will be resolved in the courts or ... sat at a table,” Barroso said.

Schellenberg was detained on drug charges in 2014 before China-Canada ties nosedived following the 2018 arrest in Vancouver of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou (孟晚舟).
That arrest infuriated Beijing, which detained two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — on espionage charges that Ottawa condemned as retaliatory.

Comparing social media platforms to casinos and addictive drugs, lawyer Mark Lanier on Monday delivered opening statements in a landmark trial in Los Angeles that seeks to hold Instagram owner Meta and Google's YouTube responsible for harms to children who use their products.

Instagram's parent company Meta and Google's YouTube face claims that their platforms addict children through deliberate design choices that keep kids glued to their screens. TikTok and Snap, which were originally named in the lawsuit, settled for undisclosed sums.

Jurors got their first glimpse into what would be a lengthy trial characterized by dueling narratives from the plaintiffs and the two remaining defendants.

Meta lawyer Paul Schmidt spoke of the disagreement within the scientific community over social media addiction, with some researchers believing it does not exist, or that addiction is not the most appropriate way to describe heavy social media use.

Lawyers representing YouTube were to begin their opening statement yesterday.

Lanier, the plaintiff's lawyer, delivered lively first remarks where he said the case would be as “easy as ABC” — which stands for “addicting the brains of children.” 

He said Meta and Google, “two of the richest corporations in history,” have “engineered addiction in children's brains.”

He presented jurors with a slew of internal e-mails, documents and studies conducted by Meta and YouTube, as well as YouTube's parent company, Google. 

He showed the findings of a study Meta conducted called “Project Myst” in which they surveyed 1,000 teens and their parents about their social media use. 

The two major findings were that Meta knew children who experienced “adverse events” like trauma and stress were particularly vulnerable for addiction; and that parental supervision and controls made little impact, Lanier said.

He also highlighted internal Google documents that likened some company products to a casino, and internal communication between Meta employees in which one person said Instagram is “like a drug” and they are “basically pushers.”

At the core of the Los Angeles case is a 20-year-old identified only by the initials “KGM,” whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media would play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials — essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury.

KGM made a brief appearance after a break during Lanier's statement and she is to return to testify later in the trial. 

Lanier spent time describing KGM's childhood, focusing particularly on what her personality was like before she began using social media. She started using YouTube at age six and Instagram at age nine, Lanier said. Before she graduated elementary school, she had posted 284 videos on YouTube.

Lanier said the companies' lawyers would “try to blame the little girl and her parents for the trap they built,” referencing the plaintiff. She was a minor when she said she became addicted to social media, which she claims had a detrimental impact on her mental health.

Lanier said that despite the public position of Meta and YouTube being that they work to protect children, their internal documents show an entirely different position, with explicit references to young children being listed as their target audiences.

The attorney also drew comparisons between the social media companies and tobacco firms, citing internal communication between Meta employees who were concerned about the company's lack of proactive action about the potential harm their platforms can have on children and teens.

“For a teenager, social validation is survival,” Lanier said. 

The defendants “engineered a feature that caters to a minor's craving for social validation,” he added, speaking about “like” buttons and similar features.

In his opening statement representing Meta, Schmidt said the core question in the case is whether the platforms were a substantial factor in KGM's mental health struggles. 

He spent much of his time going through the plaintiff's health records, emphasizing that she had experienced many difficult circumstances in her childhood, including emotional abuse, body image issues and bullying.

Schmidt presented a clip from a video deposition from one of KGM‘s mental health providers, Thomas Suberman, who said social media was “not the through-line of what I recall being her main issues,” adding that her struggles seemed to largely stem from interpersonal conflicts and relationships. 

He painted a picture — with KGM's own text messages and testimony pointing to a volatile home life — of a particularly troubled relationship with her mother.

Schmidt acknowledged that many mental health professionals do believe social media addiction can exist, but said three of KGM's providers — all of whom believe in the form of addiction — have never diagnosed her with it, or treated her for it.

Schmidt told jurors that the case is not about whether social media is a good thing or whether teens spend too much time on their phones or whether the jurors like or dislike Meta, but whether social media was a substantial factor in KGM's mental health struggles.

Reuters

12:32 JST, February 10, 2026

DHAKA, Feb 9 (Reuters) – For years under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's opposition had little presence on the streets during elections, either boycotting polls or being sidelined by mass arrests of senior leaders. Now, ahead of Thursday's vote, the roles have reversed.

Hasina's Awami League is banned, but many young people who helped oust her government in a 2024 uprising say the upcoming vote will be the Muslim-majority nation's first competitive election since 2009, when she began a 15-year-rule.

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is widely expected to win, although a coalition led by the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami is putting up a strong challenge. A new party driven by Gen-Z activists under the age of 30 has aligned with Jamaat after failing to translate its anti-Hasina street mobilisation into an electoral base.

BNP chief Tarique Rahmantold Reuters his party, which is contesting 292 of the 300 parliamentary seats at stake, was confident of winning “enough to form a government”.

Analysts say a decisive result in the February 12 vote, instead of a fractured outcome, is vital for restoring stability in the nation of 175 million after Hasina's ouster triggered months of unrest and disrupted major industries, including the garments sector in the world's second‑largest exporter.

The verdict will also affect the roles of rival regional heavyweights China and India in the South Asian nation.

“Opinion polls suggest the BNP has an edge, but we must remember that a significant portion of voters are still undecided,” said Parvez Karim Abbasi, executive director at Dhaka's Centre for Governance Studies.

“Several factors will shape the outcome, including how Generation Z – which makes up about a quarter of the electorate – votes, as their choices will carry considerable weight.”

Across Bangladesh, black‑and‑white posters and banners bearing the BNP's “sheaf of paddy” symbol and Jamaat's “scales” hang from poles and trees and are pasted on roadside walls, alongside those of several independent candidates. Party shacks on street corners, draped in their emblems, blare campaign songs.

It marks a sharp contrast with past elections, when the Awami League's “boat” symbol dominated the landscape.

Opinion polls expect the once-banned Jamaat, which had opposed Bangladesh's India-backed 1971 independence from Pakistan, to have its best electoral performance even if it does not win.

The election verdict will also influence the roles of China and India in Bangladesh in coming years, analysts have said. Beijing has increased its standing in Bangladesh since Hasina was seen as pro-India and fled to New Delhi after her ouster, where she remains.

While New Delhi's influence is on the wane, the BNP is seen by some analysts as being relatively more in tune with India than the Jamaat.

A Jamaat-led government might tilt closer to Pakistan, a fellow Muslim‑majority nation and a long‑standing rival of Hindu‑majority India, analysts say. Also, Jamaat's Gen-Z ally has said “New Delhi's hegemony” in Bangladesh is one of its main concerns and its leaders met Chinese diplomats recently.

Jamaat, which calls for a society governed by Islamic principles, has said the party is not inclined towards any country.

BNP's Rahman has said if his party formed the government it would have friendly relations with any nation that “offers what is suitable for my people and my country”.

Bangladesh, one of the world's most densely populated countries with high rates of extreme poverty, has been hit by high inflation, weakening reserves and slowing investment, which has pushed it to seek large-scale external financing since 2022, including billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Corruption is the biggest concern among the 128 million voters, followed by inflation, according to a survey by Dhaka-based think tanks Communication & Research Foundation and Bangladesh Election and Public Opinion Studies.

Analysts say Jamaat's clean image is a factor in its favour, much more than its Islamic leanings.

“Voters report high intention to participate, prioritise corruption and economic concerns over religious or symbolic issues, and express clear expectations for leaders who demonstrate care, competence and accountability,” said the survey.

Nevertheless, BNP's Rahman, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, is seen as the frontrunner to lead the next government. But if the Jamaat-led coalition emerges ahead, its chair, Shafiqur Rahman, could be in line for the top job.

Mohammad Rakib, 21, who is set to vote for the first time, said he hoped the next government would allow people to express their views and exercise their franchise freely.

“Everyone was tired of (Hasina's) Awami League. People couldn't even vote during national elections. People had no voice,” he said. “I hope the next government, whoever comes into power, will ensure this freedom of expression.”

Pope Leo XIV has sent 80 electric generators and thousands of medical supplies to Ukraine to help civilians cope with freezing winter temperatures and constant attacks, the Vatican announced on Feb. 9.

The aid was arranged in response to appeals from bishops who warned of mounting difficulties caused by Russia's attacks on energy infrastructure and subzero temperatures across the country.

Three trucks carrying the generators and medical supplies departed from the Basilica of Saint Sophia in Rome and have already arrived in Fastiv and Kyiv, areas heavily affected by recent strikes.

Alongside the generators, thousands of medical supplies were delivered, including antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, supplements, and melatonin, which Vatican officials said is in high demand as Ukrainians struggle with stress and sleep deprivation amid ongoing attacks.

The Vatican added that preparations are underway to send another shipment of medicine and food, with distribution coordinated through parish networks across Ukraine.

Since assuming the papacy last year, Pope Leo has called for ""a just and lasting peace"" in Ukraine and has offered to host peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow at the Vatican.

Zelensky has expressed support for such an initiative, while Russian officials have thus far rejected the proposal.

Before becoming pope, Leo XIV denounced Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine while serving as Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru.

Signed by the U.S. and NATO in July, the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) agreement lays out a mechanism for NATO member states and partners to purchase high-priority equipment for Ukraine.

24 countries, including two non-NATO member states Australia and New Zealand, have so far joined the initiative.

According to the NHK report, aid that Tokyo could fund for Ukraine through the program would be limited to non-lethal provisions. 

When asked by the Kyiv Independent about the news, a representative of the Japanese embassy said they are aware of the news, but denied that Japan had entered the program yet.

⁠""Currently there's no such common policy with NATO as in media reports at this point,"" they said.

Although Japan's post-World War II constitution restricts the provision of lethal military aid to foreign countries, Tokyo remains one of the top supporters of Ukraine, with around $15 billion worth of total aid (mostly financial and humanitarian) sent and another $3.5 billion committed, according to a December 2025 report by OSW.

The news comes just two days after Japan's conservative LDP party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cemented its power in snap elections on Feb. 8.

Takaichi is known for a hard-line stance on defense and security, particularly in the face of expansionist behavior from China. 

The first shipment of arms for Ukraine purchased under the PURL initiative arrived in September 2025, two months after the agreement was announced in Washington by U.S. President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said negotiations to end Russia's war against Ukraine remain far from finished, pushing back against recent U.S. claims of progress, in an interview with state-owned NTV aired on Feb. 10.

Lavrov warned against what he described as excessive optimism surrounding the talks, saying there was ""some kind of enthusiastic perception of what is happening"" that should not be embraced.

His comments contrast with remarks by U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump, who has said Ukraine and Russia are ""closer than ever before"" to a peace deal following recent negotiations.

""Negotiations are continuing… there is still a long way to go,"" Lavrov said.

The minister also pushed back against a growing narrative in Russia that Trump has ""put Europe in its place"" and forced President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept ceasefire terms.

""All of this would be very good if we want to achieve peace, but we are not there yet,"" he added. 

The remarks follow Lavrov's Feb. 9 interview with Russian-registered TV BRICS, in which he accused the Trump administration of abandoning alleged Russia–U.S. understandings on Ukraine.

Lavrov claimed Washington had backtracked on what he described as ""Anchorage agreements"" reached in 2025 that envisioned Ukraine surrendering Donbas region to Russia without fighting.

The White House has not confirmed the existence of such agreements.

Lavrov has also criticized the Trump administration for keeping in place U.S. sanctions adopted after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, arguing that they contradict Washington's declared interest in restoring cooperation with Moscow.

In the NTV interview, Lavrov reiterated familiar Kremlin talking points about Russia's foreign policy priorities, including building a ""multipolar world order"" and countering ""neocolonial practices.""

His comments come as diplomatic activity intensifies around efforts to end the war, with trilateral talks involving Ukraine, the United States, and Russia potentially resuming as early as this week. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Washington is pushing for the war to end before the start of summer and may apply pressure on the parties accordingly.

U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker rejected that characterization on Feb. 9, saying the United States has not set a deadline for ending the war.

Territorial issues remain the central obstacle in the negotiations. 

Russia has long demanded that Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas and has increasingly tied any future peace deal to such a move after more than a decade of fighting in the region. 

Ukraine has ruled out a withdrawal, though Ukrainian officials have said alternative arrangements, including a demilitarized zone, could be considered. 

The U.S. has also floated the idea of establishing a free economic zone in parts of the war-affected area.

When they saw Prime Minister Mark Carney galvanizing a Davos audience by imagining a new world order of united middle powers, many South Africans were eager to enlist in his coalition.

Canada and South Africa seem like natural allies. Both are resource-rich middle powers. Both are racing to seek new trading partners and diversify their overseas markets, to protect themselves from the wrath and tariffs of U.S. President Donald Trump.

But the potential, so far, is largely unrealized. South Africa remains low on Mr. Carney's priority list. The South African government, for its part, has done little to exploit the possibilities of the Canadian market. The story of their unfulfilled trade is a cautionary tale about the limits of the middle-power rhetoric.

The goodwill is indisputably there. South African politicians and commentators have been quoting Mr. Carney's speech ever since he delivered it at Davos last month, especially its signature line: “Middle powers must act together, because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.” Many have endorsed his vision of a middle-power partnership.

South Africa, a self-described ‘moral superpower,' rethinks its foreign policy

Top officials from the two countries forged close relations as they sat together at countless meetings last year to co-ordinate agendas for the Group of Seven, where Canada held the presidency, and the G20, which South Africa led. President Cyril Ramaphosa flew to Canada for the G7 summit, and Mr. Carney trekked to Johannesburg for the G20.

Promises have been plentiful. Ottawa introduced a new Africa Strategy last March, pledging to boost trade with the continent. Canada and South Africa were planning “an ambitious economic agenda,” according to Cheryl Urban, an assistant deputy minister at Global Affairs Canada, in testimony to a House of Commons committee in November.

Since then, South Africa has boosted its trade attractiveness with an uptick in its economic growth. Its electricity shortages have ended, and its currency has strengthened to three-year highs. It portrays itself as the gateway to the much larger African market, with a new continental trade agreement expected to reduce barriers.

After a year of meetings between Canadian and South African officials, however, few trade initiatives have emerged. Behind the optimistic rhetoric, the handful of announcements have been skimpy.

“We haven't seen Canada's specific efforts, beyond the high-level talk we have shared with leaders about the need to deepen trade,” said Wandile Sihlobo, an agricultural economist who sits on Mr. Ramaphosa's economic advisory council.

South Africa, he said, sees Canada as a “key potential trading partner” in the Americas, especially in the agricultural sector, and is pushing for progress this year in the aftermath of Mr. Trump's decision to hit South Africa with a 30-per-cent tariff.

“Still, we haven't made material progress on engaging Canada about the prospects of a trade deal,” he told The Globe and Mail. “We hope this year Canada can actively engage South Africa and be specific about its interests.”

After meeting Mr. Ramaphosa on the margins of the G20 in November, Mr. Carney announced only a small handful of initiatives.

He disclosed that the two countries had agreed to launch talks on a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA). But an investment deal is likely to take years to negotiate, analysts say. South Africa has been reluctant to sign such treaties over the past decade, preferring to offer a generic set of legislated protections for investors from all countries.

Mr. Carney also announced that South Africa would lead a trade mission to Canada. It later emerged, however, that the trade mission would be a farm industry delegation to an agricultural machinery trade show in Saskatchewan. There is no sign of a broader trade mission with visits to the capitals of either country.

In a third announcement, Mr. Carney promised the opening of a Cape Town office of FinDev Canada, the government's development finance institution. But in its Africa Strategy last year, Ottawa had said the FinDev office would open by the end of 2025. The delay is unexplained. A spokesperson for FinDev Canada said there is no confirmed date for the opening of the office yet, although it is expected some time this year. Nor will the office focus solely on South Africa – it will handle projects across the entire African continent.

“Despite last year's Africa Strategy. I see little evidence of serious, sustained, high-level engagement with African partners to foster a more comprehensive and strategic policy approach,” said David Black, a Dalhousie University professor who studies Canada-Africa relations.

“Any diversification and middle power coalition-building project should encompass Africa, and South Africa is the obvious place to start,” he told The Globe.

Business groups say they see a definite rise in trade interest among companies in both countries. The two governments, however, have mainly pursued other markets, including China and Europe.

“At present, there is no strong public indication of active, formal negotiations, unlike Canada's engagements with other regions,” said Greg Nott, a Johannesburg lawyer who chairs the Southern Africa-Canada Chamber of Commerce.

The political rhetoric about potential trade is slowly turning into commercial conversations, but the increased engagement is still modest, and largely at the exploratory level, Mr. Nott told The Globe.

The South African mission to Saskatchewan is too narrow and should have included a broader trade mission to Ottawa and Toronto, he said. “If you don't go where capital and decision-makers are, you miss half the opportunity.”

Trade numbers expose the lack of momentum. Canada has boosted its imports from South Africa over the past two decades – mainly in the mining sector – but its exports to the country have remained stagnant. It exported $583-million in goods to South Africa in 2024, roughly the same as it did in 2006 and less than it did in 2008. This was just 0.1 per cent of Canada's global exports in 2024, according to Statistics Canada.

The unfulfilled potential in South Africa is part of a larger neglect of the broader African market. A Senate committee reported in December that Africa accounted for barely 1 per cent of Canada's total merchandise trade in 2024. Canada's trade volume with Africa falls “well below” that of other G7 countries, the report said.

When talking to journalists, Mr. Carney has repeatedly insisted that Africa is one of the regions where he aims to expand trade relations. But in his Davos speech, when listing his trade deals around the world, he made no mention of Africa.

At a news conference in Johannesburg during the G20 summit, he said he decided to focus first on other regions of the world where potential returns are higher than in Africa. “That's because we have a responsibility to have that highest return,” he said.

In his talks with South Africa's President, Mr. Carney emphasized “Canada's strengths in clean and conventional energy and emerging technologies,” according to a readout by his office. But fast-growing South African sectors such as solar energy are already dominated by Chinese and European companies, with Canada struggling to catch up.

South African companies, for their part, have been slow to exploit the Canadian market, despite the rising level of interest on both sides as companies seek to diversify away from the U.S. market.

South Africa might be underestimating the value of Canada as a potential strategic partner – a country that shares its commitment to rules-based trade, Mr. Nott said.

“The opportunity now,” he said, “is to move from shared values and potential to execution, speed and scale.”

A top adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader discussed ways to reach a “balanced and just” agreement with the United States during talks in Oman on Tuesday, as Washington and Tehran prepare to resume negotiations aimed at averting a new conflict.

Oman facilitated talks between Iran and the U.S. last week, which a spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry said had allowed Tehran to gauge Washington's seriousness and showed enough consensus for diplomacy to continue.

The talks came after U.S. President Donald Trump positioned a naval flotilla in the region, raising fears of new military action. Trump, who joined an Israeli bombing campaign last year and hit Iranian nuclear sites, had threatened last month to intervene militarily during a bloody government crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran, but ultimately held off.

Netanyahu heads to Washington to encourage Trump to demand more from Iran

“After the talks, we felt there was understanding and consensus to continue the diplomatic process,” said the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Esmaeil Baghaei.

Baghaei said Tuesday's trip to Oman by Ali Larijani, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had been pre-planned, and that Larijani would travel next to Qatar, which has also mediated in several Middle East crises.

Oil prices eased on Tuesday as traders remained focused on Iran-U.S. tensions. 

Oman's state news agency said Larijani and Omani Sultan Haitham bin Tariq discussed ways to reach a “balanced and just” agreement between Iran and the U.S., stressing the importance of returning to dialogue to bridge differences and promote regional and global peace and security.

Iranian state media said the meeting lasted nearly three hours.

The date and venue of the next round of U.S.-Iran talks have yet to be announced. 

The U.S. is seeking to expand the scope of negotiations with Iran beyond the nuclear issue to curb Iran's ballistic missile programme, one of the biggest in the Middle East. 

Tehran says its missile arsenal has been rebuilt since last year's 12-day bombing campaign by Israel and the U.S., and that its stockpile is non-negotiable.

Iran and U.S. hold talks in Oman, with America's military leader in the Mideast joining in

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to use a meeting with Trump in Washington on Wednesday to push for any U.S.-Iran deal to include limitations on Tehran's missiles. 

Baghaei said the U.S. “must act independently of foreign pressures, especially Israeli pressures that ignore the interests of the region and even the U.S.”

In any negotiations, Iran would continue to demand the lifting of financial sanctions and insist on its nuclear rights including enrichment, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said. 

Washington has demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent fissile purity, a small step away from the 90 per cent that is considered weapons grade.

The head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Mohammad Eslami, said on Monday: “The possibility of diluting 60 per cent enriched uranium ... depends on whether, in return, all sanctions are lifted or not.”

Asked whether the U.S. would allow limited uranium enrichment by Iran, U.S. Vice-President JD Vance said during a visit to Armenia on Monday: “I think President Trump is going to make the ultimate determination about where we draw the red lines in the negotiations.” 

Iran and the U.S. held five rounds of talks last year on curbing Tehran's nuclear programme, with the process breaking down mainly due to disputes over uranium enrichment inside Iran.

Since Trump struck Iran's facilities, Tehran has said it has halted enrichment activity. It has always said its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.

Pakistan had decided to forfeit its high-profile T20 World Cup match against India after the ICC rejected Bangladesh's security concerns about playing in India and replaced them with Scotland.

The high-stakes match between India and Pakistan at the T20 World Cup is back on after the Pakistani government on Monday directed its national cricket team to play India.

The announcement ends a week-long boycott that had threatened one of the highlight events at the tournament, which is being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.

The decision came after a phone call between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Pakistan's government said in a statement posted on X.

The talks involved the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), the statement said, with the decision taken to protect ""the spirit of cricket.""

The T20 World Cup match is scheduled for February 15 in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.

Pakistan would have forfeited two points if they had skipped the match against India, potentially risking their chances of advancing in the tournament.

The 20-team T20 World Cup began on February 7 and ends on March 8.

Bangladesh refused to play in India and withdrew from the tournament over concerns about the ""safety and well-being"" of players, amid heightened political tensions between the South Asian neighbors.

Dismissing its security concerns, the ICC replaced the Bangladesh team with Scotland.

As a protest, Pakistan refused to face India in their group match, with PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi criticizing the ICC's ""double standards"" and ""injustice.""

""We are deeply moved by Pakistan's efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period,"" BCB president Mohammad Aminul Islam said in a statement. 

The ICC said on Monday that it would not impose any penalty on Bangladesh ​for ​their refusal to play in India, and announced that Bangladesh would host an event prior to the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2031.

Pakistan's change of heart came after intensive weekend negotiations, including visits to Lahore by ICC and BCB officials. The Pakistan government noted in its statement that the PCB was formally asked by ICC members, including Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates to end the boycott.

An India-Pakistan clash is among cricket's most lucrative events, generating millions of dollars in broadcast and sponsorship revenue. A cancellation would have threatened TV rights deals and ICC funding.

India captain Suryakumar Yadav said on Friday his team was ready to play as scheduled, while Pakistan captain Salman Agha said last week the team would follow government advice.

""The India game is not in our control. It was the government's decision,"" Agha said.

In September, controversy erupted after the Indian team won the Asia Cup with a victory over archrival Pakistan, but the Indian players refused to accept the trophy from Naqvi, who is also Pakistan's interior minister.

India's grip over cricket globally tightened after the appointment of Jay Shah, son of Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, as chairman of the ICC.

Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger tells DW the 2026 Munich Security Conference comes when ""obviously, trust has been damaged"" by President Trump. But he also says US calls for a more ""self-reliant"" Europe are fair and overdue.

The organizers of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) did not hesitate to name one world leader who they think is behind the current ""period of wrecking-ball politics.""

""The most powerful of those who take the axe to existing rules and institutions is US President Donald Trump,"" they wrote in the Munich Security Report 2026released on Monday.

The release came as organizers announced that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead ""a sizable delegation"" of officials to the MSC this weekend.

Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger spoke to DW on Monday, before the annual event opens its doors in the Bavarian capital. 

He said he saw two core functions for this year's MSC, the first he likened to a ""bicycle repair shop,"" oiling the chain and getting trans-Atlantic ties rolling again after a tense few weeks. 

""Part of our mission, I think, is to at least offer the possibility of repair work in terms of rebuilding, trust, confidence building, et cetera among trans-Atlantic partners. Obviously, trust has been damaged. Think of Greenland,"" Ischinger told DW's Nina Haase. 

The MSC will bring together about 65 world leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, along with nearly 100 foreign and defense ministers, top military brass and high-level policymakers for three days of discussions.

Ischinger, a former US ambassador closely associated with the event for decades, said he also hoped the event would contribute to a more self-reliant Europe, ""after 80 years of relying on the American security umbrella.""

""It's not written in the Bible, as the Polish prime minister used to say, that 450 million Europeans need 350 million Americans to defend themselves against 140 million Russians,"" Ischinger said. ""Why can we not comply with the American demand of doing more for ourselves to become more capable, more self-reliant? We should.""

At the 2025 MSC, Vice President JD Vance launched a blistering attack on the US's European allies , accusing EU leaders of curbing free speech, permitting too much migration and ignoring voters' views.

Vance held talks with AfD party leaders, not represented in Munich that year, on the same visit. But Ischinger told DW that the far-right German party's return in 2026 had nothing to do with pressure from the US administration. 

""That's just a myth. I've never been approached by anyone from the US side about that at all,"" he said. 

""Second, I just want to make sure that everyone understands my sympathy for the AfD is close to zero. I have no sympathy for this party, but I need to recognize I am the head of a private foundation which runs a private, independent dialogue forum called the Munich Security Conference,"" Ischinger said. 

He said that when his predecessor Christoph Heusgen revoked AfD invitations, there was a very specific context. 

""The AfD had just walked out of a speech by President Zelenskyy in the German Bundestag [parliament], which was really something which made everybody, including myself, very, very angry. But since that moment, we've had elections in this country. And the AfD is now the single largest opposition party. Should I ignore that?"" he asked.

The 2026 Munich Security Report also aims to focus on what Ischinger called ""the elephant in the room,"" a broader backlash against the principles that have underpinned global governance since 1945.

""For generations, US allies were not just able to rely on American power but on a broadly shared understanding of the principles underpinning the international order,"" Ischinger wrote in his foreword to the report.

""Today, this appears far less certain, raising difficult questions about the future shape of transatlantic and international cooperation,"" he added.

While Rubio will lead the Trump administration's delegation, some prominent US critics of the president will also speak at the MSC. 

California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York are all scheduled to participate.

The report warns that across Western democracies, public trust in institutions is eroding, and parties promising radical change are gaining ground.

""The result is a new climate in which those who employ bulldozers, wrecking balls, and chainsaws are often cautiously admired if not openly celebrated,"" the report says.

Trump's disruptive approach appeals to supporters who believe breaking established institutions can overcome political gridlock, as seen in moves on NATO spending and an Israel-Hamas ceasefire.

But the long-term result may be a shift toward transactional, interest-driven global politics.

""Ironically, this would be a world that privileges the rich and powerful, not those who have placed their hopes in wrecking-ball politics,"" the report stresses.

Globally, the US ""renunciation of core elements of the existing international order"" is straining systems already under pressure, from the WTO to humanitarian aid, the report states.

In Europe, Washington's wavering support for Ukraine and shifting security signals are deepening fears as Russia intensifies military and hybrid attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is among the most prominent guests expected in Munich.

In the Indo-Pacific, partners face growing uncertainty as China pushes for dominance and US commitments appear increasingly unpredictable.

Ischinger emphasized that regardless of how one views current US foreign policy, it is already reshaping the world in profound ways, with consequences that are only beginning to unfold.

Ghislaine Maxwell said she would exonerate Donald Trump over any wrongdoing connected to Jeffrey Epstein in exchange for clemency.

Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in trafficking girls to Epstein, testified before Congress on Monday that she would not answer any questions about the convicted paedophile.

But David Oscar Markus, her lawyer, said after the hearing that she would be willing to testify that the US president and Bill Clinton, the former president, had not done anything wrong in relation to their links with Epstein in return for clemency.

This prompted a backlash from Democrats, who called for her to be returned to a maximum-security prison and accused the White House of a “cover-up”.

Mr Markus, who said he advised his client to stay silent during questioning from Congress, told reporters: “Ms Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump.”

He continued: “Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters.

“For example, both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.”

Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative who played a key role in the release of the files, called for Maxwell to be returned to her maximum-security prison after she refused to answer the committee's questions.

He said on social media: “Here is my conclusion after sitting through Maxwell's deposition with her refusing to answer a single question about the men who raped underage girls, saying she would only do so for clemency.

“She must immediately be sent back to the maximum security prison where she belongs.”

Maxwell appeared via video link from Bryan Federal Prison Camp in Texas, a minimum-security facility she was moved to in July 2025. Dressed in her prison uniform and glasses, she spoke only to spell her name and to invoke her “right to silence”, the 20-minute video of her deposition shows.

In the clip James Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked Maxwell whether she was a close friend of Epstein.

Maxwell, who was wearing a beige button-up shirt and glasses with dark, cropped hair, said: “I would like to answer your question.

“But on the advice of counsel I respectfully decline to answer this question and any related questions.”

Mr Trump was friends with Epstein for some 15 years until the early 2000s, while Mr Clinton is pictured multiple times in releases from the Epstein files. Both men, who have denied any wrongdoing, flew on the paedophile's private jet several times.

Mr Clinton will testify under oath before the oversight committee on Feb 27, having resisted a subpoena for months until he was threatened with a possible prison sentence.

Maxwell, a former socialite and the ex-girlfriend of Epstein, was jailed in 2022 for procuring women and underage girls for him.

She claimed in January that 29 associates and friends of Epstein were shielded by the US government through “secret settlements”.

The decision to move her to a minimum-security jail after she testified favourably about Mr Trump in July previously faced scrutiny.

Interviewed by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, Maxwell said Mr Trump had been a “gentleman in all respects” and that he was “never inappropriate with anybody”.

Days after her interview, she was quietly moved from her Florida jail to a minimum-security prison in Texas.

Suhas Subramanyam, a Democratic representative, said that Maxwell appeared “robotic” and “unrepentant” throughout Monday's hearing.

He accused Mr Trump of impeding the investigation, saying Maxwell refused to answer questions because “the president is waving a pardon over her head”.

“In no way should she ever be pardoned. I call on the president to firmly commit to never pardoning her,” he said, adding: “The victims deserve justice.”

Asked on Monday whether Mr Trump was open to the offer, the White House said a pardon was “not something he's talking about or even thinking about at this moment in time. I can assure you of that”.

Six men, including one foreign government official, have had their names redacted from the Epstein files.

Members of congress were allowed to review the unredacted files for the first time on Monday. After doing so, they expressed concern that high-profile men had their faces and images obscured for no clear reason.

Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, said he discovered the names of six men whose identities have been redacted from the released documents and who “are likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files”.

Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, said: “There's no explanation why those people were redacted.”

The two men, who were responsible for the release of the files, declined to name the six men who had been obscured but Mr Massie said one of them “is pretty high up in a foreign government” and Mr Khanna said one of the others “is a pretty prominent individual”.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA), which Congress passed in November, compelled the US department of justice (DoJ) to release all of the documents in its possession related to Jeffrey Epstein.

It required the redaction of the names or personal identifying information about Epstein's victims, who numbered more than 1,000 according to the FBI.

But it said no records could be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure or foreign dignitary”.

“Our law was very clear,” Mr Khanna said. “Unless something was classified, it required it to be unredacted.”

Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, was among the members of congress who examined the unredacted Epstein files at a secure DoJ location on Monday. Members were not allowed to bring with them an electronic device but were allowed to take handwritten notes.

“I saw the names of lots of people who were redacted for mysterious or baffling or inscrutable reasons,” Mr Raskin told reporters.

He added: “There are certainly lots of names of other people who were enablers and co-operators with Jeffrey Epstein that were just blanked out for no apparent reason.”

Epstein, who had ties to top business executives, politicians, celebrities and academics, was found dead in his New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking underage girls.

A number of political and business leaders have already been resigned or had their reputations tarnished after their ties with Epstein were revealed in the files published on Jan 30.

The Trump administration's push for mass deportations has resulted in more than 18,000 challenges in federal court from immigrants claiming their detention is illegal, more than were filed under the last three administrations combined — including President Donald Trump's first term.

So far this year, immigrants are filing on average more than 200 of these cases, known as habeas petitions, daily across the country, with California and Texas accounting for about 40% of new cases, a ProPublica analysis of federal court filings found. To keep tabs on this historic rise, ProPublica is publishing a habeas case tracker.

“I don't recall a time that anything like this has ever happened,” said Daniel Caudillo, director of the Immigration Law Clinic at Texas Tech University School of Law and a recently departed immigration judge.

The wave of habeas petitions comes in response to new administration policies aimed at ramping up the number of deportations. Among those are policies that require the majority of immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in detention while their immigration cases are proceeding.

Lawyers say these policies upend decades of legal precedent that previously allowed immigrants who had been in the country for years and posed no security or flight risk a chance to remain in their communities until an immigration judge could determine whether they could stay in the country legally.

On Friday night, a divided three-judge panel in the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with the administration in limiting bond hearings to immigrants who entered the country lawfully. Caudillo called the decision “devastating,” adding that as a result, most immigrants held in states that fall under the circuit, which includes Texas, will now be subject to mandatory detention. Appeals of judges' rulings in habeas cases challenging immigrants' detention have been filed in nine of the 12 regional appeals courts, meaning the question could ultimately find its way to the Supreme Court.

A large majority of federal judges who've ruled on the habeas petitions so far are siding with immigrants. A recent analysis by Politico found that over 300 judges have ruled against the administration's new detention policies, while only 14 have upheld them. The result is that federal judges frequently are ordering the government to either release immigrants from detention or offer them a bond hearing before an immigration judge to determine whether they are eligible for release while their immigration case proceeds.

Officials from the White House and Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to a list of questions, but in statements, spokespeople insisted that the Trump administration is fully enforcing federal immigration law and placed the blame on the federal judges.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing the law and arresting illegal aliens who have no right to be in our country, and reversed Biden's catch and release policy. We are applying the law as written,” wrote Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson.

The caseload has overwhelmed legal advocates and government attorneys.

In court filings, U.S. attorneys are telling judges the sheer volume of petitions is burdening their offices, pushing them to shift resources away from other priorities. In a case originating from Minnesota, where the administration has been waging a monthslong immigration crackdown, U.S. Attorney Daniel Rosen wrote in a declaration that his attorneys and paralegals were “continuously working over time” while the office's civil division was at 50% capacity.

The number of habeas filings in that state jumped from a dozen in 2024 to over 700 in the past two months alone, placing Minnesota third behind Texas and California, ProPublica found. The load has been such that, in a rare moment of candor, a government attorney detailed to the office complained to a federal judge that “the system sucks, this job sucks.” The lawyer, Julie Le, reportedly was let go from the U.S. attorney's office after the public rant. (ProPublica was not able to reach Le for comment. The Department of Justice confirmed her detail with the office was over.)

“If rogue judges followed the law in adjudicating cases and respected the Government's obligation to properly prepare cases, there wouldn't be an ‘overwhelming' habeas caseload or concern over DHS following orders,” a DOJ spokesperson wrote in response to questions from ProPublica.

“Then there are a lot of rogue judges,” said David Briones, a senior judge in the Western District of Texas, in response to the Justice Department's statement. “Obviously we feel that we're correct, that's all I can say.” The Western District of Texas leads the country in habeas cases, with over 1,300 filed in the last three months, and Briones has generally ruled against the government in these cases, according to El Paso Matters. The Texas Tribune has also reported on the rise of habeas cases in Texas.

Judges are growing increasingly frustrated, publicly rebuking the administration for missing deadlines and failing to comply with court orders.

Recently, a Texas federal judge ordered the release of the 5-year-old Minnesota boy who made headlines after he was pictured wearing a blue bunny hat and a Spider-Man backpack as immigration agents escorted him and his father to their vehicle. In a fiery ruling, judge Fred Biery of the Western District of Texas chastised the administration for Liam Conejo Ramos' detention. “The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children,” he wrote.

The number of immigrants held in detention has increased from around 40,000 when Trump took office to more than 70,000 this year. While the number of recent border crossers in detention has fallen, the number of detained immigrants arrested by federal immigration agents elsewhere in the country tripled during the first nine months of the Trump administration, a recent analysis by the Deportation Data Project found.

“It's just been a very, very chaotic landscape,” said Sirine Shebaya, executive director of the National Immigration Project, a national advocacy organization that, among other things, represents detained immigrants and provides assistance to attorneys and community-based groups.

“And I think that chaos is bleeding into communities everywhere, both because of the extremely traumatizing ways that people are being arrested and detained,” she said, and because of the amount of money and resources being spent on detaining people who in the past would have gotten out on bond or not been detained in the first place as their cases made their way through the process.

Denise Gilman, co-director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, who has argued habeas cases on behalf of immigrants over the years, sees a positive side to the sudden rise in cases, she told ProPublica.

“People are starting to pay attention to how massive and arbitrary and illogical the immigration detention system is.”

For this story, ProPublica analyzed federal habeas petitions filed by immigrant detainees in district courts across the country using records from Public Access to Court Electronic Records and the Free Law Project. The data includes some cases that were refiled for a variety of reasons, such as filing errors or deficiencies.

However, 4,200 nurses are still at the strike line at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, aiming to reach a new contract.

More than 10,000 union nurses at Montefiore and Mount Sinai Hospitals ended the longest and largest nurses strike in New York City on Monday after negotiating fair health care benefits, safe staffing groups, and improved workplace safety measures. 

The New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA), the union representing the nurses, announced that workers will vote on a series of tentative agreements with the two hospitals, negotiated over the weekend, later in the week. Nurses were set to vote sometime between Feb. 9 and 11. 

If they ratify the contract, they will return to work on Feb. 14 and effectively end their participation in the strike 28 days after walking off the job in early January. 

However, 4,200 nurses are still at the strike line at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, aiming to reach a new contract that ensures nurse departments are appropriately staffed, union officials said.

“We really appreciate all the solidarity we have received. It's a great reminder that New York City's unions and elected officials keep this city a union town,” NYSNA Executive Director Pat Kane said in a press release. “It shows that this strike is not just about nurses, it's about protecting care for all working people.”

Mount Sinai CEO Brendan Carr issued a statement addressing community members about what a potential transition for nurses to return to work would entail. 

“This process has been difficult for all of us,” Carr wrote, vowing to share more details about nurses' return to work if the contract is ratified. “While it has been amazing to once again see Mount Sinai do extraordinary things in order to serve our patients and community, it will take time to rebuild the momentum that we had in the alignment of our organization.”

A spokesperson for Montefiore did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

Nurses at the three major hospitals began their historic strike in early January, braving the frigid New York winter and sacrificing their pay and health care to secure a safer and more financially just workplace. 

Since then, elected leaders from New York and elsewhere have shown up to the strike line, demanding that the hospitals meet union nurses at the bargaining table. 

Part of the gains secured by union negotiators include commitments to maintaining enforceable safe staffing standards, which were a key sticking point nurses highlighted in interviews with Prism earlier this month. They said it would improve patient care. 

Two other major highlights among the temporary agreements include protection against rising health insurance costs and increased workplace safety measures. 

“Nurses at Montefiore and Mount Sinai systems are heading back to the bedside with our heads held high after winning fair tentative contracts,” NYSNA President Nancy Haggans said in a statement. 

Elesha Van Zee, a radiology nurse at Mount Sinai West, said the prospect of ratifying a new contract that prioritizes affordable health care will help her family's medical care remain on track. Van Zee's husband Ivan Larios had been receiving care at a Mount Sinai hospital under Van Zee's insurance to treat a severe infection on his leg that stemmed from a series of grave fractures he suffered in 2020.

“His care has been on hold for the duration of the strike,” she said. “Even though we will have health coverage upon return to work, there are still issues we need to resolve, like Mount Sinai physicians being out of network for nurses and our families. This is still a stressful situation that I hope to overcome. Because of the extent of the injury, he cannot transfer his care to another physician.”

Negotiators also secured protections for nurses in the workplace, which workers have said is an imperative for nurses to provide adequate care.

“My patients deserved to feel safe in a hospital while receiving the care,” Van Zee said. “If I'm not even ensured safety, then how can I ensure their safety to the best of my ability?”

Part of those safety measures include protections that negotiators secured for immigrant and trans patients.

KA Hogan, an emergency department nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital, said protections against immigration enforcement investigations in hospitals carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are vital to nurses and patients alike. 

“We have seen ICE come into hospitals,” Hogan told Prism in January. “We have seen patients be concerned about being deported and seeking health care because of the violence of ICE.”

The hospitals also agreed to increase nurses' salaries by more than 12% over the life of the three-year contract in order to recruit and retain nurses for safe patient care.

But as nurses at Montefiore and Mount Sinai mull potentially ratifying their new contracts, the strike at NewYork-Presbyterian rages on.

Both parties last met Sunday, Feb. 8, but union officials said safe staffing concerns remain among the rank and file. A NewYork-Presbyterian spokesperson did not address a list of questions about where both parties stand, but said mediators presented a “comprehensive proposal” to all parties during the Sunday meeting. 

“NewYork-Presbyterian accepted the proposal which includes the same wage increases for all three hospitals, as well as preserves the pension, maintains our nurses' health benefits, and includes increased staffing levels. We look forward to bringing our nurses back to care for our patients,” the spokesperson wrote.

For Van Zee, the resilience nurses have shown is indicative of their commitment to their patients. As the strike continues at NewYork-Presbyterian, Van Zee wished those nurses unity.

“The only reason we won our contract is because nurses stayed united and strong and fought back,” she said. “It breaks my heart for those nurses, their families, and their patients. A strike is never wanted, and the choice is a difficult one to make. Standing up for yourself, your family, and for your patients is a brave choice and you sacrifice your entire livelihood, which I don't think people realize.”

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 How the CCP Balances Control and Innovation

 Jennifer Lind

Conventional wisdom has long held that China would never become a technological powerhouse. From the late 1970s to the early twenty-first century, despite the country's rapid economic growth, its technology base lagged decades behind that of the United States. Many prominent social scientists assumed that China would be unable to catch up: the country's authoritarian institutions, they argued, stifled innovation through repression, censorship, and corruption, which would prevent it from ever truly competing with the United States. China, unable to keep pace with the United States technologically, would thus be no match for it economically or militarily.

But seemingly in the blink of an eye, China has become a global innovation leader. Chinese firms dominate high-tech sectors such as electric vehicles, advanced batteries, renewable energy, and telecommunications. And Beijing is now vying for leadership in artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and quantum science—the technologies on which future productivity and military power will be based.

China defied the conventional wisdom because its leaders understood that they faced a tension between maintaining political control and fostering innovation to sustain growth. Pursuing what I call “smart authoritarianism,” the Chinese Communist Party adapted its tools of authoritarian control to meet the demands of the globalized information age. Beijing found ways to provide freedom to entrepreneurs and innovators while inhibiting collective action and restraining passions that might imperil the regime. In its effort to maintain political control, the CCP sacrificed some growth that may have been possible under a freer system. But the party created enough space to foster innovation without loosening its hold on power.

China's successful pursuit of innovation means that an authoritarian superpower is now capable of challenging the United States in East Asia, supporting autocracies worldwide, and shaping global governance to advance its own interests. If the United States and its allies are to address China's growing challenge, they must first understand how analysts erred in underestimating it.

The success of Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in the late twentieth century showed that authoritarian regimes can preside over what economists call catch-up growth: lifting their economies from poverty to middle income in terms of per capita GDP. The leaders of those countries invested in education and infrastructure, professionalized their civil services to improve the quality of governance, and directed investment into manufactured exports to grow their economies. China's economic rise began in the late 1970s when Deng Xiaoping emulated this model.

After economies catch up, however, they can no longer rely on cheap labor and capital to drive future growth. They need to enhance productivity through innovation. But many scholars argue that the political controls on which authoritarian regimes rely to stay in power quash innovation, giving liberal democracies an advantage in economic development. The 2024 Nobel Prize in economics, for instance, was awarded to Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson for their theory that inclusive institutions—those that foster broad participation in economic activity and create a stable business environment, such as property rights, rule of law, and an open and vibrant civil society—are the keys to sustained growth.

Such institutions, those and other scholars argue, are incompatible with authoritarian rule. Autocrats censor information and limit citizens' participation in global educational and scientific networks. They typically permit little or no independent civil society, curbing the actions of the private sector, universities, and nongovernmental organizations. And they are wary of constraining their arbitrary decision-making authority or engaging in reforms that would disrupt the patronage relationships that undergird their power.

In the words of the political scientist Samuel Huntington, authoritarian leaders face a “king's dilemma.” They can maintain a tight grip over their societies, but doing so will suppress innovation and growth. Alternatively, they can permit the freer flow of information and encourage creativity and dynamism, but it risks opening their societies to alternative sources of influence and power that could threaten the regime. Many scholars have thus concluded that authoritarian regimes face an inexorable choice between maintaining control and having an innovative economy.

The fate of other East Asian regimes seemed to support these arguments—and to suggest that China's future growth would be stymied by the king's dilemma. South Korea and Taiwan grew highly innovative, but they democratized. Authoritarian Singapore was the exception: its ruling party remained in power while the country grew innovative and rich. Yet the tiny city-state's success seemed an improbable model for a country like China, with its massive economy and over a billion people.

China has proved that the supposed incompatibility between political control and technological innovation is not nearly as insurmountable as many observers believed. China's leaders showed that the Singaporean case offered many lessons for countries large and small alike.

The CCP, following the example of other smart authoritarian regimes, learned how to adapt its tools of control to a modern economy. Its leaders knew that the country needed highly skilled workers, information flows, and international exchange and collaboration—even as the CCP feared that these could threaten the regime. Beijing also realized that it needed to project a friendlier image and eschew wanton violence to avoid the opprobrium of the global community, reassure domestic investors, and attract foreign direct investment. This form of softer, smarter authoritarianism, the political scientists Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman have argued, is “better adapted to a world of open borders, international media, and knowledge-based economies.”

Starting with Deng's reforms, China's government created a highly skilled workforce by investing heavily in elite higher education. Today, China leads the world in producing engineers and Ph.D. graduates in science and engineering, and its universities claimed eight of the top ten spots on Leiden University's 2025 global ranking of schools by scientific research output. The CCP also professionalized the civil service, implementing strict qualification examinations and prioritizing competence over connections. And the government has gradually improved property rights protections and commercial law. Provinces advertised their property rights systems to compete to attract foreign direct investment, which helped boost their economic growth rates.

In the reform period, especially under Jiang Zemin's leadership (1989 to 2002), the CCP also permitted the expansion of commercial media outlets, private-sector companies, and nonprofit organizations. A larger civil society not only boosted economic growth and enabled the diffusion of ideas; it also strengthened the CCP, as the political scientist Jessica Teets has observed, by serving as a source of information about societal problems and by promoting policy reforms that strengthened the regime's hold on power.



Yet the regime has never relinquished control over civil society. The party uses its monopoly on power to direct research agendas toward topics that support state goals, restrict public discussions of politics, and predetermine judicial rulings if it feels that social stability or its reputation is at stake. It also strictly monitors individuals, firms, and nongovernmental organizations and permits only those who are compliant to operate. In 2009, for example, the tax and civil affairs bureaus imposed a massive fine and revoked the registration of the Open Constitution Initiative, also known as Gongmeng, a prominent legal advocacy organization, on questionable tax evasion charges. Gongmeng had published research reports on governance issues, including the 2008 protests in Tibet against CCP rule, and defended citizens in high-profile public interest cases. Social organizations are thus given enough space to achieve narrowly defined goals that accord with state priorities, but risk being shut down if they venture into territory that threatens CCP control.

The CCP also adapted to the advent of digital and social media by pioneering new strategies for controlling information. Although they sometimes revert to heavy-handed censorship, China's leaders have found novel ways to more subtly and efficiently control the public sphere. For instance, the political scientist Margaret Roberts has identified how the regime makes information harder to access by slowing web traffic or misfiling documents, flooding online spaces with pro-regime content to distract or dilute criticism, and privately intimidating users to dissuade them from spreading sensitive material.

The CCP also shifted from high- to low-intensity repression. The bloody crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989 put CCP repression in the global spotlight and discouraged foreign investment in China. Since then, the party has adopted more targeted methods to constrain domestic opponents. As the political scientist Rory Truex has found, Beijing closely tracks dissidents and disgruntled citizens to stop them from joining protests, observes a “dissident calendar” in which it preemptively detains activists during key anniversaries, and recruits family members to pressure protesters to desist. When the regime feels it must resort to violence, such as when it wants to forcibly evict farmers from land for development projects, it outsources coercion to “thugs for hire,” as the scholar Lynette Ong has argued, to distance itself from the aggression. And through massive investments in AI, especially facial recognition and other biometrics, the CCP can rely more on technology than truncheons to control the population.

Importantly, smart authoritarianism is not a growth-maximizing strategy. Leaders understand that through their efforts to retain control, they are leaving some economic growth on the table. But while greater openness and freedoms could mean more innovation and faster growth, it could come at the cost of losing power. Where this sweet spot between freedom and control lies changes in response to public opinion, the economy's developmental stage, evolving technologies and methods of control, and the drivers of growth and innovation. Smart authoritarian leaders must constantly adjust the levers of control to open up society when they can and tighten their grip when they must. When they get that balance right, innovation can flourish even without inclusive institutions.

China's smart authoritarianism has yielded impressive results. The country once dismissed as a copycat now ranks among the world's most innovative. In 2025, China ranked among the top ten most technologically advanced countries in the Global Innovation Index, leap-frogging France, Germany, and Japan. Not even a decade ago, consumers around the world may have struggled to identify a single Chinese brand; now, Chinese firms such as BYD, Huawei, ByteDance, and Alibaba are household names. Chinese-dominated supply chains underpin many high-tech industries, and the country controls large shares of global production and processing capacity for batteries, solar panels, and critical minerals. And Chinese firms are becoming increasingly competitive in other sectors traditionally dominated by U.S., Japanese, or European firms, such as industrial robotics, advanced machine tools, and parts of biotech and biopharmaceuticals.

China's advance has shifted global technology flows. For decades, Western companies sold products to China and built factories there to access the country's cheap labor and vast markets, while Chinese firms absorbed Western intellectual property. Today, China has reached the global technological frontier in industries such as electric vehicles, batteries, drones, and robotics; Western firms are increasingly licensing Chinese technology and partnering with Chinese firms to stay competitive.

Starting in 2022, the United States and other countries imposed export controls on cutting-edge chips to slow the pace of China's AI development. But these policies have also galvanized Chinese innovation. In 2025, Chinese AI company DeepSeek unveiled its R1 model, which performed comparably to top U.S. large language models despite being trained on a fraction of the chips typically used by rivals. China's top-tier generative AI startups, known as the “six tigers” (Zhipu AI, MiniMax, Baichuan, Moonshot, StepFun, and 01.AI), are battling for market share and technical leadership. Meanwhile, tech behemoths Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Xiaomi are pouring resources into AI development. Although the United States continues to lead in producing the world's most prominent AI models, it now finds itself locked in a technology rivalry with the country that previously faced a seemingly insurmountable disadvantage.

China's commercial innovation also translates to military advancements and the modernization of the People's Liberation Army. The PLA has integrated AI into command, targeting, surveillance, and autonomous operations. China is testing AI-powered swarms of hundreds of autonomously operating drones and has developed intelligent battle management systems that can process vast amounts of battlefield data faster than human commanders can. The PLA has also expanded both its nuclear forces and improved the delivery systems it uses to deploy them, such as through fractional orbital bombardment systems that send weapons into low Earth orbit and could potentially evade U.S. missile defense systems. The PLA is untested in battle, but commercial innovation has equipped the military with cutting-edge technology that could make its forces more capable than their experience might suggest.

Skeptics might argue that China won't pose a serious geopolitical challenge because it faces a host of economic problems that will preoccupy its leaders and diminish its national capabilities. Although it has made major strides in innovation, the country has a long way to go to generate enough productivity to sustain economic growth—even at much-reduced levels—in the face of an aging population, a troubled property market, and competition among firms for shrinking returns so intense that it threatens to undercut entire sectors.

Although China's economic headwinds are real, the CCP has repeatedly defied predictions of both political and economic catastrophe. Public anger over draconian COVID-19 lockdowns, which appeared to portend an imminent crisis, has not fundamentally destabilized the regime. The country has made significant progress cleaning up environmental damage, notably air pollution, caused by decades of lightly regulated growth. And in the 1990s, the CCP presided over massive reform of the bloated state sector, which included more than 30 million layoffs. Much more reform of the state sector is essential to improve the efficient use of capital and promote innovation, but in the past the party has shown itself capable of far more difficult challenges.

Xi Jinping's centralization of power, repressive policies, and crackdowns on civil society organizations and private-sector firms have also raised concerns that China's era of smart authoritarianism is over and that such policies will stifle the country's economic dynamism. But periods of tightening are part of the smart authoritarian model and recurred frequently throughout China's own decades of rapid growth. China's stunning success in the AI sector—a sector that did not exist before Xi's rule—shows that Xi's policies have not stopped innovation. And Xi appears keenly aware of the balance between control and openness. After initiating a strict crackdown on the tech sector in 2020, which erased more than $1 trillion of firms' market value, Xi gathered private business and technology leaders for a symposium in February 2025 to show the party's support for entrepreneurs in critical sectors. In December, officials announced the establishment of a state-backed venture capital guidance fund to channel about $140 billion in investment into strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, quantum technology, and hydrogen energy.



The United States and its partners should assume that China will remain a formidable economic, technological, diplomatic, and military power. Indeed, the challenge posed by China is even more daunting than that of the previous superpower, the Soviet Union. Whereas the Soviet Union at its peak had only about 40 percent of U.S. GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity), China already exceeds 100 percent of U.S. GDP on comparable measures. Many observers expected China to mirror the Soviet Union's inability to reform its institutions to meet the challenges of the information age, but China has shown itself adept at acquiring and working with new technology.

China now poses a serious military threat to Taiwan and across East Asia—a region where the U.S. military previously roamed unimpeded. The CCP is sharing its control technologies with autocrats around the world, including in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Iran, and frequently trains those countries' officials in methods of authoritarian governance. Beijing has also been strategically shaping the agendas of international institutions—and its influence is growing as the Trump administration pulls out from such groupings and Washington seeks to reduce its international responsibilities. The success of China's smart authoritarianism provides an appealing model for leaders in places such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam to emulate.

The United States cannot simply expect that China and its authoritarian regime will follow the Soviets into history's dustbin. Indeed, contrary to Western hubris, smart authoritarians have shown themselves to be adaptable and competent. To meet the challenge of an innovative China, then, the United States must lean into the strengths that have made it a technological powerhouse: world-class educational institutions (and the overseas talent they attract), well-regulated and deep financial markets, global financial leadership, a robust culture of entrepreneurship, a vibrant civil society, and a unique position at the center of innovation networks in both Europe and Asia. China has shown that, through adaptation, authoritarian regimes can innovate effectively and compete with democracies. How well the United States deals with the rise of smart authoritarianism depends on whether it can adapt, too.

 How U.S.-Chinese Competition Could Leave Most Countries Behind

 Sam Winter-Levy and Anton Leicht

The future of artificial intelligence will be controlled by the United States and China. The two countries employ 70 percent of the world's top machine learning researchers, command 90 percent of global computing power, and attract the vast majority of AI investment—more than twice the combined total of every other state combined. In past technological revolutions, powers that were not at the frontier could gradually adopt new capabilities and catch up. But the AI revolution will be different, locking those countries into a strategic trap that could consign much of the world to technological vassalage.

This trap particularly affects what might be called the AI middle powers: countries such as France, India, and the United Kingdom, which have substantial state capacity and economic resources but lack the scale, capital, energy, and computing power to build frontier AI systems on their own. These powers face three principal challenges. First, their access to frontier AI capabilities is subject to the whims of policymakers in Washington and Beijing. Second, they remain exposed to AI's disruptive effects—including job losses, social upheaval, and the expansion of AI-enhanced cybercrime—whether or not they share in its benefits. Third, they lack the leverage and the policy tools necessary to shape AI's development or manage its consequences.

Enduring marginalization is not inevitable. But avoiding it will require the middle powers to retain access to frontier AI capabilities and identify what economic and strategic value they can offer to a world transformed by AI systems. Different paths to these goals remain open: some middle powers may choose to align themselves with the United States or China, some may attempt to play Washington and Beijing against each other to extract concessions, and others may mount an ambitious attempt at technological sovereignty. But all of them will ultimately have to reckon with what a global AI economy might look like—and where they might find leverage within it.

Today, most middle powers access AI the same way individuals do: through commercial products and interfaces provided by foreign companies. But that access is less stable than it appears. Unlike manufactured goods, weapons, or energy, AI capabilities cannot be stockpiled. Every query to a frontier AI system depends on real-time access to infrastructure controlled by a handful of Silicon Valley firms—and, ultimately, by the U.S. government, which can restrict access to American AI systems through export controls or sanctions. This dominance could change: China is rapidly building out its own infrastructure, though it remains a few years behind. And efficiency gains might eventually democratize access: smaller models require less computing power, which could lower the barrier to entry. But so far, each new generation of frontier systems has grown more demanding to run, not less.

If the United States or China decided to cut off a middle power's access to systems based in its territory, the consequences would currently be limited because few essential services—hospitals, power grids, or military systems, for example—depend on frontier AI to function. But as artificial intelligence becomes more deeply embedded in critical economic and national security infrastructure, those stakes will rise. And this risk is not hypothetical. In other areas, both the United States and China have proved willing to weaponize other countries' dependence in search of leverage. China has repeatedly used export restrictions on rare earths elements and critical minerals as a coercive tool, while the United States has leveraged European reliance on U.S. security guarantees to extract trade concessions and pressure Denmark over Greenland. There is little reason to think that Beijing and Washington will show more restraint when it comes to AI.



Some middle powers have attempted to address this vulnerability by building data centers that can run foreign models within their borders, giving them greater control over those systems and the data they process. Recently unveiled projects in the European Union, South Korea, and the United Kingdom all include provisions for greater access to sovereign computing resources for running foreign AI systems. Because these arrangements preserve revenue streams for U.S. companies while binding allies more closely to American infrastructure, U.S. companies as well as the U.S. government are promoting them through private initiatives such as OpenAI's Stargate data centers and policy directives encouraging AI exports.

But data center buildouts are extraordinarily expensive and may not be economically viable for every country attempting them. Countries with high AI adoption rates, including Germany and the United Kingdom, face steep energy costs and local resistance to major new infrastructure projects, making large-scale data centers a hard political sell. And even if countries build out local data centers, their dependence problem will persist. AI models require continuous updates to remain competitive, meaning that any version running on a sovereign data center will quickly fall behind without ongoing access to the provider. The computing hardware itself—advanced chips and networking infrastructure that come from U.S.-controlled supply chains—requires regular maintenance and replacement. Complete sovereignty over AI infrastructure, in other words, remains elusive.

Sovereignty over the models themselves is harder still. France has attempted to build its own AI systems through its company Mistral, and Canada has attempted the same with Cohere. These are designed to reduce dependence on imports and provide a fallback if access is cut off. But U.S. and Chinese frontier systems remain more capable than anything these local champions have developed, and the gap shows no sign of narrowing. As long as that remains the case, major businesses and national security agencies will prefer the highest-quality offerings from frontier developers.

Whether or not they have access to frontier AI systems, middle powers will remain vulnerable to AI's downsides, often more so than the great powers themselves. The harms associated with advanced AI will not respect borders: criminal misuse, military deployment by adversaries, labor displacement, and corrosive social effects will reach countries irrespective of whether they host leading AI labs.

Defending against these harms is considerably harder without direct access to frontier capabilities. Creating effective cyber- and biosecurity defenses, for example, increasingly depends on maintaining close relationships with AI developers and reliable access to computing power. In the military domain, middle powers that lack AI capabilities may find their legacy systems outmatched, not just by great powers but also by smaller states or nonstate actors that gain access to advanced AI tools. These aggressors could gain meaningful AI capabilities even without formal access to frontier systems if, for example, great powers arm proxies to shift regional balances, attackers steal what they need through cyberattacks, or sub-frontier models prove sufficient for offense even where they fall short for defense—a particular concern when it comes to biological weapons or cybersecurity. More broadly, any serious policy response to the full spectrum of AI-related risks presupposes a clear-eyed understanding of the technology and its implications on the part of government officials—an understanding that is difficult to develop at a distance.



Middle powers also face structural disadvantages in shaping AI's trajectory, even within their own borders. They will have little leverage to wield over development and deployment decisions, and limited flexibility in their policy options. Their regulatory input carries scant weight with the companies and jurisdictions driving the technology forward, and their tax revenues from AI-related economic activity remain uncertain. From the periphery, they may also struggle to adopt the technology fast enough to keep their workforces competitive with AI-augmented labor abroad.

Staying out of AI's orbit entirely—forgoing both its risks and its benefits—is not a viable strategy. This is because the effects of artificial intelligence are inescapable: it will reshape the productivity of economic rivals, the capabilities of adversaries, and the expectations of citizens whether or not their governments participate. A middle power might hope that staying on the sidelines will at least mean avoiding AI's dangers along with its rewards. But suffering the risks while missing the benefits is entirely possible. For middle powers, that outcome represents the central danger.

The middle powers' vulnerability stems in part from the unique nature of AI development. China and the United States are able to benefit from a virtuous circle whereby access to computing power allows their domestic champions to train better models, which then attracts more users and generates more revenue, which in turn funds investment in still more computing power. Each advantage compounds the next. Less transformative technologies have already demonstrated a milder version of this pattern—Europe's failure to capture the economic gains of the Internet goes a long way toward explaining its relative decline against the United States. Countries that fall behind on AI may find it even harder to catch up.

To escape this trap, middle powers face two imperatives: they must secure access to frontier AI capabilities and find an economic foothold in the emerging AI order. Access will be critical, and there are three realistic strategies for maintaining it.

The first is bandwagoning: allying closely with either the United States or China to ensure access to an AI ecosystem. The United Kingdom appears to be pursuing this path, seeking ever closer alignment with the United States' AI industry through regulatory cooperation and infrastructure deals. This strategy is particularly appealing in a securitized environment in which access requires great-power patronage. But it is not without risks. It can deepen a one-sided reliance, foreclose access to competing providers, and leave a country even more vulnerable if its patron's goodwill fades—a risk that has only grown more salient as the Trump administration uses technology access as a bargaining chip for unrelated trade concessions. A country cut off after becoming dependent would face cascading disruptions: businesses reliant on AI-powered services could lose functionality overnight, government agencies could find critical systems degraded, and the scramble to find alternatives could take months or years—or push middle powers toward alternative providers offering exploitative terms.

The second strategy is hedging: using domestic market scale and economic leverage to extract favorable terms from both great powers and spur competition between them. Malaysia and much of Southeast Asia are perhaps hewing closest to this approach, courting AI infrastructure investment and partnerships from both the United States and China. As long as systems remain interoperable and markets stay open, hedging promises cheap and stable access. But if the environment grows more securitized or the world divides into blocs, access could be lost.



The third strategy is to mount a genuine sovereignty effort, building enough computing capacity and investing enough capital to have a realistic chance of developing domestic frontier capabilities. France and several other countries profess to be pursuing this path, but their ambitions fall short of the frontier in energy, compute, and talent. A successful sovereign effort could theoretically help a country avoid many aspects of the middle power trap, but it carries risks. An underfunded attempt could leave a country stranded in an unprofitable second tier, close to the frontier but never reaching it. And even reaching the frontier offers no guarantee of returns if value ultimately accrues elsewhere in the supply chain.

The success of any of these strategies will depend above all on how much frontier capabilities matter in comparison with second-best alternatives. That in turn depends on whether small performance gaps prove decisive in AI-accelerated economic competition and whether the technical paradigm continues to allow so-called fast following—the efficient imitation that lets middle powers trail the frontier by a year or so. Beyond these technical uncertainties, it remains unclear whether the Trump administration's pro-export stance will hold as AI models become national security assets, or whether great powers will eventually securitize their AI industries and pull frontier capabilities off the open market. Given this uncertainty, middle powers should be cautious about locking themselves into any single path. They must monitor AI technology—and how Beijing and Washington perceive it—closely enough to pivot if conditions change. And in the meantime, they must remain risk-averse. They should not commit to any path that precludes access to imported frontier capabilities.

The United States, meanwhile, should make bandwagoning as attractive as possible in order to maximize its market share, revenue, and leverage over AI's development. But such an effort will conflict with many middle powers' sovereignty ambitions. To resolve this tension, Washington must make bandwagoning beneficial and nonthreatening by forgoing aggressive attempts to leverage AI access, promoting exports that deliver meaningful capabilities, and implementing security standards that allow even highly sensitive frontier systems to be shared with allies.

With access secured, middle powers face a second challenge. They must find durable economic and strategic niches that can guarantee their relevance as AI's importance grows. One possible niche is upstream inputs—the tools and resources required to build artificial intelligence systems, from semiconductor manufacturing equipment to high-quality training data. Another is downstream bottlenecks—capacities that translate AI performance into real-world impact, such as robotics, and advanced manufacturing. And a third is automation-resistant sectors—health care, artisanal production, and tourism, for example—in which human presence or physical locality is a major source of value.

Not all niches confer equal leverage. The positions that matter most are those that great powers cannot easily replicate or route around. The Dutch semiconductor equipment company ASML already occupies such a position. The United States cannot quickly build its own extreme ultraviolet lithography capability, and every advanced chip fabricator in the world needs ongoing access to ASML's machines and expertise. Such capabilities remain valuable because they are of continuous use rather than capable of being exhausted in a single transaction. A country sitting on valuable training data, by contrast, may find that once it has been sold or scraped, its leverage disappears. India's vast stores of professional services data may prove strategically useful if New Delhi retains control and conditions access on lasting partnerships. Or this data could be sold off piecemeal to U.S. or Chinese AI companies and lost as a source of leverage entirely.



Not every middle power can control an input as critical as ASML's. But many can position themselves at the other end of the chain, where AI capabilities must be translated into real-world impact. The race for AI supremacy is absorbing U.S. talent, capital, and government focus to a degree that leaves gaps elsewhere. As systems grow more capable, the bottleneck will increasingly shift to deployment—to the manufacturing, robotics, and applied R & D capacity needed to convert models' performance into economic and strategic value. These are areas in which U.S. capacity is limited and Chinese capacity is vast, because of decades of offshoring from the United States and sustained industrial investment by Beijing. Middle powers with strength in these areas—including South Korea and Japan in advanced manufacturing and robotics, Germany in precision engineering, and India in pharmaceutical R & D—may find themselves newly valuable to the United States as it looks for allied scale to counter China's industrial base.

Middle powers should therefore prioritize niches that great powers cannot do without: the inputs required to build AI systems or the capacities required to put them to use. That means resisting pressure to sell off or offshore strategic assets, as has happened when European robotics and semiconductor firms were acquired by Chinese investors or when promising AI and biotech startups were lured to the United States by deeper capital markets. Silicon Valley companies will come calling in pursuit of exclusive data access, and foreign governments will seek control over key links in the supply chain. Middle powers should be wary: they should not evaluate these assets on near-term returns alone, but on their potential to serve as a source of leverage and a strategic foothold in a changing world economy. In part, that means strategic screening of foreign investments to ensure that critical domestic industries aren't hollowed out or offshored. But it also requires active industrial policy to counter the subsidies of rival great powers. Middle powers cannot match that spending across the board, but they can succeed in safeguarding a narrow set of strategic sectors if they identify them early. They will also need to ease taxation and regulation for sectors essential to their competitive positioning.



The United States also has an interest in shaping how middle powers position themselves. Beijing threatens to outcompete Washington in manufacturing capacity, supply chain integration, and speed of deployment. To counter this, the United States needs the capabilities of a broad alliance. Through bilateral engagement, export promotion, and trade deals that credibly commit both sides to lasting technology access, the United States can incentivize middle powers to align their economic positioning with U.S. strategic priorities. This can help well-positioned allies expand bottlenecks and receive enduring access to AI capabilities in an alliance founded on mutual technological dependence.

But this vision requires both sides to act strategically. On AI policy, the Trump administration has taken some steps in the right direction: its Pax Silica initiative, which exchanges access to U.S. technology for allied contributions to the semiconductor supply chain, and its executive orders promoting AI exports suggest an awareness of the stakes. But Washington has also shown a willingness to weaponize technology access for unrelated trade concessions, as the United Kingdom discovered in December when a technology deal was reportedly suspended over British food safety standards. The Trump administration's broader hostility toward allies has left partners questioning whether the United States can be a reliable anchor for any alliance. Middle powers, for their part, must recognize that their leverage depends on assets they have not yet secured and could easily squander.

If navigated well, middle powers can turn their strategic predicament into an efficient division of labor backed by hard mutual leverage. On their current trajectory, however, they are headed for a trap in which they will bear the brunt of AI-driven disruption while capturing few of the benefits. The outcome would be dire: two great AI powers barreling toward a technological revolution with most of the world's computing power and talent, leaving most of the world's citizens behind.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Netanyahu to discuss potential Iran strikes with Trump as Washington and Tehran resume talks","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/10/middleeast/netanyahu-visit-washington-iran-talks-intl","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:38:53 GMT","


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intends to discuss possible military options against Iran with US President Donald Trump during his visit to Washington this week as Israel prepares contingencies should US-Iran talks collapse, according to two Israeli sources.
    


            Israel remains skeptical that nascent negotiations between the US and Iran will succeed, one of the sources said, but is pressing to ensure its interests are protected – as well as to preserve Israel's freedom of military action under any potential agreement.
    


            Netanyahu plans to present Trump with fresh intelligence on Iran's military capabilities, one of the sources said.
    


            “Israel is worried about Iran's progress in restoring its ballistic missile stockpiles and capabilities to its status before the 12-day war,” the source said, adding that the Israeli assessment is that without action, Iran could possess 1,800-2,000 ballistic missiles within weeks or months.
    


            CNN is unable to verify the claims. Iranian officials have repeatedly said that while Tehran doesn't want war, it is ready for it.
    


            Before departing for Washington, Netanyahu said Iran is the “first and foremost” issue on the agenda for his meeting with Trump on Wednesday, the seventh meeting between the two leaders since the start of Trump's second term.
    


            “On this trip, we will discuss a series of issues: Gaza, the region, but first and foremost, the negotiations with Iran,” Netanyahu said as he boarded his aircraft. “I will present the president with our views regarding the essential principles of the negotiations – principles that, in our eyes, are vital not only for Israel but for anyone in the world who desires peace and security in the Middle East.”
    


            The upcoming meeting follows a series of high-level exchanges in recent weeks. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir and Intelligence Division head Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder visited the Pentagon in Washington last month, while presidential envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with Netanyahu and top security officials in Jerusalem last week.
    


            Israel has tried to push the US to ensure that any deal with Iran include Tehran giving up its stockpile of enriched uranium, ceasing enrichment altogether, placing limits on its ballistic missile program and ending its support for regional proxies. The list matched a set of earlier US demands for a broader set of discussions about Iran's military capabilities and regional activities.
    


            But Iran has insisted it's only willing to discuss the nuclear file. Over the weekend, Trump signaled that he may accept a deal that leaves out the other issues. Asked by a reporter on board Air Force One if an agreement with Tehran is acceptable if it only covers nuclear, he said, “Yeah, that would be acceptable, but the one thing and right up front, no nuclear weapons.”
    


            The worst-case scenario for the Israeli prime minister is “a narrow nuclear deal in which the US settles for restrictions on enrichment alone.” Danny Citrinowicz, an Iran expert at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, wrote in an article in the Israel Hayom newspaper.
    


            “From Netanyahu's standpoint, the two preferred options are either the military defeat of Iran through American force, or what he sees as a conceptual defeat, namely an agreement so comprehensive that it effectively dismantles the regime's ability to defend itself,” he wrote.
    


            Netanyahu railed against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) negotiated with Tehran under former President Barack Obama – and was outspoken that the deal left much of Iran's military capabilities intact and lifted uranium enrichment limits after 15 years. Such vocal criticism would become far more difficult if Trump signs a similar agreement that restricts the weaponization of Iran's nuclear program while allowing domestic uranium enrichment. Uranium is a nuclear fuel that can be used to make a bomb if purified to high levels.
    


            In June, Israel's surprise attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities derailed a series of ongoing – though foundering – talks between the US and Iran. The 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran ended with Trump demanding that Netanyahu call off another wave of attacks.
    


            Netanyahu's visit to Washington was initially scheduled for February 18, according to the Israeli source, one day before a meeting of the Board of Peace. Over the weekend, the bilateral meeting was moved up at Netanyahu's request, so it is unclear if he will attend the Board of Peace convention, which will discuss advancing the Gaza ceasefire into the next stage. Netanyahu did not attend the inaugural meeting of Trump's Board of Peace in Davos last month.
    


            Trump has pushed to advance the Gaza ceasefire to the second phase, with the announcement of the board and the Palestinian technocratic committee set to run Gaza. After the retrieval of the remains of the last Israeli hostage in January, Israel opened the Rafah crossing last week for limited passage between Gaza and Egypt. However, Netanyahu continues to stress the need for Hamas to disarm before any reconstruction begins in Gaza.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Judges are regularly threatening contempt charges against the DOJ in immigration cases","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/10/politics/judges-contempt-justice-department-minnesota","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:00:47 GMT","


            In some two dozen cases stemming from President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Minnesota that CNN has reviewed, federal judges appointed to the bench by Democrats and Republicans have had to use terms like “contempt” and “noncompliance” to get the government's attention to respond to court orders.
    


            To date, it doesn't appear that any judge in the District of Minnesota has held an agency official or Justice Department attorney in civil contempt of court or imposed sanctions in cases related to Operation Metro Surge. But the sheer number of threats is significant.
    


            Many of the punishment threats have arisen in cases where judges concluded that an immigrant was unlawfully arrested and must immediately be released. Other compliance issues have bubbled up when Immigration and Customs Enforcement releases a noncitizen with certain conditions that they weren't subject to prior to their arrest, enraging a judge who never gave permission to impose such constraints.
    


            “This is clearly not tenable,” Judge Laura Provinzino, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, told one top government attorney late last month. “I can't continue to have (federal prosecutors) violating really important orders … If somebody should be released, that has to happen.”
    


Trump admin attorney leaves Minnesota after telling judge her job ‘sucks' amid crush of immigration cases



            The potential punishments highlight the smoldering tension between the federal judiciary, which has had to handle scores of cases brought by immigrants claiming they were unlawfully detained in recent weeks, and the lawyers defending the Trump administration's operation, who often have little insight into the actions of their agency clients or the ability to sufficiently keep up with the pace of litigation.
    


            Often, a judge is the one ordering the government to “show cause,” or explain, why the court should not hold lawyers or agency officials in contempt. But in some instances, attorneys representing immigrants swept up in the enforcement blitz have asked the judge to impose sanctions when compliance issues have occurred.
    


            “It's very rare for federal government officials to face contempt sanctions in court,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who served as the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “And yet, it's become almost routine under this administration.”
    


            The various contempt threats are “about putting pressure on the government to comply with the court order,” Cole said. “Once they obey the court order, the purpose of those sanctions is over.”
    


            Indeed, though some of the punishment threats are still looming over the government, in case after case, the issue has fizzled out after DOJ attorneys on the frontlines of Trump's Operation Metro Surge rectified problems identified by the court.
    


            Natalie Baldassarre, a Justice Department spokesperson, insisted in a statement to CNN that the administration “is complying with court orders” and attacked the judges taking issue with the government's actions in Minnesota.
    


            “If rogue judges followed the law in adjudicating cases and respected the government's obligation to properly prepare cases, there wouldn't be an ‘overwhelming' habeas caseload or concern over DHS following orders,” she said. “The level of illegal aliens currently detained is a direct result of this administration's strong border security policies to keep the American people safe.”
    


            More than 400 cases were brought in Minnesota last month by immigrants who were arrested amid Operation Metro Surge. CNN reviewed a subset of them that were highlighted by the chief judge of the state's federal court as he chided the administration for violating nearly 100 judicial edicts.
    


            “The extent of ICE's noncompliance is almost certainly substantially understated,” Judge Patrick Schiltz recently wrote in a scornful order that included a list of 74 cases in which his colleagues on the bench had found violations. “ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”
    


The problem was on full view last week when Julie Le, one of the attorneys managing the government's ballooning caseload, unloaded on a federal judge in St. Paul about how it's like “pulling teeth” to get agencies to correct errors made in some cases.
    


            “Fixing a system, a broken system, I don't have a magic button to do it. I don't have the power or the voice to do it,” Le said. “I only can do it within the ability and the capacity that I have.”
    


‘Untethered to the facts': Federal judges say Trump administration has a credibility issue as it battles immigration cases



            US District Judge Jerry Blackwell, a Biden appointee, had hauled Le and one of her colleges into court to explain why they shouldn't be held in contempt for repeated violations of court orders in a handful of cases.
    


            “Continued detention is not lawful just because compliance with release orders is administratively difficult or because an operation has expanded beyond the government's capacity to execute it lawfully,” Blackwell told the two lawyers.
    


            Blackwell didn't announce a decision from the bench, and Le has subsequently left her temporary post in Minnesota, which she took on in early January.
    


            In the cases reviewed by CNN, judges have similarly skewered the administration over its compliance problem, even as they've stopped short of imposing a punishment.
    


            Judge John R. Tunheim, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said late last month that the government had “willfully violated” two of his orders in the case of a Salvadoran national who was challenging his detention.
    


            After officials failed to bring the man back from another state where he was being detained to have a bond hearing, as Tunheim ordered, the judge directed the government to instead fly him back to Minnesota and release him immediately upon his arrival.
    


            The man wasn't returned to Minnesota until January 28, four days after he was supposed to land back in the state. But the judge ultimately rejected a request by his attorneys to find the government in contempt and impose sanctions against it for the repeated violations.
    


            “Although the (government) willfully violated the court's orders,” Tunheim wrote in a brief order, he said he appreciated the communication from DOJ and its efforts to comply. “The court therefore declines to impose any sanctions.”
    


            In another case, a judge laid bare a dire situation facing a Mexican national caught up in the immigration crackdown as he moved toward potential contempt proceedings.
    


            Judge Donovan Frank had raised the possibility of a contempt showdown if immigration officials didn't provide assurances that they had complied with his order to release the man, who had been detained by agents and subsequently brought to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries. The cause of the man's injuries were unknown, according to the judge, who said that hospital records reflected that the man told its staff “he was dragged and mistreated by federal agents.”
    


            On January 23, the Clinton appointee ordered ICE agents to unshackle the man from his hospital bed and leave the facility, where they had been positioned in an apparent effort to keep him detained.
    


            But four full days passed without an update from the government, prompting Frank on January 28 to threaten officials with contempt proceedings if they didn't provide assurances that the man had been released. The issue was ultimately diffused after the government told the court that it had complied with its order.
    


            Meanwhile, in a different courtroom on January 28, Provinzino grilled a high-ranking official in the federal prosecutor's office in Minneapolis about why his office had regularly violated orders from her and made clear that if she saw any further compliance issues, the top federal prosecutor in the state would need to personally appear before her to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt.
    


            The judge had called the hearing after saying that repeated demands from her for information about a detainee she had ordered released went unanswered. The man, a Mexican national, had also remained in custody 26 hours after he was supposed to have been let out.
    


            “You would just happen to be, I think, the seventh one in the office who's violated one of my orders,” she told Assistant US Attorney Friedrich Siekert. “What steps are you putting in place or is the United States Attorney's Office and ICE putting in place to ensure compliance on a prospective basis?”
    


            Siekert told the judge that part of the issue was due to the fact that his office simply didn't have the resources needed to manage the hundreds of cases brought since the immigration blitz began.
    


            “The civil division does not have the resources to handle this right now,” he said.
    


            And in the case of a man referred to in court papers as “Juan,” Judge Susan Nelson, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, noted that the government blew past her deadline for his release by five days. She said she would hold a contempt hearing if compliance wasn't eventually achieved, but after those plans were announced, the man was released and the judge said the hearing was “no longer necessary.”
    


            At least one of the Trump appointees overseeing cases in Minnesota is also grappling with compliance issues in the cases they're handling. Judge Eric Tostrud is weighing a request from attorneys for a Mexican national for compensatory sanctions in his detention case. The judge has raised the possibility of holding a hearing over the request in the coming weeks.
    


            For Schiltz's part, the appointee of former President George W. Bush had summoned the head of ICE, Todd Lyons, before him last month to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt for violations of orders in cases he's overseeing.
    


            Days before the hearing was set to take place, Schiltz backed down from his threat after an immigrant detainee was finally released from custody, as the judge had ordered. But the judge made clear that he wasn't completely lifting the contempt threat.
    


            “The court warns ICE that future noncompliance with court orders may result in future show-cause orders requiring the personal appearances of Lyons or other government officials,” Schiltz wrote in the January 28 order.
    


            David Wilson, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis whose firm has been handling hundreds of cases stemming from Operation Metro Surge, including many where compliance issues have arisen, said that Schiltz's 4-page broadside against the government represented a “boiling point” for a visibly frustrated court system.
    


            “There's clearly a fire burning behind the building,” he said.

            An Alabama circuit judge on Monday denied Alabama basketball player Charles Bediako's motion for a preliminary injunction, ending the 7-foot center's collegiate eligibility and his season with the Crimson Tide.
    


            County Circuit Court Judge Daniel Pruet cited that Bediako “failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to the injunctive relief that he seeks,” according to court documents.
    


            Bediako was playing under a temporary restraining order that allowed the former NBA G League player to join Alabama in the middle of the season despite questions regarding his collegiate eligibility.
    


            NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement that he was glad the court “upheld the rules of our members.”
    


            “Common sense won a round today,” Baker said. “The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the ‘undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream. While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.”
    


‘The theater of the absurd': NCAA president says former pro players pushing to go back to college may make Congress act



            The 23-year-old Bediako was averaging 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks in five games Alabama went 3-2 in those games.
    


            Attorneys for both sides — Bediako and the NCAA — argued their cases Friday. Bediako sued college basketball's sanctioning body in an effort to regain eligibility despite leaving Alabama for the NBA draft in 2023, signing a two-way NBA contract and playing the last three seasons in the developmental G League.
    


            Bediako spent two seasons (2021-23) at Alabama, averaging 6.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.7 blocks, and helped the Crimson Tide make the NCAA Tournament twice. He wasn't selected in the 2023 draft, but he played for the Motor City Cruise in the NBA's G League as recently as mid-January.
    


            His lawyers argued that Bediako remains within his five-year college eligibility window. The NCAA denied Alabama's initial petition, and NCAA President Charlie Baker and SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey have made it clear they are opposed to Bediako's reinstatement.
    


            Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats said Friday that, regardless of the outcome of the case, Bediako will be allowed to remain on scholarship and work toward a college degree.
    


            Alabama (16-7, 6-4 Southeastern Conference), which faces Mississippi on Tuesday, did not immediately comment on the court decision.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","She's one of the world's most powerful conservative leaders","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/09/asia/sanae-takaichi-japan-election-win-intl-hnk","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 01:59:00 GMT","


            It was a risky gamble to call a snap election – her career was on the line. But now Japan's Sanae Takaichi is basking in the strongest majority for a Japanese government in more than 70 years.
    


            Here's how this unapologetic conservative, who Trump has lavished praise on, pulled it off.
    


            In the four months since becoming leader, she had skyrocketed in popularity, galvanized typically-disengaged young voters, and given a fresh new face to the country's political landscape, which for decades was dominated by older men.
    


            This mass appeal translated to a landslide victory on Sunday, securing Takaichi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) a historic two-thirds supermajority in the lower house of parliament – the first time a single party has done so since World War ii.
    


            It's a much-needed win for the LDP, which has been working hard to rehabilitate its public image. Though the LDP has historically been dominant in Japan, in recent years it has been weighed down by election losses, stubborn inflation and political scandals. Longtime supporters have jumped ship, viewing the LDP as too old-fashioned and center-leaning, and instead flocked to new right-wing parties.
    


            Takaichi was seen as a potential answer to this problem – though conservativism looks a little different in Japan than in the United States.
    


            Socially, Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage, is in favor of patriotic education, and supports keeping Japan's single-surname system, which makes it harder for women to keep their maiden names.
    


Japan's conservative leader bets big on Takaichi mania with snap election. Will her gamble pay off?



            She has advocated revising Japan's pacifist constitution, including the article that renounces war. On Monday, she said she would “persistently work” to revise the constitution, though did not specify which parts she wants to change. It's still a steep uphill climb; she would need to secure a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament, and pass a national referendum on the issue.
    


            Economically, Takaichi backs big government and just passed a record-breaking spending budget. And though she's a prominent member of an ultranationalist lobby, she isn't anti-globalist; she's recently reaffirmed ties with the US, the UK, Italy, and South Korea, despite decades of tension rooted in Japan's brutal occupation of the Korean Peninsula.
    


            She's also an unconventional candidate in her country's normally staid, formal political landscape. She rides motorbikes, plays the drums, enjoys heavy metal, and unlike many of her male peers, doesn't come from a political dynasty; her father worked for a car company and her mother was a police officer.
    


            Her sweeping victory reflects the public's desire for LDP reform and the nationwide rightward shift in politics. But it is also a testament to Takaichi's star power – which has whipped up public enthusiasm to levels not seen for years, especially among young Japanese.
    


            The widespread excitement – dubbed by some media outlets as “Sana-mania” – was evident in the run-up to Sunday's vote. Thousands of fans huddled against the cold during one election rally in Tokyo last week, all eager for a glimpse of Takaichi.
    


            Much of this success is thanks to a savvy social media strategy, in which she delivers succinct, slogan-ready lines – and shares viral videos of her meeting world leaders, like South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, with whom she jammed out to K-pop hits.
    


            Even small details of her daily life, from the bag she carries to the pen she uses, are closely followed and emulated. In her hometown of Nara, souvenir shops sell towels emblazoned with her slogans, key chains, stationery, even cookies bearing her likeness alongside that of her political idol, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
    


            Last week ahead of the vote, two 20-year-old students expressed admiration for Takaichi – who they call “Sana-chan,” using an affectionate suffix usually reserved for close friends.
    


            She's also won a supporter in US President Donald Trump, who endorsed her ahead of the election and invited her to the White House, even before the results came out.
    


            Her victory, however, is likely to further rattle China, Japan's neighbor and biggest trade partner. Relations have cratered in recent months over comments Takaichi made about Taiwan, the democratic self-ruling island claimed by China's Communist Party.
    


            Takaichi broke Japan's long tradition of ambiguity on Taiwan when she told parliament in November that a Chinese attack on the island – which lies just 60 miles (97 kilometers) from Japanese territory – could trigger a military response from Tokyo.
    


            China retaliated by canceling flights, restricting imports of Japanese seafood and ramping up military patrols, among other measures. It offered another stern warning on Monday, with a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson describing Japan's election results as reflecting “deep-seated structural issues.”
    


            “If Japan's far-right forces misjudge the situation and act recklessly, they will inevitably face resistance from the Japanese people and firm opposition from the international community,” the spokesperson said, urging Tokyo to “retract Takaichi's erroneous remarks.”
    


            Besides the soured relations with China, Takaichi has a number of other issues to tackle: Japan's rapidly aging population, the rising cost of living, and a weak yen.
    


            Her policy direction remains unclear for now, and one expert told CNN last week that the effects of her comments “haven't fully appeared yet.”
    


            But Sunday's remarkable landslide mean the LDP now has enough seats to override votes in the upper house of parliament, to propose amendments to the constitution, and to chair all lower house committees alongside its coalition partner.
    


            That gives Takaichi a clear path to deliver on her agenda over the coming years – until the next election in 2027.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is expected this week to revoke a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, according to a White House official. 

The Environmental Protection Agency will issue a final rule rescinding a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding. That Obama-era policy determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an official announcement, confirmed the plans, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. 

“This week at the White House, President Trump will be taking the most significant deregulatory actions in history to further unleash American energy dominance and drive down costs,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.

The endangerment finding is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. It is used to justify regulations, such as auto emissions standards, intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change — deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the United States and around the world. 

Legal challenges would be certain for any action that effectively would repeal those regulations, with environmental groups describing the shift as the single biggest attack in U.S. history on federal efforts to address climate change.




An EPA spokesperson did not address when the finding would be revoked but reiterated that the agency is finalizing a new rule on it.

Brigit Hirsch said via email that the Obama-era rule was “one of the most damaging decisions in modern history” and said EPA “is actively working to deliver a historic action for the American people.”

President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax,” previously issued an executive order that directed EPA to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit greenhouse gases that cause global warming.

Lee Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticized his predecessors in Democratic administrations, saying they were “willing to bankrupt the country” in an effort to combat climate change. 

Democrats “created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence ... segments of our economy,″ Zeldin said in announcing the proposed rule last year. ”And it cost Americans a lot of money.”

Peter Zalzal, a lawyer and associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, countered that the EPA will be encouraging more climate pollution, higher health insurance and fuel costs and thousands of avoidable premature deaths. 

Zeldin's push “is cynical and deeply damaging, given the mountain of scientific evidence supporting the finding, the devastating climate harms Americans are experiencing right now and EPA's clear obligation to protect Americans' health and welfare,” he said.

Zalzal and other critics noted that the Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

Since the high court's decision, in a case known as Massachusetts v. EPA, courts have uniformly rejected legal challenges to the endangerment finding, including a 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Following Zeldin's proposal to repeal the rule, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reassessed the science underpinning the 2009 finding and concluded it was “accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.” 

Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved, the NAS panel of scientists said in a September report. “The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused greenhouse gases is beyond scientific dispute,” the panel said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans' hope for their future has fallen to a new low, according to new polling.

In 2025, only about 59% of Americans gave high ratings when asked to evaluate how good their life will be in about five years, the lowest annual measure since Gallup began asking this question almost 20 years ago. 

It's a warning about the depth of the gloom that has fallen over the country over the past few years. In the data, Gallup's “current” and “future” lines have tended to move together over time — when Americans are feeling good about the present, they tend to feel optimistic about the future. But the most recent measures show that while current life satisfaction has declined over the last decade, future optimism has dropped even more. 




The finding comes from a longstanding Gallup question that asks Americans to rate their current and future lives on a scale from 0 to 10. Those who give themselves an 8 or higher on the question about the future are categorized as optimists.

“While current life is eroding, it's that optimism for the future that has eroded almost twice as much over the course of about that last 10 years or so,” said Dan Witters, the research director of the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index.

Gallup assesses people who rate their current life at a 7 or higher and their anticipated future at an 8 or higher as “thriving.” Fewer than half of Americans, about 48%, are now in that category.




Democrats and Hispanic Americans, in particular, were in a darker mood last year. But even with President Donald Trump back in the White House and his party in control of both houses of Congress, Republicans aren't feeling nearly as good about the future as they were in the last year of Trump's first term.





Americans' attitudes toward the future tend to shift when a new political party enters the White House — generally, the party in power grows more optimistic, while the party without control is more down. For instance, Democrats became more positive about the future after Joe Biden won the presidency, while Republicans' outlook soured.

Witters notes that these changes typically happen “by roughly the same amount, same level of magnitude, so they cancel each other out.” 

That didn't happen in 2025. 

Toward the end of Biden's term and the start of Trump's second term, Democrats' optimism fell from 65% to 57%. Republicans grew more hopeful, but not enough to offset Democrats' drop.




“The regime change in the White House almost certainly was a big driving factor in what's happened,” Witters said. “And a lot of that was just because the people who identified as Democrats really took it in the chops.” 

But Republicans are still quite a bit gloomier about the future than they were in the last year of Trump's first term. A January AP-NORC poll found that while the vast majority of Republicans are still behind the president, his work on the economy hasn't lived up to many people's expectations.





Hispanic adults' optimism for the near future also declined during Trump's first year in office, dropping from 69% to 63%. 

That decrease was sharper than among white and Black Americans, something that Witters said could be tied to overall cost concerns, health care worries or alarm about Trump's recent immigration policies. 

Last year, a survey by the American Communities Project found that people living in heavily Hispanic areas were feeling less hopeful about their future than in 2024. Trump's favorability fell among Hispanics over the course of 2025, according to AP-NORC polling, which also found that Hispanic adults reported higher levels of economic stress than other groups.

A Pew Research Center poll conducted in October found that the administration's tough immigration enforcement is highly visible in Hispanic communities. About 6 in 10 Latinos said they had seen or heard of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids or arrests in their community in the past six months. 

“(Deportations are) something that everybody can see and look at with their own eyes,” Witters added. “But if you're Hispanic, I think it's fair to think that that might hit a little closer to home.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic leaders say a proposal from the White House is “incomplete and insufficient” as they are demanding new restrictions on President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and threatening a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department. 

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement late Monday that a White House counterproposal to the list of demands they transmitted over the weekend “included neither details nor legislative text” and does not address “the concerns Americans have about ICE's lawless conduct.” The White House proposal was not released publicly. 

The Democrats' statement comes as time is running short, with another partial government shutdown threatening to begin Saturday. Among the Democrats' demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use-of-force standards and a stop to racial profiling. They say such changes are necessary after two protesters were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.

Earlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had expressed optimism about the rare negotiations between Democrats and the White House, saying there was “forward progress.” 

Thune said it was a good sign that the two sides were trading papers, and “hopefully they can find some common ground here.” 

But coming to an agreement on the charged issue of immigration enforcement will be difficult, especially as rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were skeptical about finding common ground. 




Republicans have balked at the Democrats' requests and some have demands of their own, including the addition of legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration. 

And many Democrats who are furious about Immigration and Customs Enforcement's aggressive crackdown have said they won't vote for another penny of Homeland Security funding until enforcement is radically scaled back. 

“Dramatic changes are needed at the Department of Homeland Security before a DHS funding bill moves forward,” Jeffries said earlier Monday. “Period. Full stop.”

Congress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated out from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended Homeland Security funding at current levels only through Feb. 13, creating a brief window for action as the two parties discuss new restrictions on ICE and other federal officers. 

Democrats made the demands for new restrictions on ICE and other federal law enforcement after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary. Renee Good was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7. 

While he agreed to separate the funding, Trump has not publicly responded to the Democrats' specific demands. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said late last week that the Trump administration is willing to discuss some items on the Democrats' list, but “others don't seem like they are grounded in any common sense, and they are nonstarters for this administration.” 

Schumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to remove their masks, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.

Among other demands, Democrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it's verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.

Republicans have said they support the requirement for DHS officers to have body-worn cameras — language that was in the original DHS bill — but have balked at many of the other Democratic asks. 

“Taking the masks off ICE officers and agents, the reason we can't do that is that it would subject them to great harm, their families at great risk because people are doxing them and targeting them,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday. “We've got to talk about things that are reasonable and achievable.” 

Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty said on “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats are ”trying to motivate a radical left base.” 

“The left has gone completely overboard, and they're threatening the safety and security of our agents so they cannot do their job,” Hagerty said. 

In addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said last week, “there's a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.

Lawmakers in both parties have suggested they could separate out funding for ICE and Border Patrol and pass the rest of it by Friday. But Thune has been cool to that idea, saying instead that Congress should pass another short-term extension for all of DHS while they negotiate the possible new restrictions. 

“If there's additional time that's needed, then hopefully Democrats would be amenable to another extension,” Thune said. 

Many Democrats are unlikely to vote for another extension. But Republicans could potentially win enough votes in both chambers from Democrats if they feel hopeful about negotiations. 

“The ball is in the Republicans' court,” Jeffries said Monday.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number.

California became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings under a bill that was signed in September following the summer of high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles. 

The Trump administration filed a lawsuit in November challenging the laws, arguing that they would threaten the safety of officers who are facing harassment, doxing and violence and that they violated the constitution because the state is directly regulating the federal government.

Judge Christina Snyder said she issued the initial ruling because the mask ban as it was enacted did not also apply to state law enforcement authorities, discriminating against the federal government. The ruling could have national implications as states grapple with how to deal with federal agents enforcing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. 

It left open the possibility to future legislation banning federal agents from wearing masks if it applied to all law enforcement agencies, with Snyder writing “the Court finds that federal officers can perform their federal functions without wearing masks.” The ruling will go into effect Feb. 19.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill in September banning some law enforcement officers from wearing masks, neck gaiters, and other facial coverings. It was slated to go into effect Jan. 1 but was put on hold due to the lawsuit.




In addition to exempting state law enforcement officers, it made exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and other situations where not wearing a mask would jeopardize an operation. Snyder sided with the federal government, which argued this exemption was discriminatory against federal agents.

Newsom also signed into law a measure requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job, which was challenged by the federal government but upheld by the judge. In a statement, Newsom called the judge's decision a “a clear win for the rule of law.”

California State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the original bill to ban facial coverings, said Monday he would immediately introduce new legislation to include state police in the law.

“ICE and Border Patrol are covering their faces to maximize their terror campaign and to insulate themselves from accountability,” Weiner said in a news release. “We will ensure our mask ban can be enforced.”

At a Jan. 14 hearing, Snyder repeatedly asked the government's lawyer, Tiberius Davis, to explain why banning masks would impede the federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties, if officers rarely wore masks prior to 2025.

Davis cited claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that there has been a multifold increase in assaults and threats against federal officers. He also brought up an incident in Los Angeles where three women are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.

“There is real deterrence on the officer's safety and ability to perform their duties,” Davis said. 

Cameron Bell, California Department of Justice attorney, challenged his claims, saying there was no concrete evidence that federal agents can't perform their duties without facial coverings.

Bell referenced declarations from U.S citizens who have been detained by federal agents but thought they were being kidnapped.

“It's obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” Bell said.

The federal government also argued in legal briefs that allowing California's legislation could lead other states to be “emboldened to impose similar unconstitutional restraints.”

Davis cited a statement from Newsom in July 2025 during an interview posted online where he discussed the mask ban bill, saying, “It appears that we don't have the legal authority for federal agents but we do for other law enforcement authorities.”

Los Angeles County supervisors voted in December to enact a local ordinance banning law enforcement from wearing masks that went into effect Jan. 8. However, the sheriff's department said it would not enforce the ordinance until after the court ruled on the statewide mask ban. The Los Angeles Police Department had also said it wouldn't enforce the mask ban.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Comparing social media platforms to casinos and addictive drugs, lawyer Mark Lanier delivered opening statements Monday in a landmark trial in Los Angeles that seeks to hold Instagram owner Meta and Google's YouTube responsible for harms to children who use their products. 

Instagram's parent company Meta and Google's YouTube face claims that their platforms addict children through deliberate design choices that keep kids glued to their screens. TikTok and Snap, which were originally named in the lawsuit, settled for undisclosed sums. 

Jurors got their first glimpse into what will be a lengthy trial characterized by dueling narratives from the plaintiffs and the two remaining defendants. 

Meta lawyer Paul Schmidt spoke of the disagreement within the scientific community over social media addiction, with some researchers believing it doesn't exist, or that addiction is not the most appropriate way to describe heavy social media use.

Lawyers representing YouTube will begin their opening statement on Tuesday.

Lanier, the plaintiff's lawyer, delivered lively first remarks where he said the case will be as “easy as ABC” — which stands for “addicting the brains of children.” He said Meta and Google, “two of the richest corporations in history,” have “engineered addiction in children's brains.”

He presented jurors with a slew of internal emails, documents and studies conducted by Meta and YouTube, as well as YouTube's parent company, Google. He emphasized the findings of a study Meta conducted called “Project Myst” in which they surveyed 1,000 teens and their parents about their social media use. The two major findings, Lanier said, were that Meta knew children who experienced “adverse events” like trauma and stress were particularly vulnerable for addiction; and that parental supervision and controls made little impact.

He also highlighted internal Google documents that likened some company products to a casino, and internal communication between Meta employees in which one person said Instagram is “like a drug” and they are “basically pushers.”




At the core of the Los Angeles case is a 20-year-old identified only by the initials “KGM,” whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials — essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury.

KGM made a brief appearance after a break during Lanier's statement and she will return to testify later in the trial. Lanier spent time describing KGM's childhood, focusing particularly on what her personality was like before she began using social media. She started using YouTube at age 6 and Instagram at age 9, Lanier said. Before she graduated elementary school, she had posted 284 videos on YouTube.

The outcome of the trial could have profound effects on the companies' businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. 

Lanier said the companies' lawyers will “try to blame the little girl and her parents for the trap they built,” referencing the plaintiff. She was a minor when she said she became addicted to social media, which she claims had a detrimental impact on her mental health.

Lanier said that despite the public position of Meta and YouTube being that they work to protect children, their internal documents show an entirely different position, with explicit references to young children being listed as their target audiences.

The attorney also drew comparisons between the social media companies and tobacco firms, citing internal communication between Meta employees who were concerned about the company's lack of proactive action about the potential harm their platforms can have on children and teens.

“For a teenager, social validation is survival,” Lanier said. The defendants “engineered a feature that caters to a minor's craving for social validation,” he added, speaking about “like” buttons and similar features.

In his opening statement representing Meta, Schmidt said the core question in the case is whether the platforms were a substantial factor in KGM's mental health struggles. He spent much of his time going through the plaintiff's health records, emphasizing that she had experienced many difficult circumstances in her childhood, including emotional abuse, body image issues and bullying.

Schmidt presented a clip from a video deposition from one of KGM‘s mental health providers, Dr. Thomas Suberman, who said social media was “not the through-line of what I recall being her main issues,” adding that her struggles seemed to largely stem from interpersonal conflicts and relationships. He painted a picture — with KGM's own text messages and testimony pointing to a volatile home life — of a particularly troubled relationship with her mother.

Schmidt acknowledged that many mental health professionals do believe social media addiction can exist, but said three of KGM's providers — all of whom believe in the form of addiction — have never diagnosed her with it, or treated her for it.

Schmidt emphasized to the jurors that the case is not about whether social media is a good thing or whether teens spend too much time on their phones or whether the jurors like or dislike Meta, but whether social media was a substantial factor in KGM's mental health struggles.

A slew of trials beginning this year seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the Los Angeles trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors. 

A separate trial in New Mexico, meanwhile, also kicked off with opening statements on Monday. In that trial, Meta is accused of failing to protect young users from sexual exploitation, following an undercover online investigation. Attorney General Raúl Torrez in late 2023 sued Meta and Zuckerberg, who was later dropped from the suit.

A federal bellwether trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children. 

In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.

TikTok also faces similar lawsuits in more than a dozen states.

New York (AP) — To better understand some of the significance of Bad Bunny's historic Super Bowl halftime performance on Sunday night, start at the end. 

“God Bless America,” were the first and few English-language words uttered by the Spanish-language performer, who then proceeded to list countries in the Americas, including the United States and Canada. Behind him, a screen read: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love,” a direct reference to his speech at the 2026 Grammy Awards where the Puerto Rican superstar took home the top prize.

America, he seemed to be reminding his global audience including viewers in the U.S., makes up a number of countries in the Western Hemisphere. 

It was a poignant gesture for an artist whose performance was politicized the moment it was announced, labeled un-American by his detractors despite the fact that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Most recently President Donald Trump described his set as “an affront to the Greatness of America.”

In the final moments of his performance, Bad Bunny was joined by a crowd waving flags of different countries in the Americas, but also “territories of other countries like Bonaire or the U.S. Virgin Islands, ” said Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of “P FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance.”

He was also surrounded by plena musicians — a Puerto Rican genre associated with community and protest — and held a football that read, “Together, we are America.”

“This is a really profound statement of Latino belonging in the United States and immigrant belonging in the United States,” Rivera-Rideau said. “Bad Bunny is obviously very aware of the backlash against this halftime show. And a lot of that backlash has to do with this assumption that because it's in Spanish, it's somehow excluding people. And I think what we saw last night with Bad Bunny's halftime show is that he was actually including people, inviting people into his world and at the same time, making a case that immigrants and Latinos are as much a fabric of the United States as anything else.”

Simultaneously, he made the argument for “America” as a larger, hemispheric identity. 




“He is trying to reframe America as this continent-spanning container,” said Reanna Cruz, music critic and senior producer for Vox Media's music podcast Switched on Pop. “The main takeaway I have from the performance is the highlight of community. … If we have nothing else in times of hardship, we have community and we have joy, and a way to access that is to not shut out your fellow humans in whatever country it may be. The reframing of America as something that spans half the globe is really radical.”

There's a long history of that idea. “Everyone from Rubén Lárez to Los Tigres del Norte have created songs that have used this idea of all of the Americas coming together … of America being a kind of a cohesive unit,” said Rivera-Rideau. “But I think what it really boils down to is a statement that Latinos, Latin Americans, Caribbean people, immigrants, they belong and they're just as American as anybody else.”

“He's presenting a very capacious definition of what it is to be American,” said Christopher Campo-Bowen, assistant professor of musicology at Virginia Tech. “And within that, the idea of Puerto Rican sovereignty.

“He is presenting everything that he finds that makes Puerto Rico unique. And what makes Puerto Rico an autonomy culture and actor in the hemisphere — and presenting it all at once — and then also broadcasting this unifying message of ‘We are all Americans,'” he added. “He's encouraging us all to recognize that uniqueness but not to let that difference become a source of enmity or hatred.”

Puerto Ricans are Americans in both ways Bad Bunny's show explored — they are U.S. citizens, and the island nation is situated in the Americas. But it is complicated: Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens no matter where they are born and have been since 1917. But Puerto Ricans who live on the island have limited citizenship rights; they cannot vote for President, they have no representation in Congress and they can be drafted into the military.

“What it boils down to is that Puerto Rico is a territory,” said Rivera-Rideau, an idea she says Bad Bunny explored when he waved the Puerto Rican flag with a light blue triangle, a color repeated on Lady Gaga's dress.

“That's considered the original Puerto Rican flag. And once the U.S. takes over Puerto Rico in 1898, they change the color blue to match the U.S. flag. And so that light blue color on the Puerto Rican flag has become affiliated with Puerto Rican independence,” she explained. “So, I think we saw him commenting on this colonial relationship at the same time that he's insisting on full recognition in the United States as a Latino, as an American, in the continental sense. Both things are happening in that halftime show.”

That is also reflected in the music of Puerto Rico, and of course, Bad Bunny. Think of the genre salsa as an example, which “represents the kind of unique status of Puerto Rico vis-a-vis the mainland United States, in that salsa would not have been possible without this relationship,” said Campo-Bowen. He noted that in the late 1940s and early ‘50s, Puerto Ricans migrated to New York in large numbers because of massive changes on the island. “They start communities there, encounter other people from Latin America, and then salsa comes about out of that mixture.

“It is based in the long history of colonialism and that carries those issues with it. But despite that, Puerto Rico has developed this unique culture with these unique musical signifiers which Bad Bunny is more than happy to draw on and celebrate.”

Bad Bunny's “God Bless America” contrasts certain conservative messaging of American identity. Consider the fact that there was an alternative halftime performance, organized by Turning Point USA and headlined by Kid Rock, called the “all-American Halftime show.”

“Bad Bunny turns this upside down and he says, ‘No, ‘God bless America' and ‘America' is all of these Latin American and Caribbean nations and the U.S. and Canada. We're all a part of it,” said Vanessa Díaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of “P FKN R.” 

“It was about unity, but it was also about staking Latinos' claim in this country,” she said, particularly in a charged political moment as Trump's immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation, routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants, detentions are prolonged and opposition for the Trump administration's immigration crackdown grows.

In her view, Bad Bunny's performance was “profoundly political” — just as it was when he said “ICE Out” at the 2026 Grammys — but on this stage, for its message of joy and unity. 

“It was wildly imaginative and extremely educational. And yet we had fun and we danced and we cried,” Díaz said of the performance. “It was Bad Bunny at his best, being super specific about his homeland and its history and also welcoming people in to let themselves see themselves reflected in Puerto Rican culture and history.”

“Joy is resistance and dancing is resistance,” Cruz said. “For people in the Latino community, the show is very clear in how political it is.”

ClimateDepot.com executive editor Marc Morano joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss President Donald Trump's decision to sever ties with dozens of international organizations and more

President Donald Trump's administration is poised to walk back an Obama-era greenhouse gas finding that serves as a lynchpin for justifying climate regulations across the country on Wednesday.

The 2009 ""endangerment finding"" identifies six greenhouse gases that the Obama administration said pose ""a threat to public health and welfare."" That harm finding was then used to justify sweeping climate regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), such as raising fuel economy standards and limiting power plant emissions, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin hailed the move as cutting through government red tape in an interview with the Journal.

""This amounts to the largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States,"" Zeldin said.

The Journal reports that the final rule will be made public later this week and is set to eliminate requirements to measure, report, certify and comply with federal greenhouse-gas emission standards for motor vehicles. The rollback does not yet affect power plants or oil and gas facilities.

""More energy drives human flourishing,"" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told the outlet. ""Energy abundance is the thing that we have to focus on, not regulating certain forms of energy out.""

Trump is reportedly expected to hold an event at the White House on Wednesday with Zeldin and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. There they will announce a new initiative for the Department of War to purchase electricity from coal-powered plants.

The Washington Coal Club is also set to name Trump the ""Undisputed Champion of Coal"" during the event, according to the Journal.

Trump has been consistently critical of global warming claims and climate regulation throughout both of his terms in office, famously withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement when he first took office in 2017.

Treasure hunters in Poland from a group called Denar Kalisz found clay pots containing 631 medieval artifacts, silver coins and an 1,800-year-old Roman gold necklace worth invaluable sums.

A metal detectorist exploring an Australian Gold Rush-era campsite made a remarkable discovery in recent weeks — even without striking gold.

Angus James, a treasure hunter in the Australian state of Victoria, was sweeping an abandoned sports field — known locally as a sports oval — on Jan. 24 when he uncovered an unusual coin.

The field, north of the mining town of Ballarat, had been used as a campsite during the Australian Gold Rush, which began in 1851 and continued for decades.

HAUNTING ANCIENT BATTLE TRUMPET UNEARTHED IN LANDSCAPE TIED TO LEGENDARY QUEEN

Digging in the dirt, James realized the coin was Japanese in origin — and made of bronze.

The find was no ordinary piece of currency.

A rare Japanese bronze coin was discovered at a former Gold Rush-era campsite. Finding the coin was ""such a buzz,"" said treasure hunter Angus James, at right. (Angus James, @GOLDCOINRELICS via Facebook)

It was a 100 Mon Tempo Tsuho, a coin that held modest purchasing power and was commonly used for small, everyday transactions in 19th-century Japan.

Interestingly, the characters on the coin are Chinese, even though it was produced in Japan during the mid-19th century — a common practice at the time.

MASSIVE INDUSTRIAL SITE UNCOVERED IN UNLIKELY LOCATION AS ARCHAEOLOGISTS CITE 'ENORMOUS' POTENTIAL

Unearthing the artifact was ""such a buzz,"" James told Fox News Digital. ""Finding a Japanese coin this old in Australia is extremely rare.""

""I have found Chinese coins from the Gold Rush era… To find a Japanese coin this old is a great discovery.""

""I can't wait to see what else I can detect from this location.""

James shared his finds on Facebook. When he first uncovered the coin, he said he felt immediate excitement — and intrigue.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses the Trump administration's focus on energy policy, mounting pressure on Cuba to make a deal with the U.S. and more on ‘America Reports.'

I have spent my life working on the water as a commercial fisherman. Today, I serve as the chairman and chief strategist of the New England Fishermen's Stewardship Association, (NEFSA) representing fishermen who fish the waters of the North Atlantic and the New York Bight, along with their families, business and industry associations and members of the public who support wild-caught American seafood. I speak for people who work these waters every day and for communities that depend on them.

We see ocean conditions as they exist, not months later in reports. Yet policy too often prioritizes theory over experience and paperwork over outcomes. Commercial fishermen are not line items. We live with the consequences of every decision made in Washington. On the water, those decisions can make fishing less safe, manage fish poorly and drive American commercial fishermen out of business.

AMERICAN SEAFOOD IS AMERICAN FOOD SECURITY

In 2026, it is time to clearly recognize that U.S. wild-caught seafood is U.S. food security. America controls one of the largest and most productive ocean food resources in the world, and commercial fishermen make it possible to feed this country under some of the highest standards anywhere.

COAST GUARD IDENTIFIES 7 VICTIMS ON BOARD GLOUCESTER COMMERCIAL FISHING BOAT THAT SANK OFF MASSACHUSETTS

At the same time, we are forced to compete against cheap imported seafood flooding U.S. markets and undercutting American harvesters. Much of this product comes from overseas operations with weak or nonexistent environmental and labor standards, yet it is marketed as fresh or sustainable. Meanwhile, American fishermen following the rules are slowly being pushed out.

American farmers know this problem well. Domestic food producers who follow strict regulations are routinely undercut by imports that do not. Commercial fishermen, like farmers, are a pillar of national resilience. Any new food policy must rebuild and protect domestic seafood production, so American fishermen can feed American consumers under American standards.

OFFSHORE WIND EQUALS FOREIGN INDUSTRIAL TAKEOVER OF OUR OCEANS

We cannot credibly claim to support domestic seafood or food security while allowing the industrial takeover of our ocean. Offshore wind destroys habitat, displaces fishing from historic grounds and embeds permanent industrial hazards into working waters. It would be like setting our farm fields on fire and calling it progress.

Commercial fishermen warned from the beginning that these projects would compromise offshore safety. Offshore wind degrades marine radar, interferes with search-and-rescue capability and disrupts military and homeland defense systems. When radar and rescue systems fail offshore, lives are put at risk. Infrastructure that causes those failures has no place in working waters or national security zones.

Once built, the damage is permanent. Taxpayer dollars should not be used to eliminate American commercial fishing jobs so foreign energy companies and private equity firms can industrialize the waters that feed this country.

FIXING GROUNDFISH FROM THE GROUND UP

Our New England groundfish fishery is in turmoil. Fishermen face quota swings that shift from feast to famine, often driven by incomplete surveys or outdated data. A stock can be abundant one year and effectively unavailable the next, not because the fish disappeared, but because the survey failed to capture reality.

When that happens, fishermen cannot simply pivot. If the fishery they depend on is suddenly closed and they do not hold permits for others, boats tie up, crews are sent home and coastal businesses suffer despite healthy fish in the water.

Restoring confidence starts with better assessments. Better science does not mean more models divorced from reality. It means cooperative, industry-based research, with fishermen working alongside scientists over time. On the West Coast, industry-chartered vessels and fishing crews have partnered with scientists for decades to improve surveys, reduce uncertainty and produce more reliable management outcomes.

A COMMON-SENSE PATH FORWARD

CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP

The choice before the nation is clear. We can continue policies that push American commercial fishermen aside and replace domestic seafood with imports and industrial ocean uses, or we can follow the direction set by the president's executive order and put America's food producers first. Through President Trump's leadership, the federal government has recognized that domestic seafood production is a matter of national interest, economic resilience and food security.

Commercial fishermen stand ready to meet that call. With a clear vision from the White House and policies grounded in real-world experience, we can protect and strengthen fisheries that are already sustainable, restore working waterfronts, and once again make American seafood a backbone of our national food supply. We are a nation of fishermen ready to roll up our sleeves, do the work and get the job done with the president's help, feeding America first and leading the world by example.

Dustin Delano is the Chairman and Chief Strategist of the New England Fishermen's Stewardship Association.

Former Miami-Dade Police Detective Wayne Black and retired NYPD detective Michael Alcazar analyze Savannah Guthrie's latest video asking the public for help to find her mother, Nancy Guthrie on 'The Story.'

A source close to the Guthrie family is pushing back on reports about how Nancy Guthrie was discovered missing on Sunday, Feb. 1, saying key details of the timeline have been reported incorrectly.

Early reporting indicated that Nancy Guthrie had been scheduled to attend an in-person church service in Tucson that morning and was reported missing after she failed to show up. According to the family source, that account is not accurate.

The source told Fox News that for years — dating back to the COVID pandemic — Nancy and a small group of close friends had a standing Sunday routine that did not involve attending church in person. Instead, the group would gather at one another's homes to watch a New York–based church service via livestream.

The service was broadcast live from a New York church attended by Savannah Guthrie, the longtime ""Today"" show co-anchor and Nancy Guthrie's daughter.

On Sunday, Feb. 1, Nancy was expected to be at a friend's home to watch the livestream, as she had done every week. When she failed to arrive, members of the friend group became concerned.

According to the source, one of the friends contacted Annie — Nancy's daughter and Savannah Guthrie's sister — to report that Nancy had not shown up and could not be located.

The source emphasized that Nancy was never scheduled to attend a Tucson church service that day, contrary to some reports, and said the misunderstanding has led to confusion about the circumstances surrounding when she was first reported missing.

As the search intensified, Savannah Guthrie made an emotional public plea for help, describing the situation as an ""hour of desperation"" as authorities investigated an alleged ransom note tied to her mother's disappearance.

Savannah urged anyone with information to come forward as investigators worked against a looming deadline outlined in the note, which authorities have not publicly authenticated.

The final deadline outlined in the alleged ransom note passed Monday night without any proof of life or resolution.

At the same time, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said it was pursuing what it described as ""new leads"" in the case but confirmed investigators have not identified any suspects, persons of interest or vehicles connected to Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.

""The investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance remains active and ongoing,"" a spokesperson for the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed Monday evening.

""We understand the significant public interest in this case; however, investigators need time and space to do their work. If and when relevant information becomes available, it will be shared,"" the spokesperson added.

The department said there are no press briefings scheduled at this time, but noted a press conference would be called if a significant development occurs.

Sheriff's officials also confirmed an active law enforcement presence will continue at the Guthrie residences through the night and into Tuesday as part of the ongoing investigation, including expanded search efforts and follow-up on new leads.

""To preserve the integrity of this criminal investigation, details of that process are not being released at this time,"" authorities said.

Officials emphasized the scale of the public response so far.

President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to prevent the opening of a bridge that will connect Michigan and Canada unless Ottawa negotiates with Washington on tariffs and the exclusion of American products. 

In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump accused Canada of taking advantage of the United States with unfair trade practices and cozying up to China. 

In an effort to bring Canada to the negotiating table, Trump said he would not allow the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which is named after the legendary Canadian ice hockey player who played for the Detroit Red Wings. The bridge, which is currently under construction, will connect Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. 

""I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve,"" Trump wrote.

He cited the removal of U.S. alcohol products from Canadian liquor store shelves in Ontario.

Trump has previously accused Canada of taking advantage of U.S. trade policies. In his post, Trump said Canada has moved forward with building the bridge with ""virtually no U.S. content.""

He blamed former President Barack Obama for ""stupidly"" giving Canada a waiver so they could get around the Buy American Act, which mandates federal agencies purchase materials that are manufactured in the U.S. and made mostly from U.S.-produced components.

Trump accused Canada of not using American products, including steel. 

""Now, the Canadian Government expects me, as President of the United States, to PERMIT them to just ‘take advantage of America!' What does the United States of America get — Absolutely NOTHING!"" he wrote. ""Ontario won't even put U.S. spirits, beverages, and other alcoholic products, on their shelves, they are absolutely prohibited from doing so and now, on top of everything else, Prime Minister Carney wants to make a deal with China — which will eat Canada alive. We'll just get the leftovers! I don't think so.""

President Donald Trump blocked Canada from opening a bridge to Michigan until it “fully compensated” the United States.

The Gordie Howe International Bridge project, named after the hockey legend, is set to be the largest cable-stayed bridge in North America, spanning over half a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. In a Monday post on Truth Social, Trump blasted the project, claiming Canada had ripped off the U.S. He demanded proper compensation before he would approve its completion.

He bemoaned that Canada owns both sides of the bridge and that it was built “with virtually no U.S. content.”

“President Barack Hussein Obama stupidly gave them a waiver so they could get around the BUY AMERICAN Act, and not use any American products, including our Steel. Now, the Canadian Government expects me, as President of the United States, to PERMIT them to just ‘take advantage of America!' What does the United States of America get — Absolutely NOTHING!” Trump wrote.

The president then directed his rage toward Ontario's boycott of U.S. alcohol and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's overtures to China, “which will eat Canada alive.”

“We'll just get the leftovers! I don't think so. The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup,” Trump wrote, repeating an earlier claim. 

He said that he would block the opening of the bridge until the U.S. was “fully compensated for everything we have given them” and until Canada “treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve.”

“We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY. With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset. The revenues generated because of the U.S. Market will be astronomical,” Trump concluded.

The move is the latest rift between Trump and the U.S.'s northern neighbor, which has frequently been the subject of his ire in his second term. Carney's overtures toward China have sparked the most fury, with Trump threatening to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if the two sign a trade pact.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

House Republican leaders are trying to extend a prohibition on votes in the House that would overturn tariffs from President Donald Trump.

The rules committee advanced legislation on Monday night that would block votes to overturn the tariffs on countries such as Canada, China, and Mexico, among others, through July 31. The previous ban, which expired at the end of January, had prevented several Democratic-led resolutions that sought to repeal tariffs for months.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told reporters on Monday night he was confident he had the votes to pass a procedural measure that includes the tariff-blocking language. But the speaker's razor-thin, one-seat majority could make it difficult to pass the tariff ban, along with other bills.

Eyes will be on such GOP members as Reps. Don Bacon (R-NE) or Mike Turner (R-OH) to see whether they will break ranks and oppose the procedural vote on Tuesday, which will ban votes on tariff repeals and advance the Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act, the Undersea Cable Protection Act of 2025, and the Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act.

Both lawmakers, among other Republicans, have expressed skepticism in the past. Bacon recently told the Washington Examiner that he advocated Johnson not block tariff votes through a “rule” vote. The Nebraska congressman said the president's recent rhetoric about acquiring Greenland by placing tariffs on European allies.

LEADER JEFFRIES COULD BE ‘SPEAKER JEFFRIES' SOON. WHAT CHALLENGES COULD HE FACE?

“I don't think the rule will pass again,” Bacon said.

Bacon was among those who negotiated with the speaker to secure a short-term block on tariff-repeal resolutions back in September 2025, telling the Washington Examiner he was reluctant to help leadership again.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A 2019 FBI report revealed that President Donald Trump allegedly called a Palm Beach, Florida, police chief in 2006 to express gratitude for “stopping” Jeffrey Epstein, after the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender's crimes became public. Trump made the comments long before his foray into politics and presidential run. He allegedly told the police chief that everyone knew Epstein “has been doing this.”

“Mar-A-Lago is a mixture of everyone,” read the report. “Donald Trump told [redacted] that he threw Epstein out of his club. Trump called the PBPD and told him ‘thank goodness you're stopping him, everyone has known he's been doing this.”

The report was based on a phone conversation Trump allegedly had in October 2019 with a police chief, whose name was redacted, the Miami Herald reported. The report was filed in April 2020, and the chief's name was revealed to be Michael Reiter years later.

Trump also spoke about Epstein's reputation in New York City, and his former girlfriend and trafficking accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. He called her Epstein's “operative.”

“Trump told him people in New York knew Epstein was disgusting,” read the FBI report. “Trump said Maxwell was Epstein's operative.”

“She is evil, focus on her,” Trump allegedly told Reiter.  

“Trump told [redacted] that he was around Epstein once when teenagers were present and Trump ‘got the hell out of there,'” read the report. “Trump was one of the first people to call when people found out that they were investigating Epstein.”

The report also discussed then-Prince Andrew's presence at Palm Beach, stating that “he was a fixture in Palm Beach and he had no protection while there.”

Trump's alleged statements in the report would appear to contradict his earlier claims from July 2019, when he denied knowing anything about Epstein's sex crimes against underage girls.

“No, I had no idea,” Trump said at the time. “I had no idea.”

Trump's alleged 2006 phone call, along with the 2019 report, had previously gone unreported.

An FBI employee claimed that Trump had not called Reiter in 2006, according to the Miami Herald.

“We are not aware of any corroborating evidence that the President contacted law enforcement 20 years ago,” the FBI said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Nancy Pelosi reportedly plans to endorse JFK's grandson for Congress. Why?

One lesson that can be drawn from the second Trump administration is that being a member of the Kennedy family does not qualify you for public service. Yet many Camelot-besotted Democrats remain stubbornly immune to this conclusion.

One of them appears to be Nancy Pelosi, the normally shrewd former House speaker, who reportedly plans to endorse Jack Schlossberg, John F. Kennedy's grandson, for an open seat in New York's Twelfth Congressional District.

“This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve,” Pelosi said in a statement viewed by The New York Times before its release.

How that describes Schlossberg, a 33-year-old social-media personality, is difficult to understand. As a Kennedy, Schlossberg has been a lifelong celebrity in the traditional definition of the word—a person who is famous for being famous. He's been profiled in Town & Country, on the Today show, in The Washington Post, and in The New York Times. The theme of this coverage is that Schlossberg (1) is a Kennedy, (2) is handsome, and (3) posts lots of edgy content on social media. To suggest that he has failed upward would give him too much credit because failing requires having been entrusted with some responsibility in the first place.

Schlossberg's most important role to date came when Vogue hired him to write about the presidential campaign. At the time, it was widely seen as a stunt hire for which he was out of his depth. “Is he qualified to be a political correspondent?,” asked a New York Times story reporting on the hire.

From the January 2026 Issue: Why is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. so convinced he's right?

His written output has not put those doubts to rest. Schlossberg's oeuvre at Vogue is indistinguishable either in content or in style from something that could have been produced by an adequately trained high-school student. A representative passage from his campaign coverage:

The first live TV debate was in 1960, when JFK's winning smile and Florida tan outshined Nixon's sweaty 5 o'clock shadow. It was an instant hit—since then, live TV debates have spread to democracies around the world. Nothin' better than watching people fight, don't you think?

And:

Same as ever, this election will be decided by turnout in specific places. Specifically, voters in a handful of swing states—Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Georgia—will decide our future.

It was utterly banal, but at least there wasn't much of it. He wrote just seven short, insight-free columns. Nobody reading these pieces sans byline would have suspected they were catching a glimpse of a future leader of the country. Even if he had produced a body of penetrating analysis, it would hardly prepare him for national office. Yet Schlossberg now stands a plausible, perhaps strong, chance of winning the Democratic primary (and thus the general election).

New York's Twelfth, in the heart of Manhattan, probably has more Democrats qualified to serve in national leadership than any congressional district in America. Accordingly, the list of potential candidates is already in the double digits. The winner, by dint of representing the nation's media capital, is likely to have an outsize role in the national debate. The whole trick in this crowded field will be standing out. Schlossberg, by virtue of his attention-grabbing lineage and Pelosi's endorsement, now has a giant advantage over a long list of genuinely accomplished rivals.

We don't need to get too precious about the decline of standards in the House. Congress's lower chamber has always contained its share of mediocrities. Although some House members use their position to develop expertise, legislate, or conduct oversight, the bare minimum for the job in both parties has always been to show up and vote the way the party leadership tells you, and refrain from saying or doing anything scandalous.

Perhaps Pelosi figures one of those seat warmers might as well be a Kennedy. And there certainly are some Kennedys up to the job of holding an overwhelmingly Democratic congressional district.

The trouble is that although Democrats like Pelosi apparently continue to see membership in the Kennedy clan, symbolized by the martyred president and his would-have-been-president brother, as a positive signal of judgment and reliability, it is in fact a strongly negative one. As Josh Barro argued two and a half years ago, a disquieting number of Kennedy men have injured or killed their romantic partners or themselves out of drunkenness and stupidity. Ted Kennedy and Joseph P. Kennedy II, respectively, killed and paralyzed a female passenger in a car crash. Michael Kennedy died playing football while skiing—two sports the Kennedys apparently decided to combine as a kind of tradition—after having endured a scandalous affair with the family babysitter, whom he claimed was 16 years old when they began having sex. Michael Skakel was convicted of killing Martha Moxley, but freed from prison after a court deemed his lawyer incompetent. The Kennedys are victims not only of misfortune, but also their own bad judgment.

From the January 1994 issue: The cultural meaning of the Kennedys

Several Kennedys have served honorably and without scandal. But if you had to pick as your member of Congress a Kennedy male or a random person living in the district, you're probably safer with the latter.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is bad in ways both characterological and ideological that many Democrats failed to fully recognize until he endorsed Trump and joined his administration, where he has unleashed a generational catastrophe in public health. His legacy in this field is arguably more consequential than the entire Kennedy presidency, which accomplished precious little.

Instead of snapping Democrats out of their Kennedy trance, RFK Jr.'s defection to the Republican Party stung Democrats into redoubling their commitment to reclaim their Kennedy birthright. Schlossberg spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2024 as JFK's grandson, the implicit message of his speech being that Kennedy followers ought to listen to Democrats, as true heirs to Camelot, rather than the pretender, RFK Jr. The transcript of this speech is actually one of the seven contributions on Schlossberg's Vogue author page.

In a better world, the realization that RFK Jr. is a crank and moral cretin would have liberated Democrats from their fixation with the Kennedy mythos. The grief over the assassinations of JFK and Robert F. Kennedy Sr. inspired the party to search again and again for heirs to the throne, a practice that resolved into decades of affirmative action for their decreasingly talented offspring.

The Democratic Party is divided between a wing that holds “No Kings” rallies and a wing that holds anti-oligarchy rallies. Perhaps one thing both can agree on is that the party doesn't need its own royal family.

The first in a wave of legal cases alleging that social media is dangerously addictive is now on trial.

In a state court in Los Angeles this week, 12 jurors are hearing opening arguments in a case that has the potential to change social media—maybe even the internet—as we know it.

The trial, which began today, is a bellwether: Similar individual cases have been filed all around the country, and a massive federal case with more than 2,000 plaintiffs is expected to proceed this summer. In each case, the plaintiffs accuse social-media companies of releasing defective products. The argument is that these products were built with dangerously habit-forming features—including the endless-scroll feed, algorithmic recommendations, and push notifications—that have led to an array of serious health problems. Plaintiffs also accuse the companies of failing to warn users about the risks of using their products and of deliberately concealing their dangers.

The L.A. case is the first to make it to trial. It is scheduled to last about six weeks, and it  focuses heavily on Meta—in particular, Instagram. (The defendant originally included TikTok, Snap, and YouTube. TikTok and Snap settled with the plaintiff last month rather than go to trial. YouTube remains part of the case, though it is less central to the complaint. The company has said that allegations against it are “simply untrue.”) The lawsuit asks an existential question about Meta's business: Can the fundamental design and most basic features of Instagram directly cause mental-health problems in kids and teenagers? The jury will be asked to answer that question, and Meta is taking a big risk by allowing it to do so (though it can appeal to a judge if it loses).

The plaintiff in this case is a 19-year-old California woman who is named only by her initials, K.G.M., because the events that she's suing over happened when she was a minor. Her suit states that she began using social media at the age of 10 and alleges that her mental health was directly degraded by Instagram. According to her complaint, the app “targeted” her with “harmful and depressive content,” which led her to develop a negative body image and to commit acts of self-harm. She also says that she was a victim of “bullying and sextortion” in the app as a minor and that Instagram did not do “anything” until her friends and family spent two weeks repeatedly reporting the problem. Her older sister, a plaintiff in a separate case, suffered a life-threatening eating disorder that the family believes was also triggered by usage of Instagram and other social-media sites.

The basic allegations do not make Meta look very good. The company may be taking its chances in court now simply because it has to eventually. If it were to win this case, that might slow the momentum of all the others coming. The company may also relish an opportunity to set the record straight, as it were. For years now, Meta has been compared to Big Tobacco and accused of deliberately destroying children's minds. Internal documents leaked by the whistleblower Frances Haugen in 2021 showing that some employees were worried about Instagram's effects on young girls made matters worse. In response to the backlash, which has been ongoing ever since, the company has half-acquiesced to public pressure and made piecemeal efforts at image rehabilitation. It has explained itself in dry blog posts, created more ornate parental controls, and launched awkward ad campaigns emphasizing its commitment to safety and screen-life balance. (In its latest ad, Tom Brady describes his teen son's ability to connect with friends online as “very much a value-add.”)

Listen: The problem with comparing social media to Big Tobacco 

Now the company will see if it can possibly sway a group of ordinary Americans with its version of the facts. “This will be their first chance to tell their story to a jury and get a sense of how well those arguments are playing,” Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, told me. Meta's day in court has come.

K.G.M, like many of the other plaintiffs filing personal-injury suits against social-media companies, is represented by the Seattle-based Social Media Victims Law Center. In the spring of 2023, the organization filed a complaint on behalf of a number of plaintiffs, opening with this animating statement: “American children are suffering an unprecedented mental health crisis fueled by Defendants' addictive and dangerous social media products.”

The complaint goes on to accuse social-media companies of deliberately “borrowing” tactics from the slot-machine and cigarette industries in an effort to make their products addictive, and argues that social-media apps have “rewired” kids so that they prefer digital “likes” to genuine friendship, “mindless scrolling” to offline play. “While presented as ‘social,' Defendants' products have in myriad ways promoted disconnection, disassociation, and a legion of mental and physical harms,” the complaint summarizes. In K.G.M.'s case, the listed harms include “dangerous dependency” on social media as well as “anxiety, depression, self-harm, and body dysmorphia.”

Her case is the first of potentially thousands. Numerous school districts, state attorneys general, tribal nations, and individuals have also filed suit against social-media companies. But this case is worth watching because it will hit on all of the big topics. To assess whether social media is generally harmful to kids and teens, lawyers will have to argue about the nitty-gritty of a complicated and conflicted scientific field. To get at the question of whether Meta hid specific knowledge of harm, they'll debate the meaning of the documents Haugen leaked as well as others produced during discovery.

The jury will likely hear arguments about whether social-media addiction is real, what the murky concept of “the algorithm” actually means, and whether the richest companies in history really have allowed bad things to happen to children for the benefit of their bottom line. Reached for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed me to an informational website the company has created about the lawsuit and highlighted a previous statement, which reads in part: “Plaintiffs' lawyers have selectively cited Meta's internal documents to construct a misleading narrative, suggesting our platforms have harmed teens and that Meta has prioritized growth over their well-being. These claims don't reflect reality.”

Goldman, who often writes about internet law, said that he thinks Meta will have its work cut out for it with the jury. After 10 years of critical media coverage and political bickering about how to rein the tech companies in, “I assume that the jury is going to walk into the courtroom heavily skeptical of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and social media generally,” he said.

Meta's lawyers can make a good scientific case on some of the broader questions. Researchers have looked for years for smoking-gun evidence that social-media use directly causes mental-health problems in young people at scale, and have mostly turned up weak and inconsistent correlations and no way to prove long-term causation. Major scientific bodies such as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have started to recognize that the story is more complicated than just saying that social media is dangerous in all forms and for all kids.

However, this case is about one kid. Even if social-media addiction is not “real” in the sense that it is not in the DSM-5, and even if it has not created a mental-health epidemic all on its own, certain people, perhaps many, could still be susceptible to what some clinicians prefer to call problematic internet use. The jury will have to decide whether that can cause further problems such as the ones K.G.M. has described (and whether it's Meta's fault if it does). Legally, the burden will be on her lawyers to convince them of that.

Read: No one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens

This is a sticky situation. Corbin Barthold, the internet-policy counsel at the think tank TechFreedom, told me that “having lawyers get up and give speech contests in front of a jury” is one of the worst ways he can imagine of settling the scientific disputes about social media and its effects on mental health. (Actually, he called it “crazy.”) And it is somewhat surprising that we've ended up here. Social-media companies are usually protected by a portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act known as Section 230, which guarantees that online platforms are not considered legally responsible for what their users post or see. The law has been the subject of repeated controversy and legal challenge ever since it was written. Some people now argue that it is totally outdated, having been written at a time when the web was essentially a bunch of static pages, nothing like the complicated landscape we spend so much time in today.

Meta tried and failed to have the case dismissed on Section 230 grounds. Judge Carolyn Kuhl let it proceed because it will not consider specific posts or comments; instead, it will focus on design features such as the recommendation algorithm and the never-ending feed. Free-speech civil-society groups on the right and the left were irked by Kuhl's decision. However, Kuhl is not the only judge who has recently allowed such arguments to go ahead. A similar product-liability claim was the basis of a lawsuit against Google and Character.AI, filed in 2024 by the mother of a 14-year-old boy who killed himself after forming an intense relationship with a chatbot. That case was settled out of court, but it signaled, as the University of Buffalo School of Law professor Mark Bartholomew put it to me in an email, a shift, and evidence of “a growing willingness” among the courts “to take old product liability doctrines for physical goods and apply them to software.”

This trial is just one specific personal-injury suit as well as, possibly, the first of many. “It's a brick in a potential wall,” James Grimmelmann, a professor of digital and information law at Cornell Law School, told me. “If they think they're going to keep on losing other cases, they're going to have to make changes.” It's not yet obvious what changes the company would have to make. No more content recommendations? No more feed? It's not just Meta whose future would be in question. It would be any internet-based service that has any reason to believe that anyone under the age of 18 could be using it and getting “addicted” to it.

Listen: The smartphone kids are not all right

The possibly enormous stakes reflect how pitched the debate about social media has become. Pete Etchells, a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University, in England, told me that he finds the situation “really frustrating.” One side denies that anything is wrong; the other side compares social media to cigarettes, even though that makes little sense. “We're not talking about a biological substance that you can consume that has a demonstrable chemical effect,” Etchells said.

Etchells wrote a book titled Unlocked: The Real Science of Screentime, which was published in 2024 and argued, in part, that a moral panic about social media and smartphones has been making it more difficult to learn how to use them in beneficial ways and how to pick apart what, specifically, might be wrong with them. At the same time, the public justifiably wants something done about the unaccountable tech companies, he said, and bridles when those companies seem to be cherry-picking scientific studies that fit their narrative, throwing them up as an ironclad defense in order to avoid reflection again.

Even if science is on those companies' side in a general sense, that doesn't necessarily mean that the facts are on their side when you talk about one girl, one series of particular events. And now, after years of hearings and reports and rebuttals and failed legislation and bad ideas and ad spots, it's all up to that jury. They have the task of looking at this one story, hearing both sides, and making a decision.

Progressive Catholics are ready to fight back.

A quiet cold war is happening across America — one that many Americans might not be aware of if they're not tuned into the changes underway in America's Christian communities.

On one side is the religious right's use of scripture and faith to justify and defend President Donald Trump's agenda — and growing Christian nationalist sentiment. On the other side is the reshaping of the American Catholic Church, under Pope Leo XIV.

Through new appointments, orders to his bishops to speak out about immigration, and public comments critiquing the direction of the US under Trump, the pope is setting up his bishops and priests to be evangelizers, to be vocal about human dignity, and to be a counterweight to the authoritarian and nationalist tendencies of the right.

While the church has long played a role in US politics, Pope Leo's interventions, according to Christopher Hale, a Catholic writer and political activist who writes the Letters from Leo Substack, represent something new.

In the absence of a well-organized “religious left” in America, he told me, Leo's moves to reform and shake up the American Catholic Church are reinvigorating a “Catholic left” to engage in the moral struggles of the 2020s, specifically around immigration and creeping authoritarianism.

Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

What's the first thing to understand about how Pope Leo is changing the American Catholic Church?

Pope Leo is first and foremost a priest and a bishop. He was Pope Francis's go-to man for appointing bishops for two years, and his education was on the theology and practice of being a bishop, so it's very crucial to his worldview. He has very strong opinions about what it takes to succeed in these roles, but the most important thing he has emphasized is closeness to the people.

That's a contrast to the really bad habit in Catholicism to take functionaries and bureaucrats working deep in the weeds and elevate them to be bishops. In New York City, for example, Cardinal Timothy Dolan spent more time as a seminary educator and president of a university than he did as a pastor, a parish priest. There's been fewer, historically, parish priests that get elevated to the role of bishop, and Pope Francis wanted to change that. Leo is continuing that.

But it takes a long time to actually get one's personnel in place — there's thousands of bishops around the world. From what I can tell right now, Leo is working with a pipeline of Francis-era priests and bishops that he is very familiar with, and everyone who's been named an archbishop and a bishop was on his desk before he was elected pope.

Is it fair to read the flashy appointments and changes Leo has made over the last year as an attempt to move American Catholicism to the left? Or is something more gradual taking place?

Leo's big concern, very clearly in my opinion, was that the US Catholic Church had become identified as reactionary. New York is an interesting case: Dolan was affable, charming, and friendly, but very clearly identified with the political right. His successor, Archbishop Ronald Hicks, is a bit less comfortable in front of the media, but very good with parishioners, very well-loved among rank-and-file Jane and Joe Catholics.

For progressives like myself, it's a win to replace the bishop of America's biggest diocese who was very cozy with Fox and Friends, with someone who's going to be much closer with the parishioners of New York. What's not going to happen is the liberal pipe dream of replacing right-wing culture warriors with left-wing culture warriors.

But it's really important to understand that among the Catholic Church, in the United States, priests and bishops tend to be much more conservative than their global peers. So you automatically have an issue if you're Leo, and if you were Francis, there's just not a lot of moderates and progressives to choose from. Your bench is pretty conservative to begin with.

The New Yorker recently described the shake-up in New York as a sign that Pope Leo is forming his own “Team USA,” to not just guide the faithful, but speak out against the Trump administration. Is that accurate?

A lot of Americans overestimate and over-index how much the pope is thinking about the particularities of the United States. He's trying to separate himself from the culture wars that are happening in the United States, and he doesn't want to be weaponized by either the left or the right.

But when he does speak, it's hard now for bishops and priests in the US to ignore him, or say he doesn't understand the US. And immigration, and mass deportations, are one issue where he has spoken up again and again.

Over the summer, Leo himself seemed to be frustrated that the USCCB (the leadership body of the US church) weren't speaking as one body on this issue, and instead there was just a hodgepodge of bishops taking action.

So he said very clearly, in October, that the church cannot be silent and they must speak with one voice on this issue. And then a month later, the bishops, in almost a unanimous vote, take the hardest stance against the administration that you've seen since the organization existed. That would not have happened under Francis. It would've been explained away. The responsiveness of US bishops has gone up extraordinarily in the past year, and especially with conservative US bishops. They have spoken out in ways that I do not think they would have during Francis's pontificate.

For decades, abortion and sexual ethics were the defining moral issue for the global church, but especially for the American Catholic church. Does it seem, based on Leo's first year, that immigration and border politics are now taking that space?

The characterization that I've made, and I do believe this to be true, is that just as the cardinals elected a Polish pope from behind the Soviet “iron curtain” to defeat communism, I do think that God raised up a pope from the Americas to defeat creeping MAGA authoritarianism. However, I want to be very careful: John Paul II did that not on behalf of the Polish people, but on behalf of the global community.

Similarly, I believe Pope Leo XIV sees authoritarianism as perhaps emanating from America, but he's not trying to defeat it in service of America itself, but for the global community. He gets much more exercised about any kind of American intervention overseas, as strongly as he does about particular domestic issues.

His framework is the idea of a consistent ethic of life: of life's value from the womb to the tomb. And I think he views authoritarian regimes as a threat to human life. And while his predecessors were very bombastic about abortion, in the year that Leo has been pope, he's talked about immigration, he's talked about war, and he's talked about ecology at rates of a hundred to one, than when he talks about abortion.

I think he is trying to recalibrate. And it reminds me of Pope Francis in 2013, when he said that the church had gotten obsessed with abortion, gay marriage, and contraception, and it became basically an ideological perch of disjointed ideas that we cared about. We'd become a political party. That was his complaint. I think Leo is carrying forward that idea.

That recalibration is coming as strains of Christian nationalism are going more mainstream. Does it appear like Leo is setting up the church to be a counterweight to that? 

Yes. It's very clear to me that Christian nationalism has no place for Catholics within it. Christian nationalism is evangelical Protestant nationalism. And it's really pertinent to understand that the leaders of that movement do not think that Catholics are Christian, do not think that we have access to salvation.

That is the argument that I'm trying to make again and again. Christian nationalism and its stepbrother MAGA authoritarianism are both inherently anti-Catholic. To be clear, I'm making a classist argument: I'm saying that my class, my ethnic identity, is excluded from this project. So yes, there is a war at play; it's a culture war I welcome. A culture war between a multi-ethnic American Catholicism versus white evangelical Protestantism is a culture war that, I believe, the left can win.

Is that something Catholic leaders, bishops in the US and in the Vatican are aware of, this cold war?

No, I think it's definitely on Leo's mind. I think the pope believes that the authoritarian creep in the United States is more dangerous than any other single issue, including, in fact, immigration itself, even though that's one he's most personally, deeply affected by. And even among conservative Catholic bishops, they are seeing the limits of this Christian nationalist project.

And many bishops think that they can butter up and sweeten up the administration. To some degree they have had some success, but it's my fervent belief that over the long haul that is going to be a failed project. You're going to have to stand up to these people more directly, and we cannot rely on the goodwill and the whims of the president. There has to be a more head-on battle against these forces.

In Trump 2.0, there has always been a question to me of whether the religious left exists in this country. I'm not sure that the religious left exists in this country, but the second Trump administration has revealed to me that the Catholic left most certainly does.

See inside Tolga Bat Hospital, a place for Australia's injured and orphaned flying foxes.

 Photography by Harriet Spark for Vox

FAR NORTH QUEENSLAND, Australia — Australia is famously a place with some of the world's most dangerous and frightening animals. Venomous spiders. Deadly snakes. Jellyfish with fatal stings.

But it is also home to one of the world's cutest: the flying fox, also known as the giant fruit bat. I mean, look at this animal.

This is a baby bat taking a bubble bath. If it doesn't melt your heart, nothing will.

In northeastern Australia, not far from the coastal city of Cairns, is a place called Tolga Bat Hospital. It is, as its name suggests, a hospital for bats — one of the only such facilities on the planet. And it's also one of the few places you can see a baby bat getting a bubble bath.

The hospital, which has just one full-time paid employee but a cadre of volunteers, has been treating bats for more than 30 years. It comprises a few small buildings with treatment rooms, cold storage for fruit, and a nursery for orphan bats, as well as several outdoor wire enclosures. The largest cage is akin to a long-term care facility; it's for bats that can no longer fly and will live out their lives at the hospital.

Tolga Bat Hospital cares for as many as 1,000 bats a year, the bulk of which are spectacled flying foxes, an endangered species and one of four distinct kinds of flying foxes in mainland Australia. They come in with disease, heat stress, or injuries from barbed wire. The hospital also cares for hundreds of baby spectacleds — named for the lighter fur around their eyes that makes it look like they're wearing glasses — that have lost their mothers and can't survive on their own.

On a warm afternoon in December, I visited the hospital with Australian photographer Harriet Spark. We met a lot of cute bats — and they were hard not to love. Flying foxes are furry with expressive eyes, large ears, and a dog-like snout. But it was the hospital founder and director, Jenny Mclean, whom I found even more endearing.

“You meet a bat, and they're worth caring about,” Mclean, 71, told me that afternoon, as she fed a sick adult bat fruit juice from a syringe. “They have serious threats that they're facing, all of them human-induced.”

Mclean, who works around the clock at the hospital and doesn't pay herself, said she feels a responsibility to help these creatures — not only because they're suffering at our expense but because they help keep our planet healthy. Flying foxes are exceptionally good at pollinating plants and dispersing their seeds, Mclean said.

Giving back to these animals in some way, she said, is the least we can do.

The nursery is a small, two-story building with a verandah that looks out onto the lush grounds of the hospital. Most of the babies were outside when we visited, hanging with their feet on several mesh metal shelves. Spectacled flying foxes are enormous: These animals were about 2 months old and already football-sized. By the time they grow up, their wingspan could reach more than three feet.

The bats, still too young to fly, hung upside down, wrapped in their own wings, alongside stuffed animals. The stuffies, which Mclean buys from a local secondhand store, are meant to mimic mother bats, and the babies will often cling to them for comfort, Mclean told me. Some of the bats were drinking from bottles of flying fox formula attached to the shelves.

Even younger bats were in a room inside the building. Infants under one week are kept in an incubator because they have trouble regulating their body temperature. Slightly older babies are kept in plastic boxes with heating pads and socks that they can cling to. For feeding, “box babies” are swaddled in cloth around a small rectangular pillow so their wings are contained — forming baby bat burritos. A few had silicon pacifiers in their mouths.

Nearly all of these orphans lost their moms to Australian paralysis ticks: parasites that carry a potent neurotoxin in their saliva. When paralysis ticks bite bats and other animals without natural immunity, such as pet cats and dogs, the insects can, as their name suggests, cause paralysis and, eventually, heart failure.

During tick season, which typically runs from October to December, hospital workers search the ground below colonies, or “camps,” for infected bats, which often fall out of trees. If the infection is mild, workers treat the animal with an anti-toxin at the hospital. The babies, meanwhile, are often spared from paralysis. Mothers likely pick up ticks while they're foraging without their young, Mclean said, and the parasites latch on before they have a chance to crawl onto the babies. That leads to an abundance of orphans in need of care.

Paralysis ticks live all across eastern Australia, but they only seem to affect spectacled flying foxes in the Atherton Tablelands, where the hospital is located, Mclean told me. The reason is still a mystery. One explanation, Mclean said, is that spectacleds in this region feed on the berries of an invasive shrub called wild tobacco, where they encounter the ticks. While the plant grows in other parts of Australia where both ticks and flying foxes are found, Mclean said, the moist climate of the Tablelands may make ticks more likely to venture out of the grass and into the branches of the invasive shrub. That's where the flying foxes feed.

That afternoon, I followed Mclean into the main hospital building, where she treats adult bats with paralysis. Rows of small metal cages and cloth boxes sat on shelves along the wall. In some of the enclosures, large flying foxes hung calmly from the top, whereas in others, the animals — still facing the effects of paralysis — were lying down.

Using a towel, Mclean gently grabbed one of the bats from its cage to see if it would eat. The animal was having trouble swallowing, Mclean told me, as she placed a syringe with apple and mango juice in its mouth. The bat took a few sips and then pulled its head away. Mclean moved it into a small plastic bin for plan B: seeing if the animal would eat a small piece of pear instead. The bat began to chew, but then spat it out. “You have not got a good swallow, my girl,” Mclean said.

Tick paralysis is just one of the threats to Australia's flying foxes, many of which are getting worse. Little reds, another species, get tangled in barbed wire, causing tears in their wings. Spectacleds in the Tablelands, meanwhile, are increasingly born with cleft palate syndrome (for reasons that are not yet clear), which makes it hard for them to feed. And more recently, severe heat waves tied to climate change have decimated flying fox populations. In 2018, unrelenting heat killed about 23,000 spectacled flying foxes in Far North Queensland, nearly a third of the entire population. Mclean says she received about 500 orphans that year from the heat wave alone.

Nonetheless, these animals lack support — they're “maligned,” Mclean said — especially compared to koalas and other furry animals in Australia. “There are not that many people who will champion them,” she told me.

Bats have a bad rap, in part, because they can carry diseases. Flying foxes are no exception — in rare cases, they can carry Australian bat lyssavirus, a relative of rabies. What gets less attention is the fact that humans almost never contract a disease from flying foxes. “We get about a thousand sick and injured bats a year, and we get a lyssavirus bat once every three years,” Mclean said. (Workers at Tolga Bat Hospital get vaccinated before handling bats as a safety precaution.)

Ultimately, flying foxes are not a real threat to humans, she said. Disproportionately, humans harm them. “It's this whole thing of, are we willing to share the planet or not?” she said. “If you're not willing to share the planet, you are going to destroy the planet.”

If flying foxes continue to disappear, so will essential services like pollination and seed dispersal that keep forests alive, Mclean told me. “You can't have a healthy person unless you've got healthy wildlife and a healthy environment.”

Maybe the right didn't capture the culture as much as they thought.

As the NFL sent out a final marketing blitz for Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, the official Democratic Party X account shared a picture of Bad Bunny in front of the American and Puerto Rican flags under the text “All-American halftime with Bad Bunny.” It didn't sit right with one Republican.

“Unpopular: Republicans need to unite and get on better messaging because this branding is fantastic and allows all dems to get behind it. Also - super aesthetic,” wrote the political commenter and country singer Alexis Wilkins on X, quoting the post from @TheDemocrats in her message to her 88.2K followers.

Wilkins, who is dating FBI director Kash Patel, continued her argument on X the next day, after Bad Bunny's show had already become a much-viewed and much-discussed sensation. She hadn't watched, she said, but that wasn't the issue. “My point was that we can't give the left an inch of the ground we gained in the last election. … We all thought Bad Bunny was going to come out in a dress that said ICE OUT - but he didn't. This would've all been easier to message if he did. They're pulling the unity trope and we can't let them have it.”

As Wilkins fretted over how the American public would receive the halftime show, President Donald Trump was already venting his outrage on Truth Social.

“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” Trump posted. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”

Embedded in both Wilkins's unease and Trump's fury was the same concern. Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show was an undeniable smash from one of the most popular entertainers in the world right now. It was also undeniably concerned with the dignity and humanity of residents of Bad Bunny's native Puerto Rico and all of Latin America — which is to say, it had “woke” themes. And that didn't stop it from being a hit at all! What might that mean for the culture wars?

After the 2024 election, a narrative developed among members of American media. The “vibes” (loosely defined) had “shifted,” they said, and America was no longer interested in entertainment or celebrities that were “woke” (also very loosely defined). Now, for the first time since the immediate aftermath of 9/11, it was the right's turn to define culture.

“Here's how bad the Democrats fucked up: Trump is cool now,” said Bill Maher last January, as Trump took office. Emboldened, billionaires who spent years paying lip service to liberal causes began openly courting Trump, corporations gutted their DEI policies, and hot young people gave gleeful quotes to magazines about how excited they were to be able to use slurs in public again.

As Ezra Klein noted in the New York Times last January, the shift didn't seem entirely justified by Trump's narrow electoral win. “Trump's cultural victory has lapped his political victory,” Klein wrote. “The election was close, but the vibes have been a rout.”

Yet, a year into Trump's administration, it seems less clear that the vibes are still in Trump's favor. The cultural success stories of the past year have included Sinners, a crowdpleasing blockbuster that is also a parable about the horrors of racial appropriation, and Heated Rivalry, a genre romance about two gay hockey players struggling against the homophobia of the NHL. The Grammy for Album of the Year went to Bad Bunny himself, marking the first time a Spanish-language album won the award. The biggest political star of 2025 was New York mayor Zohran Mamdani, an avowed socialist who managed to win over Trump himself. Meanwhile, JD Vance is getting booed at the Olympics, and even the manosphere podcasters who helped propel Trump to victory in 2024 have been criticizing the policies he's enacted in office. “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo, ‘Where's your papers?' Is that what we've come to?” Joe Rogan asked in January.

It certainly doesn't appear that Americans en masse are falling into fits of patriotic rage about the idea that the Super Bowl halftime show was sung mostly in Spanish; the complaints appear to be coming from the usual suspects, like former Real Housewife Jill Zarin and YouTuber Jake Paul. Viewers also don't even seem to mind the political message that was on display. As Izzie Ramirez explained for Vox, the whole routine was a love letter to Puerto Rico and a celebration of Puerto Rico's identity as a culture in its own right. It would have been in character for Benito to take it farther (he likes to play with gender norms in his outfits, and he began his Grammy exception speech last week with the words “ICE out!”). But the message came across anyway, in part because the existence of a person of color speaking Spanish at an “all-American” event like the Super Bowl is seen as inherently “left” by some people.

Ultimately, though, Benito ended his performance with two messages: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love,” and, “Together, we are all America.” Those are both strong, popular ideas that lots of people in the US agree with and that it would feel almost perverse to take issue with.

Meanwhile, the right offered counter programming that didn't have nearly the same cultural impact. Turning Point USA, the conservative campus organization that was the brainchild of the late Charlie Kirk, ran a concert billed as “The All-American Super Bowl Halftime Show” (the same language that Democrats would wink at when they posted their Bad Bunny ad). The show's most prominent entertainer was perennial Trump supporter Kid Rock, who appeared to lip sync at least part of his set.

Trump, with his animal instinct for where the public's attention is drifting, did not post about the All-American Halftime Show once. Early estimates have it drawing 18 million views. Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show, in contrast, is projected to have gotten 128 million.

If an event as plainly, brutally capitalistic and unconcerned with social justice as the Super Bowl can bring a cheering, joyous audience to its feet with a show celebrating the vibrancy of Latino culture — even as the Trump administration is violently arresting Latino immigrants without due process and claiming to be doing so at the behest of the American people — well, is the anti-woke vibe shift truly over? Did it even ever happen at all?

Last year, we witnessed a slew of billionaires excited that Trump's win gave them an excuse to stop pretending to care about social justice, while irony-poisoned groypers felt emboldened to have splashy parties where they could shout their beloved slurs as loudly as they pleased. But that didn't mean that the entire country had suddenly embraced the cruelty of Trumpism. It doesn't mean that they are willing to ignore the power of an incredible groove because the lyrics sung over it are in Spanish. And it doesn't mean they have soured on the idea of love beating hate. In fact, they seem to find it especially compelling and worth celebrating when the consequences of the Trump administration's xenophobic hatred are playing out in the streets right now, in plain view of everyone.

Trump's supporters are real, and they are committed. But it's worth considering that perhaps American culture never truly belonged to Donald Trump at all.

Salesforce made cuts to its workforce at the beginning of this month.

The cut involved fewer than 1,000 roles, according to a person familiar with the matter.

At least nine employees posted on LinkedIn that their roles had been eliminated. Affected roles included marketing, product management, data analytics, and Salesforce's Agentforce AI product, according to LinkedIn posts and profiles, as well as two employees who spoke to Business Insider.

The layoffs also come amid an executive shake-up at Salesforce, in which the company appointed six new leaders to replace five high-profile leaders who have announced departures since December.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in August that the company used AI agents to reduce its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000.

Jony Ive designed the iPhone, which famously ditched most of a phone's physical buttons for virtual ones. His take on the new Ferrari interior shows a very different approach.

Ferrari has spent five years working with LoveFrom, the design studio founded by Ive and fellow Apple design alum Marc Newson, to shape the interior of its first EV, the Luce.

The result is a button-heavy, screen-forward cabin that blends Ferrari's performance ethos with high-end, Apple-style minimalism.

Ferrari hasn't released photos of the exterior or a full list of specs, but earlier disclosures suggest the Luce will be a four-door, four-seat electric car capable of reaching 60 mph from a standing start in 2.5 seconds. It's expected to have a 330-mile range.

The Luce marks Ferrari's leap into electrification — with an interior wrapped in Ive's distinctive design language. Here's what the interior looks like.

Ferrari — long synonymous with grunting, high-performance racers — is moving into the near-silence of electric power.

To guide that transition, the automaker worked with LoveFrom to refine the interior's materials, shapes, and controls.

The result looks nothing like most EVs. The Luce's cabin is lined with tactile hardware — rows of machined-metal toggles and physical switches designed to be clicked, not swiped.

For any curious Apple fans, there are some familiar flourishes: brushed aluminum, slim leather surfaces, and a minimalist layout.

The slim, three-spoke steering wheel keeps things simple — starting with directional controls mounted directly on the wheel.

More buttons sit beneath the silver spokes, putting most core functions within thumb's reach.

On the left are controls for cruise, drive modes, and dash lighting. On the right are power modes, suspension settings, and wipers.

Volume and track controls are tucked behind the wheel, while paddles manage torque delivery, mimicking the engagement of traditional gear changes. Even in an EV, Ferrari wants drivers to feel like they're choosing their own gears.

The center infotainment display looks a bit like an oversized Apple Watch. Ferrari's system comes complete with fan-speed settings, heated-seat controls, and a built-in circular clock.

The tablet-like screen sits on a ball-and-socket joint, allowing it to swivel toward either the driver or the passenger.

Ferrari also says the silver bar below the screen is a palm rest — perfect for drivers to stabilize their hand while switching Spotify playlists in a sharp corner.

Ferrari is leaning heavily into glass for the Luce's interior, using Corning Gorilla Glass across many hard surfaces — including the gear selector.

The company says the material is more crack-resistant than typical smartphone glass and is designed to withstand scratches from daily use.

There's also a touch of whimsy in the key fob. The square Ferrari badge is the key: slot it into the console, and the glass fob turns black, disappearing into the surrounding trim.

Pick it up and walk away, and it glows Ferrari's signature racing yellow.

The gauge cluster behind the steering wheel takes inspiration from helicopter cockpits.

Ferrari says the digital display is mounted directly to the steering column, keeping critical high-speed information locked in the driver's line of sight.

The setup is also a first for Ferrari.

At the center is a hybrid speedometer: a physical needle floating over layered digital driving data, all viewed through a curved lens. While most modern cars have abandoned analog needles entirely, Ferrari kept one — blending old-school driving cues with a fully digital display.

Ferrari first revealed its all-electric project in October 2025 under the working name ""Elettrica."" Now, it has an official name: the Luce (pronounced LOO-che).

In Italian, luce translates to ""light.""

The partnership between Ferrari and LoveFrom — first reported in 2021 — resulted in an interior designed to signal the automaker's ambition to reimagine the electric-car experience from the ground up.

It's an unusual move for Ferrari, which rarely brings in outside design firms.

""The team focused on perfecting and refining every solution to its purest form,"" the automaker said in a press release.

The rest of the car, which was developed in-house, will be revealed in May. Ferrari has not confirmed pricing or availability for the new EV yet.

One of xAI's cofounders, Tony Wu, has left Elon Musk's AI company.

Wu said in a post on X on Tuesday that he had resigned from the company.

""It's time for my next chapter,"" Wu wrote. ""It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what's possible.""

""And to Elon @elonmusk - thank you for believing in the mission and for the ride of a lifetime,"" he added.

Wu's Slack access was deactivated on Monday, Business Insider confirmed. 

Wu began reporting directly to Musk last year. He led the company's reasoning org and had taken a leadership role for some of its core efforts, people with knowledge of the organization said. 

XAI underwent a reorg several weeks before Wu's departure, and cofounder Guodong Zhang took over post-training in addition to pre-training, including portions of the company that had previously reported to Wu, the people said.

Wu is the fourth cofounder to leave the company over the past year. Christian Szegedy left the company in February, according to his LinkedIn. Igor Babuschkin announced he'd left the company in August, and Greg Yang said last month he'd stepped back from the company over health concerns.

Before joining the company, Wu worked at Google for nearly two years and interned at OpenAI, according to his LinkedIn profile.

XAI was launched in 2023. Musk has said the company and its Grok chatbot will serve as an alternative to what he deems ""woke"" chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Since then, Musk has merged the company with his social media company X. Last week, Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, acquired xAI.

The company is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value SpaceX at $1.5 trillion.

XAI has come under fire in recent months after its chatbot, Grok, was found to have generated nonconsensual sexual images of real people. The backlash prompted the company to restrict Grok's image-generation features on X.

French authorities last week raided xAI's Paris office as part of an investigation following reports that Grok was used to create sexually explicit deepfakes.

XAI and Wu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Can OpenAI make the numbers meet? It's a trillion-dollar question.","https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-profitability-analyst-investor-opinions-funding-ipo-2026-2","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:08:00 GMT","

Last November, OpenAI investor Brad Gerstner pressed Sam Altman on a podcast about how a company with $13 billion in revenue could commit to $1.4 trillion in spending. Altman bristled.

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer,"" he said. ""Enough.""

Three months later, OpenAI is aiming to raise $100 billion in its latest funding round — a sign that, even amid mounting questions, Altman can find buyers.

Amazon, SoftBank, and Nvidia are all reportedly considering investments that could run into the tens of billions. It would be the largest fundraise in history, surpassing the last recordholder: the company's March 2025 fundraising round of $40 billion. And there are strong signals that it's weighing an IPO for later this year.

For all that momentum, the chatbot pioneer can't shake the central concern: It is spending money it doesn't have, at a scale that could overwhelm its backers if revenue doesn't offset its costs.

The urgency is mounting. On Monday, OpenAI began testing ads inside ChatGPT for free and low-paying users in the US, a sign it's looking for more ways to monetize. Rival Anthropic seized the moment, spending millions on Super Bowl ads the day before mocking the decision.

OpenAI's view is that scale itself will become an advantage, one large enough to overwhelm competitors and cement OpenAI's position at the center of the AI industry.

Whether it can make good on that all-important bet is the trillion-dollar question — and one that will be in front of millions of investors if the company goes public this year.

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter.

For some investors, the uncertainty is reason enough to stay away.

""The company is not yet profitable and doesn't have a plausible pathway to near-term profitability,"" Charles Jaskel, founder of secondaries firm New Vintage Partners, told Business Insider. He wouldn't invest in this round if given the chance, he said.

""Markets change, and there is no guarantee that a technological edge, especially in this AI-driven end of the market, will endure.""

Others have been more blunt. George Noble, a former Fidelity portfolio manager, likened OpenAI to a ""cash incinerator"" on X. Sebastian Mallaby, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a New York Times op-ed in mid-January that OpenAI will run out of money in the next 18 months.

OpenAI's losses will total $143 billion between 2024 and 2029, the ""largest startup losses in history,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a December 4 note. HSBC researchers said in a late November report that they expect OpenAI to have a $207 billion shortfall by 2030, even when modeling for significant boosts in revenue.

In September, The Information reported that OpenAI was telling investors it would burn $115 billion of cash by 2029, more than three times the company's previous estimate.

Its largest corporate partner is feeling the pressure. Last month, Microsoft said nearly half of its cloud computing backlog was tied to OpenAI. The software giant's reliance on OpenAI helped wipe $440 billion from Microsoft's market value amid concerns that Altman's company may not deliver on its obligations.

At the center of OpenAI's spending is compute: the processing power required to train and run AI models. It has signed agreements for more than 30 gigawatts of capacity in the coming years — nearly a third of what JLL estimates the entire industry used last year.

""You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,"" Altman reportedly told journalists at a dinner in August.

For OpenAI and those investing in it, that spending isn't reckless — it's necessary.

In a January blog post, chief financial officer Sarah Friar said the company's relative lack of computing power had been holding back monetization. OpenAI had about 1.9 gigawatts at the end of the year, far short of what it needs to serve demand, she said.

""Compute is the scarcest resource in AI,"" Friar wrote. ""Three years ago, we relied on a single compute provider. Today, we are working with providers across a diversified ecosystem. That shift gives us resilience and, critically, compute certainty.""

Some investors say that the headline spending figures overstate OpenAI's true exposure.

Ethan Choi, an OpenAI investor at Khosla Ventures, wrote on X last month that of the $1.4 trillion in obligations cited by Altman, about $600 billion would be spent directly by OpenAI. The remaining $800 billion, he said, would be covered by partners building the data centers OpenAI will rely on.

Choi told Business Insider that the $600 billion figure is less daunting than it sounds — spread over a decade, it could be matched by the revenue OpenAI expects to generate over the same period.

Choi noted that OpenAI and its rival Anthropic have shown they can generate about $10 billion in annual revenue for each gigawatt of computing power. OpenAI should have about 14 gigawatts online in three years or so, Choi said, adding that the figure was his estimate based on public information. That means $140 billion in potential annual revenue.

Choi trusts Altman and Friar on how to deploy capital. They ""have the most data in front of them,"" he said. ""Whenever there is a big wave like this, there are always naysayers, or folks who don't see the big picture. I think we just need to step back and think about how we can apply AI to our lives, and it's endless.""

ChatGPT's launch was a watershed for consumer technology, hitting 100 million users in two months to achieve the fastest consumer adoption of any product in history. For a time, OpenAI seemed unstoppable.

It went on one of the most impressive growth runs in business history. The company hit $20 billion in annual revenue in roughly three years, torrid growth even in the blitzscaling world of tech.

Revenue is only half the equation.

""It basically did what Google did in seven years, in two,"" Rob Enderle, an independent technology analyst, told Business Insider. ""So that's great, except for the problem of their capex.""

""The infrastructure they're buying is undergoing massive advancements, with performance doubling, tripling, quadrupling,"" he said. ""You can't build a data center fast enough to ensure that it's not going to be obsolete by the time you finish it.""

One way to fund that burn: Go public. Multiple outlets, including Business Insider, have reported there are signs OpenAI is aiming to IPO later this year. That would give OpenAI access to a far deeper pool of capital than private markets can offer, but it also means quarterly earnings calls, public scrutiny of its losses, and increased pressure to show a path to profitability.

A competitive market for IPOs adds to the pressure. Last week, Elon Musk merged xAI with SpaceX, a company widely expected to go public this year. Reporting also suggests Anthropic, OpenAI's closest competitor, is eyeing going public by the end of the year.

There are also questions about focus and competition. Over the past year, OpenAI has shifted between expansion and retrenchment.

Last May, OpenAI named Instacart chief Fidji Simo as CEO of applications, signaling how serious the company is about expanding beyond its core chatbot. In December, Altman called a ""Code Red"" in an internal memo, telling employees the company had spread itself too thin and needed to refocus on improving ChatGPT.

Two months later, the company is pushing deeper into search and ecommerce with a new checkout feature, considering adult content, working on a personal device with Apple's former design chief, and rolling out ads — something the ""Code Red"" memo explicitly hit pause on. It's also exploring robotics and designing its own chips.

Meanwhile, rivals are closing in. On the consumer side, Google's Gemini has been steadily eating into ChatGPT's lead, according to data from Apptopia. On the enterprise side, Anthropic has carved out a strong position, particularly with software developers and businesses looking for specialized AI coding tools.

It's no longer clear that ChatGPT's consumer dominance alone will be enough to generate the kind of returns OpenAI's valuation demands.

Andrej Karpathy, an OpenAI founder who is now building his own startup, fawned over Anthropic's Claude on X.

""This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks,"" he wrote. ""I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there.""

OpenAI's version, Codex, has not received the same level of adulation.

There's also competition on the model approach. Open-source models from China and elsewhere are delivering rapid performance gains at a fraction of the cost.

""Our biggest concern is competitive intensity,"" Kyle Qi, an investor at Llama Ventures, which backs Anthropic, Thinking Machines Lab, and xAI, told Business Insider. ""Google and leading Chinese LLMs are rapidly catching up and, in some areas, already outperforming on cost, latency, and specific benchmarks. That convergence compresses OpenAI's technological moat at a time when expectations for durable dominance are priced in.""

Jeremy Abelson, the founder and CEO at Irving Investors, which has investment exposure to OpenAI, told Business Insider that ""OpenAI needs to spend a large amount of money on capex now because key competitors like Google are investing in-line to larger capex at this point to remain at the top of the LLM leaderboard.""

He added that if the Altman-led company doesn't keep ahead of the innovation curve, ""it risks decreasing market share and losing relevance.""

Until fundraising is finished, it's unclear what OpenAI's valuation will be, but estimates reported by other news outlets range from $750 billion to $830 billion. Whether its ultimate valuation makes sense may depend less on the brilliance of OpenAI's models than on the discipline of its capital allocation. The margin for error is thin.

""At this valuation, a lot of things need to go right,"" said Steve Brotman, managing director and founding partner at Alpha Partners, who said he would pass on OpenAI at this stage for less risky opportunities. ""Use the product if you enjoy it. That doesn't mean you need to buy the stock.""

Altman himself has been upfront on the stakes.

""Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money,"" he said at the August dinner. ""And a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money.""

Now the market will decide.

Two C-suite executives and several senior staff have departed Tools for Humanity, the Sam Altman-founded startup behind the eyeball-scanning ""Orb,"" in recent months, Business Insider has learned.

Adrian Ludwig, the Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Architect, recently left after a two-year stint, according to two people and a LinkedIn review. He previously worked at firms including Alphabet, Atlassian, and Adobe.

Damien Kieran, Chief Legal and Privacy Officer for the past year and a half also recently announced his departure in a LinkedIn post. His previous roles included general counsel at the photo-sharing app BeReal and chief privacy officer at Twitter, leaving after Elon Musk took over the platform. His hiring at the Altman startup was widely covered in the summer of 2024.

Kieran said in the post that he plans to spend his time off training for an Ironman, earning his pilot's license, and riding his motorcycles.

Ludwig and Kieran declined requests for comment.

Their exits follow a slew of other high-level departures: the head of protocol and applied research, the head of people, the head of talent, and the head of people operations have left the company in recent months, according to former employees and a review of LinkedIn. A former employee added that the company's data protection officer left in November. The head of device product and a lawyer who, according to LinkedIn, joined in September, also submitted their notices, the former employee said.

Business Insider reviewed an internal Slack message in the company's #team-chat channel in which CEO Alex Blania described leadership changes, including the appointment of five interim positions. That included an interim head of market operations, interim head of operational partnerships, interim head of people, interim general counsel, and interim head of protocol.

""Only exceptional impact, commitment, extreme work ethic, and mission alignment will be sufficient to succeed in our team,"" Blania wrote. ""If that's not for you, that is okay. But in fairness to all other team members, this might not be the right place to be.""

One former employee who recently left the company said that challenges with company culture and leadership contributed to the departures.

A Tools for Humanity spokesperson told Business Insider that, ""each departure is unique and we wish our former colleagues the best.""

""At a time when the distinction between AI and humans online blurs more each day, we've aligned our team around our increasingly urgent mission to help humanity make those distinctions,"" she said.

The rash of exits at Tools for Humanity comes as Altman and Blania turn their attention to a new venture they co-founded, Merge Labs, to develop brain-computer interfaces.

As Business Insider previously reported, Tools for Humanity has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to try and scan the world's eyeballs in order to verify users' identities. Along the way, it's struggled to win over international regulators, and former employees expressed concern over its long-term strategy.

The company has also faced scrutiny over its hardcore company culture, after Business Insider reported that Blania told staffers to work weekends and not care about anything outside of work.

In the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death, prosecutors examined sexual assault claims against one of his most powerful associates: Leon Black.

The Justice Department's newly released Epstein files show prosecutors looked at allegations from at least four women who accused the billionaire former CEO of Apollo Global Management — the key source of Epstein's wealth in the last decade of his life — of sexual assault and other misconduct.

Neither the local Manhattan district attorney's office nor the federal US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York — the two departments examining the accusations against Black — brought charges against him.

The newly public files include dozens of emails, internal memos, and records of calls with lawyers for Black's accusers going back to 2019. They include the first known instance that prosecutors investigated whether there was wrongdoing related to Black.

Two of the women who drew the attention of prosecutors alleged Black raped them in Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2002, claims that mirror those in civil lawsuits filed against Black after Epstein's death. One, who said Black raped her as an adult, has since withdrawn her lawsuit. The other woman's lawsuit, in which she alleged Black raped her as a teenager, is pending. In each case, Black has denied wrongdoing.

Lawyers and a spokesperson for Black didn't answer Business Insider's questions about any interactions with law enforcement. Black's attorney, Susan Estrich, pointed to an Apollo-commissioned investigation of Black that she said found ""he had no awareness of Epstein's criminal activities.""

""There is absolutely no truth to any of the allegations against Mr. Black,"" Estrich said in a statement.

Representatives for the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment about their inquiries into Black.

Epstein was convicted of state charges for procuring a child for prostitution in 2008 and died in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.

In March 2021, Black stepped down from his role as CEO and chairman of Apollo, the behemoth he'd cofounded.

The billionaire's connections to Epstein had been the subject of media and public scrutiny since Epstein's 2019 arrest, prompting an internal investigation that found Black had transferred over $150 million to the convicted sex offender between 2012 and 2017.

The review found no evidence of criminal activity. The transactions, which Black has said were for tax and estate planning advice, are now under scrutiny by the Senate Finance Committee's investigators.

The newly released files show that behind the scenes, the Justice Department also looked into Black's ties to Epstein.

A December 2019 memo says that federal prosecutors investigated Epstein's ""potential co-conspirators,"" including Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence and is the only person to be criminally charged for involvement in his sex-trafficking operation.

The document does not list Black among the potential coconspirators, but includes a summary of a 2019 interview with a woman who told the Justice Department that Epstein directed her to massage Black in Epstein's townhouse. She told investigators she ""ran out of the room"" when Black ""began initiating sexual contact,"" the document said. The document was heavily redacted, and the date of the alleged incident is unclear.

A document from 2021 details allegations relayed to federal prosecutors by Jeanne Christensen, an attorney who specializes in sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuits. Christensen told them she spoke to a woman who alleged that ""Leon Black raped her violently.""

Christensen's account is that Epstein introduced the woman to Black at his townhouse in 2002 under the pretense that he could help her find work. The woman claimed Black sexually assaulted her in Epstein's massage room, Christensen said.

The allegations mirror those made in a 2022 civil lawsuit against Black by Cheri Pierson, whom Christensen represented. In the lawsuit, Pierson said she experienced ""excruciating pain"" when Black ""placed his mouth on her vagina and began biting her"" on the massage table.

According to Christensen's email to prosecutors, Pierson's allegation resembled the experience of another client who had accused Black of sexual assault. The non-redacted portions of the documents include few other details of this woman's account but show that the Manhattan district attorney's office later closed its investigation into her claims.

Black has said he never met Pierson, who discontinued her lawsuit, which was dismissed with prejudice, in 2024.

In February 2023, a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA's office emailed an assistant US Attorney to say the DA's office was looking into a new accusation against Black. It was an extension of an investigation into Epstein and his associates that dated back to 2019, the files show.

The woman was represented by Christensen and said she ""was trafficked by Maxwell and Epstein,"" the prosecutor said.

The new accuser's claims, described in memos federal prosecutors wrote, are consistent with the allegations made by the woman who filed the most recent lawsuit against Black, in July 2023, using a ""Jane Doe"" pseudonym.

The lawsuit, which is pending, alleges the accuser was sexually abused by Epstein in 2002, when she was 16 years old, and trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell to multiple men, including Black.

Estrich, Black's attorney, called the accuser ""a fraud.""

""Her birth family says she makes up stories and she fabricates 'evidence,'"" Estrich said in a statement to Business Insider.

A spokesperson for Christensen's law firm, Wigdor LLP, declined to comment. The woman who filed the lawsuit didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Manhattan DA investigators interviewed the woman in January 2023, according to a memo written by a federal prosecutor. The memo said the Manhattan DA's office had ""not found any independent corroboration"" of her allegations ""against JE and LB,"" appearing to refer to Jeffrey Epstein and Leon Black.

Four days before Christensen filed the civil lawsuit on behalf of the accuser, she blasted federal prosecutors for not indicting Black.

""It's outrageous that criminal charges have not been brought against him,"" Christensen wrote.

A prominent attorney representing other Epstein victims pushed back at the accuser's story, according to the newly released files.

Brad Edwards, who has represented over 100 Epstein accusers, opposed the woman's attempt to join a $290 million class-action settlement from a lawsuit that victims had filed against JPMorgan Chase for allegedly facilitating his sex-trafficking operation, according to a prosecutor's memo.

According to the memo, which was based on a conversation the prosecutor had with Christensen, Edwards said in a sealed court hearing that there was no ""corroboration"" for the accuser's claims about her interactions with Epstein, Maxwell, and Black. Edwards told the judge that ""the number of people she claims to be trafficked to is incredible,"" the memo said. Edwards declined Business Insider's request for comment.

US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who oversaw the class-action lawsuit, ""expressed reluctance to affirm the award"" to the woman ""because he can't understand why there is no corroboration,"" the memo said.

It isn't clear from the Epstein files or from court records if the woman received funds from the settlement.

Christensen represented a third woman in a civil action against Black: Guzel Ganieva, who in 2021 accused him of rape and trying to pressure her into a sexual encounter with Epstein. It's unclear from the heavily redacted documents if prosecutors looked into the allegations by Ganieva, whose lawsuit was dismissed in 2023 after a judge found her claims were barred by a non-disclosure agreement with Black, who said they had a consensual relationship.

There's no indication that any criminal inquiry into Black remains active. A June 2024 timeline of the Epstein investigation put together by the FBI referred to it using the past tense: ""The Manhattan District Attorney's office looked into allegations against Leon Black.""

Elon Musk says he's happy to lose one lunar milestone if it helps him win the bigger prize.

The SpaceX chief said in a post on X on Monday that he would congratulate Blue Origin if it lands on the moon before SpaceX, as his company focuses on a more ambitious goal: building a ""self-growing city"" on the moon.

""What really matters for the future is being able to land millions of tons of equipment and people to build a self-growing city on the moon,"" Musk wrote. ""In this respect, perhaps we are be more the tortoise than the hare for now,"" he added.

Musk's comments about SpaceX being more ""tortoise than the hare"" came in response to an X post by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, who shared a black-and-white image of a tortoise. The post on Monday appeared to be a nod to the tortoise-and-hare fable, framing Blue Origin as the slow-and-steady contender and SpaceX as the faster but more distracted rival.

Musk and Bezos have been rivals for years, frequently clashing over their space ambitions at SpaceX and Blue Origin, as well as over their fortunes.

After long touting Mars as SpaceX's main destination, Musk said on Sunday that the company has shifted its focus to the moon.

""For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,"" he wrote in a post on X.

""That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the moon is faster,"" he added.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that SpaceX told investors it is targeting March 2027 for an uncrewed landing on the moon.

In a separate post on X, Musk said on Sunday that SpaceX would ""continue to launch directly from Earth to Mars while possible, rather than moon to Mars.""

""Fuel is relatively scarce on the moon,"" Musk added.

Musk previously said SpaceX would send an uncrewed mission to Mars by the end of 2026.

""No, we're going straight to Mars. The moon is a distraction,"" he said in January last year in response to a post on X.

Musk is known for rolling out bold timelines for projects such as electric vehicles — only to revise or abandon them later.

Bezos has long emphasised the moon as humanity's next destination, and has taken aim at Musk's push to colonize Mars.

""Go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first and see if you like it, because it's a garden paradise compared to Mars,"" Bezos said in 2019.

During a presentation for project Blue Moon, Bezos included a slide about Mars with the title ""FAR, FAR AWAY,"" referencing SpaceX's Mars ambition.

Blue Origin said previously it aimed to reach the moon by 2023 — a target it did not meet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Plug-in hybrids were supposed to be Americans' bridge to EVs. Now they're fading from showrooms.","https://www.businessinsider.com/plug-in-hybrids-sales-fall-2026-2","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:08:00 GMT","

US automakers are still building electric vehicles and rolling out gas-powered trucks. But plug-in hybrids — once pitched as a compromise between gasoline cars and fully electric vehicles — are quickly disappearing from American showrooms.

Plug-in hybrids combine a cord-chargeable battery with a gasoline engine, allowing drivers to travel short distances on electricity alone before switching to gas on longer trips.

Unlike conventional or ""mild"" hybrids, which use small batteries to assist a gasoline engine and don't get an electrical socket, plug-in hybrids were designed to cut fuel use without requiring a full commitment to an EV.

Despite years of promotion, that powertrain is now being phased out across much of the industry, leaving several major automakers without any plug-in hybrids in their US lineups.

""Consumers really don't seem to like them,"" Kevin Roberts, the director of market intelligence at CarGurus, told Business Insider. ""The sales figures are low and declining.""

In January, year-over-year sales of plug-in hybrids fell 51.8%, according to CarGurus data. That happened while mild-hybrid sales jumped by 12.7%.

For months, the average sticker price of plug-in hybrids has continued to climb, even as demand waned. The average plug-in hybrid listed for $70,565 in January 2026, up from $62,079 a year earlier.

As demand has weakened and prices have risen, automakers have begun pulling plug-in hybrids out of their US lineups.

The most dramatic retrenchment has come from Stellantis. Over the past year, the automaker has canceled or discontinued several plug-in hybrid models, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe, Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, Alfa Romeo Tonale hybrid, and Dodge Hornet R/T.

Stellantis told Business Insider it is focusing instead on ""more competitive electrified solutions, including hybrid and range-extended vehicles.""

Ford is ending production of the Escape and Lincoln Corsair — including their plug-in hybrid variants — leaving the automaker without any plug-in hybrids in its American lineup. Kia has ended US sales of the Niro plug-in hybrid.

Last year, Volvo stopped US production of the S60 and V60 Recharge, including their plug-in hybrid variants, as part of ""normal lifecycle planning,"" the company told Business Insider.

While 18% of Volvo's US vehicle sales last year had a plug, the automaker has said it wants electrified vehicles — including plug-in hybrids and fully electric models — to account for 90% to 100% of global sales by 2030.

Still, a wave of decisions to remove or wind down plug-in hybrid models has rapidly thinned inventory across the industry. Availability of plug-in hybrids on US dealer lots fell 46.9% over the past year, according to CarGurus dealership data.

The retreat comes as American car companies reassess their electric strategies. The Detroit Big Three have announced tens of billions of dollars in losses tied to electrification investments, while Chinese automakers — led by BYD, the world's best-selling EV car brand last year — have continued expanding electric and hybrid production and gaining market share abroad.

The lineup changes have been costly for the car brands. Stellantis announced a $26 billion write-down tied to its broader electrification strategy, including discontinued plug-in models.

""Automakers probably dislike plug-in hybrids the most,"" Roberts added. ""It's the most expensive option out there — you have to put in all the hardware for an EV, plus all the hardware for a combustion vehicle. Then, you have to add all the additional components to make them work together.""

The plug-in hybrid pull-back stands out because it hasn't been mirrored across other powertrains. Automakers continue to produce battery-electric vehicles and conventional hybrids.

The other big bet among automakers is investing in range-extended electric vehicles, which rely primarily on electric motors but house small gas generators that can recharge batteries mid-drive. They're often called EREVs.

Many prototypes boast a range of 500 to 700 miles and get better gas mileage than combustion engines.

Ford announced plans to build a full-size EREV pickup. Stellantis' Ram 1500 will have an EREV option this year.

Volkswagen is also reviving the Scout brand of SUVs and pickups, including extended-range models. The company's CEO recently told InsideEVs that about 80% of reservations so far have been for EREVs.

While Chinese automakers have leaned heavily into plug-in hybrids and extended-range vehicles as a mass-market bridge to electrification, US automakers appear to be abandoning plug-in hybrids in favor of a more polarized strategy — betting on either simpler hybrids or fully electric vehicles.

Roberts of CarGurus said the plug-in hybrid retreat can't stop the global momentum toward a fully-electric future.

""I still think the long-term trend is toward EVs,"" he added. ""It's just going to be a significantly different path.""



Correction: February 10, 2027 — This story has been updated to reflect that Ford has yet to specify the launch window for its EREV pickup.

Hear me out: McNuggets and caviar slaps — and it may be just the kind of delightful combination that McDonald's needs right now.

McDonald's launched a pre-Valentine's Day promotion on Tuesday, allowing nugget fans across the country to sign up for free delivery of a 1-oz tin of baerii sturgeon caviar from Paramount Caviar, eight ounces of crème fraîche, and a $25 voucher to buy McNuggets to pair with it, while supplies last.

I got my hands on a kit ahead of the launch and have to say, I didn't expect to like the combination as much as I did.

I've been a nugget connoisseur since my preschool days, and McDonald's McNuggets top the charts as my favorite from all fast food brands. They're an essential road trip snack, and I enjoy an order at least once a month as a pick-me-up when I need a nostalgic emotional boost.

My usual preference for dipping my 10-piece is alternating between sweet & sour sauce and barbecue; however, on this special occasion, the pairing of smooth crème fraîche and salty popping caviar really elevated my dining experience.

Sipping sparkling wine (not included) and delicately topping my nuggets with the mother-of-pearl spoon included in the kit, rather than my usual raccoonish dipping behavior, took it to the next level.

Nubia Murray, senior director of brand communications at McDonald's, said the promotion was a way to make caviar, a typically exclusive luxury ingredient made from salt-cured, unfertilized fish eggs, ""playful and accessible"" by offering it for free.

McNugget Caviar was inspired by a dish served at the August 2025 US Open that spawned viral copycats online. COQODAQ, a Korean fusion fried chicken restaurant based in New York, offered a dish at the tennis championships: six chicken nuggets topped with caviar, crème fraîche, and chives, priced at $100.

McDonald's fans with expensive tastes recreated the dish for social media videos.

""We're grounded in what we call 'fan truths' — the emotional connections people already have with our food and our brand,"" Murray said. ""When we see something fans genuinely love, sometimes in a playful or unexpected way, we bring that insight to life in a way only McDonald's can. This was a fun, culturally relevant moment that says to our fans, 'we see you, let's have a little fun.'""

The McNugget Caviar promotion is just the latest in McDonald's recent made-for-a-viral-moment marketing campaigns, including its dill pickle-themed Grinch meal from the holiday season. And the caviar giveaway builds on that momentum at an important time for the brand.

In early 2025, McDonald's experienced a significant same-store sales slump, with its first-quarter US sales dropping 3.6% — the company's worst performance since 2020 — driven by lower- and middle-income consumers cutting back on fast food due to inflation and other economic concerns.

The chain countered by expanding its $5 meal offerings and doubling down on targeted marketing to regain price-sensitive diners. It has improved its same-store sales performance in subsequent quarters, but foot traffic in the quick-service segment is still down across the board.

Analysts told Business Insider earlier this month that price cuts and discounted meal deals have become structural for quick-service restaurants as they navigate an increasingly value-focused environment. However, constant deals are a double-edged sword because consumers get used to discounts and don't come back to pay full price when the economy improves.

""Value is important, but you look at when McDonald's, Burger King, etc., have done well — it's really when they have great menu innovation or great marketing that they really see customers respond,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said.

In that way, the McNugget Caviar promotion lands in a sweet spot: it's free, yet offers value beyond its price point by capitalizing on social media buzz and offering a unique combination that McDonald's diners may not typically enjoy.

McNuggets with caviar won't fix inflation, and it won't turn McDonald's into a luxury brand. But, for a moment, it lets a $5-meal chain wink at a $100 dish — and invites fans to play along.

In an era when value menus are table stakes, maybe the real flex isn't being cheaper, but being in on the joke.

Russian troops are experimenting with a contraption that spins steel cables to protect vehicles from small loitering munitions.

The device was seen on the ""War Correspondents"" program of the Russian state TV channel Smotrim, which reported on Sunday that the gadget was built by mechanics from the 70th Motor Rifle Regiment in Zaporizhzhia.

Fitted to an uncrewed ground vehicle called a Courier, the defensive tool resembles a large weed whacker that's raised to spin vertically.

They're essentially discs with roughly nine or 10 thin cables that whip aside incoming objects. Each disc, turned via a shaft, sticks out from one of the Courier's four sides.

The Courier, a tracked, 550-pound Russian ground drone, is mounted with what appears to be a motor that can spin all four shafts simultaneously.

""When an FPV drone tries to strike, the cables either knock it down or deflect it to the side,"" said a man identified by state media as a squad leader named ""Struk."" He described the spinner as a test device.

The Courier is a multi-purpose drone, meaning that it can potentially be used to transport cargo, retrieve the dead or wounded, or be fitted with weapons for assault missions.

Uncrewed ground vehicles have risen quickly as a new front of the war's technology race, with Russian and Ukrainian forces both hoping to scale up production of ground drones that can replace human soldiers for dangerous frontline tasks.

Little is known about the effectiveness of the new spinning device, but it's another example of how both sides of the war continue to innovate. In the conflict's early days, Russian troops fitted their battle tanks and armored vehicles with metal cages, nets, and spikes to increase survivability against small drone attacks.

The tactic was initially mocked, but has since spread even to militaries outside Ukraine and Russia.

Still, the Courier is designed to carry a significant payload, so it has space for the new weed whacker — a luxury that battle tanks, armored vehicles, and weaponized drones don't enjoy.

Ukrainian bloggers reported in 2023 on a patent with a similar concept, though this idea involved a single, spinning fan mounted on the top of a battle tank to protect against munitions.

In May 2025, they posted images of another device that would protect vehicles in a similar fashion, with spinning blades on each side.

A cited patent description said the system was designed with the belief that a drone operator would have difficulty seeing the spinning blades.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm a software engineer who moved from Lagos to Toronto. The difference in office cultures shocked me.","https://www.businessinsider.com/how-software-engineer-moved-nigeria-canada-loves-toronto-2026-2","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:05:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Daniel Fayemi, a 28-year-old senior software and blockchain engineer living in Toronto. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Over the past seven years, I've worked for multiple companies shipping blockchain integrations and production-grade financial infrastructure in Lagos, Amsterdam, and now Toronto.

I started my career in Nigeria, where I was born and raised, and moved to Amsterdam in May 2023 after a short career break for a job as a senior software engineer. I returned to Nigeria after a year and worked until I received my Canadian work visa through my wife in October 2024.

Since May 2025, I've worked as a senior software engineer at Source Inc. in Toronto, and I do some consulting on the side. I make a six-figure salary, plus restricted options in the same range. 

I really like living in Canada.

My then-girlfriend, now wife, was in school in Toronto, and I decided to join her. Professionally, I was also excited to work in the North American market and build products for a global audience from here.

I was excited about moving, but mostly I was nervous. The costs add up fast … legal fees, travel, and finding a home in Toronto where my wife and I could settle. We put a lot of our savings on the line, and I was scared of not making something meaningful out of that money, effort, and sacrifice.

""Expensive"" is relative, but it's not just the price in Toronto; it's the space. You pay a lot for not much.

Food can be expensive here, too. I saved more in Lagos and Amsterdam than I do here. One thing that makes everything feel pricier is taxes being added after purchase.

Tips, too, were a real money culture shock. In Lagos and Amsterdam, tipping is fully voluntary and even a little frowned upon. Here, they say it's optional, but the prompts are right there, leaving you with little choice. I get why it exists, but it took getting used to.

Compared to Nigerian groceries, Amsterdam was actually more expensive than Toronto and harder to find, so I understand those prices. The funniest adjustment for me was actually grocery shopping.

I landed last year, thinking I would do a classic Nigerian bulk run so I wouldn't have to keep going out in the cold. I pushed three heavy grocery bags through the lobby and the concierge, two neighbors in the elevator, and a guy in my hallway all asked if we were throwing a party. I learned fast.

My first culture shocks in Canada were the weather and the work culture. I'm usually fast-paced at work, and I've had to tone it down a bit. Also, as someone from Lagos who thought Amsterdam cold was ""real,"" Toronto taught me otherwise. I love the cold, or maybe I'm just not scared of it now.

In Toronto, if it's pouring or a heat alert is in effect, our team quietly switches to working from home. No drama, just ""see you on Slack."" In the Netherlands, we still went in unless the weather was truly extreme. In Nigeria, you went in, period.

The second shock was leadership. My managers are genuinely kind and low-ego. There's no visible ""upper floor."" People jump into the same document and solve the problem. Coming from what I joke is the ""Respect Capital of the World,"" Lagos, that felt radical at first.

I like the occasional chit-chat with folks just starting out. Because most of my close friends here are software engineers at different levels, I don't feel a strong need for what the broader tech community has to offer. I still run a small mentorship back in Nigeria, and I think I need to focus on getting my feet under me here first.

Compared with Lagos and parts of Europe, Canada feels more workplace-centered, so in Toronto, I rely on LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord for news and new opportunities. I found my current role on LinkedIn, and I still get about two recruiter messages a week there.

The groups I'm in are private circles of friends and friends-of-friends where we swap opportunities, do interview prep, workshop startup ideas, and sometimes just hop on to play video games. Sometimes I go on outings with colleagues and friends. We went to an arcade together recently.

Our move has had some challenges. Finding a suitable place in Toronto has been one of the hardest parts of moving here. I recently left the first place I rented when I arrived, and it still took me four months to find a new one, even with all my documents.

It was a joint application with my wife, who has a good credit score. Because my credit score was still new, landlords kept requesting bank statements for my savings account, and a few also questioned my income. I think we only got this apartment because our real estate agent knew the landlady.

I haven't had a single bad experience here. Toronto has a wide range of food, which I also appreciate. I can get authentic Lebanese shawarma at Shelby's Shawarma one night and the best pasta at Trattoria Mercatto the next, and yes, I've tried the whole menu.

Every day feels different, and the weather can change multiple times before lunch. I love that on a random Monday at 9 a.m., you might see a long line of people waiting to try a new ice cream brand. Toronto's interesting to watch, and I love it.

I plan to grow into more leadership roles here, work more with AI, and maybe one day build something of my own, most likely something related to blockchain and AI.

Search for a home on Compass.com, the website of America's largest real estate brokerage, and you'll find a familiar layout: a map of available homes, a bunch of price tags, a lineup of shimmering kitchens and golden-hour facades. It all looks a lot like Zillow, the near-ubiquitous home search site.

There is one key difference between Compass' site and Zillow, though: a prominently displayed black box.

Behind the black box sits a heap of listings beyond Zillow's reach, so-called ""Private Exclusives"" that can only be seen with the help of a Compass agent. The intrigue is undeniable: ""Unlock 347 (8%) more homes you won't find anywhere else,"" the box urges when I search in the Austin area. In Los Angeles, there are apparently 366 homes that can only be unearthed by contacting Compass. New York City boasts nearly 450 homes you can't find on Zillow, Realtor.com, or any other home-search portal.

Each of these homes is technically in violation of Zillow's hotly debated ""Listing Access Standards,"" rules the search giant unveiled last April to crack down on agents — many of them at Compass — sharing homes in some places but not others. The country's most popular home-search portal has gone so far as to ban some listings from its vaunted website, which Zillow says is necessary to stem the rising tide of exclusive listings and preserve a fair and open marketplace: ""If a listing is online, it should be online everywhere,"" begins one of the company's blog posts.

The ban prompted a swift legal response from Compass, which sued Zillow in federal court, claiming the search site was using its monopoly power to quash competition. Compass may not want its listings on Zillow right away, but it does want them there eventually: CEO Robert Reffkin has likened the ""private exclusive"" phase to a movie trailer that drums up hype before a wider release. If Zillow bans listings, that wide release loses its luster.

On Friday, Zillow scored an early victory in the legal battle: A judge denied Compass's request for a preliminary injunction, which would have forced Zillow to stop enforcing its new rules. Compass' lawyers failed to show that Zillow is actually a monopoly, the judge concluded, so the so-called ""Zillow Ban"" lives — for now.

The judge's ruling is a big step in the real estate listing war, but the future of home search still looks murky.

For one thing, it's not even clear that Zillow really wants to enforce its own rules. Under the company's Listing Access Standards, agents who market a home publicly — posting a sign in the front yard, advertising the listing on their brokerage's website, or merely teasing its existence via Compass' black box — have one business day to share the home with everyone or risk having it blacklisted from Zillow. During the injunction hearing, though, the company revealed that it had sent about 1,200 warnings and banned just 50 homes from its site over a roughly four-month period last year. Internal documents also showed executives fretting over the risks of turning away agents and their listings. It's not a great look for the biggest name in home search to openly admit that it can't — or won't — show you every home for sale. Zillow may keep up its tepid enforcement of the ban, and it may very well deter some agents, especially those reliant on Zillow's reach, from following Compass' lead. But it won't stop these ""exclusive listings"" from proliferating.

""Zillow's not going to go out and ban thousands of listings,"" says Mike DelPrete, a tech strategist and scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""They'd be shooting themselves in the foot.""

In the meantime, Compass just keeps getting more powerful. Since the courtroom proceedings in November, the company has sidestepped regulatory scrutiny (thanks to some savvy politicking) to close on its acquisition of the second-largest brokerage in the US, Anywhere Real Estate, which owns household names like Corcoran, Century 21, and Coldwell Banker, among others. The combined company, including franchisees, would account for almost a quarter of nationwide home sales volume based on last year's figures, according to an analysis by T3 Sixty, a real estate management consulting firm. More agents mean more listings, which makes Compass' stockpile of exclusive homes all the more valuable. If Compass continues to advertise listings only on its own platforms — in internal databases or simply on the public-facing side of its website — it could attract even more agents and clients by promising them an edge in home search. ""Come here,"" the pitch goes, ""and you'll get access to a VIP room filled with the area's hottest listings."" As one longtime real estate executive told me last year, ""Listings are fuel.""

The legal setback doesn't amount to a total loss for Compass. Its antitrust case against Zillow will continue to wind its way through the courts, and the company could still prevail in a jury trial. Or Compass could simply decide to pursue its vision regardless of the courtroom result. ""We'll never give up,"" Reffkin, Compass' CEO, told me at company headquarters late last year, when I pressed him on the possibility that the legal battle doesn't go his way. Even if Zillow blocks some listings from its platform, Compass may plow ahead under the assumption that buyers and their agents will gravitate toward any place that offers them a leg up in their home search. And while Zillow may come out on top in the courtroom, the underlying state of play probably won't change. Compass still maintains thousands of home listings that are unavailable on other search portals. Other big brokerages are following suit, building up their own stockpiles of exclusive inventory in preparation for a world in which listings are more closely guarded rather than shared broadly from the get-go.

If you're looking to buy a house, this reality could make choosing an agent all the more fraught. Not only will you have to gauge their grasp on the local market or their negotiating chops, but you'll also have to consider how many listings you could gain early access to by choosing their brokerage. Some agents have always been able to unlock more inventory than others, via ""private listing networks"" or chummy relationships with potential sellers in the area. But if brokerages encourage more of their agents to share homes internally before making their broader debut, bigger companies like Compass could gain a decisive advantage, particularly in markets where they control a significant share of listings. This shift could make it more difficult to shrug off an agent and go it alone, or weaken your negotiating position if you want to bargain down your agent's fees. It also raises the real possibility of house-hunting FOMO: Even if the vast majority of these listings are eventually shared everywhere, you may have already missed the chance to be first in line for your dream home.

For now, these are still mostly hypothetical — the judge's ruling on a Friday morning didn't alter the status quo. It did, however, offer a preview of the messiness to come: more legal barbs, more blog posts, and, most importantly, more listings squirreled away in private databases or posted beyond Zillow's reach. Homebuyers, take note: The old way of searching for homes is fading fast.

President Donald Trump is threatening to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, a long-awaited new border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan.

In a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said he would not allow the bridge to open until the US is ""fully compensated for everything we have given them,"" adding that Canada must treat the United States with what he described as ""fairness and respect.""

""We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY. With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,"" Trump added.

The Gordie Howe International Bridge is expected to be completed in early 2026 and has been under construction since 2018. The $6.4 billion project is entirely funded by Canada's Federal government, and will feature six lanes and a pedestrian and cycling path.

The University of Windsor's Cross-Border Institute estimated in a 2021 study that the new route will save about 850,000 hours a year for trucks, which would mean billions of dollars in savings over the bridge's lifetime. The study also found that the Windsor-Detroit corridor is the largest pathway for trade between the US and Canada.

Trump's remarks mark the latest escalation in tensions with Canada, a key US trading partner, as the president steps up his criticism of the country.

In recent weeks, Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moves forward with a trade deal with China.

He also bristled at comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which were widely seen as an implicit rebuke of Trump's foreign and economic policies. In January, Trump also warned that he could impose a 50% tariff on aircraft manufactured in Canada and revoke certification for newly produced planes.

Sen. Gary Peters, of Michigan, called Trump's statement ""completely backwards"" in a post on X.

""We've wanted this bridge for years because it will be a boon for our economy,"" said Peters. ""This is another case of the President undermining Michigan businesses and workers.""

The White House and the Ontario Premier's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I've traveled to over 40 countries. These 5 bucket-list destinations left me disappointed.","https://www.businessinsider.com/travel-disappointment-bucket-list-trips-bali-cairo-paris-hollywood-thailand-2026-2","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:03:00 GMT","

My obsession with travel began early. While other kids plastered their walls with posters of pop stars, I pinned up a world map.

Growing up in South Africa, international travel felt like a distant dream. But everything changed in my early 20s. After saving up from my first job, I finally took my first trip abroad. It was a chilly journey to London to see the Spice Girls reunite — one of my childhood dreams.

That trip ignited a passion in me that's never faded.

Since then, I've seized every opportunity to explore, whether for work or leisure. And while many destinations have lived up to their hype, some have left me wishing I'd kept those dreams in my imagination.

Having traveled to 40 countries and counting, I've learned that some places, no matter how iconic, are better left as daydreams. These are five destinations that left me disappointed.

Back in 2010, a three-day layover in Cairo on an EgyptAir flight from London to Johannesburg felt like destiny calling. I'd always been mesmerized by ancient Egypt's pharaohs, myths, and architecture. Stepping off the plane, however, the Egypt of my imagination vanished almost instantly.

In its place was a sprawling, brown city of intense heat, dilapidation, and overwhelming frenzy. From the moment I left the airport, I felt like a walking target. Every interaction, from a forced perfume-shop detour to navigating the aggressive markets, felt like a potential scam.

And then, there they were. The Pyramids of Giza. They are, undeniably, breathtaking. More massive, more majestic, more impossible than any picture could capture. Standing before them, I felt a genuine awe I will never forget. But the magic was short-lived.

Turning around, the view was dominated by fast-food joints directly across from the Sphinx. The air was thick not with ancient mystery, but with the shouts of hundreds of vendors and the exhaust of countless tour buses. Even the famous Nile River turned out to be a polluted dump, with a stench so foul that Baby Moses would rot in his little basket.

Paris has always been the epitome of romance and beauty — at least in my mind. Since my university days, when I studied French, I'd dreamed of walking along the Seine, gazing up at the Eiffel Tower, and experiencing the city of love firsthand. It was my top European destination, and I imagined it would be a fairy tale. Reality hit hard.

Paris has a certain grittiness about it. I never felt the same sense of safety I've felt in other major European capitals. And while Parisian rudeness is legendary, experiencing it firsthand was still a shock. How a city's people could be so blatantly ill-mannered toward foreign tourists blew my mind.

Of course, there's the Eiffel Tower, which is indeed majestic from a distance. But up close, you're met with never-ending lines, security checks, and crowds. Venturing to the top unlocked a vertigo I never knew I possessed — the iconic view was barely a consolation for my white-knuckled grip on the railing.

If travel was my first love, showbiz was my second. Like millions, I grew up on a diet of American movies and TV that painted Hollywood as a glittering, otherworldly paradise of palm trees and perpetual glamour. To walk the Hollywood Walk of Fame was the ultimate dream.

But Hollywood isn't all glitz and glamour. The reality was a stark contrast to the movies I'd loved. The opulence is there, but so is poverty, grime, and a suffocating mass of tourists. My heart sank to see homeless people on the stars I'd dreamed of exploring.

And the iconic Hollywood sign, while undeniably cool to spot in the hills, is almost impossible to photograph. Despite trying numerous times over the years, my last attempt in 2019 ended with me once again lost in the hills, with zero phone signal, dehydrated, and surrounded by rattlesnakes.

Bali is sold as the ""Eat, Pray, Love"" island paradise for spiritual awakening and rustic, tropical bliss. But what I found felt more like a well-branded spiritual-industrial complex.

The reality is an island straining under mass tourism: notorious traffic clogging tiny roads, drunk and rowdy Australians, and hordes of inexperienced tourists wobbling on scooters.

Worst of all, for me, is the performative ""enlightenment."" The hippy vibe feels less like a genuine search for peace and more like an overdone tourist trend.

During a visit last year, I attended a meditation session where the man next to me, bare-chested with long flowing hair, turned over and introduced himself as Tarzan. I couldn't help roll my eyes. In that moment, he encapsulated my Bali experience: A beautiful island where authenticity often feels sacrificed by an almost cultlike, spiritual aesthetic. 

To criticize any part of Thailand feels like a betrayal. In fact, I adore the country so much that I moved there last year. Over the years, I've explored the alleys of Bangkok and island-hopped between the country's stunning southern islands like Phuket and Koh Samui. So naturally, the cultured, serene north of Chiang Mai was next on my list.

However, I was left completely underwhelmed when I finally visited in 2023. Chiang Mai is undeniably pleasant. It's serene. It's famous for its stunning temples. But after you've visited the fifth or sixth wat, you quickly realize there isn't much else to do.

My memory is of a dusty, charming town, one sleepy river, and a bunch of temples. In a kingdom bursting with energetic cities and idyllic islands, Chiang Mai is Thailand's sleepiest, if not downright dull, destination.

This year has seen a revival of the ""Sell America"" narrative amid new trade war tensions and Donald Trump's aggressive posturing toward allies.

Yet, according to one research firm, investors shouldn't get too worked up about the latest bearish sentiment on America's ties to key trading partners.

As Trump's tariff policies have weighed on some relationships this year—most notably with the European Union—investors have, in some instances, sold off dollar assets such as stocks, bonds, and the greenback itself. The president's bombastic rhetoric regarding taking over Greenland only gave fresh fuel to Sell America fears earlier this year.

The events have fueled speculation that the EU could distance itself from the US, but according to Dan Alamariu, chief geopolitical strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, this is unlikely, and ""Sell America"" sentiment is overdone.

""Markets cite Trump's unconventional domestic and foreign policies, upending of established political norms, rising debt, and ally antagonism as reasons,"" he stated. ""Yet there's a large gap between headlines and structural incentives.""

The strategist highlighted the impracticality of coordinated sell-offs, even in times of high uncertainty. Alamariu maintains that a split between the US and the EU, whether in trade or with investors fleeing either market, doesn't make sense.

""Europe-wide sell-off of U.S. assets is unlikely,"" he stated. ""First, geopolitical tensions are self-limiting and not in either side's interest. Second, investors don't keep long-term geopolitical grudges—especially if tensions trend lower.""

In his view, the ""Sell America"" narrative hasn't spread across Europe so far, and there is no evidence that investors are dumping US assets en masse. European investors were still among the leading buyers of US Treasurys last year, government data shows.

China's recent move urging its banks to scale back US Treasury investments is likely to fuel more talk of ""Sell America."" Yet, Alamariu argues that positive investor sentiment will continue to outweigh any bearishness on US markets.

""The Trump administration will try to stimulate the economy in 2026 ahead of the midterms,"" he predicts. ""U.S. dominance of critical fields like high tech and higher innovation propensity means it remains attractive to foreign investors despite policy misgivings.""

Alamariu believes there is one scenario in which the ""Sell America"" could become a concern for investors. He said that if the US market continues to underperform in the coming year amid major geopolitical disturbances, more investors could pivot to other markets.

Elon Musk's xAI has lost another founding member.

Tony Wu announced late on Monday that he resigned from the artificial intelligence startup, becoming the latest co-founder to leave the company. Others, including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy, have also departed, and Greg Yang announced last month that he would be stepping back from his role to focus on his battle with Lyme disease.

""It's time for my next chapter,"" Wu wrote in a post on X. ""It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what's possible.""

Wu's departure comes as xAI faces a consumer backlash and regulatory probes in multiple countries. The company's Grok AI chatbot and image generator allowed mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit, deepfake images that were based on photos of real people, including children.

Tesla CEO Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The company's stated goal was to ""understand the true nature of the universe,"" according to its website at the time.  

Last week, Musk announced that his rocket company SpaceX acquired xAI ahead of what could be a potentially massive IPO. The record-setting transaction is the largest merger of all time and values SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, according to documents viewed by CNBC.

Musk previously merged xAI with X in a multibillion-dollar deal he announced last March.

Trump administration Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday admitted he and his family had lunch on the private island of notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein years earlier.

""I did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation"" in 2012, Lutnick said in testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee.

""My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies,"" he said. ""I had another couple with — they were there as well, with their children.""

""And we had lunch on the island, that is true, for an hour,"" he said.

""And we left with all of my children, with my nannies and my wife, all together. We were on family vacation,"" he said.

The secretary's admission came as he faces bipartisan calls to resign following the release of records showing that his business and personal relationship with Epstein was more extensive than previously known.

Lutnick previously said that he cut off contact with Epstein after 2005 — years before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a state-level charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution, which required him to register as a sex offender.

But analyses of the latest batch of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice show Lutnick and Epstein were in communication years later.

In December 2012, Epstein invited Lutnick to lunch at his private island in the Caribbean, the documents showed. The two men also had business dealings as recently as 2014, CBS News reported.

Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.   

In his testimony Tuesday morning before the Appropriations panel's subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies, Lutnick insisted that he ""barely had anything to do with that person.""

""I'm glad to be here to make it clear that I met Jeffrey Epstein when he moved, when I moved to a house next door to him in New York,"" the Cabinet secretary testified.

""Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall, two times,"" he said. ""So six years later, I met him, and then a year and a half after that, I met him, and never again.""

""Probably the total — and you've seen all of these documents, of these millions and millions of documents — there may be 10 emails connecting me with him ... Over a 14 year period.""

""I did not have any relationship with him,"" Lutnick said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the subcommittee's ranking member, replied, ""There's not an indication that you yourself engaged in any wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein. It's the fact that you ... misled the country and the Congress based on your earlier statements suggesting that you cut off all contact, when, in fact, you had not.""

Asked by Van Hollen if he saw anything inappropriate during his visit to the island, Lutnick said that he did not.

""The only thing I saw with my wife and my children and the other couple and their children was staff who worked for Mr. Epstein on that island,"" he testified.

Van Hollen asked if Lutnick would commit to sharing with Congress his own records relating to Epstein in order to ""ensure that the file is complete.""

""I will surely talk about that. Hadn't thought about that,"" Lutnick said, adding, ""I have nothing to hide. Absolutely nothing.""

In this article

Paramount Skydance said Tuesday it has sweetened its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, adding a so-called ticking fee to signal regulatory confidence among other new elements. 

Paramount stopped short, however, of raising its per-share offer to WBD shareholders. In December, Paramount launched a hostile tender offer for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery at $30 per share, all cash. The company contends its offer is superior to a pending transaction between Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix. 

""The additional benefits of our superior $30 per share, all-cash offer clearly underscore our strong and unwavering commitment to delivering the full value WBD shareholders deserve for their investment,"" said Paramount CEO David Ellison in a statement. ""We are making meaningful enhancements – backing this offer with billions of dollars, providing shareholders with certainty in value, a clear regulatory path, and protection against market volatility.""

The ""ticking fee"" is payable to WBD shareholders for any potential delays in receiving regulatory approval for a Paramount-WBD tie-up. 

Paramount has set the fee at 25 cents per share, per quarter that the transaction hasn't closed after year-end 2026, ""underscoring Paramount's confidence in the speed and certainty of regulatory approval for its transaction,"" the company said. 

The so-called ticking fee is equivalent to roughly $650 million in cash value each quarter for every quarter the deal is not closed past Dec. 31. 

In addition, on Tuesday Paramount said it would fund the $2.8 billion termination fee that Warner Bros. Discovery would owe Netflix if that deal were to fall through, and it would also eliminate a potential $1.5 billion refinancing cost of debt. 

Paramount said the revised offer — including the ticking fee, funding the termination fee and refinancing — is ""fully financed"" by $43.6 billion of equity commitments from the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners, as well as $54 billion in debt commitments from lenders Bank of America, Citigroup and private equity firm Apollo. 

RedBird Capital Partners' Gerry Cardinale told CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday that the amended bid was an effort to ""continue to reinforce and perfect"" Paramount's offer.

""What we've done is we've perfected it by taking off the table all of the, what I call, more clerical items that they have been using to suggest that they are not going to engage with us,"" said Cardinale, the firm's founder.

If WBD still declines the offer, Cardinale said RedBird and Paramount will continue going directly to shareholders to make their case, though he said he believes there is no reason for the board to not engage.

""Our deal is highly aligned with delivering the best value and certainty – that has never changed,"" he said.

Netflix's proposed acquisition of WBD's streaming and studios assets was estimated to close in 12 to 18 months from when the deal was announced in December. That deal would close after the separation of WBD's TV networks, such as CNN, TBS and Discovery, takes place, which is expected in the third quarter of 2026. 

Last month, Netflix amended its own offer for WBD assets to pay $27.75 per share entirely in cash. The initial deal was composed of a combination of cash and stock at an equity value of $72 billion. 

Paramount's revised offer leans on antitrust concerns that have been raised by lawmakers and industry insiders since Netflix announced the proposed deal.

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has publicly noted his confidence in getting the deal approved, most recently in the company's January earnings call with investors. Sarandos said he believed the deal would secure regulatory approval, contending it would preserve jobs at a time of heavy layoffs across media ""because this deal is pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.""

Strategy CEO Michael Saylor brushed off concerns about the company's credit risk if bitcoin continues to tumble. 

In fact, Saylor said he plans to keep accumulating the cryptocurrency for the company every quarter. 

""If bitcoin falls 90% for the next four years, we'll refinance the debt,"" the executive said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""We'll just roll it forward.""

Asked whether he believed banks would continue to lend to the digital asset treasury firm if bitcoin collapses, Saylor said, ""Yeah, because the volatility of bitcoin is such that it's always going to be a value.""

Bitcoin was last trading at $68,970.45, down 9% over the past five days. It has retreated as investors broadly reassess its utility, with the token tumbling 15% to $60,062.00 on Thursday — its lowest level in roughly 16 months. At its trough, the crypto was down more than 50% from its record.

Strategy has more than $8 billion in total debt on its balance sheet, in part due to its issuance of convertible notes used to buy bitcoin.  

The executive also dismissed suggestions that Strategy would sell any of its digital asset holdings: ""I expect we'll be buying bitcoin every quarter forever,"" Saylor said.

Strategy holds 714,644 bitcoins worth about $49 billion as of writing time, per its website. That makes it the largest corporate owner of the digital asset. 

Saylor noted his firm has two-and-a-half years worth of cash on its balance sheet to cover dividends.

Strategy shed about 2% on Tuesday as bitcoin broke below $70,000 again. The stock has tumbled more than 40% over the past three months.

The Environmental Protection Agency moved to finalize the revocation of a critical scientific finding that undergirds the U.S. government's climate regulations and ability to regulate greenhouse gases, the agency told CNBC. 

The EPA took a key step to ax the 2009 ""endangerment finding"" over the weekend by submitting the proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget, the EPA press office told CNBC. The agency initially proposed rescinding it in July last year. 

""This week at the White House, President Trump will be taking the most significant deregulatory actions in history to further unleash American energy dominance and drive down costs,"" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email to CNBC.

The revocation of the endangerment finding would represent the Trump administration's biggest broadside yet against efforts to combat climate change and would be a boon for the fossil fuel industry that has fought against climate regulations for years. The endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases pose a risk to public health and welfare, giving EPA the authority to regulate them. 

Effectively, the EPA's move would immediately wipe away regulations on emissions from the country's highest polluting sector in transportation. 

Rescinding the endangerment finding, which was signed during the Obama administration and serves as the basis for troves of U.S. climate policy enacted since, would cause EPA to ""lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prescribe standards for certain motor vehicle emissions,"" the agency said. 

Since the ruling, the EPA has regulated emissions from automobiles and other vehicles and power plants. Its revocation would open the door to challenging those regulations.

Rescinding the endangerment finding would almost certainly face legal challenges from environmental groups, and it could be legally tenuous. The endangerment finding has been upheld in court. In 2007, a Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, cleared the way for the finding to be made. The high court declined to hear an appeal challenging the endangerment finding as recently as 2023. 

The Wall Street Journal first reported the administration's plans.

Good morning. Fresh off his feature in Salesforce's Super Bowl ad, MrBeast is getting into banking. The YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, said Monday that his company Beast Industries acquired the financial services app Step.

Stock futures are little changed this morning after all three major averages posted gains to start the week.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Tech stocks lifted the overall market yesterday, helping the S&P 500 notch its second day in a row of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also reached new intraday and closing records.

Here's what to know:

Shares of Coca-Cola are lower this morning after the beverage company reported mixed results for its fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were better than expected for the period, but adjusted revenue came in at $11.82 billion — short of the $12.03 billion Wall Street was expecting.

Coca-Cola said it projects 4% to 5% organic revenue growth in 2026. The company, like rival Pepsi, has seen weakening demand for its offerings as shoppers try to save more at the grocery store.

Alphabet is preparing to spend big on artificial intelligence. At the same time, the Google parent is acknowledging the risks. 

In its annual financial report last week, the company warned — for the first time — that greater use of generative AI by consumers could change its core advertising business. As CNBC's Jennifer Elias reports, Alphabet also noted risks tied to its sizable AI infrastructure investments.

The tech giant plans to raise $20 billion from a U.S. dollar bond sale to fund its AI build-out, according to people familiar with the matter. Alphabet said in its earnings report last week that its capital expenditures in 2026 could more than double those of 2025.

Target is shifting its resources in hopes of fixing its in-store experience problem. 

In an internal memo obtained by CNBC, the retailer said Monday that it is increasing store staffing but cutting around 500 jobs at distribution centers and regional offices. The move ""fuels our ability to put significantly more payroll in our stores — primarily in additional labor and hours where needed most, but also in new guest experience training for every team member at every store,"" the email said.

Improving shoppers' in-store experience is a priority for newly minted Target CEO Michael Fiddelke, who took the helm at the beginning of this month. Target and Fiddelke are hoping to win back customers driven away by complaints of messy shelves and long check-out lines.

Novo Nordisk is facing regulatory scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, which said in a letter dated last week that the drugmaker's TV ad for its new Wegovy pill includes ""false or misleading"" claims.

The FDA said the ad — which Novo clarified is not the company's star-studded Super Bowl spot — misbrands the oral weight-loss drug, a violation of federal law. A spokesperson for the company said it is ""in the process of responding to the FDA to address their concerns.""

U.S.-listed shares of the Danish drugmaker ended yesterday's trading session more than 3% higher. Meanwhile, shares of Hims & Hers, which Novo said Monday it would sue over its copycat obesity pill, dropped 16%.

It may be America's oldest bank, but BNY is going all in on new technology, including ""digital employees."" Here's why the bank is spending billions on AI, and why it says that won't come at the expense of human workers:

In this article

Spotify's stock popped 15% as the music streaming platform added more users and bolstered features in newer markets.

Here's how the company did compared to LSEG estimates.

Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 7% year over year.

The Swedish company said monthly active users jumped 11% from a year ago to 751 million, surpassing the 744.7 million expected by analysts polled by FactSet. Paid subscribers surged 10% year over year to 290 million.

Spotify attributed strong user additions to growth in Latin America, Europe and the rest of the world and improvements to its mobile free tier. Co-CEO Alex Norström said the company recorded the most users ever added during a quarter.

The streamer's 476 million ad-supported user numbers also beat estimates, topping the 468.9 million expected by StreetAccount.

The company also launched audiobooks in new markets and rolled out music videos for premium users, along with more artificial intelligence tools in the fourth quarter. 

This month, Spotify also hiked prices for Premium users in the U.S., Estonia and Latvia. The company previously raised U.S. subscription prices in 2024 and 2023.

The music platform said 2025's ""Spotify Wrapped,"" which breaks down user listening hours and most popular songs at the end of the year, was its most successful ever. Over 300 million users interacted with the feature, which collected more than 630 million shares on social media, Spotify said.

Net income grew to 1.17 billion euros ($1.39 billion), or 4.43 euros per share, from 367 million euros, or 1.76 euros per share, in the year-ago period. 

Looking ahead, Spotify expects to grow monthly active users by 8 million to 759 million, surpassing a 752.4 million estimate from FactSet. Total premium subscribers are forecast to hit 293 million.

For the current quarter, Spotify expects revenue to total 4.5 billion euros, with a 670 basis point headwind year over year from foreign exchange rates. That came up short of a 4.58 billion euros estimate.

Coca-Cola on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue, falling short of Wall Street's projections for the first time in five years.

However, demand for its drinks in North America and Latin America is beginning to show signs of improvement.

Looking ahead to 2026, the company is projecting organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% for the full year.

""It's right at the beginning of the year, and I think we've taken a realistic and prudent approach to a number of markets out there, particularly some of the international markets where we want to see conditions improve, and we need to do some things to execute better,"" outgoing CEO James Quincey said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""

Here's what the company reported for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The beverage giant reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $2.27 billion, or 53 cents per share, up from $2.2 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding transaction gains and other one-time items, Coke earned 58 cents per share.

Net sales rose 2% to $11.82 billion. 

Organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions, divestitures and currency, increased 5% in the quarter.

Unit case volume rose 1% in the quarter, marking the second straight quarter of growth for the company. The metric excludes the impact of pricing and foreign currency to reflect demand. 

Like rival PepsiCo, Coke has seen demand for its drinks fall as budget-conscious shoppers try to save more on their grocery bills and dine out less frequently. Coke's overall volume for 2025 was unchanged from the prior year. 

But there have been some bright spots, like Smartwater and Fairlife, showing that consumers are still willing to pay more for premium drinks. 

And two key markets for Coke are starting to show signs of improvement. Coke's volume in North America increased 1%, while it rose 2% in Latin America. 

Worldwide, Coke's water, sports, coffee and tea division outperformed the rest of its portfolio, signaling consumers' willingness to spend on drinks they perceive as healthier options. The segment saw volume grow 3%, thanks to higher demand for brands like Smartwater and Bodyarmor. 

The company's sparkling soft drinks business reported flat volume. Its namesake soda saw volume rise 1% in the quarter, while Coke Zero Sugar reported that its volume climbed 13%.

Coke's juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages division reported that volume fell 3%. Higher demand for Fairlife was offset by the sale of Coke's finished product operations in Nigeria to one of its bottlers.

Tuesday marks Quincey's last earnings report as CEO. The company announced in December that Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun will succeed him as chief executive, effective March 31.

Braun said on the company's conference call Tuesday that he wants to improve Coke's speed when taking new products to market, better integrate its marketing where customers actually buy its drinks and continue efforts to digitize every step of its system.

""Our system needs to focus on being a little bit better and sharper everywhere to drive transformation and impact,"" Braun said.

The company also plans to stay ""flexible and opportunistic"" when it comes to acquisitions, according to CFO John Murphy. While he noted that Coke's track record hasn't been perfect, he added that almost half of the company's 32 billion-dollar brands were the result of deal-making.

Executives plan to share more about the company's future priorities during its Feb. 17 presentation at the annual CAGNY conference. 

As of Tuesday's open Coca-Cola shares have risen roughly 20% over the last year, raising its market value up to more than $330 billion.

In this article

Alibaba on Tuesday launched an artificial intelligence model designed to power robotics, as more tech giants push into the fast-growing field.

The model, called RynnBrain, is designed to help robots comprehend the physical world around them and identify objects. 

One video released by Alibaba's DAMO Academy shows a robot identifying fruit and putting it in a basket. While these tasks seem simple, they involve complex AI that governs a robot's understanding of individual items as well as movement. 

Robotics falls under the umbrella term dubbed ""physical AI,"" which includes machines that rely on artificial intelligence, such as self-driving cars – an area China has prioritized as it competes with the U.S. for technological leadership.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been among the tech industry's most bullish on the sector and last year said AI and robotics represent ""a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity.""

For Alibaba, the RynnBrain model gives it an entry point into the robotics market and continues the momentum it has seen with its Qwen family of AI models that are among the most advanced coming out of China.

Alibaba is not alone in creating models designed for physical AI. These AI ""world models"" are being developed by tech giants around the world. Nvidia has a number of models to train and run AI in robotics under the ""Cosmos"" brand, while Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is Google DeepMind's own version. 

Elon Musk, one of the biggest proponents of robotics, is designing his own AI with Tesla's Optimus. 

When it comes to humanoid robots specifically, the machines designed to walk and move like humans, China is seen as forging ahead of the U.S., with companies planning to ramp up production this year. 

Like its other models, Alibaba is pursuing an open source strategy with RynnBrain, meaning developers can use it for free. Open-sourcing models has been key for Alibaba to expand the use of its models to developers around the world.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Tuesday slammed Democrats for conditioning Homeland Security Department funding on a requirement that federal immigration agents must obtain judicial warrants to carry out key enforcement activities.

Johnson, in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" called that proposal ""completely unworkable."" But it's Democrats' top demand for funding DHS, which is set to lose funding by the week's end if Congress can't pass an appropriations bill.

Johnson said he hopes Congress can pass another stopgap measure to buy time, but suggested Democrats have been unreasonable in negotiations so far.

""They want to defund DHS just like they want to defund police,"" Johnson said of his political opponents. DHS includes the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, whose deportation efforts have grown especially controversial after an aggressive surge in Minnesota stirred national unrest.

Democrats ""want to make it almost impossible for ICE to do its job,"" Johnson, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said.

""Of the 10 demands, probably the most obnoxious is they want to require judicial warrants, which is completely unworkable,"" he said. 

""Our immigration laws have always been enforced by the executive branch, through administrative law judges. We have, again, literally millions of cases that need to be adjudicated. Our Article Three courts simply can't handle that, and Democrats know it,"" Johnson said.

Democrats have rejected arguments that requiring judge-signed warrants to enter private property — as opposed to administrative warrants issued by federal agency officials — would overburden the system.

The White House sent a counterproposal to Democrats' demands, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement late Monday called it ""incomplete and insufficient.""

Johnson also defended ICE agents wearing masks and obscuring their faces, accusing Democrats of wanting extreme political activists to ""dox"" agents.

""Democrats want to make sure that ICE can't use masks. Why is that? Because they want their activists to be able to dox them and put their families at risk.""

He warned that a shutdown would cause real harm, noting that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration would be defunded if DHS appropriations lapsed. Other parts of the department are already funded through previous legislation.

""They're really playing with fire here,"" Johnson said.

In this article

Kering said it expects a return to growth this year even as it posted another quarter of sales declines on Tuesday, with its biggest sales driver, Gucci, continuing to lag in new CEO Luca de Meo's first quarter at the reins. 

The company, which also owns brands Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, said fourth-quarter sales fell 3% on a comparable basis to 3.9 billion euros ($4.64 billion), a slight beat according to FactSet estimates.

Its flagship label Gucci, posted a 10% decline on a comparable basis in the quarter, also slightly better than consensus, while the other houses posted flat or moderate growth year-on-year.

""2025 was not the year we wanted,"" CEO Luca de Meo said on an earnings call. ""It didn't reflect the full potential of Kering, and we all know it.""

In 2025, sales fell 10% to 14.7 billion euros. Recurring operating income was down 33% from last year, with its operating margin also declining to 11.5% in the period as a result of weaker sales. 

Shares jumped as much as 14% and were last seen up 10.3%, however, the stock is down nearly 14% so far this year.

The positive sentiment spilled over into the broader luxury space, benefiting Burberry, which gained 3.4% in early trade, Hermes, last seen 3% higher, and Italy's Brunello Cucinelli, which added 2.7%.Shares of French luxury conglomerate LVMH were 1.4% higher, while Switzerland's Richemont gained 2%.

Kering, like peer LVMH and other fashion players, has seen its business suffer over the past few years, following a boom in demand during Covid-19, which led to price hikes that alienated customers. Paired with weak consumer demand from China — formerly one of the sector's main growth drivers — and strategic missteps, the fortunes of Kering and others have declined.

The appointment of Demna as artistic director of Gucci is intended to help sales and get the firm's reputation back on track. His first collection, ""La Famiglia,"" was launched last year.

The market is now eagerly awaiting signs that attempts by De Meo — whose surprise appointment last year marked the company's first outsider CEO — to turn Kering around are starting to bear fruit. De Meo was recruited from the auto industry, and his experience included turning around the struggling automaker Renault at the start of the decade.  

""These results point to a slight improvement, all across the board of the Kering brand portfolio and activities,"" said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. ""Whether this could be a precursor for an inflection, moving brands like Gucci to growth in FY26E as consensus currently anticipates, will be the key investment case debate.""

Kering said it sees a ""return to growth and margin improvement"" in 2026, but was light on further details regarding its outlook. It's expected to present a longer-term plan and guidance at the company's Capital Markets Day in April.

""Since the second half of the year, I can assure you, we have been taking action decisively to put the group back on the right trajectory,"" De Meo said, adding that the group is still ""far from"" where they want to be.

One of De Meo's actions has been deleveraging the company's balance sheet, and selling its beauty segment to L'Oreal for 4 billion euros in an attempt to tackle the group's high net debt and focus on its core fashion business. 

""Our objective is clear, reignite desirability and prepare the next cycle of growth, house by house, product by product, client by client,"" De Meo said. 

The new CEO also noted Kering is preparing to enter the wellness and longevity segment, ""a space where we want to play and where we know value and growth will be created,"" and added that the company's jewelry strategy will be further unveiled in April.  

""[Kering's] closing stages of 2025 confirm gradually reducing pressures at a time of more supportive industry conditions,"" noted Jefferies analyst James Grzinic. Investors will be keen to hear more from De Meo first impressions, ""with considerable cost savings potential, an inevitable area of focus,"" the analyst added.

In this article

British oil giant BP on Tuesday posted fourth-quarter profit in line with expectations and suspended share buybacks, seeking to shore up its balance sheet as lower crude prices take their toll.

The London-listed energy firm reported underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $1.54 billion for the final three months of 2025. That matched analyst expectations of $1.54 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.

BP's full-year 2025 net profit came in at $7.49 billion, missing analyst expectations of $7.58 billion. That's down from nearly $9 billion in 2024. 

BP said the board decided to suspend the share buyback and fully allocate excess cash ""to accelerate strengthening"" of its balance sheet. The firm's previous buyback was $750 million and was announced alongside third-quarter results in November.  

For the fourth quarter, the company announced a dividend per ordinary share of 8.320 cents.

""2025 was a year of strong underlying financial results, strong operational performance, and meaningful strategic progress,"" Carol Howle, BP interim CEO, said in a statement.

""We have made progress against our four primary targets - growing cash flow and returns, reducing costs, and strengthening the balance sheet - but know there is more work to be done, and we are clear on the urgency to deliver,"" she added.

Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill is scheduled to take the reins at BP on April 1, following Murray Auchincloss' decision to step down late last year.

Shares of BP fell nearly 4% during early afternoon deals, paring some of its losses from earlier in the session.

Some other earnings highlights included:

The results come at a tough time for Europe's oil and gas sector. 

Oil prices notched their biggest annual loss since the Covid-19 pandemic last year, partly due to oversupply concerns, ratcheting up the pressure on Big Oil's commitment to shareholder returns. 

BP's industry rivals Equinor and Shell both reported weaker quarterly earnings last week, citing lower crude prices, among other factors.

Equinor announced it would reduce share buybacks to $1.5 billion this year, down from $5 billion last year, while also trimming investments in its renewables and low-emission energy projects. 

Shell, for its part, kept its buybacks steady at $3.5 billion, a move that marked the firm's 17th consecutive quarter of $3 billion or more in buybacks.

BP's decision to pause its share buybacks should be seen as a prudent step to prioritize balance sheet strength in a softer commodity price environment, according to Maurizio Carulli, global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot.

""Under former CEO Murray Auchincloss's 'strategy reset' last April, buybacks had already been reduced from $1.75bn per quarter to $750m. The decision to cancel them entirely signals a more cautious stance and a clear focus on financial resilience,"" Carulli 

""While the move was not a complete surprise to the market, particularly after similar actions by other oil majors, some shorter-term investors may be disappointed, which helps explain the share price weakness seen today. However, prioritising balance sheet strength in a softer commodity price environment is a prudent step.

Interactive Brokers now offers nano Bitcoin futures via Coinbase Derivatives, providing smaller, lower-risk, and perpetual-style contracts to broaden regulated crypto access for its clients.

Interactive Brokers is expanding its crypto derivatives lineup through a new offering of nano Bitcoin contracts listed by Coinbase Derivatives, giving eligible clients another regulated way to gain exposure to digital assets.

The broker said the new contracts are now available for trading on the IBKR platform with both monthly expirations and perpetual-style structures. 

Trading will be available around the clock, aligning with the always-on nature of crypto markets, with exceptions for scheduled exchange maintenance on Fridays from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern time.

The products are designed to lower the entry point for futures traders. Nano Bitcoin futures represent 0.01 Bitcoin per contract, while nano Ether futures represent 0.10 Ether. The smaller sizing allows traders to take more precise positions and manage risk with lower capital requirements compared with standard futures contracts.

Interactive Brokers Chief Executive Officer Milan Galik said demand has grown for perpetual-style crypto futures because they provide long-dated exposure and added flexibility. He framed the launch as part of the firm's broader effort to expand access to crypto-related products within a regulated framework.

“By offering nano-sized Bitcoin and Ether futures on a regulated exchange, we are expanding access to these products with smaller contract sizes and lower margin requirements,” Galik said in a company press release.

Perpetual-style futures are structured to track the spot price of the underlying cryptocurrency, reducing the need for frequent contract rollovers. The combination of perpetual-style design and nano sizing is intended to make these contracts more accessible for a wider range of market participants.

The launch reflects Interactive Brokers' push to integrate digital asset exposure into its multi-asset trading platform, which offers access to more than 170 markets worldwide. Clients can trade traditional securities alongside crypto-related instruments through a single account.

Coinbase Institutional also highlighted the partnership as part of its effort to broaden access to regulated crypto derivatives in the United States.

“We're pleased to collaborate with Interactive Brokers to expand access to regulated crypto derivatives,” said Greg Tusar, co-CEO of Coinbase Institutional. “These nano sized contracts are designed to lower the barrier to entry and give more investors the ability to engage with digital assets in a secure and regulated environment.”

Interactive Brokers noted that eligibility to trade crypto-related products depends on jurisdiction, reflecting differing regulatory requirements across regions.

Bithumb has apologised for staff error that sent customers 620,000 bitcoins instead of 620,000 Korean won, equivalent to a few hundred US dollars

South Korea's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange is scrambling to recover more than $40bn of cryptocurrency after accidentally crediting customers with 620,000 bitcoins during a promotional event last week.

Bithumb said it had corrected most of the mistaken credits, but that about 13bn won ($9m) remained unrecovered after some recipients sold or withdrew the funds before the error was detected.

The mistake occurred on 6 February, when an employee entered prize amounts in bitcoin rather than Korean won during a “random box” promotional event. The plan had been to send a total of 620,000 won ($423) in prizes to 695 qualifying customers, but the employee instead sent 620,000 bitcoins ($42bn). Of those eligible, 249 opened their prize boxes and received their reward, equivalent to roughly 14 times more bitcoin than the exchange owns.

Lee Chan-jin, governor of South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), called it “catastrophic” for those who sold the bitcoin they received. Bitcoin prices have risen since Friday, meaning any customers required to return cryptocurrency could face losses. Lee added that the incident exposed “structural problems” in how exchanges operate internal ledger systems.

Separately, legal experts are divided on whether recipients who sold what they received could face criminal prosecution, given a 2021 supreme court ruling that cryptocurrency does not constitute “property” under Korean criminal law.

Bithumb said it corrected 99.7% of the erroneous credits by reversing internal ledger entries and issued an apology. However, 86 customers sold about 1,788 bitcoins in the 35 minutes before the exchange froze the affected accounts, financial authorities said, triggering a brief price drop on its platform. Some had been withdrawn to personal bank accounts, and some was used to buy other cryptocurrencies, according to local media.

The exchange is now holding what it described as “one-on-one persuasion” talks with roughly 80 customers who cashed out, asking them to return the won equivalent voluntarily.

It is reportedly seeking to avoid civil lawsuits, where courts could, under civil law, order the return of the original asset rather than its cash equivalent.

The FSS escalated its response to a full investigation, while the country's parliament has scheduled an emergency hearing for 11 February to question both the exchange and financial authorities.

Bithumb said in its apology: “Bithumb takes this incident very seriously and will do its utmost to prevent recurrence by redesigning the entire asset payment process and enhancing the internal control system.

“We want to make it clear that this incident is unrelated to any external hacking or security breach, and does not pose any issues with system security or customer asset management.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

Vitalik Buterin is calling for a different path in artificial intelligence—one that rejects a blind “race to AGI” and instead relies on Ethereum-style decentralization, verification, and privacy as guardrails for the AI era.

“The frame of ‘work on AGI' itself contains an error,” Ethereum co-founder Buterin wrote in a post on X Monday, noting that the goal is often treated as an undifferentiated race where the main distinction is simply “that you get to be the one at the top.” 

He compared the phrase to vaguely describing Ethereum as just “working in finance” or “working on computing,” saying it obscures more important questions about direction and values.

Buterin said AI and crypto are too often approached from “completely separate philosophical perspectives,” and urged builders to integrate them. 

Instead of raw acceleration, AI development should focus on systems that “foster human freedom and empowerment” and ensure “the world does not blow up,” Buterin wrote, echoing his defensive-acceleration, or d/acc, framework.

Joni Pirovich, founder and CEO of Crystal aOS, told Decrypt, “Ethereum becoming the default settlement layer for AI-to-AI interactions is realistic.

It's less about 'accelerating AGI' and more about providing the necessary rails and guardrails for agentic commerce, trade, and investing. 

Trust and coordination, especially at the technology infrastructure and compliance infrastructure levels, are even more important now than ever.”

The comments land as major AI firms continue to publicly push toward AGI and superintelligence, with leading labs describing rapid progress in autonomous agents and advanced models. 

Buterin claims his alternative centers on safer, more verifiable infrastructure rather than larger models, outlining a practical roadmap in which Ethereum plays a central, though not exclusive, role. 

That includes local LLM tooling, zero-knowledge payments that let users call AI APIs without linking identity across requests, stronger cryptographic privacy, and client-side verification of AI services and attestations.

“Using Ethereum as an economic layer for AI-to-AI interaction is also directionally correct, but it will live mostly on rollups and app-specific L2s,” Midhun Krishna M, co-founder and CEO of LLM cost tracker TknOps.io, told Decrypt. 

Decentralized agent economies need programmable deposits, usage-based payments, and on-chain dispute resolution, Krishna said, adding that AI-augmented governance will require “identity, reputation, and stake-weighted accountability, not just better interfaces.”

Vitalik grouped the Ethereum–AI design space into a four-part framework, illustrated as a 2x2 chart, spanning infrastructure vs. impact and survive vs. thrive outcomes. 

One quadrant centers on tooling for trustless and private AI interaction, including local LLMs, zero-knowledge payments for anonymous API calls, cryptographic privacy upgrades, and client-side verification of AI services, TEE attestations, and proofs.

Another quadrant positions Ethereum as an economic layer for AI activity, supporting API payments, bot-to-bot hiring, security deposits, on-chain dispute resolution, and AI reputation standards, such as proposed ERC-based models, aimed at enabling decentralized agent coordination rather than in-house platform control.

A third focus revives the cypherpunk “don't trust, verify” vision through local LLM assistants that can propose transactions, audit smart contracts, interpret formal verification proofs, and interact with apps without relying on centralized interfaces. 

A fourth targets upgraded prediction markets, quadratic voting, and governance systems.

The comments echo a split that surfaced last year between Buterin and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who said his company was confident it knew how to build AGI and that AI agents could soon “join the workforce,” while Buterin promoted crypto-based safety rails and coordinated control mechanisms.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum has shown early signs of recovery after a prolonged period of weakness that pushed prices sharply lower. ETH has attempted to stabilize near key support levels, but further upside depends on sustained backing from investors and broader market conditions. 

At present, Ethereum appears to have at least one of these factors working in its favor, keeping recovery prospects alive.

On-chain data suggests a notable shift in investor behavior. The exchange net position change indicator, which tracks capital flows into and out of exchanges, has turned negative for Ethereum. This signals that more ETH is leaving exchanges than entering them, a pattern typically associated with accumulation rather than distribution.

Such outflows suggest holders are choosing to buy and move ETH into private wallets instead of preparing to sell. Lower prices often encourage this behavior as investors position for potential rebounds. This shift in stance reflects improving confidence, even as the price has yet to fully reflect rising demand.

Broader momentum indicators support this narrative. The Chaikin Money Flow has shown a steady uptick over the past week, reinforcing the trend observed in exchange data. Rising CMF values indicate declining outflows and improving capital flow dynamics across Ethereum markets.

A move above the zero line would mark inflows overtaking outflows, a bullish development for ETH. At the same time, Ethereum has managed to hold above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement near $2,054. Maintaining this level often acts as a trigger for renewed participation, encouraging investors to deploy capital as downside risk appears more contained.

Ethereum is trading near $2,018 at the time of writing, signaling that demand remains present beneath current prices. The challenge lies in translating that demand into sustained upward movement. A successful bounce from the $2,000 level could push ETH through $2,205, a key short-term resistance. Beyond that, the psychological target of $2,500 comes into focus.

Reaching $2,500 may not prove difficult from a structural standpoint. Cost basis distribution data shows relatively light accumulation around this zone, suggesting limited overhead supply. As a result, ETH could move through this range with less resistance once momentum builds. Stronger accumulation clusters appear closer to $2,800, which is likely to act as a more meaningful barrier.

Before that scenario plays out, Ethereum must clear intermediate hurdles. A decisive move above $2,344 would confirm recovery strength and validate the path toward $2,500 and potentially higher levels. Failure to sustain current support, however, would undermine the bullish setup. A loss of the $2,000 level would expose ETH to renewed downside risk, with $1,796 emerging as the next major support area.

Dubai, UAE, February 10, 2026

Bitcoin is once again pushing toward a major psychological level, with BTC eyeing $75,000 as market momentum slowly rebuilds. As the flagship cryptocurrency leads the narrative, investors are watching closely to see whether this move signals the start of a broader rally or another period of consolidation. 

At the same time, attention is turning to cheap altcoins that are still in early development stages. While Bitcoin sets the pace, some analysts are building a high growth case for a low priced altcoin, focusing on fundamentals, adoption progress, and realistic upside potential. This contrast between BTC's steady climb and emerging altcoin opportunities is shaping investor strategies for the next market phase.

Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading near $70,000, maintaining a massive market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. After a period of sharp volatility in late January, the asset has found strong support and is once again testing the upper ranges of its current cycle. 

Investors are watching the charts closely as the price attempts to break out of a long consolidation phase. Despite the renewed optimism, the road to new highs is filled with significant technical obstacles.

The primary resistance zones for Bitcoin are currently set at $72,000 and $74,650. These levels have historically seen heavy selling pressure from institutional holders taking profits. If Bitcoin fails to clear the $72,000 mark convincingly, analysts warn of a potential ""double top"" scenario. 

A conservative price prediction suggests that even in a bullish environment, BTC may only see a 6% to 10% increase to reach the $75,000 level by mid-2026. For many retail investors, this modest upside is less attractive than the high-growth potential of emerging altcoins.

While Bitcoin continues to face strong resistance levels, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a new option in decentralized lending. The protocol is non custodial, meaning users keep full control of their funds while interacting with on chain finance in a transparent way.

Mutuum Finance is designed around a dual market structure. It allows users to earn yield through pooled liquidity for standard lending, while a peer to peer marketplace, planned for later stages, is intended to support custom loan terms. This setup aims to improve efficiency and flexibility compared with older lending platforms.

According to an official statement on X, the project has reached a major milestone with the launch of its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This working version includes essential features like liquidity pools, debt-tracking systems, and yield-bearing receipts known as mtTokens. By delivering a functional product before its mainnet debut, Mutuum Finance has proven that it is focused on technical execution. This transparency is a major reason why the project has already attracted over 19,000 holders and raised more than $20.4 million in funding.



The growth of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reflected in its rapidly selling distribution phases. The project is currently in Phase 7, where the MUTM token is priced at $0.04. This follows a steady climb from an initial price of $0.01, representing a increase for the earliest participants. With a confirmed $0.06 launch price, the project offers a clear path toward a total appreciation for Phase 1 buyers.

To keep the community active, the platform features a 24-hour leaderboard on its dashboard. This board resets daily at 00:00 UTC and rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM tokens. This gamified approach has encouraged continuous participation from both retail and larger ""whale"" investors. 

Mutuum Finance has also simplified the entry process by supporting MUTM payments via direct card purchases. This allows users to join the ecosystem without needing to navigate complex crypto exchanges or prior holdings.

The long-term vision for Mutuum Finance includes the launch of a native, over-collateralized stablecoin. This asset will allow users to unlock liquidity from their holdings without forced sales. To ensure the system remains safe and accurate, the protocol integrates with top-tier decentralized oracles for real-time price feeds. These oracles are crucial for preventing errors during market volatility and ensuring that all collateral positions are correctly valued.

Security is the primary focus for the development team. The project successfully completed a full security audit with Halborn, one of the most respected firms in the world. Additionally, the protocol holds a high 90/100 score from CertiK and maintains an active $50,000 bug bounty program. 

This commitment to safety is exactly why analysts believe MUTM is building a strong case for a breakout year. As Phase 7 moves toward a sell-out, the window to enter at a discount is closing fast. The combination of verified code and a working testnet makes this the standout cheap crypto opportunity of 2026.

Blockchain.com has secured registration from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, clearing a regulatory hurdle that allows the firm to offer brokerage, custodial, and institutional-grade crypto services in the UK. The approval places the company on the FCA's register of crypto asset businesses permitted to operate under the country's anti-money-laundering framework.

In a statement released Tuesday, Blockchain.com said the registration enables it to serve both retail and institutional clients under UK oversight. The company was founded in the UK in 2011 and has operated globally for more than a decade, but FCA registration had remained a key requirement for deeper activity in its home market.

The UK approval follows the firm's receipt of a Markets in Crypto-Assets license last year, which grants passporting rights across the European Economic Area. Together, the two approvals give Blockchain.com regulated access to both the UK and EU markets, even as the regulatory frameworks governing those jurisdictions continue to diverge.

While FCA registration allows Blockchain.com to operate as a crypto asset business, it does not amount to full authorization under the UK's forthcoming permanent crypto regime. The government is still developing that framework, with implementation expected in 2027.

For now, registered firms are permitted to conduct certain activities while meeting strict financial crime controls, but they remain outside a comprehensive prudential regime covering capital, governance, and consumer protections. That distinction matters for companies planning long-term expansion in the UK, particularly those serving institutional clients.

Blockchain.com acknowledged that the registration is not the final step. The firm said it is continuing work toward securing full authorization once the UK's permanent framework comes into force. Until then, crypto companies must operate within a transitional environment where access is allowed, but future requirements remain subject to policy development.

The FCA has taken a cautious approach to crypto registration, approving only a limited number of firms since the regime was introduced. Many applicants have withdrawn or failed to meet the regulator's standards, citing difficulties around governance, controls, and risk management.

Against that backdrop, Blockchain.com's registration places it among a smaller group of firms that have cleared the FCA's checks. For the UK, the process reflects an attempt to allow crypto activity while tightening oversight, rather than leaving the sector entirely outside the regulatory perimeter.

The government has repeatedly said it wants the UK to remain competitive as a financial center while avoiding a repeat of past failures seen in offshore crypto markets. That balance has produced a slower approval process, but one that aims to favor firms with established operations and compliance capabilities.

Blockchain.com founder and CEO Peter Smith framed the registration as part of a broader engagement with UK regulators and policymakers.

“We are committed to working hand-in-hand with the FCA and UK policymakers as they shape the permanent regulatory framework, ensuring the UK remains a global leader in financial innovation,” Smith said.

The statement reflects an effort to align the company with the direction of UK policy rather than treating registration as a one-off compliance exercise. That tone is consistent with how larger crypto firms have approached regulation in major markets, where ongoing dialogue often matters as much as initial approval.

Blockchain.com said it currently operates across more than 70 jurisdictions worldwide. The FCA registration adds another regulated base alongside its EU permissions under MiCA, giving the firm coverage across two of the most closely watched crypto markets.

For institutional clients, that combination matters. Many funds, banks, and corporate users require counterparties to hold local approvals, even when services are delivered on a cross-border basis. UK registration may therefore support broader use of Blockchain.com's custody and brokerage services by firms with UK exposure.

At the same time, the staggered rollout of crypto regulation across regions continues to complicate expansion strategies. With the UK's full regime still years away, firms like Blockchain.com must operate within interim rules while preparing for tighter supervision later in the decade.

The FCA approval does not settle those questions, but it places Blockchain.com inside the regulatory system at a time when access, rather than scale alone, is becoming the primary constraint for crypto firms operating in developed markets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Cardano Founder Says Leios Solves The Blockchain Trilemma","https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-leios-solves-blockchain-trilemma/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:30:10 GMT","

Cardano is preparing a layer-1 upgrade it says will push mainnet throughput from roughly 10–15 transactions per second to hundreds, while keeping the network's decentralization and security profile intact. At a Tokyo community event on the Midnight Japan Tour, Input Output's Michael Smolenski and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson framed Ouroboros Leios as both a scaling step and a broader consensus breakthrough.

Smolenski, Cardano Core product manager at Input Output, told attendees Leios is “an upgrade to layer 1 to make Cardano faster,” with active development underway and a target release “this year in 2026.” He described the current throughput ceiling as suitable for proving out Ouroboros' design, but insufficient for the next phase of adoption and for the economics of stake pool operators (SPOs).

“Up until now the speed of the network has been around […] 10 to 15 transactions per second,” Smolenski said. “But now we need to move on to higher transaction throughput in order to compete and drive further adoption. Another factor, SPOs, they in the long term need to support the cost of their operations from transaction fees instead of from block rewards […] they need to see network usage of around 50 transactions per second.”

The initial Leios mainnet release is pitched as a “50 times improvement,” with Smolenski translating that into an early move from roughly 10 TPS to around 500 TPS. Rather than sticking to transactions-per-second as the headline metric, he emphasized “transaction kilobytes per second” to account for varied transaction sizes, calling out a target of “300 transaction kilobytes per second” and a confirmation window “between 20 to 80 seconds,” based on prototype results.

Smolenski described Leios as Cardano's “next generation consensus protocol,” built around additional block types. “There's a new block. It's called an endorser block,” he said, adding that existing blocks would be referred to as “ranking blocks.” The practical consequence, in his telling, is the ability to “pack a whole lot more transactions” by bundling them into endorser blocks, alongside other prioritization mechanics he did not detail on stage.

He also stressed that scaling will be incremental to avoid overburdening node operators. The team plans to demonstrate higher throughput in steps, first targeting 500 TPS on mainnet, then proving 1,000 TPS in the near term, with an eventual ambition of 10,000 TPS. “We can't just go from where we are […] and go up to 10,000 transactions per second because this needs to be done in a strategic manner,” Smolenski said, repeatedly pointing to the need to “bring the SPOs along with us.”

On timeline, he said a first public Leios testnet is targeted “at the end of Q2 this year,” ahead of a mainnet hard fork.

Hoskinson widened the frame, positioning Leios as the culmination of a decade-long research and engineering pipeline. “Ouroboros Leios didn't begin in 2026 […] Leios actually began in 2016, 10 years ago,” he said, describing “more than two dozen papers,” “dozens of protocols,” and contributions spanning “more than 15 engineering firms” and “168 scientists over a 10-year period.”

“Why Leios is special is it's not TPS,” Hoskinson said. “It's actually a resolution of the hardest problem in consensus and blockchain, the blockchain trilemma […] you have decentralization, you have security, and you have scalability […] we're told you can only pick two.” He then made the core claim: “This protocol is decentralized, secure, and fast.”

Notably, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also said the blockchain trilemma has effectively been solved, comments he made just a few weeks ago.

Hoskinson also argued the design is engineered to degrade safely. “If the protocol fails, the protocol fails to what we have today. It collapses to Ouroboros Praos,” he said, referencing a prior network incident he characterized as a soft fork in which “Cardano split into two networks” and later “came back together by itself.”

In the same remarks, Hoskinson repeatedly returned to governance capacity as the longer-horizon advantage, suggesting pure technical differentiation is transient. He pointed to Cardano's on-chain governance and treasury — “a billion dollars in it […] that you control […] the ADA holders,” he said — as the mechanism to fund upgrades and coordinate change over time.

At press time, ADA traded at $0.2638.

The NFT ecosystem has evolved far beyond its early single-chain roots. What began as a largely Ethereum-centric movement has transformed into a diverse, multi-chain landscape where creators, collectors, and developers operate across multiple blockchains simultaneously. As transaction costs, scalability demands, and user expectations continue to shift, multi-chain NFT marketplace development has emerged as a strategic necessity rather than a technical luxury.

Today's NFT users no longer ask whether a marketplace supports multiple blockchains they ask how seamlessly it does so. Platforms that fail to adapt risk fragmenting liquidity, alienating creators, and losing relevance in an increasingly interconnected Web3 economy. This article explores the core benefits, practical use cases, and strategic considerations involved in building a multi-chain NFT marketplace, offering insights grounded in real-world implementations and market behavior.

 

In the early days of NFTs, Ethereum's dominance made single-chain marketplaces viable. Liquidity was concentrated, standards were consistent, and most users were willing to tolerate high gas fees in exchange for network trust and composability. However, as NFT adoption expanded, Ethereum's limitations—particularly scalability and transaction costs—became more apparent.

This led to the rapid rise of alternative blockchains such as Solana, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Flow. Each ecosystem brought distinct advantages: Solana offered high throughput and near-zero fees, Polygon delivered Ethereum compatibility with lower costs, and Flow focused on consumer-friendly experiences for mainstream brands. The result was a fragmented NFT market, with liquidity and communities spread across multiple chains.

Multi-chain marketplaces emerged as a response to this fragmentation. Rather than forcing users to choose a single ecosystem, these platforms aim to unify access, enabling users to mint, list, trade, and manage NFTs across chains from a single interface. This approach reflects a broader Web3 trend toward interoperability and abstraction of underlying infrastructure.

 

One of the most significant advantages of a multi-chain approach is expanded market reach. By supporting multiple blockchains, a marketplace can tap into distinct user bases, creator communities, and liquidity pools that would otherwise remain siloed. This is particularly important in regions where gas fees or preferred chains differ due to economic or cultural factors.

Cost optimization is another major benefit. Users can choose blockchains that align with their transaction frequency and budget. For example, a creator minting a large collection may prefer a low-fee chain, while collectors trading high-value art may still opt for Ethereum's security and prestige. Multi-chain platforms empower users with choice, reducing friction and increasing engagement.

From a strategic perspective, multi-chain marketplaces are also more future-proof. Blockchain ecosystems evolve rapidly, and dominance can shift over time. Platforms that are architected to integrate new chains more easily are better positioned to adapt to emerging technologies, regulatory changes, and user trends without requiring complete redesigns.

 

Liquidity is the lifeblood of any marketplace. In single-chain NFT platforms, liquidity is inherently limited to the activity on that chain. Multi-chain marketplaces, by contrast, can aggregate liquidity across ecosystems, increasing trading volume and improving price discovery.

Blur and OpenSea's cross-chain expansions illustrate how liquidity aggregation strengthens network effects. When buyers know they can access a wider range of assets and sellers know they can reach a broader audience, both sides are incentivized to remain active on the platform. Over time, this creates a reinforcing cycle that strengthens market dominance.

However, liquidity aggregation is not merely a UX feature it requires careful backend design. Cross-chain indexing, real-time metadata synchronization, and consistent royalty enforcement are all critical components that determine whether liquidity feels unified or fragmented from a user's perspective.

 

One of the most prominent use cases for multi-chain NFT marketplaces is creator diversification. Artists, game studios, and brands increasingly operate across multiple ecosystems to reach different audiences. A gaming studio, for instance, may deploy in-game assets on a high-speed chain while offering premium collectibles on Ethereum. A multi-chain marketplace enables such strategies without forcing creators to manage multiple platforms.

Another major use case is cross-chain NFT trading and portfolio management. Advanced collectors often hold assets across several blockchains. Marketplaces that provide unified dashboards, valuation tools, and analytics across chains significantly improve user experience and retention. This capability transforms the marketplace from a transactional platform into a portfolio management hub.

Enterprise and brand-driven NFTs also benefit from multi-chain strategies. Global brands entering Web3 often prioritize scalability, regulatory clarity, and user accessibility over ideological chain loyalty. Supporting multiple blockchains allows marketplaces to tailor infrastructure to specific campaign needs, whether it's a mass-market NFT drop or a limited-edition premium release.

 

Building a multi-chain NFT marketplace introduces architectural complexity that goes far beyond adding wallet connectors. At the core lies the challenge of interoperability ensuring that assets, metadata, and transactions remain consistent across fundamentally different blockchain environments.

Most successful platforms adopt a modular architecture, separating chain-specific logic from core marketplace functions. Smart contracts handle on-chain operations, while off-chain services manage indexing, search, analytics, and user profiles. This separation allows teams to integrate new blockchains without disrupting the entire system.

Bridges and messaging protocols play a crucial role, particularly for cross-chain asset transfers. However, bridges are also among the most exploited components in Web3, accounting for a significant share of blockchain-related hacks. As a result, many marketplaces limit direct cross-chain transfers and instead focus on unified listings and discovery, reducing security exposure while still delivering multi-chain value.

 

Multi-chain marketplaces must also navigate regulatory and governance complexity. Different blockchains may have varying levels of decentralization, validator structures, and compliance implications. Supporting multiple chains means inheriting multiple risk profiles, which must be carefully managed.

From a compliance standpoint, marketplaces must consider how KYC, AML, and content moderation policies apply across chains. A unified policy framework helps maintain consistency, but implementation often requires chain-specific adaptations. Platforms that proactively address these challenges tend to build stronger relationships with payment providers and institutional partners.

Governance models also evolve in multi-chain contexts. Some platforms introduce token-based governance to coordinate decisions across ecosystems, while others retain centralized oversight for faster execution. The right approach depends on scale, audience, and long-term vision.

 

Perhaps the most important insight in multi-chain NFT marketplace development is that more chains do not automatically mean more value. Strategic selection matters. Supporting too many blockchains without sufficient user demand can dilute focus, increase maintenance costs, and complicate UX.

Successful platforms prioritize chains based on user activity, ecosystem health, and strategic alignment. They also invest heavily in abstraction—hiding complexity from users while maintaining transparency and trust. Wallet-less onboarding, gas fee abstraction, and clear transaction previews are increasingly becoming differentiators rather than optional enhancements.

Finally, community engagement remains critical. Multi-chain marketplaces must foster cross-ecosystem communities rather than treating each chain as an isolated silo. Unified branding, shared incentives, and consistent communication help create a cohesive identity that transcends individual blockchains.

 

Building a multi-chain NFT marketplace is as much a strategic endeavor as it is a technical one. The platforms that succeed are those that understand why interoperability matters, where it delivers the most value, and how to implement it without compromising security or user experience. As Web3 continues to mature, multi-chain architectures are likely to become the default rather than the exception.

For founders and developers, the goal should not be to chase every new blockchain trend, but to build resilient systems that connect ecosystems, empower users, and adapt to change. In doing so, multi-chain NFT marketplaces can play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of the digital ownership economy.

Building a multi-chain NFT marketplace represents a strategic leap toward scalability, inclusivity, and long-term relevance in an increasingly interconnected Web3 ecosystem. By enabling seamless access across multiple blockchains, businesses can unlock broader liquidity, empower creators with greater flexibility, and deliver superior user experiences while remaining adaptable to future technological shifts. However, success depends on thoughtful chain selection, robust security architecture, regulatory awareness, and a strong focus on user-centric design rather than sheer technical expansion. A well-planned NFT Marketplace Development Solution that embraces interoperability while managing complexity positions platforms to not only compete in today's fragmented NFT landscape but to lead the next phase of digital asset innovation.

Think the NFT craze is over? Think again. While the “ape” hype of 2021 feels like a lifetime ago, the underlying tech has actually matured into something much more stable and useful. In 2025 alone, the global NFT market saw a steady climb, with sales volumes hitting roughly $38 billion as industries like real estate, gaming, and luxury retail moved from experimentation to integration. By the end of this year, analysts expect the market to cross the $50 billion mark, driven by utility rather than just pretty pictures.

If you want to enter this space now, “standard” isn't going to cut it. A basic JPEG on a common marketplace is yesterday's news. Today, success lies in building something tailored. Whether you are looking for specialized NFT development services or trying to map out a project yourself, this guide dives into the nuts and bolts of making your digital assets as custom as they can possibly be.

Before you write a single line of code, you have to decide what these tokens actually do. Are they keys to a digital club? Are they fractionalized shares of a physical building? Or maybe they are dynamic characters in a video game that level up as the player progresses.

Customization starts with the “Why.” If you just copy a generic project, you'll end up with a generic result. To stand out, you need to bake the logic directly into the asset's DNA. This means moving away from static metadata.

Most people fail because they treat NFTs as an afterthought. Rarely do they consider how the token will interact with other platforms. When you plan for high customization, you are essentially designing a mini-program that lives on the blockchain.

Our blockchain team advice: Start with a “Utility Map.” List every single thing a holder can do with the token. If the list is short, your project might need more brainstorming before you start development.

Picking a network is like choosing a foundation for a house. If you build on sand, everything eventually sinks. Most people default to Ethereum because it is the most popular, but it isn't always the best for every custom use case.

You've likely heard of ERC-721. It's the gold standard for unique tokens. However, if you want to get creative, you should look into ERC-1155. This standard allows you to manage both unique items and “semi-fungible” items (like gold coins in a game) within a single contract. It saves a lot of money on gas and makes the system much more organized.

For those wanting ultimate customization, look into ERC-6551. This is a newer standard that gives every NFT its own wallet address. Suddenly, your NFT can “own” other NFTs or hold its own cryptocurrency. This is a game-changer for digital identity and gaming.

Important to remember: Your choice of blockchain dictates who can buy your tokens. If you pick a niche chain, you might have less traffic, even if the tech is better.

This is where the magic (and the math) happens. The smart contract is the brain of your NFT. To make it “as custom as possible,” you shouldn't just use a template from OpenZeppelin and call it a day.

You need to write logic that handles specific business rules. For example, do you want a secondary market royalty that changes over time? Maybe the first year it's 10%, but then it drops to 5% to encourage long-term trading. You can program that.

Creating a custom contract requires a lot of testing. Because you are departing from the “safe” standard templates, you run the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. Hackers love custom code because it hasn't been battle-tested by thousands of other projects yet.

Did you know? Over 70% of smart contract hacks happen because of simple logic errors in custom functions. Always get a third-party audit before you deploy to the mainnet.

Where does the “art” actually live? Contrary to popular belief, the image is rarely stored directly on the blockchain. It would be way too expensive. Usually, the blockchain just stores a link to a file.

If you want a truly custom and decentralized project, you shouldn't use a regular website server to host your images. If your website goes down, the NFT becomes a broken link. Instead, use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or Arweave. These are decentralized storage layers that ensure your assets live as long as the blockchain does.

Metadata is a JSON file that describes the NFT. It looks like this:

To make it custom, you can add “Hidden Traits” that only reveal themselves when certain conditions are met. You could also include “On-chain Metadata” for vital stats. While it costs more in gas, putting the most important data (like a character's health points) directly on the blockchain makes it much more secure and “real” in the eyes of collectors.

Use this hack: Use “Base64 Encoding” to store small SVG images entirely on-chain. This makes the NFT 100% independent of any external servers.

The user experience (UX) is often the weakest link in NFT projects. If a user has to jump through ten hoops just to buy your token, they won't do it. A custom project needs a custom frontend that feels like a premium app, not a clunky crypto experiment.

You'll need to connect the website to the user's wallet (like MetaMask or Phantom). This is usually done using libraries like Ethers.js or Web3.js.

Remember, most users in 2026 are looking for simplicity. They don't want to see “Transaction Hash” errors. They want to see “Success! Your Knight is now in your wallet.” Use clear language and provide feedback at every step of the process.

Never, ever skip this. Even if you are a coding wizard, mistakes happen. In the world of blockchain, mistakes are permanent. If you lose the “Owner” rights to your contract or accidentally allow anyone to mint for free, there is no “undo” button.

Custom features mean custom risks. If you've added a “staking” feature where people can earn rewards for holding your NFT, that code is especially sensitive. It handles money, and money attracts bad actors.

Important to remember: An audit doesn't just find bugs; it also optimizes your code to save gas. A well-written contract can save your users thousands of dollars in transaction fees over its lifetime.

The launch isn't the finish line; it's the starting gun. Once the NFTs are out in the world, you need to manage the community and the secondary market.

You'll want to get your collection verified on marketplaces like OpenSea, Blur, or Magic Eden. This adds a “blue checkmark” that tells buyers your project is the real deal and not a scammy copycat.

The most successful custom projects treat their NFTs as a platform. They keep adding value months and years after the initial sale. This is what separates a “cash grab” from a legitimate business.

Did you know? In the current landscape, “Gasless Minting” is becoming the gold standard for luxury brands. By using a “Lazy Minting” approach, the NFT isn't actually created until someone buys it. This saves the creator from paying upfront fees and makes the entry barrier for customers almost zero.

Our blockchain team advice: If you are building for the long term, focus on “Interoperability.” This means making sure your NFT can be recognized and used in other metaverses or platforms. Using standard metadata formats but with custom “extension” fields is the best way to achieve this.

Use this hack: To prevent “whale” manipulation (where one person buys everything), you can implement a “Max Mint per Wallet” limit directly in the smart contract code. It's a simple three-line addition that ensures a much fairer distribution of your assets.

Navigating the world of blockchain can feel like trying to learn a new language while running a marathon. It's fast, it's technical, and the stakes are high. However, the ability to create truly unique, programmable assets opens up doors that were closed in the traditional digital world.

Building a custom NFT ecosystem requires a blend of creative vision and technical precision. From choosing the right standard to ensuring your smart contracts are airtight, every decision shapes the future of your project.

On February 5, 2026, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) announced a £247,590 fine against MediaLab.AI, Inc. (“MediaLab”), the company behind the image-sharing platform Imgur, for failing to lawfully process children's personal information.

The ICO determined that MediaLab had permitted children to use Imgur without implementing basic safeguards required under UK data protection law, and had processed the personal information of children in ways that breached the UK GDPR between September 2021 and September 2025.

Key failings identified by the ICO included:

In determining the penalty amount, the ICO considered MediaLab's acceptance of the provisional findings and its commitment to address the infringements if access to Imgur from the UK is restored. The ICO also took into account the number of children affected, the potential harm, the duration of the contraventions and MediaLab's global turnover. The ICO indicated that, should MediaLab resume processing children's data in the UK without implementing the required measures, further regulatory action may follow.

Today the European Parliament held a vote on the European Central Bank's (ECB's) annual report. One of the amendments added to the report shortly before the vote was a passage in support of the digital euro (as first reported by EuroNews), effectively providing an indicative vote on the central bank digital currency, given legislative negotiations are ongoing. The result was strongly supportive of the CBDC, with 420 in favor, 158 against and 64 abstentions.

While votes on central bank digital currencies might be expected to divide along party lines, with left leaning supportive and right leaning against, today the centrist and right leaning parties were split on the topic. The digital euro rapporteur, MEP Navarrete Rojas who is leading the negotiations, was amongst the no votes. The center right EPP party to which he belongs is the largest in parliament and was completely split, although more of his party's MEPs voted in favor of the digital euro than against. Even the far right Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN) party had more votes in favor than against.

A key argument that the ECB has been making is the need for payment sovereignty, with today's retail payments dominated by Visa and Mastercard. The Ukraine war and Trump's threats over Greenland reinforced the ECB's arguments of late. The Rapporteur has argued that retail payments should be left to the private sector, with the European Payments Initiative (EPI) making progress in rolling out a European digital wallet, wero. Instead he proposed that the ECB should stick to an offline digital euro. Today's amendment and vote was specific about supporting both an online and offline digital euro.

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio believes that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) will become a reality, despite major concerns about government control over the personal finances of ordinary people. The billionaire investor discussed in an interview on the Tucker Carlson Show how CBDCs could pose risks worldwide, particularly for those who value financial freedom.

Dalio said CBDCs will be implemented across continents. He explained that they could function like money-market funds and offer practical benefits, facilitating easier and faster transactions.

However, the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, according to Dalio. He believes CBDCs will lead to a complete loss of privacy, as governments would have full access to transaction details. While this transparency could help combat illegal activities, authorities would gain unprecedented power over citizens' financial lives.

Programmable digital money would also enable direct government taxation, allowing officials to withdraw funds from people's accounts. Furthermore, authorities could enforce foreign exchange controls at will and seize money from sanctioned countries, putting international currency holders at risk. Dalio went further, stating that people who fall out of political favour could be entirely excluded from the financial system.

Dalio believes that CBDCs have low investment potential as these currencies will not likely offer interest payments, making them a poor choice for wealth storage. In turn, CBDC holders will face currency devaluation over time. These factors make digital money an ineffective vehicle for saving money.

Interest in CBDCs and their practical use cases continues to grow, but actual global deployment remains limited. According to the Atlantic Council's tracking system, only three countries — Nigeria, Jamaica and the Bahamas — currently operate CBDCs.

However, 49 countries, including China, India, Russia and Brazil, are conducting pilot tests. India's central bank recently proposed linking BRICS CBDCs for cross-border trade and tourism transactions. Elsewhere, 20 countries have CBDCs in development, and another 36 nations continue researching the technology.

In the US, President Donald Trump has expressed opposition to these currencies and signed an executive order after assuming office that prevents the issuance, circulation and use of a US CBDC. While this rule offers relief for privacy advocates, Dalio warns that CBDCs will eventually spread globally, as growing support for digital money could influence American policy in the future.

While governments see multiple benefits to introducing CBDCs, ordinary people remain concerned about surveillance and the potential abuse of power.

Dalio also warned in a separate interview that the world is 'on the brink' of a capital war, amid geopolitical tensions and volatile capital markets. He believes the world is close to teetering into capital war territory, where money is weaponised through trade embargoes, limited access to capital markets, or the use of debt ownership as leverage.

'We are on the brink. That means not in, but it means we are quite close to [capital war], and it would be very easy to go over the brink into a capital war, because there are mutual fears,' he said.

What to Know:

Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates founder and macroeconomic oracle, has never been shy about predicting shifts in the global order. But his recent commentary on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) paints a specifically dystopian picture.

Speaking on the ‘Tucker Carlson Show', his core warning? As governments digitize sovereign currencies, transactional anonymity will be the first casualty. Unlike cash (which leaves no digital footprint) or crypto (designed for pseudonymity), CBDCs grant central banks total visibility into every purchase, transfer, and saving habit.



It fundamentally alters the relationship between the individual and the state. When money becomes programmable, it stops being just a store of value; it becomes a tool for policy enforcement.

Dalio's warning suggests a future where purchasing power is curtailed based on social credit, carbon footprints, or even political affiliation. The financial system is bifurcating: a state-surveilled centralized lane on one side, and a decentralized alternative fighting for sovereignty on the other.

The implications extend far beyond simple banking. If financial rails can be censored, the industries relying on them, specifically content creation and independent media, are essentially sitting ducks.

We've already seen ‘Operation Choke Point 2.0' where legal businesses get debanked for ‘reputational risks.' With the $191B creator economy facing tightening restrictions from centralized processors, the market is hunting for Web3 alternatives outside the reach of potential CBDC surveillance.

That search for censorship-resistant infrastructure is driving attention toward platforms like SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), which aims to sever the creator economy from traditional financial gatekeepers.

SUBBD Disassociates Content from Centralized Control Through AI and Web3

The current creator economy has a fatal flaw: reliance on Web2 intermediaries. Platforms like OnlyFans or Patreon dictate terms, take massive revenue cuts, sometimes up to 70% when you factor in agency and processing fees, and hold the power to de-platform users without recourse.

Dalio's CBDC warning just makes this scarier. If the underlying currency becomes programmable, a creator could be demonetized at the protocol level of the money itself, not just by a platform admin.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is pitching itself as the antithesis to that surveillance-heavy model. Built on Ethereum ($ETH), SUBBD uses an EVM-compatible architecture to ensure transactions remain transparent yet permissionless. The project merges this decentralized financial layer with high-utility AI tools.

Instead of relying on centralized algorithms that often suppress organic reach, SUBBD hands creators AI Personal Assistants for automated interactions and proprietary AI Voice Cloning. Influencers can scale their presence (and revenue) without selling their data rights to a centralized entity.



It's about sovereignty. In the SUBBD ecosystem, payments are peer-to-peer, governed by smart contracts rather than arbitrary corporate policy. For fans, that means access to token-gated exclusive content that can't be blocked by a bank manager or a government censor.

For creators, it means retaining control over their earnings and their digital likeness. Is it surprising that creators are fleeing legacy platforms when Web3 offers both better fees and actual ownership?

Presale Data Signals Shift Toward Decentralized Creator Economies

Smart money is increasingly betting on utility tokens that solve specific, high-friction problems. While memecoins rely on fleeting sentiment (and let's be honest, gambling), SUBBD Token attacks the structural failures of the content industry. The project's presale performance suggests the narrative is sticking, it has already raised over $1.4M from early supporters.

Currently priced at $0.057495, the token is the platform's economic engine. Beyond simple transactions, the tokenomics are designed to encourage long-term holding rather than mercenary capital rotation. SUBBD offers a fixed 20% APY for staking during the first year.

That aggressive yield strategy locks up supply while the platform scales, potentially creating a supply squeeze if creator demand accelerates as predicted.

Traders are eyeing the token's ‘dual-threat' capability: it captures value from the AI boom, through features like AI influencer creation, and the Web3 payment revolution simultaneously. With multiple monetization routes (PPV, NFT sales, tipping) free from the ‘debanking' fear Dalio warns against, the valuation gap between SUBBD and legacy platforms looks interesting.

Frankly, as regulatory pressure mounts on traditional fintech, the premium on decentralized alternatives will likely expand.

A year ago, the most pro-crypto president in U.S. history had just returned to power after pandering to clueless retail crypto investors and receiving massive financial backing from semicorrupt crypto insiders. Donald Trump's second coming was supposed to be a new dawn for crypto, leading various self-dealing evangelists to predict that bitcoin would become “digital gold,” reaching at least $200,000 by the end of 2025.

As promised, Trump did gut most crypto regulations. He also signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stable Coins (GENIUS) Act; pushed for the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act; profited personally from shady domestic and foreign crypto deals; promoted his own useless meme coin; pardoned crypto crooks who had allegedly aided terrorist organizations; and hosted private dinners for crypto insiders at the White House.

Moreover, crypto was supposed to benefit from various macro and geopolitical risks, such as the ballooning of U.S. and other advanced economies' debt and deficits; the debasement of the dollar and other fiat currencies; new trade wars; and growing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, China and many others. Indeed, the heightened risk environment helps to explain why gold rose by over 60% in 2025.

Despite record transactions last year, most users prefer alternatives – while Beijing likely to maintain gradual expansion, analysts say

The slow uptake underscores that China still has a long way to go to realise its ambitions. Despite government and public sector incentives, such as issuing consumption coupons and tax rebates through the system, users have shown little motivation to embrace the digital currency.

Chloe Cui, an employee at a state-owned bank, is paid a portion of her salary in digital yuan – another initiative to expand domestic use. But every month, she transfers the money straight to her regular bank account. “I've never used [it] for payments. I only use it when receiving money,” she said.

The upgraded digital yuan would also incorporate more emerging technologies than the traditional monetary system, boosting digitisation across issuance, circulation and payment – a move analysts see as Beijing's answer to stablecoins.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"

EU lawmakers backed plans Tuesday for a digital euro, a project that has split the bloc but has gained greater urgency as Europe seeks to bolster its financial sovereignty.

Lawmakers voted in favour of two amendments to an annual report on the European Central Bank (ECB), expressing support for the introduction of the digital currency.

The electronic version of the money used in the 21-nation currency area would be available to use free of charge in shops, online or from person to person.

""The introduction of a digital euro... is essential to strengthen EU monetary sovereignty, reduce fragmentation in retail payments and support the integrity and resilience of the single market,"" one of the amendments said, approved by 438 lawmakers with 158 against.

First suggested by the ECB, the project has been some six years in the making.

The EU executive formally proposed a digital euro in June 2023 but any law to make it a reality needs the support of member states and European lawmakers.

EU countries in December gave their green light, putting pressure on lawmakers to grant their formal approval too.

Tuesday's vote is only an expression of support at this stage but shows where lawmakers currently stand on an issue that has divided Europe.

Supporters say it would let Europeans make online payments without relying on US card companies or payments systems -- as Europe ramps up efforts to break its dependence on foreign firms including US giants such as Visa and Mastercard.

Critics fear it would allow governments to surveil citizens' payments or even cut them off from the money supply.

ECB chief Christine Lagarde on Monday sought to assuage privacy fears, telling EU lawmakers that the bank ""would not have access to personal data"".

She also said it was in ""no way intended to replace cash"".

""Cash is queen,"" Lagarde said, as she urged lawmakers to move forward.

Lagarde also echoed sovereignty arguments, saying: ""It will be built on a fully European infrastructure, avoiding an excessive dependency on foreign providers for payment systems that are critical to the functioning of our economy.""

February 10, 2026


Bithumb mistakenly credited 620,000 “ghost Bitcoin” worth $40 billion during a promotion due to an employee entering Bitcoin instead of won (₩2,000/$1.37).
South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service launched on-site inspections and may open a formal investigation if legal violations are found.
Some customers sold 1,788 Bitcoin; the exchange recovered 93 per cent of the value and covered the remainder with its own assets.
Internal ledger processes enabled trades to execute despite limited actual holdings, exposing structural weaknesses in centralised exchange controls.
“It was nothing more than erroneously entered virtual data, yet it ended up being traded,” the Financial Supervisory Service governor Lee Chan-jin said.


South Korea is investigating how cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb initiated an exchange of $40 billion in Bitcoin that it apparently did not have.

The Seoul exchange started crediting customer accounts on February 6 with the digital currency rather than the 2,000 won ($1.37) per person authorised for a promotional campaign. The incident reportedly stemmed from an employee inputting the payout as Bitcoin rather than won.

In the 20 minutes it took to recognise the mistake, 620,000 “ghost Bitcoin” ($40 billion) – rather than 620,000 won ($423) – appeared across the balances of hundreds of customer accounts, according to Bithumb.

South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service said it was looking into the incident and had initiated on-site inspections, with a formal investigation to be initiated if legal violations are found.

“It was nothing more than erroneously entered virtual data, yet it ended up being traded,” FSS governor Lee Chan-jin said at a press conference on Monday. “That is the essence of the issue: the transaction was actually executed.”

Some customers immediately tried to sell the assets immediately, resulting in the sale of 1,788 Bitcoin. None of the tokens appeared to leave Bithumb, according to the exchange, but payouts were made. Bithumb said it had recovered 93 per cent of the value of those sales by Saturday in either won or other tokens.

The company added it had reconciled the remaining outstanding Bitcoin using its own assets.

The transfer orders of magnitude larger than what should have been possible happened because of a quirk in how centralised exchanges operate.

In the third quarter of 2025, Bithumb held just 175 Bitcoin on its balance sheet, while custodian holdings for clients totalled 42,619 Bitcoin, according to a regulatory filing.

Those balances, though, are tracked on an internal ledger instead of directly on the blockchain. Trades are initiated by updating the internal records first, while on-chain settlement comes later.

This makes trading fast, but it opens the door to big mistakes if internal book-keeping does not match an exchange's actual holdings.

“The so-called ghost Bitcoin incident clearly revealed that, beyond a mere input error, there are structural weaknesses in internal controls and ledger management systems of cryptocurrency exchanges,” Kim Jiho, a spokesperson for the ruling Democratic Party, said on Saturday. 

“This is an issue that cannot be taken lightly.”

Bithumb said it is taking corrective measures to tighten oversight of transfers, including a multilevel approval process for distributing awards.

“We will supplement previously missing processes to ensure that approvals are carried out in two or more stages, thereby preventing incidents,” the company said.

The response to the mistake has been swift. Regulators convened two emergency meetings over the weekend. DAXA, an alliance of South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, announced that it would conduct a review of internal controls across all exchanges.

Authorities are also pursuing new legislative measures requiring exchanges to establish internal controls similar to those for traditional financial institutions.

“The incident has exposed fundamental weaknesses in the virtual asset information system, specifically, regulatory blind spots that existed in virtual asset legislation,” the FSS's Mr Lee said. “This has identified a task that must be strongly reinforced in the second legislature phase of virtual assets.”

Bithumb is South Korea's second-largest exchange by trading volume, according to CoinGecko. The incident occurred during a particularly volatile week in cryptocurrency that saw Bitcoin fall to nearly $60,000, less than half its October peak above $126,000, before rebounding to roughly $70,000 by Monday.

Bitcoin's BTC$68,747.00 slide to around $60,000 earlier this month looked familiar, not to gold bugs, but to tech investors, crypto asset manager Grayscale said in a Monday report.

As high-growth software stocks sold off, bitcoin fell in near lockstep, reinforcing the view that, for now, the world's largest cryptocurrency trades more like an emerging technology than a mature store of value, the report said.

The cryptocurrency's design, capped supply, independence from governments and a resilient, decentralized network, gives it the long-term qualities of a store of value. But at just 17 years old, bitcoin is still early in its monetary journey, especially compared with gold's millennia-long history, the firm argued.

""Bitcoin can be considered a long-term store of value: the network will likely continue operating well beyond our lifetimes and the asset may retain its value in real terms,"" wrote head of research Zach Pandl.

The crypto's claim to being digital gold has looked increasingly thin in recent months. Rather than serving as a safe haven, it has fallen sharply from its highs and moved in tandem with risk assets as investors turned defensive. 

At the same time, physical gold has surged to record levels, drawing inflows just as bitcoin saw capital exit. The split has weakened the case that the cryptocurrency reliably holds value during market stress, suggesting that scarcity alone has yet to make it behave like gold when protection matters most.

Investing in bitcoin today is fundamentally a bet on adoption, Pandl said. Until bitcoin is widely accepted as a global monetary asset, its price will likely remain sensitive to risk appetite, rising and falling with growth-oriented portfolios rather than acting as a hedge during market stress.

Recent market mechanics support that view. The report pointed to U.S.-led selling pressure, outflows from spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a sharp deleveraging across crypto derivatives, signals that look more like a growth unwind than a crisis of confidence in the network itself.

Spot bitcoin ETFs have logged a sustained run of outflows, pointing to a cooling in institutional appetite. In recent weeks, U.S.-listed funds have shed hundreds of millions of dollars as investors pulled back amid market volatility and falling prices. The withdrawals have dragged down total assets under management and left many positions underwater, underscoring softer demand for ETF-based bitcoin exposure even as inflows continue elsewhere in crypto.

Looking ahead, Grayscale sees the foundations of a recovery forming beyond short-term price action. Regulatory momentum around stablecoins and tokenized assets, combined with continued innovation in blockchain infrastructure, could drive the next phase of adoption. Platforms such as Ethereum and Solana, along with middleware like Chainlink, stand to benefit, the firm said.

Bitcoin's own long-term test is still unfolding. Questions around scaling, fees and even quantum resistance loom large. But the report argued that if the crypto clears those hurdles, its volatility should fall, correlations with equities should fade and its behavior may eventually resemble gold's, just with a digital backbone.

Wall Street bank JPMorgan said the crypto's lower volatility relative to gold could make it ""more attractive"" in the long term.

Platforms such as Ethereum and Solana, along with middleware like Chainlink, stand to benefit, the firm said.

Bitcoin's own long-term test is still unfolding. Questions around scaling, fees and even quantum resistance loom large. But the report argued that if the crypto clears those hurdles, its volatility should fall, correlations with equities should fade and its behavior may eventually resemble gold's, just with a digital backbone.

Wall Street bank JPMorgan said the crypto's lower volatility relative to gold could make it ""more attractive"" in the long term.

If History Repeats, Investors Can See Supercharged Returns.","https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/10/sofi-stock-crypto-history-supercharged-returns/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:45:00 GMT","

This innovative fintech enterprise is going full steam ahead in the world of blockchain technology.

When asked what they see as the most innovative industries, investors probably won't pick financial services. But SoFi Technologies (SOFI +1.01%) is changing that narrative. Its monster growth proves how well it's resonating with customers.

The fintech stock is making an aggressive push into the cryptocurrency market. If history repeats, shareholders may enjoy supercharged returns.

Just in the final six months of 2025, SoFi made some big moves that indicate management's heightened focus on blockchain technology.

In August, SoFi announced an exciting partnership with Lightspark to offer a new capability. SoFi Pay customers can send fast and cheap cross-border payments to more than 30 countries within the app. These transactions use the Bitcoin Lightning network. 

With SoFi Crypto, the business launched crypto trading in November, allowing its members to buy, sell, and hold certain digital assets. This is the first time a nationally chartered, federally insured bank made such a move.

In December, SoFi introduced its fully reserved stablecoin, called SoFiUSD, leaning into one of the hottest trends in the digital asset industry. This initiative ""will enable SoFi to serve as a stablecoin infrastructure provider for banks, fintechs, and enterprise platforms,"" according to the press release.

""Blockchain is a technology super cycle that will fundamentally change finance, not just in payments, but across every area of money,"" Chief Executive Officer Anthony Noto said. He has high hopes. 

Looking ahead, crypto-backed lending, institutional trading and custody, and business banking are all focus areas. 

Critics can argue that SoFi is getting distracted by an unproven technology. Skeptics might say that the company should focus on core revenue generators. This includes lending and fee-based banking activities. But investors have to let the leadership team do what it thinks is best. After all, SoFi has been impressively successful up to this point. 

There is clearly upside for investors if things work out. The crypto market is currently in a downturn. Its market cap of $2.4 trillion is 44% below its peak from October (as of Feb. 9). However, the trailing five-year gain of 104% is still notable. 

Assuming the crypto market continues its long-term ascent and is much more valuable in five or 10 years, it puts SoFi in a wonderful position to drive durable growth. Should the digital asset ecosystem continue to grow, it will fuel confidence that the industry is here to stay, supporting the belief that blockchain technology has real use within financial services.

With more adoption of SoFi's related endeavors, the financials could get a boost, providing a tailwind to the stock price.

SoFi Technologies, best known for its digital banking, lending, and investing platform, is pushing deeper into digital assets through SoFi Crypto and SoFiUSD. For you as an investor, this means the business is expanding beyond its core of loans, deposits, and brokerage into on-platform crypto trading and blockchain based payment rails.

The move could allow SoFi to participate in demand for regulated access to crypto and stablecoins, an area many traditional banks have approached cautiously. As this develops, you may want to watch how SoFi integrates SoFiUSD across its products, how partners adopt its stablecoin infrastructure, and how regulators respond to a bank operated stablecoin model.

Stay updated on the most important news stories for SoFi Technologies by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on SoFi Technologies.

How SoFi Technologies stacks up against its biggest competitors

For SoFi, launching in-house crypto trading and SoFiUSD looks like an attempt to widen its role from consumer finance into digital asset infrastructure, putting it in a different lane to fintech peers like Block and Coinbase while still competing with platform-led players such as PayPal. Because SoFi is already a federally insured bank with an existing member base and technology platform, crypto trading and a fully reserved stablecoin can plug directly into lending, deposits, and payments. This may increase engagement and fee-based activity over time if member uptake and partner interest are strong.

These moves line up with the existing narrative that SoFi is trying to shift more of its mix toward capital-light, fee-based revenue and use new products such as blockchain-enabled services as extra growth levers alongside its loan platform and Galileo technology arm. For you, the key question is whether SoFiUSD and SoFi Crypto become meaningful extensions of that ecosystem or stay relatively niche compared to better-known services in payments and trading from PayPal, Block, and Coinbase.

From here, you may want to track member adoption of SoFi Crypto, real world payment or partner use cases for SoFiUSD, and any regulatory commentary that directly references bank issued stablecoins.

Kraken sacked its chief financial officer, Stephanie Lemmerman, just as the crypto exchange prepares to publicly list in the U.S. in the early part of this year, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Lemmerman joined Kraken from Dapper Labs in November 2024 and was the exchange's CFO for one year and four months. She now has a strategic advisory role at Kraken, one of the people said.

Robert Moore, formerly VP of business expansion, has basically taken over her job, the person said. An updated leadership page on the website of Kraken's parent company, Payward Inc., lists Moore as deputy CFO. Lemmerman does not appear.

Clearly it matters that Kraken has removed its CFO after lodging a confidential filing with U.S. regulators in November. That came just days after Kraken raised $800 million at a $20 billion valuation, including $200 million from Citadel Securities.

Other people who have been promoted to senior roles include Curtis Ting, who was made chief operating officer in December, and Kamo Asatryan was made chief data officer in January.

A second person familiar with the changes said finance at Kraken is changing to become more of a product than a back-office function.

Kraken declined to comment.

About a week ago, bitcoin BTC$68,747.00 dropped more than 10% in a day to around $60,000 before rebounding to $70,000 in recent days. The question is, did the slide mark ""capitulation,"" when holders panic-sell at a loss, exhaust bearish pressure and set the stage for a new bull run? 

The futures market says no, suggesting there's scope for another leg lower, according to Amberdata's director of derivatives, Greg Magadini.

""[The] lack of 'reaction' in the futures basis doesn't make me confident we hit a true CAPITULATION moment,"" Magadini said in a market note Monday.

Magadini is referring to how futures typically trade in relation to the spot price during bearish trends and capitulation phases.

Futures are standardised derivative contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset, like bitcoin, at a set price on a future date. Traders use futures to bet on price direction, buying contracts when they expect a rally or shorting when they anticipate a decline, without actually owning the asset itself.

The price difference, or basis, between futures and spot markets reveals market sentiment and trader positioning. When futures trade at a significant premium to spot prices, it signals bullish optimism among investors. Conversely, a discount indicates bearish pressure.​

Historically, bitcoin bear markets have tended to bottom out, with standard futures and perpetual futures trading at significant discounts to spot on major exchanges. These massive discounts represented capitulation and mark the final bear-market flush.

Last week, however, futures slipped into a discount only for a short time. 

""Although the 90-day basis dropped lower on each leg down for BTC, these moves barely ranged -100bps. Today, fixed basis remains around 4% for BTC (inline with risk-free treasury yields),"" Magadini said.

Compare that with the end of the 2022 bear market, when the 90-day futures traded at a 9% discount as the bitcoin price bottomed out below 20,000. So, if history is a guide, bitcoin could see another leg lower where futures traders capitulate, pushing prices into a steep discount relative to the spot price.

Bitcoin BTC$68,747.00 is struggling to regain a foothold above $70,000 as altcoins outperform.

The largest cryptocurrency is little changed over 24 hours, while the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 0.40% even as ether ETH$2,000.64 declined. Memecoins are leading gains, with the CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME) adding 1.5% as PIPPIN climbed 46%.

Tokens linked to artificial intelligence (AI) also fared well. WLD$0.3804, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, rose more than 3% in the past day, while Virtuals' VIRTUAL token rose 2.4%. That's as the ""agentic AI,"" where AI tools now also execute tasks, narrative grows.

Still, the crypto Fear and Greed Index still points to “extreme fear” in the market after last week's selloff.

Meanwhile, traditional markets steadied, buoyed in part by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory in Japan. While Japanese bond yields rose after the result, they have since fallen near to pre-election levels.

For the first time in nearly a month, U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded back-to-back net inflows, snapping a redemption streak that stretched back to mid-January. 

According to SoSo value data, the consecutive inflows shift began on Friday with $471.1 million in fresh capital, followed by a $144.9 million on Monday. This  comes as bitcoin bounced back from Thursday's $60,000 low to around $70,000.

In mid-January, bitcoin peaked near $98,000 after a two week rally that started at $87,000. The subsequent sell-off to $60,000 saw investors yank millions of these spot ETFs. 

Broadly speaking, investors still appear confidence about the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects, as evident from the spot ETFs' resilient asset under management (AUM).

Bitcoin's Fear & Greed sentiment indicator fell to its lowest ever level, leading some analysts to suggest that $60,000 was the bottom for BTC. Does historical data agree?

 Cointelegraph in your social feed 

Bitcoin (BTC) pushed back above $71,000 on Monday, after market sentiment indicators across the crypto market dropped to new lows. 

Some analysts believed that “extreme fear” and upside liquidity may help Bitcoin hold above its yearly-low at $60,000, but others warned that weak market conditions and bearish futures volume may push prices even lower.

Key takeaways:

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to a record low of 7, showing extreme fear in the market.

More than $5.5 billion in short liquidations above current prices may fuel a rebound.

Weak price trends and rising derivatives selling may still drag Bitcoin below $60,000.

MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe said Bitcoin is flashing sentiment readings that have previously marked market bottoms. According to Van De Poppe, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index had dropped to 5 over the weekend (final recorded reading is 7), its lowest reading in history, while the daily relative strength index (RSI) for BTC has fallen to 15, signaling deeply oversold conditions.

These levels were last seen during the 2018 bear market and the March 2020 COVID-19 crash. Van de Poppe said such conditions may allow BTC to recover and avoid an immediate retest of the $60,000 level.

CoinGlass data adds to the bullish case. Bitcoin's liquidation heatmap shows over $5.45 billion in cumulative short liquidations positioned if the price moves roughly $10,000 higher, compared with $2.4 billion in liquidations on a retest of $60,000. 

This imbalance suggests that an upward move may trigger forced shorts covering, leading to a BTC rally.

Data from CryptoQuant shows Bitcoin trading below its 50-day moving average near $87,000, while further below the 200-day moving average around $102,000. This wide gap reflects a corrective or “repricing” phase following the prior rally.

CryptoQuant's Price Z-Score is also negative at -1.6, indicating BTC is trading below its statistical mean, a sign of selling pressure and trend exhaustion. Such conditions have preceded extended base-building rather than immediate rebounds.

Crypto analyst Darkfost highlighted a growing selling dominance in the derivatives markets. Monthly net taker volume has turned sharply negative at -$272 million on Sunday, while Binance's taker buy-sell ratio has slipped below 1, signaling a strong selling pressure. 

With futures volumes outweighing spot flows at the moment, stronger spot demand is needed to trigger a bullish reaction from BTC.

Adding a longer-term caution, Bitcoin investor Jelle noted that past Bitcoin bear market bottoms formed below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. For the current cycle, that level sits near $57,000, with deeper downside scenarios extending toward $42,000 if history repeats.

SEAL and the Ethereum Foundation created a Trillion Dollar Security dashboard to track Ethereum security as part of efforts to fight wallet drainers.

 Cointelegraph in your social feed 

The Ethereum Foundation is sponsoring crypto security nonprofit Security Alliance (SEAL) to “track and neutralize” crypto drainers and other social engineering attackers targeting Ethereum users.

SEAL said on Monday that it launched the “Trillion Dollar Security” initiative with EF to support these efforts after reaching out to EF late last year about funding security engineers to more closely track drainer development and protect against wide-scale attacks.

The EF is now sponsoring a security engineer whose “sole mission” is to work with SEAL's intelligence team to combat drainers targeting Ethereum users, said SEAL.

SEAL's broader mission is to protect crypto market participants by providing collaborative tools for threat intelligence sharing and incident response while providing legal protection for its white-hat hackers.

“The Security Alliance has done important work to combat attacks and the ecosystem has benefited tremendously,” The Ethereum Foundation posted to X in response to SEAL's announcement.

Phishing scammers and drainers often create fake websites or fraudulent emails that impersonate legitimate crypto protocols, tricking users into approving seemingly harmless wallet transactions that can result in the loss of funds.

Their tactics have become increasingly sophisticated over the years, prompting the need for improved detection and prevention mechanisms.

Crypto intelligence platform ScamSniffer estimates that these scammers have stolen nearly $1 billion in crypto over the years. However, efforts from SEAL and other crypto sleuths helped bring that tally down to $84 million in 2025, an all-time low.

SEAL and the EF created a Trillion Dollar Security dashboard to track Ethereum's security across six dimensions: user experience, smart contracts, infrastructure and cloud, consensus protocol, monitoring and incident response, social layer and governance.

Each dimension includes eight to 29 risk controls being closely monitored, along with identified “priority work” that must be addressed.

SEAL said the partnership with the EF is the first of many planned initiatives with other forward-thinking ecosystems, welcoming other crypto ecosystems to reach out:

“If your foundation or crypto ecosystem is interested in similar sponsorship opportunities, we're happy to discuss how this model protects users at scale,” SEAL said.

The quirky geology behind Olympic curling stones

The rocks used in the Olympic sport of curling come from one island in Scotland and one quarry in Wales. What makes them so special?

By Andrea Thompson edited by Seth Fletcher

From skating to curling, the thrilling sports of the Winter Olympics have plenty of science behind them. Follow our coverage here to learn more.

Athletes often have specialized equipment or apparel to make them run, swim, skate or ski their best, but curling takes things to another level. Curling rocks—as the round, roughly 40-pound stones are called—only come from two places on the planet: a little island in Scotland called Ailsa Craig and the Trefor granite quarry in Wales.

But what makes the rocks from these places uniquely suited for sliding across a rectangular slab of ice toward a bullseye target? And are these really the only places to find suitable stones?

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

To find out, Scientific American spoke with Derek Leung of the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, a mineralogist and avid curler who used to compete for Team Hong Kong. Leung has married his two interests by doing the first mineralogical analyses of curling rocks since 1890. “It's been more than a hundred years since we had looked at them,” he says, so he wanted to see what modern science could tell us.

But before we get into that, let's go over the two main parts of a curling rock: the running surface and the striking surface. The former is a ring on the bottom of the rock that skids across the ice, and the latter is a band around the sides of the rock that collides with other rocks (ideally knocking an opponent's rock off the bull's-eye or nudging your team's closer to it).

Derek Leung

Each surface needs specific properties to do its job. This is where Ailsa Craig and the Trefor quarry come in. The former has been used for curling stones since the early 19th century; the latter since curling grew in popularity after World War II.

Each place has two types of rock used for curling stones: Ailsa Craig common green and Ailsa Craig blue hone, and blue Trefor and red Trefor. All four types are granitoids, which are igneous rocks, meaning they form as magma or lava cools and crystalizes. Ailsa Craig's rocks formed around 60 million years ago when magma pushed into a relatively shallow layer of the Earth's crust during the rifting that formed the Atlantic Ocean. Trefor's formed around 400 to 500 million years ago during a mountain-building event called the Caledonian Orogeny. Both are, geologically speaking, fairly young. “Having a young rock is probably a good thing because it means that it's less likely to have incurred stresses related to different tectonic events” before it is subjected to the stresses of curling, Leung says.

Common wisdom has held that rocks from these two sources were ideal because they contained very little quartz, a brittle, silica-based mineral that would be less than ideal for expensive stones constantly knocking into each other. (Curling stones cost around $600 a pop, and they're typically used for 50 to 70 years.) But Leung found that in fact all four rocks contain quartz. Yet under the microscope, “I found almost no fractures,” he says, likely because of their young age.

Ailsa Craig blue hone is commonly used for the running surface; manufacturers cut a circle out of the bottom of the main rock and insert a disk of blue hone. Leung found that blue hone has small, fairly uniform grain sizes. This is ideal for decades of sliding across the ice, because bigger mineral grains are more likely to get plucked out by the ice, leaving holes in the surface that could cause unpredictable behavior. Blue hone is also relatively nonporous, which means water from the ice is less likely to get in and cause fractures.

For the striking surface, on the other hand, “you want to have larger differences in grain size,” Leung says, because “it prevents certain types of damage from occurring” when the stones collide. Ailsa Craig common green, blue Trefor and red Trefor are all good for this, which is why they're used for the main rock; the striking surface is created by carving the main rock. The rocks for the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics will be made of Ailsa Craig common green and use blue hone for the running surface.

In principle, there's no reason rock from other places couldn't work for curling. After all, when that 1890 study was conducted, curlers used stone from all around Scotland, the sport's birthplace. Ailsa Craig and the Trefor granite quarry probably became the go-to sources over time through some combination of their performance characteristics, tradition and standardization. And blasting is no longer allowed at Ailsa Craig, a now-uninhabited bird sanctuary, so another source would help keep curling clubs stocked in the future.

This is something Leung hopes to work on. An effort in Canada in the 1950s failed because the very black, igneous rock called anorthosite that was quarried from Northern Ontario started chipping soon after use. But with better knowledge of what rock works best, it might be possible to find a new source. “We could look for rocks that are formed in a similar environment as Ailsa Craig,” Leung says—maybe Nova Scotia, which is on the opposite side of the Atlantic rifting event that made the granitoids found in Ailsa Craig.

He hopes one day to work with quarries to get samples to analyze. If he finds any likely candidates, he would love to get them made into curling rocks and try throwing them down the ice to see what happens.

Rules of mysterious ancient Roman board game decoded by AI

A Roman stone board game has been unplayable since its discovery more than a century ago, but AI might have just worked out the rules

It was the summer of 2020, and researcher Walter Crist was wandering around the exhibits inside a Dutch museum dedicated to the presence of the ancient Roman empire in the Netherlands. As a scientist who studies ancient board games, one exhibit stuck out to Crist: a stone game board dating to the late Roman Empire. It was about eight inches across and etched with angular lines that roughly formed the shape of an oblong octagon inside a rectangle.

“I thought to myself, ‘Well, that's very interesting,' because the pattern on it—it's not something I had ever seen in the literature before,” Crist says.

What the game was called and how it was played were a mystery, too.

Crist contacted the museum curators to get a closer look. And now he and his colleagues believe they've decoded the game in a first-of-its-kind study using a combination of more traditional archaeological methods and artificial intelligence. According to the analysis, the object appears to be a sort of “blocking game.” In these types of games, one player tries to block another from moving; one example is tic-tac-toe.

The research was published on Monday in the journal Antiquity.

Crist, now a guest lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, recalls that when he and his team started investigating the board game, they didn't have a ton of details to work with. They knew that the game board had been found around the late 1800s or early 1900s in the southeastern Netherlands' city of Heerlen—which would have been the city of Coriovallum in Roman times. The board was made out limestone that was imported from France. And the game was likely played casually and may not have been particularly notable, in part because there is no known documentation of it in written texts from the time.

To decipher the rules, Crist's team programmed two AI agents to play the game over and over again using more than 100 different sets of rules taken from other known European games, both ancient and modern. As the AI agents played—1,000 games per set of rules—the researchers tracked how the pieces moved. Then they compared the moves with the levels of wear on areas of the board, tracing which gameplay seemed to replicate grooves on the stone.

The team found nine rule sets that appeared “consistent” with the wear on the board. “And they were all variations of this same kind of blocking game,” Crist says.

This type of game was played in the 19th and 20th centuries in Scandinavia, and researchers thought it dated to early medieval times. But the Roman game is the earliest example of such a game in Europe, Crist says. He and his team called the game Ludus Coriovalli, Latin for “the game from Coriovallum.” (You can play it online here.)

Crist et al./Antiquity

Crist hopes the study will help researchers solve other ancient board games. Such games offer a way to connect the ancient past to our own lives, he says. Indeed, they haven't changed much over the centuries. The ancient Egyptian board game Senet, for example, might not have been all that different from Sorry! Chess, meanwhile, is thought to have originated in ancient India, and nobody really knows when or where backgammon originated.

Understanding how ancient games might've been played, Crist says, “can lead us to new insights on how people in the past enjoyed their lives.”

What came before the big bang?

Physicists cannot access anything that existed before the start of time and space, but they have theories

By Sarah Scoles edited by Clara Moskowitz

The big bang wasn't a bang in the traditional sense—but it was nonetheless the start of important things: for one, space; another, time. Thirdly, it began the conditions and processes that eventually resulted in us humans, who can sit here and wonder about space and time. The big bang was, effectively, the beginning of the universe. According to the logic of human brains, it seems like there must have been something before the big bang, even if “before” is the wrong word because there was no time until after.

The good news for us is that physicists do have ways of thinking about—and even empirically studying—the origins of the origin of the universe. Counterintuitive and impossible as it may seem, cosmologists are even making progress in determining which wild ideas might peel back the veil on that early era, even though it remains inaccessible to telescopes.

For millennia, what happened before and at the beginning of the universe was not a question scientists could even scratch at. Cosmological queries were the dominion of philosophers, says Jenann Ismael—herself a philosopher of physics at Johns Hopkins University. The most fundamental query, of course, is where we come from—a question as popular among philosophers as it is with the rest of us. Other questions, Ismael says, include doozies such as “What are space and time? Does time have a beginning? Does space have boundaries?”

Even after cosmology became a hard science, the field was a bit sketchy, Ismael says. “The science was one-and-a-half facts,” she adds. The sentiment, she says, is usually attributed to physicist James Jeans. But that has changed in the past century or so as the philosophers' musings have wandered into the realm of theory, experiment and data. “These old conceptual questions are arising in ways that have new angles, a new spin and a new framework,” Ismael continues.

It's unclear whether science as a discipline—and scientists as people—will ever be able to answer some questions definitively. After all, no one can “see” before the big bang, and no one will ever be able to—at least not directly. But the current and future universe, researchers are learning, may contain clues about the distant past.

And as scientists push the boundaries of what can be known, they are testing their theories about the before before—the only way to get closer to potential truth. “I'm happy to listen to any framework, but I only start taking it seriously when it produces a clean observational target that a real instrument can go after,” says Brian Keating, a cosmologist at the University of California, San Diego. “If there isn't a discriminant you can measure, you're doing metaphysics with equations.”

Here are three ideas that he and other scientists take seriously about the cosmos's ultimate origins.

Quantum mechanics is the physics of the extremely small, ruled by statistics and uncertainty. It's also what may have shaped the early universe. To understand the quantum cosmos, scientists calculate the probability of a given output from a certain input.

In cosmology, the “output” is the universe as it looks today. “The question is: What should the input be?” says Jean-Luc Lehners, former head of the Theoretical Cosmology group at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) in Germany.

Physicists can break up the problem into chunks of outputs and inputs. If they consider the modern universe to be the output, they can try to figure out what input might have produced it. Then they can step backward by taking that input as a new output and determine what conditions earlier in the universe might have produced that state, and so on. They can theoretically (if they have a lot of time on their hands) do that forever, going in steps to reach the before before—and even before that.

That infinite regression, however, didn't make sense to physicists Stephen Hawking and James Hartle, who worked on the question together in the 1980s. They decided to eliminate the universe's ultimate input—its “beginning.” Instead they formed a model of the universe called the no-boundary proposal. They suggested time and space form a closed, rounded surface: a four-dimensional hemisphere of spacetime.

Does that not make sense? Try this: imagine the universe like the globe of Earth. The big bang is the North Pole. There is no “before” it, just as there is no north of north. Before becomes irrelevant as a concept. “It's almost like a Zen idea,” Lehners says. And it's one he's toying with in calculations to see if he can re-create the universe we see today from a round place with no north of north.

“The no-boundary proposal has a decent amount of support, or at least interest, within the physics community,” says Sean Carroll, a professor of natural philosophy at Johns Hopkins University. He notes that some scientists worry about how well-defined the idea is, but he finds it to be a “natural starting point,” given what we know about quantum gravity.

Paul Steinhardt, a physicist at Princeton University, has another idea about what happened before the universe as we know it began. It stands in opposition to an idea that he helped shape: this concept suggests that, after the big bang, spacetime expanded very quickly for a very short period of time called inflation. The inflation scenario is meant to explain why the universe looks flat and similar in every place our telescopes can look.

After helping to establish inflation theory, however, Steinhardt started doubt the idea—in part because it has required constant tweaking to keep it consistent with our measurements of the cosmos. “It's really hard to think of a historical example where that actually led to what turns out to be the right answer,” Steinhardt says. “Almost always, that's a sign that the Titanic is sinking.”

Time to get in a lifeboat, he thought. So he came up with a cyclic universe: one that balloons significantly in size, as ours seems to be doing now, then shrinks a little and then starts expanding all over again. “When people think about contracting universes, they're usually thinking about things coming to a crunch,” Steinhardt says—the cosmos collapsing back down into an infinitesimally small point. That's not what Steinhardt is talking about: he thinks the universe perhaps contracts slowly—to a smaller fraction of its size but not to nothing. That shrinking smooths things out in ways inflation fails to explain, he says, while still producing a cosmos that appears flat and the same in all directions.

Steinhardt adds that what looks like a big bang is actually not: the universe expands, then slowly contracts and then quickly goes back to expanding. The fast transition between contraction and expansion is not a bang but a “big bounce.”

Steinhardt hopes to test this idea not just by examining the past but also by taking data from the present and watching the future carefully. “It makes an obvious prediction, which is that the current phase of accelerated expansion can't continue forever,” Steinhardt says. “It must end.” This idea, in turn, raises a new question: “Could it already be in the process of ending now?” he asks.

Our measurements about how the universe is expanding come from relatively faraway objects that emitted their light a long time ago. Things could have changed, and we might not know yet because the effects would be hard to measure. “We'd have to look at objects very close by in order to detect it,” Steinhardt says. That's not cosmologists' forte, and they would have to develop new techniques and instruments to look nearby for such effects.

Even more intriguingly, Steinhardt says that because “nothing bad happens to space” during the contraction and bounce, information—even objects such as black holes—can pass from before the bounce to after. “There might be things in our observable universe which are from before,” he says. Keep an eye out.

Another big idea about the before before is of interest to Latham Boyle, a researcher at the Higgs Center for Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh, who was formerly Steinhardt's graduate student. Like the big bounce concept, Boyle's favored proposal is pretty simple conceptually—and it similarly eschews inflation. “There's the universe after the big bang and the universe before the big bang,” he says, “and they're kind of mirror copies of one another.”

Picture this, Boyle says, like the points of two ice cream cones touching each other, with their contact representing the big bang. “Time marches away from the big bang in both directions,” he says. On our side, it goes forward; on the mirror side, it goes backward. What happened before the big bang is the reflected opposite of what happened after. And that doesn't just include time: here, there is matter; there, there is antimatter. Here, left is left; there, left is right.

Boyle has ideas for observations that could support (or nullify) his theory, which is called the CPT-symmetric (charge-parity-time-symmetric) universe. For one, a CPT-symmetric universe wouldn't have sent gravitational waves shimmering through space from the beginning of the universe, as classical cosmology theories predict. Astronomers have been hunting for such signals. If these waves are eventually detected, that would rule this idea out.

Boyle's hypothesis also predicts that dark matter could be explained by a particular kind of neutrino. He hopes cosmological instruments will reveal more information about neutrinos soon. The model's connection to particle physics, among other aspects, makes this idea intriguing, Carroll says.

“What I like here is the economy,” Keating says, “and the fact that it sticks its neck out,” focusing on the kinds of specific, physical predictions experimentalists like him need.

Each of these scientists is attached to their own idea. But Lehners, interviewed late last year, isn't confident any of them will stand the test of time—whatever time is. “I think it's completely preposterous that, in the year 2025, we should understand the beginning of the universe,” he says. “Why not in the year 2,000,025 or whatever?”

And even if researchers think they are getting close, they could be approaching a false summit: that frustrating place that looks, when you're hiking, like the top of the mountain but is actually a mere bump blocking your view of the true peak—or your view of what you think is the true peak but is, in fact, just another bump. “In general, I think that it's extremely plausible that there was something before the big bang,” Carroll says, “but it's also very plausible that the big bang was truly the beginning. There's too much we're just unsure about, and I am a bit skeptical that the state of the art is good enough to allow us to draw any firm experimental or observational conclusions out of any of these models.”

But cosmologists aren't studying the ultimate origins because they think the mystery will be resolved in their lifetime. Lehner imagines himself as part of an intergenerational project helping humanity trek closer and closer to a truth we may never find.

Studying such a physically and philosophically inaccessible topic is fundamentally different from other types of science—those quests at least exist in our plane of space and time. It almost seems like the question isn't actually within the realm of science. But science often involves probing things we cannot access, at least at the start, philosopher of physics Ismael says. Scientists predicted atoms before we could see them, and black holes and dark matter still lie beyond our ability to detect directly—yet investigating them is clearly scientific. “I think the benchmark for what counts as science has moved,” she says. And it will continue to—including, perhaps, backward to the before that may not be a before.

One of the most striking findings in spintronics is unusual magnetoresistance (UMR). In this effect, the electrical resistance of a heavy metal changes when it is placed next to a magnetic insulator and the direction of magnetization rotates within a plane perpendicular to the flow of electric current. This behavior played a key role in shaping the concept of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), which became the dominant explanation for UMR. Over time, SMR has been widely used to interpret results from many types of experiments, including magnetoresistance measurements, spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, harmonic Hall voltage studies, magnetic field sensors, and switching of magnetization or Néel vectors.

As more experiments were carried out, researchers noticed something puzzling. UMR showed up in nearly all magnetic systems, even in cases where no spin Hall material was present. The effect was also detected in systems where SMR theory clearly does not apply (e.g., those without a spin Hall effect). To address these inconsistencies, scientists proposed a growing list of alternative explanations tied to spin currents or related effects. These included Rashba-Edelstein MR, spin-orbit MR, anomalous Hall MR, orbital Hall MR, crystal-symmetry MR, orbital Rashba-Edelstein MR, and Hanle MR. Each was designed to account for the ""SMR-like"" signals observed in specific experimental setups.

A New Experimental Answer Emerges

More recently, Prof. Lijun Zhu of the Institute of Semiconductors at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof. Xiangrong Wang of the Chinese University of Hong Kong presented clear experimental evidence pointing to a different origin of universal UMR. Their work shows that the effect arises from how electrons scatter at interfaces, with this scattering controlled by both the magnetization and the electric field at the interface. This process is known as two-vector magnetoresistance. Crucially, this explanation does not rely on spin currents, which removes many of the complications found in earlier models.

Their experiments revealed that very large UMR signals can appear even in single-layer magnetic metals. They also found that the effect includes higher-order contributions and follows a universal sum rule. All of these observations closely match what the two-vector MR model predicts, without the need to invoke spin-current-based mechanisms.

Reinterpreting Decades of Experimental Data

The researchers also carried out a careful review of previous studies. This reanalysis showed that many influential experimental results once attributed to spin Hall magnetoresistance or other spin-current-related, or even unrelated, mechanisms can be consistently explained using the two-vector MR framework. In addition, they highlighted several experimental and theoretical findings that directly conflict with spin-current-based MR models but are naturally explained by the two-vector approach.

A Challenge to a Long-Standing Theory

Together, these results pose a serious challenge to the long-accepted SMR theory. They provide the first strong experimental confirmation of the two-vector magnetoresistance model and establish a single, universal physical explanation for UMR. By doing so, the work offers a simpler and more comprehensive way to understand magnetoresistance across a wide range of spintronic systems.

This research was recently published in National Science Review under the title ""Physics Origin of Universal Unusual Magnetoresistance.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","AI reads brain MRIs in seconds and flags emergencies","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210005419.htm","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 06:05:48 GMT","

A newly developed artificial intelligence system from the University of Michigan can analyze brain MRI scans and deliver a diagnosis in a matter of seconds, according to a new study. The model identified neurological conditions with accuracy reaching 97.5% and was also able to assess how urgently patients needed medical care.

Researchers say this first-of-its-kind technology has the potential to reshape how brain imaging is handled across health systems in the United States. The findings were published in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

""As the global demand for MRI rises and places significant strain our physicians and health systems, our AI model has potential to reduce burden by improving diagnosis and treatment with fast, accurate information,"" said senior author Todd Hollon, M.D., a neurosurgeon at University of Michigan Health and assistant professor of neurosurgery at U-M Medical School.

Testing the Prima AI System

Hollon named the new technology Prima. Over a one-year period, his research team evaluated the system using more than 30,000 MRI studies.

Across more than 50 different radiologic diagnoses involving major neurological disorders, Prima delivered stronger diagnostic performance than other advanced AI models. In addition to identifying disease, the system also proved capable of determining which cases required higher priority.

Certain neurological conditions, including strokes and brain hemorrhages, demand immediate medical attention. Hollon said that in these situations, Prima can automatically alert health care providers so action can be taken quickly.

The system was designed to notify the most appropriate subspecialist, such as a stroke neurologist or neurosurgeon. Feedback becomes available immediately after a patient completes imaging.

""Accuracy is paramount when reading a brain MRI, but quick turnaround times are critical for timely diagnosis and improved outcomes,"" said Yiwei Lyu, M.S., co-first author and postdoctoral fellow of Computer Science and Engineering at U-M.

""At key steps in the process, our results show how Prima can improve workflows and streamline clinical care without abandoning accuracy.""

What Is Prima?

Prima is classified as a vision language model (VLM), a type of artificial intelligence that can process images, video, and text together in real time. While artificial intelligence has been applied to MRI analysis before, researchers say Prima takes a different approach.

Earlier models were typically trained on carefully selected subsets of MRI data and designed to perform narrow tasks, such as identifying lesions or estimating dementia risk. Prima was trained on a much broader dataset.

Hollon's team used every available MRI collected since radiology records were digitized at University of Michigan Health. This included more than 200,000 MRI studies and 5.6 million imaging sequences. The model also incorporated patients' clinical histories and the reasons physicians ordered each imaging study.

""Prima works like a radiologist by integrating information regarding the patient's medical history and imaging data to produce a comprehensive understanding of their health,"" said co-first author Samir Harake, a data scientist in Hollon's Machine Learning in Neurosurgery Lab.

""This enables better performance across a broad range of prediction tasks.""

Addressing MRI Delays and Radiology Shortages

Each year, millions of MRI scans are performed worldwide, many of them focused on neurological disease. Researchers say the demand for these scans is growing faster than the availability of neuroradiology services.

This imbalance has contributed to staffing shortages, diagnostic delays, and errors. Depending on where a patient receives a scan, results may take days or even longer to return.

""Whether you are receiving a scan at a larger health system that is facing increasing volume or a rural hospital with limited resources, innovative technologies are needed to improve access to radiology services,"" said Vikas Gulani, M.D. Ph.D., co-author and chair of the Department of Radiology at U-M Health.

""Our teams at University of Michigan have collaborated to develop a cutting-edge solution to this problem with tremendous, scalable potential.""

The Future of AI in Medical Imaging

Although Prima performed strongly, researchers emphasize that the work is still in an early evaluation phase. Future research will focus on incorporating more detailed patient information and electronic medical record data to further improve diagnostic accuracy.

This approach mirrors how radiologists and physicians interpret MRIs and other imaging studies in real clinical settings. While artificial intelligence is already used in health care, most existing systems are limited to narrowly defined tasks.

Hollon describes Prima as ""ChatGPT for medical imaging,"" noting that similar technology could eventually be adapted for other imaging types, including mammograms, chest X-rays and ultrasounds.

""Like the way AI tools can help draft an email or provide recommendations, Prima aims to be a co-pilot for interpreting medical imaging studies,"" Hollon said.

""We believe that Prima exemplifies the transformative potential of integrating health systems and AI-driven models to improve health care through innovation.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New research reveals humans could have as many as 33 senses","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208233832.htm","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 01:58:20 GMT","

When we spend hours focused on screens, it is easy to forget that our bodies are constantly processing far more than images and noise. Yet our senses are always active. When we slow down or become more aware, we notice the texture of surfaces, the tension in our muscles, or the softness of food in our hands.Even routine moments are filled with sensation. In the morning, you may feel the sharpness of toothpaste, hear and feel water running in the shower, smell shampoo, and later take in the comforting scent of freshly brewed coffee.

Rethinking the Five Senses

Aristotle famously described five senses, but he also believed the universe was made of five elements, an idea modern science has long rejected. Today, research suggests his sensory framework may be just as incomplete. Scientists now believe humans may possess dozens of distinct senses.Nearly everything we experience is multisensory. We do not process sight, sound, smell, and touch in isolation. Instead, they blend together into a single, unified experience of the world and of our own bodies.

How the Senses Influence One Another

What we feel affects what we see and what we see affects what we hear. Different odors in shampoo can affect how you perceive the texture of hair. The fragrance of rose makes hair seem silkier, for instance.

Odors in low-fat yogurts can make them feel richer and thicker on  the palate without adding more emulsifiers. Perception of odors in the mouth, rising to the nasal passage, are modified by the viscosity of the liquids we consume.

How Many Senses Do Humans Have

My long-term collaborator, professor Charles Spence from the  Crossmodal Laboratory in Oxford, told me his neuroscience colleagues believe there are anywhere between 22 and 33 senses.

These include proprioception, which enables us to know where our limbs are without looking at them. Our sense of balance draws on the vestibular system of ear canals as well as sight and proprioception.

Another example is interoception, by which we sense changes in our  own bodies such as a slight increase in our heart rate and hunger. We  also have a sense of agency when moving our limbs: a feeling that can go  missing in stroke patients who sometimes even believe someone else is moving their arm.

There is the sense of ownership. Stroke patients sometimes feel their, for instance, arm is not their own even though they may still feel sensations in it.

Taste Is Not a Single Sense

Some of the traditional senses are combinations of several senses.  Touch, for instance involves pain, temperature, itch and tactile  sensations. When we taste something  we are actually experiencing a combination of three senses: touch,  smell and taste – or gustation – which combine to produce the flavors  we perceive in food and drinks.

Gustation, covers sensations produced by receptors on the tongue that  enable us to detect salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami (savory). What  about mint, mango, melon, strawberry, raspberry?

We don't have raspberry receptors on the tongue, nor is raspberry  flavor some combination of sweet, sour and bitter. There is no taste  arithmetic for fruit flavors.

Why Smell Dominates Flavor

We perceive them through the combined workings of the tongue and the nose. It is smell that contributes the lion's share to what we call tasting.

This is not inhaling odors from the environment, though. Odor  compounds are released as we chew or sip, traveling from the mouth to  the nose though the nasal pharynx at the back of throat.

Touch plays its part too,  binding tastes and smells together and fixing our preferences for runny  or firm eggs, and the velvety, luxuriousness gooeyness of chocolate.

When Balance Changes What You See

Sight is influenced by our vestibular system. When you are on board  an aircraft on the ground, look down the cabin. Look again when you are  in the climb.

It will “look” to you as though the front of the cabin is higher than  you are, although optically, everything is in the same relation to you  as it was on the ground. What you “see” is the combined effect of sight  and your ear canals telling you that you are titling backwards.

Exploring the Science of the Senses

The senses offer a rich seam of research and philosophers,  neuroscientists and psychologists work together at the Centre for the  Study of the Senses at the University of London's School of Advanced  Study.

In 2013, the center launched its Rethinking the Senses project,  directed by my colleague, the late Professor Sir Colin Blakemore. We  discovered how modifying the sound of your own footsteps can make your  body feel lighter or heavier.

We learned how audioguides in Tate Britain art museum that address  the listener as if the model in a portrait was speaking enable visitors  to remember more visual details of the painting. We discovered how  aircraft noise interferes with our perception of taste and why you  should always drink tomato juice on a plane.

Why Tomato Juice Tastes Better on a Plane

While our perception of salt, sweet and sour is reduced in the  presence of white noise, umami is not, and tomatoes, and tomato juice is  rich in umami. This means the aircraft's noise will taste enhance the savory flavor.

Seeing Sensory Illusions for Yourself

At our latest interactive exhibition, Senses Unwrapped  at Coal Drops Yard in London's King's Cross, people can discover for  themselves how their senses work and why they don't work as we think  they do.

Pausing to Notice the Senses

For example, the size-weight illusion is illustrated by a set of  small, medium and large curling stones. People can lift each one and  decide which is heaviest. The smallest one feels heaviest, but people  can them place them on balancing scales and discover that they are all  the same weight.

But there are always plenty of things around you to show how  intricate your senses are, if you only pause for a moment to take it all  in. So next time you walk outside or savor a meal, take a moment to  appreciate how your senses are working together to help you feel all the  sensations involved.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find a clue to human brain evolution in finger length","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210040559.htm","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:44:33 GMT","

Human evolution is closely tied to a steady increase in brain size. New research suggests this expansion may be partly influenced by levels of estrogen before birth, with an unexpected indicator found in the length of our fingers.

Professor John Manning, part of Swansea's Applied Sports, Technology, Exercise and Med-icine (A-STEM) research team, has spent years studying what is known as digit ratio. This measure compares the length of the index finger to the ring finger, a relationship called the 2D:4D ratio. Scientists have shown that this ratio reflects the balance of estrogen and testosterone a fetus is exposed to during the first trimester of pregnancy.

When prenatal estrogen levels are higher relative to testosterone, the index finger tends to be longer than the ring finger. In these cases, the 2D:4D value is considered high.

Newborn Measurements and Brain Size

In his latest study, Professor Manning worked with researchers from Istanbul University's Department of Anthropology. Their findings were recently published in the journal Early Human Development.

Because head circumference in newborns is strongly linked to brain size and later measures of intelligence, the research team examined both finger ratios and head size in a group of 225 newborns. The group included 100 boys and 125 girls.

The results showed a clear pattern in boys. Higher 2D:4D ratios, which point to greater prenatal estrogen exposure, were associated with larger head circumference. This relationship did not appear in girls.

Evolutionary Tradeoffs and Health Implications

Professor Manning explained the broader significance of the findings. ""This finding is relevant to human evolution because increases in brain size are found alongside feminization of the skeleton, what is known as the estrogenized ape hypothesis. High values of 2D:4D in males have been found to be related to elevated rates of heart problems, poor sperm counts and predisposition to schizophrenia.

""However, increases in brain size may offset these problems. Thus, the evolutionary drive for larger brains in humans may inevitably be linked to reductions in male viability including cardiovascular problems, infertility and rates of schizophrenia.""

The researchers say the study adds to growing evidence that prenatal estrogen has played a positive role in shaping the evolution of the human brain, even if it came with biological costs.

A Broader Pattern in Digit Ratio Research

Professor Manning's earlier work has also linked digit ratio to a wide range of outcomes. Past studies have explored connections between finger length and alcohol consumption, recovery after Covid-19 infection, and oxygen use in football players. Together, this research highlights how a simple anatomical trait may reflect powerful influences during early human development.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This common tomato nutrient may help prevent severe gum disease","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208233841.htm","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 09:58:36 GMT","

A recent study suggests that older Americans who do not get enough lycopene in their diets face a much higher risk of developing severe periodontitis. The analysis focused on U.S. adults ages 65 to 79 and found that risk levels varied by both race and sex. The findings were published in The Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging.

The research was led by Katherine Kwong from the Department of Human Development at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut. She worked with scientists from Tulane University, the University of California San Diego, Yunnan University, Southern Illinois University and Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center.

Large National Survey Reveals Widespread Deficiency

Researchers examined health and nutrition data from 1,227 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2009-2014). Nearly half of the older adults included in the study, about 48.7%, showed signs of periodontitis. At the same time, more than three quarters, or 77.9%, were not consuming enough lycopene. Lycopene is a carotenoid found mainly in tomatoes and other red fruits.

Lower Lycopene, Higher Risk

After accounting for factors such as age, sex, race, smoking habits and education level, the researchers found a strong association between lycopene intake and gum health. Older adults who met recommended lycopene intake levels had roughly one third the odds of severe periodontitis compared with those whose intake was insufficient.

Differences by Race and Sex

The study also identified clear disparities. Severe periodontitis appeared more frequently in men and in non-Hispanic Black adults than in other groups.

Key findings include:

What the Findings Mean

According to the authors, the results suggest that dietary lycopene could be an important factor that can be changed to help prevent severe gum disease in older adults. However, they caution that the study design was cross-sectional, meaning it cannot prove that low lycopene intake directly causes gum disease.

The researchers also emphasize the broader issue of racial and sex differences in periodontal disease, noting that non-Hispanic Black adults and men experience higher rates of severe disease. They recommend that future prevention efforts take these differences into account and call for long term or randomized controlled studies to determine whether increasing lycopene intake can reduce the risk or slow the progression of severe gum disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Italy's Winter Olympics are stunning from space","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209211229.htm","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 11:50:33 GMT","

With the 2026 Winter Olympics now in full swing, imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission offers a clear and striking look at northern Italy, bringing several major Olympic locations into view from space.

Known as the Milano Cortina Games, the 2026 Olympics are spread across a wide area rather than centered in a single city. Events are taking place at multiple sites throughout northern Italy, including Milan, Bormio, Livigno, Anterselva, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Predazzo, Tesero and Verona.

Alpine Venues From Above

In the cloud-free image, the upper portion is dominated by the peaks and valleys of the Alps, where many of the competition venues are located. The mountainous terrain stands out clearly, making it easier to see how the events are distributed across the region. Viewers can click on marked circles to pinpoint the exact locations of these venues.

To the northeast is Cortina d'Ampezzo, the town that gives the Games part of their official name. Often referred to as the ""Pearl of the Dolomites,"" Cortina sits within the dramatic Dolomite mountain range, which is also recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site. The town is well known as a winter sports destination and previously hosted the Winter Olympics in 1956.

Milan, Lake Garda, and Verona

The opening ceremony for the 2026 Winter Olympics will take place at San Siro Stadium in Milan. In the satellite image, the stadium appears as a gray area just below the Alpine region in the lower left portion of the frame. Milan is Italy's second-largest city after Rome, and its metropolitan area stretches across much of Lombardy and into eastern Piedmont.

Toward the center of the image, the deep blue waters of Lake Garda are immediately noticeable. With a surface area of 370 sq km, Lake Garda is the largest lake in Italy and ranks as the third largest in the Alpine region.

Just east of Lake Garda lies Verona, the city selected to host the Olympic closing ceremony, which will conclude two weeks of competition. Verona is known for its well-preserved historic architecture, including the famous Arena, a circular Roman amphitheatre that has contributed to the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site designation. On March 6, the Arena will also serve as the venue for the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Winter Games, marking the 50th anniversary of the first Paralympic Winter Games.

Venice Along the Adriatic Coast

At the far eastern edge of the image, in the lower right corner, another iconic Italian landmark comes into view. The crescent-shaped Venetian lagoon glows in shades of turquoise, revealing the network of islands that form the floating city of Venice along the Adriatic coast.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find genes that existed before all life on Earth","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210082913.htm","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:43:36 GMT","

Every organism alive today traces its lineage back to a single shared ancestor that lived about four billion years ago. Scientists refer to this organism as the ""last universal common ancestor,"" and it represents the earliest form of life that can currently be examined using established evolutionary methods.

Research on this ancient ancestor shows that many features seen in modern life were already in place at that time. Cells already had membranes, and genetic information was stored in DNA. Because these essential traits were already established, scientists seeking to understand how life first took shape must look even further back in time, to evolutionary events that occurred before this shared ancestor existed.

Studying Life Before the First Common Ancestor

In a study published in the journal Cell Genomics, researchers Aaron Goldman (Oberlin College), Greg Fournier (MIT), and Betül Kaçar (University of Wisconsin-Madison) describe a way to explore that earlier period of evolution. ""While the last universal common ancestor is the most ancient organism we can study with evolutionary methods,"" said Goldman, ""some of the genes in its genome were much older."" The team focuses on a special group of genes called ""universal paralogs,"" which preserve evidence of biological changes that took place before the last universal common ancestor.

A paralog is a group of related genes that appear multiple times within a single genome. Humans provide a clear example. Our DNA contains eight different hemoglobin genes, all of which produce proteins that carry oxygen through the blood. These genes all originated from a single ancestral globin gene that existed around 800 million years ago. Over long periods of time, repeated copying errors produced extra versions of the gene, and each copy gradually developed its own specialized role.

What Makes Universal Paralogs Unique

Universal paralogs are much rarer. These gene families appear in at least two copies in the genomes of nearly all living organisms. Their widespread presence suggests that the original gene duplication occurred before the last universal common ancestor emerged. Those duplicated genes were then passed down through countless generations and remain present in life today.

Because of this deep evolutionary reach, the authors argue that universal paralogs are a critical yet often overlooked resource for studying the earliest history of life on Earth. This approach is becoming more practical as new AI-based techniques and AI-optimized hardware make it easier to analyze ancient genetic patterns in detail.

""While there are precious few universal paralogs that we know,"" says Goldman, ""they can give us a lot of information about what life was like before the time of the last universal common ancestor."" Fournier adds, ""The history of these universal paralogs is the only information we will ever have about these earliest cellular lineages, and so we need to carefully extract as much knowledge as we can from them.""

Clues to the First Cellular Functions

In their analysis, Goldman, Fournier, and Kaçar reviewed all known universal paralogs. Every one of these genes plays a role in either building proteins or moving molecules across cell membranes. This finding suggests that protein production and membrane transport were among the first biological functions to evolve.

The researchers also emphasize the importance of reconstructing the ancient forms of these genes. In one study from Goldman's lab at Oberlin, scientists examined a universal paralog family involved in inserting enzymes and other proteins into cell membranes. Using standard methods from evolutionary biology and computational biology, they reconstructed the protein produced by the original ancestral gene.

Their results showed that this simpler, ancient protein could still attach to cell membranes and interact with the machinery that makes proteins. It likely helped early proteins embed themselves into primitive membranes, offering insight into how the earliest cells may have operated.

A New Window Into Life's Earliest History

The authors hope that continued advances in computational tools will allow scientists to identify additional universal paralog families and study their ancient ancestors in greater detail. ""By following universal paralogs,"" says Kaçar, ""we can connect the earliest steps of life on Earth to the tools of modern science. They provide us a chance to transform the deepest unknowns of evolution and biology into discoveries we can actually test."" Their goal is to build a clearer picture of evolution before the last universal common ancestor, shedding light on how life as we know it first emerged.

French President Emmanuel Macron has launched Choose France initiatives to attract both foreign investors and scientists to his country.Credit: Gonzalo Fuentes/POOL/AFP via Getty

France announced late last week that it would be awarding funds to 46 scientists as part of a high-profile initiative to recruit foreign researchers to the country with the promise of greater academic freedom. Almost all of them were previously at US institutions.

The more than €30-million Choose France for Science initiative, launched last April, is just one of a slew of European initiatives that aim to bring in research talent disaffected by changes elsewhere. These include the European Union's Choose Europe initiative, which is currently supported by nearly €900 million (US$1.1 billion) in research funding. The French programme will see 41 of the 46 recruits relocate to France from the United States. Eight of these researchers worked at Columbia University in New York City, which last year saw hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of its research grants cut and frozen by the administration of US President Donald Trump.

Some US researchers want to leave the country. Can Europe take them?

Some US researchers want to leave the country. Can Europe take them?

The awardees include Zhongkai Tao, a mathematician studying the structures of waves and matter in physics. Previously at the University of California, Berkeley, Tao has now taken up his grant at the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies (Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques or IHES) in Paris. Astrophysicist Kartik Sheth, who was associate chief scientist at NASA until he was fired by the agency during mass layoffs last year, has also been funded by the initiative. He will take up a three-year position at Aix-Marseille University in France.

Under Trump's second presidency, US researchers have experienced grant cuts, the dismantling of science-funding agencies and increased federal control over universities. US foreign aid and awards to international collaborators have also been terminated. When announcing the call last year, Élisabeth Borne, then French minister for higher education and research, said that France would offer a “refuge” to researchers as “science and research face unprecedented threats worldwide”. 

The high proportion of US scientists among those recruited by the programme shows that “enthusiasm and morale for doing science is low” in the United States, says Sharon Milgram, who led early-career researcher training and education programmes at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) for nearly 20 years, until she retired in December.

Yet a few dozen vacating scientists are unlikely to make a large dent at US academic institutions, which altogether have more than 1.5 million faculty members, she says. France and other countries hoping to lure US scientists face an uphill battle: funders such as the NIH, with their multibillion-dollar budgets, are irreplaceable, Milgram adds. Tens of thousands of scientists, rather than dozens, would need to relocate for it to have a big long-term impact on US science, she says.

Columbia University, which had most of its grants reinstated and unfrozen after the institution agreed to pay US$200 million to settle claims that it had failed to combat campus antisemitism, did not respond to Nature's queries about its researchers leaving the institution.

Of the 46 awardees, 19 are US nationals, 13 are French and 8 are originally from other European nations. The largest share are researchers studying climate, biodiversity and sustainable societies, according to the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research. The ministry declined to identify the 46 awardees, citing safety reasons.

But it did reveal that almost half of the awardees are headed to higher-education institutions in and around Paris. And 12 are going to Aix-Marseille University, which launched its own ‘Safe Place for Science' initiative, worth about €15 million (US$17.9 million). The university said that the programme was launched “in a context where some scientists in the United States may feel threatened or hindered in their research”. 

Among them is Alka Patel, a historian of art and architecture, previously at the University of California Irvine.

Meanwhile, Tao says he decided to move to France because the IHES is “a world-leading institute of mathematics” and he will be surrounded in Paris by a strong maths community. “Certainly, the Choose France funding shows that the French government supports researchers from all over the world,” he adds. With the funding, Tao says that he will establish a research group and study uncertainty principles and geometric spectral theory.

China is now responsible for most of the global supply chain for many essential pharmaceutical products. Credit: VCG via Getty

In biomedical science, China still lags behind the United States and Europe when it comes to fundamental research and conducting clinical trials involving investigators and participants from several countries1. But the nation is now a global leader when it comes to drug development and manufacturing. And it is becoming increasingly important in frontier science.

How China is vying to attract the world's top scientific talent

How China is vying to attract the world's top scientific talent

Industry analysts estimate that China now accounts for 70–95% of the global supply chain for many essential pharmaceutical products, including ibuprofen and paracetamol. In 2024, Chinese biotechnology firms developed more than 1,250 new drugs, surpassing the European Union and approaching the US total of roughly 1,440 (see ‘A growing force in biomedical innovation'). In 2018, China conducted only 9% of the clinical trials conducted by companies around the world. Now, it is responsible for about one-fifth of such trials1 (see ‘Top contributors to commercial clinical trials'). And in the past few years, it has achieved several therapeutic milestones.

As China's biotech industry gathers pace, however, so does geopolitical scrutiny.

Last December, the US Biosecure Act was signed into law in response to concerns about national security. This act prevents US pharmaceutical companies that receive federal funding from working with certain Chinese biotech companies. Such increased outside scrutiny, stemming from ongoing concerns about how genetic and clinical information is handled in China, has been prompting Chinese government officials, state-affiliated think tanks and industry stakeholders to advocate for building a closed ‘secure' biotech ecosystem in China.

Although a desire to sever ties is understandable, closing off China's biotech and pharma industries and its preclinical and clinical research from the rest of the world would be scientifically and economically counterproductive. It would blunt China's momentum, restrict people's access to life-saving medications in nations around the world and stall innovation globally.

Biomedical progress depends on shared knowledge, diverse patient cohorts and the development of regulations that aligns with global standards. In our view, China — and the rest of the world — should be striving to become more collaborative, not less.

Several domestic shifts have been driving China's biotech boom.

The country's advance to become the world's leading provider of many ‘active pharmaceutical ingredients' (the biologically active components that produce a medication's intended therapeutic effect), is thanks to decades of investment in chemical manufacturing, as well as in the transport, storage and export of compounds.

China's contract-development and manufacturing organizations and genomics-service providers are continuing to underpin global pipelines for drug development — even amid increased US legislative scrutiny. Thanks to China's manufacturing efficiency, lower regulatory hurdles and ability to recruit large numbers of participants in clinical trials, these organizations can provide services more quickly and cheaply than equivalent ones elsewhere can. (China's large, centralized hospital networks, for instance, make it easier for researchers to recruit participants and coordinate trials across several sites.) This is the case for preclinical studies; for procedures to assess the physical and chemical characteristics of a drug and ensure its quality; and for assistance with obtaining approval from regulators.

In addition, to better align the country's biotech and pharma sectors with global standards, the Chinese government launched a slew of regulatory reforms for medical products in 2015. These reforms have helped to make China an attractive option for pharma companies wanting to conduct early-stage clinical trials — particularly for drug development in oncology and immunology, and for trials needing participants from only one country.

Although it is not without problems, China's National Reimbursement Drug List is another factor that has helped to keep the costs of the drugs developed and produced in China relatively low. To ensure that medical products are affordable, the Chinese government negotiates notable price cuts with companies that want to get their products listed in China and therefore made available to more people. Listed drugs are covered by state-sponsored insurance schemes, with 2025 updates to the scheme particularly benefiting people with rare diseases and those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and autoimmune disorders.

Finally, over the past decade or so, there has been a rise in the number of people trained in drug discovery and development in China. Under the China Initiative, implemented by the US government in 2018, thousands of researchers and academics affiliated with China, but working in the United States, faced new restrictions and scrutiny — intended to safeguard US laboratories and businesses from espionage. Anyone receiving funds from China or involved in partnerships with institutions from China, for example, had to declare this to the US government.

The climate of anxiety that this created, combined with recruitment programmes by the Chinese government — which have, since 2008, offered research funds and other benefits to try to entice researchers back to China — seem to have catalysed the return of many US-trained Chinese life scientists2. Many of these people have seeded Chinese biotech start-ups.

So can China go it alone?

Some Chinese government officials and industry stakeholders are arguing that, given all these developments, China could compensate for any tools, materials and knowledge lost as a result of the country cutting biotech and pharma ties with the United States or other countries.

A State Council directive (a high-level administrative order) issued by the Chinese government in September 2025, for example, instructs government procurement offices, which manage the buying of goods and other services for government organizations, to prioritize domestic products. And some policy advisers are already discussing how a ‘closed loop' of home-grown agencies, such as contract-research organizations, contract-development and manufacturing organizations, regulators and health-insurance companies, could be established in China.

The electronics sector faced a similar challenge in 2022, when US export controls reduced China's access to materials, such as lithography tools, needed to make cutting-edge semiconductor chips. And China's response was to pour billions of US dollars into a workaround — chiplet technology. Chiplets are less advanced than conventional chips and easier to manufacture, but can be connected to make a functional system. The Chinese government also supported developers of artificial intelligence in finding ways to work around computing limits, leading to home-grown successes such as the AI start-up Zhipu in Beijing.

How China can become a biotechnology superpower

How China can become a biotechnology superpower

But ultimately, even China's advances in semiconductors and AI have depended on importing information, materials, software and manufacturing equipment. And probably more so than in semiconductors and electronics, advances in biology depend on the circulation of ideas, enabled by researchers publishing their work in high-impact journals and attending international conferences.

Although China's advances in biotech and pharma are impressive, the country is still far from being a self-sufficient biotech superpower.

Several Chinese companies chasing the same leads amid a hypercompetitive corporate culture continues to result in inefficiencies and diminishing returns. Also, the country's biotech industry continues to drive the incremental optimization of pre-existing treatments rather than groundbreaking discoveries. A 2024 review showed, for example, that nearly 40% of registered clinical trials for cell therapies (which involve transferring cells into a person to treat or prevent disease) conducted in China between 2021 and 2023 focused on known molecular targets3.

China's biotech filings under the Patent Cooperation Treaty — an international agreement that allows inventors to seek patent protection in multiple countries — surged from 119 in 2010 to more than 1,900 in 2023. By comparison, the EU filed 1,369 and the United States 3,721 applications in 2023. But, in part because of their long history of commanding science, the United States and the EU still lead when it comes to representation in high-impact journals and the discovery of genuinely new mechanisms.

Besides all these challenges, a lack of international trust continues to be a problem, and tensions are sustained in part by events in China. In 2024, for instance, US intelligence officials reported that Chinese biotech firms had transferred intellectual property of US clients to Chinese authorities without the clients' consent (see go.nature.com/4twedie).

Lastly, most Chinese biotech and pharma companies lack the capital needed to weather failures in high-risk, early-stage research, or to complete the full innovation cycle from discovery to commercialization, to generating enough returns to sustain innovation.

China's capital markets are still immature. And although the National Reimbursement Drug List has expanded people's access to drugs, including in low- and middle-income countries, the list makes it harder for China's biotech and pharma industries to become profitable. In 2024, the average negotiated discount was roughly 63% — the highest so far.

You're at a conference. The lights are low, it's the last speaker of the day, engagement has hit rock bottom and the audience completely tunes out. Phones come out and everyone is running the clock down; the speaker even apologizes for getting in the way of the networking drinks.

Re-imagine this setting as a gig: the lights are low, it's the last act of the day, the band walks onto the stage, engagement goes through the roof and the audience explodes with excitement. No one wants it to end. In fact, the artist returns for an encore.

And now ask yourself, could the energy felt at a concert be recreated in a conference hall?

I research and teach immunology at Imperial College London and have also dabbled in public engagement as a popular-science author, so a chunk of my job focuses on public speaking. I have even tried stand-up comedy (the audience laughed, sometimes in the correct places). I also love live music. But the question is, what can researchers learn from performers to improve science talks?

Conference talks are a key feature of scientific careers. An invitation to give a keynote presentation at a reputable international conference is seen as a marker of esteem and ticks boxes for tenure and promotion. The extent to which a person's ability to engage audiences is taken into account when selecting speakers is debatable — people are chosen for having ‘an interesting story', which isn't necessarily the same as the ability to tell an interesting story.

Talks don't just raise an individual's profile; they can be a platform to highlight a team that also contributed to the work. A great talk will advertise your laboratory, department or institution. To put it simply, if you are doing cool work (and you can explain it in a cool way), you might attract cool people to come and do it with you in a virtuous cycle.

Beyond self-publicity, the point of science talks is to inform, educate and inspire others. In a research ecosystem that increasingly churns out overwhelming numbers of papers, scientific presentations are an important method of highlighting your work to a wider audience. And often, they can help you to engage with a broader circle than your own. We are all somewhat habitual in the papers that we read and the journals that we browse, and often the best ideas cross-pollinate from other fields. Moreover, a good talk can advertise stories to journal editors, who might be more open to a paper that is based on a talk than to one that lands in their inbox without context.

On a selfish level, if you're an in-demand speaker, you are more likely to be invited to better conferences in nicer places. International travel, and the chance to meet other scientists and hear their research, is one of the great perks of a career in science. And being a speaker can give you kudos — which might open up conversations and collaborations with other speakers.

All of these benefits can be magnified if you knock the talk out of the park, and just as easily negated if you grind your way through your slides in a dull, monotone voice. But scientists are not necessarily natural performers. So, are there some lessons that can be learnt from performance artists?

As well as drawing on what I have observed through 25 years of snoozing through seminars and going to gigs, I reached out to actors, singers and comedians to get some tips from them.

It is much easier to lose an audience than it is to win them back. By the time people have started checking their e-mails, they are as good as gone until the next speaker. They need to be gripped from the beginning. This starts when you are backstage. My colleague Robin Shattock, a vaccine researcher at Imperial College London, listens to ‘pump up' music — such as ‘The Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor — before public speaking. ‘Lose Yourself' by Eminem works for me.

Lowlands: where science meets music

One way to lose the audience before you've even begun is by fiddling with cables onstage. Check your set-up in advance and make sure that the IT works — fumbling around with HDMI cables and looking for an adaptor for your laptop is unlikely to endear you to the crowd.

The introduction also plays a part in capturing the audience. Sometimes we have the ‘advantage' of being introduced as a speaker. This does contextualize the talk, but I'm not sure that a concise summary of a CV necessarily fires up the audience. It's worth considering what you share in the short bio you provide to the conference organizers — does it matter that you have worked at an institution for 25 years? Would it be better to describe your expertise?

Once you start, you need to own the stage. Don't be apologetic about what you have to say — people are here to listen to you. If they have turned up, they have some basic level of engagement in your talk. Repay that engagement with confidence. Actor and former stand-up comedian Ben Willbond told me that “the audience needs to know they are in a safe pair of hands. If you watch a nervous, novice stand-up, they almost always lose the audience members, who can sense the speaker is not comfortable. When you are confident and in control, the audience relaxes and buys into what you are selling them”.

Willbond compares the ability to control a room to a ‘muscle memory' that needs to be learnt and practised, so that it happens without conscious thought. “When speaking, engage the audience by looking up from the podium and into every corner of the room,” he advises. “That way, you then fill the stage.”

How to know whether a conference is right for you

How to know whether a conference is right for you

Steve Cross, a London-based comedian and science communicator who runs courses to train academics to become better speakers, gave me the advice to “never stand behind the lectern. Come out and see how much better everything gets”. If you want to own the space, you need to be in the space. Movement and hand gestures can be important for this. I'm a fairly mobile speaker and have been known to knock things off lecterns, followed by the odd expletive. I've learnt to work this into the whole presentation package; when I've tried to rein in my movements, I expend too much energy on standing still and lose the flow. If movement is natural to you, incorporate it, because it gives character (as long as it's not so extreme that it becomes distracting). However, be mindful of the microphone set-up — static microphones tie you to the spot more than mobile ones do.

Tone of voice is also important — try to vary it. Sounding too excited is just as bad as too bored. If you are excited about everything, then it's hard for people to re-engage with the talk if they lose the thread. For example, when listening to sports on the radio, I tune back in when the pitch changes because something noteworthy might have happened. And if you insist on saying ‘interestingly', make sure that the thing you are describing is actually interesting.

In a perfect world, a talk would be written from scratch, with the narrative chosen first and then the slides created next. But if you are upcycling an old talk, as all academics do, try to think of the flow and whether the slides you have resuscitated actually tell the story that you want. This is comparable to a band's set list: switching between crowd-pleasers and new songs. A long string of data-heavy slides might lose the audience, so throw in images, jokes, asides and remarks to keep people attentive.

Ditch the decaff: only caffeinated coffee is linked to brain benefits.Credit: Matthew Horwood/Getty

We are, as a species, especially fond of caffeine. Tea is the second-most commonly consumed beverage globally, after water, and most adults in the United States begin their day with coffee. And although many people consume caffeine for a jolt of energy, a study published today in JAMA1 suggests that the stimulant also has a longer-term brain benefit: keeping our minds sharp over time.

The study offers what the authors think is the longest-term data to date on the relationship between caffeine consumption and cognition. It found that moderate caffeine intake from coffee and tea was associated with reductions in both dementia risk and the rate of cognitive decline. Specialists praise the study for its size but note that the results should be interpreted with caution.

“This is a well‑conducted study for the type of data available. However, because it uses observational, not experimental, evidence, the findings can only be considered suggestive,” says Naveed Sattar, a cardiometabolic medicine specialist at the University of Glasgow, UK.

Many studies have investigated the link between caffeine and cognition2. But Yu Zhang, an epidemiologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and first author of the study, says that previous work followed participants over relatively short periods, whereas dementia builds over many decades.

For its work, Zhang's group leveraged two decades-long health studies — the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study — to track the caffeine-drinking habits of more than 130,000 health-care professionals over 43 years. Participants in these studies documented their diet every few years. They also filled out questionnaires about their cognitive function and took tests that required them to recount strings of words as an objective measure of cognition.

The team found that moderate consumption of caffeine, amounting to 2–3 cups of coffee or 1–2 cups of tea a day, was associated with the greatest reductions in dementia risk and rate of cognitive decline. But lower levels of consumption were also associated with brain benefits.

Contrary to past work3, the association between caffeine intake and cognitive health held even in those who drank large amounts of coffee: dementia risk was 18% lower in people in the highest bracket of caffeine consumption — up to five cups of coffee a day — than in those who drank little or none.

Manipulating the selectivity-determining step in the hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing intermediates is critical to achieving high ammonia selectivity in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Here, we propose a molecular interface engineering strategy that functionalized with thiol-anchored aromatic ligands to regulate the interfacial binding affinity and activation of key nitrogen-containing intermediates on silver nanocube surfaces. By systematically varying the electronic properties of the substituents, we identify 4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde as the most effective ligand, increasing the ammonia Faradaic efficiency from 50.8% to 98.9% and achieving a yield rate of 14,366.1 μg h–1 cmgeo–2 at –0.63 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ electrochemical characterizations combined with theoretical simulations further reveal that 4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde modification promotes the activation of weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules and accelerates the hydrogenation of *HNO intermediates. This targeted modulation of interfacial binding affinity offers an effective strategy for selectivity control in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. The enhanced performance is further validated in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyser, underscoring the practical viability of this molecular design strategy for selective nitrate conversion.

Soft and conducting organic materials are ideal candidates for stretchable bioelectronics and wearable devices. Despite recent advances, our understanding of conducting polymer nanostructures and how they arise remains incomplete, given the limited high-resolution studies and molecular-level descriptions of these systems. Here, we employ cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to investigate the evolution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) morphology in solution and the resulting solid state structure in the presence of ionic and molecular additives. Our results reveal the formation of heterostructural elongated fibers consisting of PEDOT:PSS micelles in solution. Cryo-EM further reveals that additives increase the number of fibrils, in addition to inducing the formation of crystalline domains. We observe that fibril and crystalline phases in solutions act as a template for the growth of these nanostructures in the solid state. Furthermore, exploiting cryo-EM reveals the role of solid-liquid interactions in PEDOT:PSS through the imaging of PEDOT:PSS nanostructures after the hydration of thin films. Hydration leads to the swelling of heterostructural fibers while reducing the crystalline domain size. Such behavior explains the mechanical robustness of PEDOT:PSS thin films processed with various additives as well as the high electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS in applications such as organic electorchemical transistors.

All cryo-EM micrographs generated in this study and data presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4 are available through ScholarSphere (https://doi.org/10.26207/ayrf-n930).

Adipogenin is a microprotein expressed in adipose tissue. Previous studies have suggested its role in lipid storage, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms have been unclear. A recent study published in Science presents evidence that adipogenin forms complexes with seipin, a protein that is essential for lipid droplet formation in adipocytes, thereby modulating lipid storage.

Federal records obtained by WIRED show that over the past several months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have carried out a secret campaign to expand ICE's physical presence across the US. Documents show that more than 150 leases and office expansions have or would place new facilities in nearly every state, many of them in or just outside of the country's largest metropolitan areas. In many cases, these facilities, which are to be used by street-level agents and ICE attorneys, are located near elementary schools, medical offices, places of worship, and other sensitive locations.

In El Paso, Texas, for example, the agency is moving into a large campus of buildings right off of Interstate 10 near multiple local health providers and other businesses. In Irvine, California, ICE is moving into offices located next to a childcare agency. In New York, ICE is moving into offices on Long Island near a passport center. In a wealthy community near Houston, Texas, ICE appears poised to move into an office building blocks away from a preschool.

The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages federal buildings and functions as the government's internal IT department, is playing a critical role in this aggressive expansion. In numerous emails and memorandums viewed by WIRED, DHS asked GSA explicitly to disregard usual government lease procurement procedures and even hide lease listings due to “national security concerns” in an effort to support ICE's immigration enforcement activities across the US.

“GSA is committed to working with all of our partner agencies, including our patriotic law enforcement partners such as ICE, to meet their workspace needs. GSA remains focused on supporting this administration's goal of optimizing the federal footprint, and providing the best workplaces for our federal agencies to meet their mission,” Marianne Copenhaver, GSA associate administrator for communications, tells WIRED. “GSA is following all lease procurement procedures in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.”

DHS, ICE's parent agency, did not reply to requests for comment.

Since President Donald Trump took office in 2025, ICE has more than doubled in size. DHS claims the agency now has 22,000 officers and agents stationed around the country and is still in the process of hiring more. The agency received nearly $80 billion in funding as part of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, giving it virtually unlimited resources to combat what the administration has consistently portrayed as an “invasion.” With new employees comes a desperate need for office space, and the possibility of deployment to new areas of operation.

In September, as NPR and The Washington Post reported, a number of GSA employees were added to an “ICE surge” team responsible for finding new office locations and expanding preexisting offices for ICE employees. More specifically, according to documents viewed by WIRED, workers at the Public Buildings Service (PBS), the department within GSA that handles government buildings and leases, were assigned to actively support ICE's physical expansion and told to find leasing spaces for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) divisions across the country. ERO is tasked with immigration enforcement, including the arrest, detention, and removal of immigrants, and previously operated out of only 25 field offices in the US; OPLA is the legal arm of ICE, and lawyers with OPLA litigate “all removal cases including those against criminal aliens, terrorists, and human rights abusers,” for DHS, according to ICE's website.

Records reviewed by WIRED show that the ICE surge team has successfully found spaces for ICE across the country. In addition to expanding previously held ICE offices, it has moved or is moving ICE into new buildings, or into space the government controlled under the terms of existing leases, in almost every US state and major city.

Starting in September, GSA was pushed to bypass the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) that requires open competition among bidders for federal building and lease procurements, because ICE requested that leases fall under the “unusual or compelling urgency” government statute. The statute states that the procuring agency's “need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.”

A training kickoff for PBS staff assigned to the ICE surge team the same month cited the “Big Beautiful Bill” and the aim of hiring 13,000 new ICE employees, as the “trigger event” for the new team. These team members were told that around 250 new locations were needed for ICE employees, and this would be potentially achieved by new lease acquisitions and by locating ICE in existing federal spaces. The “primary focus is securing a space. Renovations are secondary,” shows documentation viewed by WIRED. Employees were instructed to move as quickly as possible, without getting “hung up” on issues like “needing paint and carpet before occupancy.”

In a memorandum dated September 10, 2025, an OPLA representative asked GSA's office of general counsel to look past the usual leasing procedures with the “unusual and compelling urgency justification,” in accordance with Trump's executive order on immigration. “In the next three months, OPLA will grow to more than 3,500 attorneys and 1,000 support staff,” the memorandum states. “OPLA has critical space needs that require the ability to identify office locations nationwide that OPLA can readily occupy as soon as possible.”

GSA's ICE surge team began visiting potential leasing locations and worked to finalize deals within days. A DHS official sent GSA an email on September 24, 2025, asking that the agency not publicize leasing information, recognizing that this request was outside of the “normal” process. “Due to national security concerns and recent attacks against ICE, publicizing new lease locations puts our officers, employees, and detainees in grave danger,” the email stated. While many ICE locations have attracted protests, there have not been known attacks on ICE offices.

GSA was instructed in January 2025 to pause most acquisitions, deliveries, and modifications, except for projects under $50,000 and those related to supporting security measures for the president's office. But on September 25, 2025, a GSA commissioner emailed other leaders at the agency that “an exception to the acquisition pause has been approved for all actions supporting the ICE hiring surge, regardless of dollar value.”

By September 29, GSA had already awarded leasing projects, and the ERO division at ICE had sent the ICE surge team a list of requirements for specific leasing locations, including sally ports—a secure entryway system with interlocking doors used by military troops, prisons, and police stations—and other security measures. ICE also came to GSA with a specific request: that any new location be within a 10-mile radius of an existing ERO facility.

By early October, the ICE surge team was working through the government shutdown, even as other critical government work was put on hold. Days after the shutdown began, GSA was still awarding leases. On October 6, 2025, a signed internal memorandum stated that GSA should “approve of all new lease housing determinations associated with ICE hiring surge,” in light of ICE's “urgent” space requirements and the purported impact of delays on the agency's ability to “meet critical immigration enforcement deadlines.”

On October 9, the same day that Trump announced in a cabinet meeting that the government would be making “permanent” cuts from “Democrat programs” during the shutdown, GSA received a list from OPLA with requests for office locations, including expansions and new leases, in 41 cities around the country.

In a memorandum dated October 29, 2025, a representative from Homeland Security Investigations—one of the two major departments within ICE, along with ERO, and tasked with a wide range of investigative work in cases ranging from human trafficking to art theft—asked GSA's office of general counsel to engage in nationwide lease acquisition on behalf of DHS “using the unusual and compelling urgency justification,” in accordance with Trump's executive immigration order.

“If HSI cannot effectively obtain office space in a timely manner, HSI will be adversely impacted in accomplishing its mission—a mission that is inextricably tied to the Administration's priority in protecting the American People Against Invasion,” the memorandum states.

By early November, according to documents viewed by WIRED, 19 projects had been awarded in cities around the US, including Nashville, Tennessee; Dallas, Texas; Sacramento, California; and Tampa, Florida. Multiple projects were days away from being awarded in Miami, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and New Orleans, Louisiana, among others, and emergency requests for short-term space had been made in eight cities, including Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; and Newark, New Jersey.

In documents viewed by WIRED, ICE has repeatedly outlined its expansion to cities around the US. The September memorandum citing “unusual and compelling urgency” for office expansion states that OPLA will be “expanding its legal operations” into Birmingham, Alabama; Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, and Tampa, Florida; Des Moines, Iowa; Boise, Idaho; Louisville, Kentucky; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Grand Rapids, Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; Raleigh, North Carolina; Long Island, New York; Columbus, Ohio; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; Richmond, Virginia; Spokane, Washington and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The memorandum also states that the existing offices are at maximum capacity and will “require additional space” to accommodate the new employees hired. At the time, the memo states that OPLA had selected almost 1,000 attorneys to hire.

Months after the “surge” began, ICE's expansion to American cities is well underway, according to documentation viewed by WIRED. The table below gives a detailed listing of planned ICE lease locations as of January, and includes current ICE offices that are set to expand and new spaces the agency is poised to occupy. It does not include more than 100 planned ICE locations across many states—including California, New York, and New Jersey—where WIRED has not viewed every specific address.

WIRED reached out to the owners of private properties at which ICE is planning to lease space, or to agents and managers associated with these properties; they did not respond to our inquiries, or declined comment.

As of January, ICE's expansion is heavily concentrated in a few key states. Texas has at least 9 leasing projects underway. In Harlingen, located near the US border with Mexico, a lease has been awarded at 222 East Van Buren, in the same building as the city's Department of Labor–aligned outpost. (ICE has already detained dozens of Harlingen-area residents.) In the Woodlands, a district near Houston, ICE appears poised to move into an office building at 1780 Hughes Landing Boulevard, blocks away from a Primrose preschool. In El Paso, ICE is moving into the Epicenter Office Community, a large campus of buildings right off Interstate 10 near many local health providers and other businesses. In San Antonio, ICE is considering a move into a building located at 15727 Anthem Parkway, near apartment buildings, dozens of restaurants, and the Methodist Hospital Landmark. In Eagle Pass, ICE appears to be looking at a move into a building at 3381 US Highway 277, where at least one government office—the Drug Enforcement Administration—is already located.

A Trump administration official recently told WIRED that California and New York are “next” for the type of fraud investigation that culminated in 3,000 ICE agents in Minneapolis. At least seven leasing projects are underway in California. In Sacramento, ICE has installed security features at the John E. Moss building ahead of further expansion. The location is already the site of a Justice Department immigration court. In Irvine, a city in Orange County located an hour's drive from Los Angeles, ICE is moving into offices on 2020 Main Street, located right next to the airport and a childcare agency. In Van Nuys, a neighborhood of Los Angeles, ICE is expanding its offices at the James C. Corman federal building that also has offices for the IRS and Health and Human Services. Further expansion of ICE offices is also underway throughout the state, in federal buildings in Los Angeles, at San Diego's Edward J. Schwartz Courthouse and federal building, and in Santa Ana's federal building. The Santa Ana federal building is located within blocks of a church, the stadium for one of the nation's top high school football programs, and many government services.

In New York and New Jersey, ICE is expanding its physical footprint rapidly. In Roseland, New Jersey, less than an hour's drive from New York City, ICE is moving into a building at 5 Becker Farm Road. The building is located near the Roseland Child Development Center. In Woodbury, New York, a hamlet in Long Island, ICE is moving into offices located at 88 Froehlich Farm Boulevard, near an expedited passport center. In New Windsor, New York, a town within driving distance of New York City along the Hudson River known for the Storm King Art Center, ICE is moving into offices at 843 Union Avenue. All three of these locations are within an hour and a half from a warehouse in Chester, New York, that DHS is pursuing as an immigrant detention center.

The same pattern plays out in dozens of other cities across the US. ICE's expansion includes not just its own preexisting space—or sharing an office with other government agencies—but also situates its agents near sensitive civilian locations.

That often includes places of worship. In Hyattsville, Maryland, ICE is expanding its offices at the Metro 1 building on 6505 Belcrest Road, which sits a few blocks from a Lutheran church. In Tennessee, OPLA is planning to move into the Nashville House office building, a business center in the city near multiple churches. The One City Center building in Portland, Maine, where ICE plans to expand its offices, is within walking distance to at least six churches, a mosque, one synagogue, and a Salvation Army adult rehab center.

Several planned ICE office spaces are located near schools and early-childhood care centers. ICE is poised to move into a building on 1000 Westlakes Drive in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, suburb of Berwyn; the Hillside Elementary School is about a mile away. In Hartford, Connecticut, OPLA is poised to expand existing ICE office space in the Abraham A. Ribicoff federal building, which sits two blocks from the Betances elementary school. Back in Tennessee, ICE is ready to move into offices at 5904 Ridgeway Center Parkway in Memphis, in a building near the private all-girls Hutchison School. In the Columbus, Ohio, suburb of Westerville, OPLA appears ready to move into a small office building at 774 Park Meadow, near the Oakstone Academy High School. In Meridian, Idaho, ICE is moving into the Portico at Meridian Center, which is located near the Spalding STEM Academy high school. And in Oakbrook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, ICE is moving into the Oakbrook Gateway, an office building located near both a Bright Horizons daycare center and a hospice center.

Many other planned locations are near hospitals and medical offices. In York, Pennsylvania, ICE's OPLA division has leased space at Yorktowne Medical, a facility with multiple medical offices. In Columbia, South Carolina, ICE is poised to move into offices at 1441 Main Street, which sits blocks away from the Prisma Health Baptist Hospital. In Naples, Florida, ICE is poised to move into offices at 75 Vineyards Boulevard, close to Physicians Regional Pine Ridge campus hospital.

Other locations appear to be strategically situated near buildings that ICE either currently uses or could use to detain immigrants. The Hyattsville location is about an hour and a half from a warehouse DHS recently purchased that ICE has said will be used to detain immigrants, as is a second office marked for OPLA use in Cockeysville, Maryland. Among the many ICE leasing projects underway in Florida is Research Commons, a building located in Orlando at 12249 Science Drive that's less than 25 minutes away from another warehouse identified by the Post as a potential large-scale detention center. The York, Pennsylvania, location is also an hour and 20 minutes away from a warehouse recently purchased by ICE for nearly $90 million that a Republican congressman said will be used as a processing and immigrant detention facility.

In Alexandria, Louisiana, ICE is moving into a building on 1201 3rd Street, located right in the city's historic downtown center and a 16-minute drive from the Alexandria Staging Facility, where immigrants have been detained, transferred, and then deported. Alexandria has emerged as a key location for ICE's activities in the state and around the country, and an investigation from The Guardian alleged a pattern of abuse and alleged due process violations at the Alexandria facility that's operated as a deportation “hub.”

This is just a sampling of the dozens and dozens of lease locations in the process of being awarded to ICE in every single GSA leasing region, which spans the entire country and US territories. ICE agents and officers will share buildings with doctors, restaurants, and businesses. They'll expand existing offices and move in with unrelated government agencies—at 801 Arch Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for example, they'll share space with the DMV.

Together, the leasing plans give a clear picture of where ICE is going next in the US: Everywhere.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","OpenAI Abandons ‘io' Branding for Its AI Hardware","https://www.wired.com/story/openai-drops-io-branding-hardware-devices/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:45:00 GMT","

OpenAI will not use the name “io” for its forthcoming line of AI hardware devices, according to a Monday court filing.

The motion is part of a trademark infringement lawsuit filed last year by audio device startup iyO, which sued OpenAI after the ChatGPT maker acquired famed Apple designer Jony Ive's startup io. Peter Welinder, OpenAI's vice president and general manager, said in the filing that OpenAI had reviewed its product-naming strategy and “decided not to use the name ‘io' (or ‘IYO,' or any capitalization of either) in connection with the naming, advertising, marketing, or sale of any artificial intelligence-enabled hardware products.”

Welinder also said that OpenAI now has a better understanding of the timeline for getting its devices to market. In the filing, the company said its first hardware device won't ship to customers before the end of February 2027.

Previously, OpenAI has said that it is planning to unveil its AI device in the second half of 2026. The company's first prototype is reportedly a screenless device that can sit on a user's desk, and accompany a phone and laptop. Welinder also said that OpenAI has yet to create packaging or marketing materials for its first hardware device, according to the filing.

In a statement, an OpenAI spokesperson said: ""We have decided to move forward with a new name, which we look forward to sharing in the future.”

The news comes as wild rumors continue to spread about OpenAI's hardware efforts. A now debunked Reddit thread went viral over the weekend, claiming that OpenAI had pulled a Super Bowl ad unveiling its forthcoming device. Someone posted the alleged ad, which featured the actor Alexander Skarsgård wearing a pair of silver headphones and tapping a reflective puck. The video was shared widely on social media, including by Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian.

OpenAI spokesperson Lindsay McCallum confirmed to WIRED that the company had nothing to do with the ad in question.

OpenAI announced in May 2025 that it would acquire Jony Ive's secretive consumer hardware subsidiary for $6.5 billion, marking the company's largest acquisition ever. At the time, io was marketed as a new company that would merge with OpenAI to create a family of AI devices.

Since then, the company has been embroiled in a messy trademark infringement lawsuit that's likely revealed more than OpenAI would have liked about its devices. iyO claims that OpenAI and io executives met with iyO leaders and tested the company's AI audio technology before the acquisition was announced.

OpenAI leaders previously revealed in filings related to this lawsuit that the prototype CEO Sam Altman mentioned in io's launch video was “not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device.”

Update: 2/10/26 1 pm EDT: This story has been updated with comment from OpenAI.

Vapes are bad for your body and definitely bad for the planet; the world's landfills are stuffed with disposable vape cartridges. But now there's a way to give all that e-waste a more pleasant tune.

The Vape Synth is a project created by a group of makers in New York City who break apart spent Elf Bar nicotine vaporizers and hack them into digital musical instruments. The resulting device still looks like a vape cartridge, but with a small speaker nestled amid an array of lights and buttons. To play it, you put your mouth on it and draw your breath inward, like you would on a vape.

Think of it like a digital ocarina. The Vape Synth repurposes the vaporizer's existing low-pressure sensor. By sucking wind through the sensor—maybe it's a reverse digital ocarina—you trigger an oscillator circuit and generate an audio signal. Pressing the buttons triggers different tones. The noises that come out are, frankly, screechy and chaotic. (This is what it sounds like.)

The people who made the Vape Synth know it sounds goofy. That's the point.

“We started from a very silly place,” says Kari Love, one of Vape Synth's creators. “We have to use the low pressure sensor. Which means to play it, you must suck.”

Love and David Rios are professors at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program. Shuang Cai is a PhD student at Cornell University and teaches at NYU and Cornell. They are all self-described salvage hoarders and makers who work on the Vape Synth project under the moniker Paper Bag Team. (None of them vape nicotine.)

The three have presented the Vape Synth in talks like the Open Hardware Summit and run workshops to build them at events like the 2025 Low Tech Electronics Faire. Another workshop was held this past weekend at the hacker collective NYC Resistor in Brooklyn. The team also just released a thorough guide via Instructables on how to hack your very own vapes into synths.

“They're this huge e-waste product,” Love says of spent vapes. “You see them everywhere. They have the lithium ion batteries, which makes them particularly insidious in the disposable tech world.”

Handmade Vape Synths with speakers, buttons, and photoresistors on top. There's a circuit board inside each, and the design utilizes the vape's existing battery and low pressure sensor.

When Juul, once the king of vapes, was ordered by the FDA to pull its product from US markets, it cleared the way for other—entirely disposable—vape devices to flood the shelves. The already multi-billion-dollar vape business exploded, with devices pouring in from countries like China and birthing dozens of brands with names like SoundCloud rap song titles. (Pillow Talk, Hyppe Bar, PolkaDot, Puff Bar.)

These colorful devices filled with flavored nicotine juice are all disposable; they wind up in the trash after a few thousand puffs. Vape recycling is basically nonexistent in the US. All the plastic, circuitry, and batteries inside the vape just go to waste—unless you salvage them.

“The juice goes out, but then you have this charging circuit, the battery,” Cai says. “Everything in there is still perfectly fine.”

The team was inspired by hacker Andrew Quitmeyer's deliberately goofy Bubble Punk philosophy, which argues that if you take something serious like waste reduction and make it a little funny and silly, it keeps the concept approachable and more people will participate.

“This process is upstream salvage,” Cai says. “The idea is not that we want to use this as a solution to the existing status quo, but to use this to call for attention and encourage more creative action on these kinds of issues.”

The speaker and circuit board, uninstalled.

A complete Synth Vape hack.

Love says the project started when a student came to her asking for a way to make a miniature fog machine. Love's first thought was to take apart and repurpose a vape, but then the student never returned and she was left with a disassembled device on her desk. Love then talked about it with Rios, who teaches a class about new musical interfaces. They collaborated with Cai, a fellow tinkerer, with the idea of turning the vape into a makeshift musical instrument.

“Ideally, we would change that paradigm and make less waste,” Love says. “But while we're making that much waste, let's divert some of it. Let's use it.”

Paper Bag Team's instructions recommend making the synths out of one specific, very popular vape: the Elf Bar, aka the EB BC5000, a Chinese-made vape that has sold millions of units in the US. (While you can use models made by Leaf Bar or Lost Mary, they're not recommended for this hack as the internal parts can be slightly different.)

The blueprints from Paper Bag use the vape's original batteries, charging circuit with LED, and case. The first step of the process of vape repurposing is to put on some gloves, because nicotine can be absorbed through the skin. After that, the instructions spell out how to add speakers and controls and move the low pressure sensor closer to the mouthpiece so it can be activated after the holes for the musical components have been drilled elsewhere in the case.

The Vape Synth's tonal quality is a bit lacking. I found that it sort of sounds like a dying rabbit or swarm of flies hitting a bug zapper nonstop. Love says the team is already working on another version of the Vape Synth with a wider musical range that can also be used as a MIDI controller, and therefore able to trigger more pleasing sounds.

Attendees of the 2025 Low Tech Electronics Faire assemble their own Vape Synths.

Rios says people shouldn't be intimidated by the idea of poking and prodding their electronics.

“People feel just completely unempowered to do anything,” Rios says. “Even the most basic thing of just popping the lid open to see what's in there. You don't even have to touch it. It can be fun and easy and you can hopefully apply that to your other e-waste, or at least get interested.”

The Paper Bag Team are all careful to credit other fellow makers like artist Sebastian Bidegain, who built a Vape camera; maker Becky Stern's efforts to reuse vape batteries; and Disengineering, an art collective that turned vapes into microphones. Part of the goal of running workshops and putting the DIY instructions online is to encourage people to find their own ways to repurpose e-waste.

“There's no way that the three of us are going to have all the ideas,” Rios says.

Elon Musk's xAI is establishing its Seattle-area engineering center in a former Epic Games space in downtown Bellevue, Wash., following through on Musk's announcement in September that the company planned to open an outpost in the region.

The location was first reported Monday by the Puget Sound Business Journal, and confirmed by GeekWire based on references to xAI in online permit logs. The nearly 25,000-square-foot space is on the 8th floor of the Lincoln Square South building at 10400 NE 4th St.

The lease makes xAI the latest AI company to set up shop in Bellevue, following the news last week that OpenAI is expanding to nearly 300,000 square feet at nearby City Center Plaza. 

In fact, the xAI and OpenAI offices in downtown Bellevue will be about a 10-minute walk from each other, should Musk and Sam Altman ever find themselves in their respective Seattle-area hubs at the same time and decide to patch things up.

Founded in 2023, xAI is best known for Grok, its AI chatbot, which is integrated into Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

News of the company's Seattle-area location comes days after SpaceX announced its acquisition of xAI in a deal valuing the AI company at $250 billion, further consolidating Musk's businesses. The key tenant-improvement filing for the Bellevue space was in late December, indicating that the lease was in the works before the acquisition closed.

Job listings show xAI is hiring for a range of engineering roles in the Seattle area, with salaries from $180,000 to $440,000. The positions go beyond networking and infrastructure to include core AI research roles, such as members of the technical staff focused on CUDA/GPU kernel development, image generation, video generation, and world models. This signals that the Bellevue office will serve as a hub for AI model development, not just operations support.

SpaceX already has a large presence in the Seattle region, focused on the development of Starlink satellite internet service out of the company's Redmond engineering offices.

We've contacted xAI for more information about its plans for the office.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

REDMOND, Wash. — For more than three years, much of the focus on AI in education has been on the implications of handing students what amounts to a technological cheat code. 

But what if this disruptive force could be used to improve education instead? 

That's the idea behind an effort now getting under way in Washington state. Last week, school districts gathered at Microsoft in Redmond for the start of a two-year “community of practice” focused on AI in education. More than 150 educators and administrators filled the room.

The event brought together two programs. Microsoft's Elevate Washington initiative, announced last October, awarded $75,000 grants to 10 districts to plan and implement AI projects. The Gates Foundation is funding a separate cohort of 10 districts focused on AI infrastructure and data systems.

The Microsoft Elevate grants also include up to $25,000 in funding for technology consulting. The districts are expected to share what they learn with each other and across the state.

The focus is on practical applications, such as AI-powered tutoring in Bellevue, K-12 literacy frameworks in Highline and Quincy, and chatbots for students and families in Kennewick.

In Issaquah, the goal is to use AI to help special education students manage the psychological burden of moving from teacher to teacher with an individualized education plan (IEP).

The project was inspired by listening sessions with high school students who receive special education services. It can be stressful and burdensome for students to explain their needs to each new teacher, ensuring that their accommodations and goals are being met.

Dr. Sharine Carver, the district's executive director of special services, said the goal is to “empower students, reduce that psychological burden and put them in the driver's seat of really understanding their IEP and being able to advocate for themselves.”

Diana Eggers, the district's director of educational technology, said the IEP project is different in that it goes beyond seeking efficiency in existing activities to instead build AI for a new purpose.

“How can we use AI to reshape what we do?” Eggers said. “We're not there yet, but we need to figure out how we can do that.”

All of the districts are navigating the unknown in one way or another. Jane Broom, senior director of Microsoft Philanthropies, who grew up in Washington public schools, told the group that they are on the front lines of an unprecedented transformation.

 “This is the fastest change I've ever seen, and this company is one that changes constantly,” she said. “These last two or three years have been pretty unreal.”

The 10 Microsoft grantees range from Seattle, the state's largest district with about 49,000 students, to Manson, a rural district in Chelan County with about 700 students. Collectively, the grantees serve about 17 percent of Washington's K-12 students.

Broom pointed to a major gap in AI usage across the state, with more than 30% of the working-age population using AI in the Seattle region vs. less than 10% in some rural areas. Microsoft highlighted this divide when it launched the Elevate program last fall.

The opening session Thursday morning came with an additional reality check: National research presented at the event showed that even the most ambitious districts are still in early stages, and struggling to answer a basic question: is any of this actually working?

Bree Dusseault, principal and managing director at the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, presented findings from a national study of early-adopter school districts. Her team surveyed 119 systems (with 45 responses), interviewed leaders at 14, and profiled 79 for a database of districts pushing ahead on AI adoption. 

The picture that emerged was mixed. Districts have moved quickly to put infrastructure in place, but significant gaps remain:

Infrastructure is largely in place. More than 80% of districts in the national survey have the technical basics like devices and broadband. About two-thirds have data privacy protocols and dedicated AI staff. Six in 10 have a formal AI policy.

Evaluation is lagging far behind. Only 24% of the surveyed districts have any system for measuring whether their AI efforts are working. Only 9% have updated learning standards to reflect new student competencies.

The work is overwhelmingly focused on teachers. Every early-adopter district in the study trains teachers and approves them to use AI. Fewer than half provide any training to students. Only 16% engage parents or families.

Students are already moving on their own. A separate RAND/CRPE survey from September 2025 found that 54% of students use AI for schoolwork. Among high schoolers, 61%. But only 19% report getting any guidance on how to use it.

Most early adopters aren't using AI to rethink education. About two-thirds of these districts are using it to do what they already do more efficiently. Another 30% are using it to support existing reform efforts. Only a handful are trying anything fundamentally new.

Addressing that last point is the idea behind the AI initiatives that got under way last week. The districts in the Microsoft program will work on their projects through the next school year, running through June 2027.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

Consider a successful mid-sized American city. One with decades of population growth. Median household incomes on par with or exceeding New York City. A bustling port in a prime location. Bold civic architecture. A vibrant arts and cultural scene. And home to some of the world's biggest and most valuable companies.

That could be Seattle. It also describes Cleveland about 75 years ago. In the 1950s, Cleveland was an epicenter for the era's “Big Tech.” Industrial giants like Standard Oil, Westinghouse, Republic Steel, and Sherwin Williams were all founded in Cleveland. Like engineering outposts in Seattle, other leading companies including General Motors and U.S. Steel were well represented locally. 

Yet Cleveland's success unraveled remarkably quickly. Within 20 years, when the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969, the city was seared into history as “the mistake on the lake.” The population has declined by 60% since 1950 (and is still shrinking). Cleveland has gone from the seventh largest U.S. city in the country to the 56th. Median household incomes are now less than half the national average — and less than 40% of the Seattle area. 

Today in Seattle tech circles there is great trepidation about the region's next act. Seattle is not punching above its weight in the AI era the way we did in the software era. We might not even be punching our weight.

Entrepreneurs, executives, investors, and technologists are departing, either because they don't think they can be competitive here in the white-hot AI market and/or are concerned about a deteriorating business environment. And the exodus appears to be accelerating.

You might take solace that our little corner of the country hosts two of the world's five biggest companies (which is a little crazy). But it is easy to believe both Amazon and Microsoft are past peak employee count, as they become more capital-intensive and lean into AI-driven productivity. Other local tech companies and engineering centers are also shrinking, while new job listings have plummeted. 

While the tech sector confronts existential dread, the political class in Seattle and Washington state seems oblivious. They don't have much to say about creating jobs or nurturing industries of the future (or even of the present). Revenue is their focus above all else, with considerably less emphasis on how our taxes translate into efficient and effective provision of government services.

The traditional Seattle civic partnership between business and government has frayed. Few lessons have been learned from Boeing's slow-motion migration out of the Seattle area (Washington is now home to just over a third of Boeing employees, and due to decrease further).

Relations between the tech industry and government are rocky, with the industry seen almost exclusively as a bottomless source of revenue. It would be shocking — but not surprising — to one day learn Amazon and/or Microsoft are moving their headquarters out of the state. (Bellevue already looks like Amazon's HQ1 in all but name).

The tech boom has been an immense boon for Seattle, as the city attracted talent from all over the world. Seattle's population has grown by almost 40% in the 21st century, and the City of Seattle rode that tailwind. The city's inflation-adjusted budget grew over three times faster than the population over the same period. 

That growth raises some obvious questions. Are city services three times better? How long can government spending keep outgrowing the population? What happens if population growth slows — or even reverses?

Meanwhile, city issues loom large in the desirability of doing business in Seattle. Downtown is barren, with record vacancies. Public safety, housing and homelessness are perennial hot topics, but progress is scarcer. After the recent election, we're apparently going to take another shot at those persistent problems with progressive panaceas that have seen limited success, both locally and elsewhere. 

Completely missing from any discussion is the crisis in our schools, where the majority of fourth and eighth graders in Seattle are not proficient in reading or math. Education is one of the most effective solutions to many social ailments — and a mandatory prerequisite for an advanced civilization — yet we've seemingly given up.

Which brings us back to Cleveland. When its fortunes began to shift, Cleveland's politicians made a bad situation worse. A confrontational, short-term posture from government made it easy for companies to put Cleveland plants at the top of their closure lists. Contrast that with another Rust Belt city, Pittsburgh, where politicians and business worked together to accept and manage the inevitable transition. They defined the post-industrial playbook for cities — one Cleveland belatedly adopted. 

Seattle has always been a lucky city. Prosperity has often come from unexpected sources. The Alaska gold rush was, quite literally, a gold rush. Bill #1 (Boeing) made Seattle synonymous with aerospace. Proximity to Alaska gave us a competitive container port, while rival ports like Portland and San Francisco dried up. Bill #2 (Gates) catalyzed a software industry in Seattle (and beyond). Jeff (Bezos) famously drove to Seattle in his Chevy Blazer, where he pioneered e-commerce and created a million and a half jobs along the way.

Maybe the luck holds and the next big thing just shows up. It could be space, energy, robotics, biotech or something unimaginable today. Hopefully we get lucky again, but hope, as they say, is not a strategy. 

So I'll offer a catchphrase as you think about Seattle's next act: Don't be Cleveland.

(I want to be very clear that I mean no offense to Cleveland. The people there today are still digging out of a hole created decades ago. Let's learn from them and not repeat the errors of their forebears.)

Edit to answer myself: Looks like this is more of an offshoot of the FreeHL projects by the same author, which rewrite GoldSrc game logic to QuakeC to get those games to run on open source engine stacks, where the utility is more obvious. I guess it was just fun to see how hard it'd be to get HL2 content running.A bit similar to the OpenMW project working on Oblivion and Skyrim content loading on the side, though perhaps that's a more obvious future vector for that project.

Funnily enough the looks of this HL2 through this engine makes it flow more with HL1 than I could expect; an interesting reverse Half Life: Source / Black Mesa / demake of sorts.

https://moddb.com/mods/half-life-dark-futureYou won't confuse it with modern Half-Life 2, but the original HL2 engine had far worse graphics than the latest version. Makes you realize how much of the difference between HL2 and HL1 is due to different textures and level design.

edit: there is also the fact that map compilers for gold source games have advanced far beyond what they could do back in 1999. The lightmaps and light sources alone can be far more intricate nowadays than what you would get from the official valve ones in 1999.

It was either ZHLT or VLHT, or something like that; looks like more alternatives have been written since then.https://gamebanana.com/tools/5391https://github.com/seedee/SDHLT

For standard Q1 mapping ericw tools [0] is great (the page has some nice previews).This project seems to use Nuclide for building which by default uses vmap compiler [1][2]. Which is really Q3 but I think FTE handles that well internally as the newer format has some more modern features.> Powerful BSP compiler.

Now you can just kind of pile it into a block of RAM, aim a chunky ASIC at it, and pull the trigger every frame.In the late 90s a mate of mine did a phenomenal video of a Quake demo (you could record all player movements and camera positions as a ""dem file"") that he'd rendered out, raytraced in POVRay. I printed it to VHS for him as part of a showreel, and never thought to keep a copy myself.

GZDoom/UZDoom is a similar grey area, it is built on the original Doom codebase but they've added so many features that it's practically its own distinct engine now. Those forks can even render arbitrary 3D models, which OG idTech couldn't do until Quake.

reply

But it is the same overall code structure, the same game, etc.All these oss quake engines, are they quake? Ironwail, quakespasm vkQuake?

Not without modifications but Half-Life: Source is essentially a tech demo to show that they can be ported easily (if you are OK with dropping some pesky features like randomized wall textures).

I see impressive stuff with reimplementations such as Surreal Engine, but they will require far more powerful machines.If Surreal had a software renderer (not requiring AVX or similar) running under an SSE2 machine, that would yield even more respect, because if your reimplemented engine runs in legacy machines the portability would explode. Just have a look on Scummvm on how many platforms and OSes can it run. Or the Super Mario port for PC, where some fork supports even 3DFX under DOS, and GL 1.2. Thus runnable under TinyGL with no 3D accelerators and even under Plan9/9front with custom tweaks.

Seems to be using a dnsft.cloud.zyxel.com certificate. Is this a home router?

reply

Seems like you or someone upstream of you uses a Zyxel brand device that has some kind of dns content filtering enabled.  You should be able to get around this on a given machine by configuring an alternate dns provider (dns over https, cloudflare's 1.1.1.1, google's 8.8.8.8, quad9's 9.9.9.9, etc.) or doing something similar at your own router/dns resolver/dhcp server if it's not the thing doing this.

Financially the cost?
I pay about 6,000 a month in daycare. 2k a month in healthcare expenses.Then community wise. Every time I've gone to take them to the movies, or to a restaurant or hell now even the grocery store I always get shafted. Everything is so overstimulated and kids get in the way to strangers trying to ignore reality with their phones. So when one of my kids throws a tantrum everyone's looks and disdain doesn't help. It's a part of growing up that I think most young adults don't realize.Then for your career it's the most destablizing thing there is. Everyone around me who doesn't have kids the sky is the limit. Midnight PR's and no problem handling oncall. I missed a pagerduty alert when I was careflly bottle feeding my 8 month old who caught pertussis from some idiot who thought they were above that. I had no choice in getting out of pagerduty because 'it's only fair'Don't get me start on dog/cat people who equate their struggles to mine... or people who have no idea how hard life is already for a kid who is disabled.Having a family sucks hard sometimes. But I wouldn't change my past for the world. They are my everything. The advantages of having kids are lost on most but I'll let others provide input if they feel like it.

Going out to eat? Going on vacations? Sleeping? Your own health? Your finances? Say goodbye to all of that for 5+ years if you have kids, even more if you have a special needs child.And despite all that, we love them and we want to have them, and probably the vast majority would do so again. And we will have our children to keep us young-at-heart, learning, active, and to help us in old age. Many of our child-free friends are going to go through a lot of loneliness when they're old, while we'll have the vibrancy of a family life.

I've seen this ""kids are insurance against loneliness"" logic repeated often, but I don't believe this bares out in reality. I personally know plenty of child-free older couples who remain quite happy and social. I also know plenty of parents whose kids don't speak to them anymore or whose children have lives on the other side of the country/world. Anecdotally the loneliest older people I know are ones who have put it upon their children to keep themselves from loneliness.> And despite all that, we love them and we want to have themAs a parent I always find it funny that we need to add this to every statement of frustration of family life (I'm not critiquing you, I also say this every time I mention any frustration about parenting).

Similarly, I find it practically impossible not to meet people literally every single time we go to e.g. the park. The kids want to play with other kids, we meet their parents, and it's basically an endless source of friendships - even better because it's other parents who probably live relatively close to you enabling you to start setting up aforementioned ideas.

If you're with your spouse, what I do is pull them out of the store until they calm down. Sometimes I wait in the car and my wife comes to the car because she is done shopping. I then remind them that they put themselves into that situation.

reply

My sister did this too until it got to be nearly as much as her entire salary so then she stopped working again and became the daycare. And that is super hard when your children have special needs. I think the worst may be that in-between area, where working and paying for daycare still seems to make sense financially because you take home more than you spend on not being at home but the net practical result is working for a very low effective salary to also spend less time with the children, which is its own kind of utterly draining.

reply

Further if either parent loses their job you can quit daycare until they get a new one.  Single income families are far less resilient.

reply

Some might say this is selfish, but on the other hand it's kind of weird to expect anybody to commit to that for the sake of some other party, whether that be society, the government, peers, or parents, particularly when none of them are doing anything of substance to help mitigate those impacts in exchange.And that's without even touching the financial security angle. It's unpleasant to have to struggle and scrape by as an adult, but absolutely terrifying when there's children involved, and for most couples the likelihood that they'll need to struggle at some point is much higher if they have children. It's understandable that people don't want to risk that if they don't absolutely have to.

Nah, I think that it is just selfish, and that it's the least weird thing in the world to expect people to commit to sacrificing some things for the sake of their children.You must have been led to these conclusions by ideas (perhaps labeled “individualism” or similar). Like all ideas, someone had to invent them, and these particular ideas surely have not been widespread for even 100 years.

reply

It's worth noting that such a degree of sacrifice wasn't always associated with raising children. It used to be much more hands-off and less financially burdensome — responsibilities were split between grandparents, other relatives, and the town/neighborhood, and after the youngest years kids could (and were expected to) spend their time outside unsupervised doing kid things. This gave parents much needed breathing room that no longer exists, thanks to the ongoing stranger danger panic that was kicked off in the 90s, people needing to move around to have a shot at getting a decent job, systematic destruction of safe third places for kids and teens, and pressure to control and structure every moment of each child's life.So I don't agree that it's individualism, but rather a natural response to financial and societal forces pushing ever more of the burden onto the parents' shoulders. We've created a world that is actively hostile to children and asking parents to just eat the resulting vastly increased costs.

Smart people see when doing something will require swimming against the current for extended periods, however, and opt to not put themselves in that situation. The problem isn't that people can see this and act accordingly, but the direction of the current. The direction of the current is what needs to change.

In reality everyone who's thinking about having kids exists on a spectrum of what's possible: either it's going to be really easy for you (because you're Elon Musk and you don't give a fuck) or it's going to be borderline impossible (because you're infertile, or you're broke, or whatever).Just because someone looked at the odds and said ""you know what, maybe this isn't a great idea"" doesn't make them selfish. Meanwhile you're the one imposing your worldview on them...

Personally, as someone with capital, having people who also work hard for less salary is beneficial. Most native born Americans are much poorer than I am so I understand their fear of the competition. Nonetheless, for me immigration is a great way to increase the population.

Except that Latin America also has a fertility rate below population replacement and taking working-aged people from countries that are already in that position is likely to be extremely destabilizing, not to mention unsustainable because it implies those countries would be undergoing long-term depopulation.We need to figure out why people aren't having more kids everywhere and there's not really anything else for it.

Even for blue collar immigrants working undocumented in the US, a large portion were formerly lower middle class before the states they lived in either failed (eg. Venezuela) or quasi-failed (eg. El Salvador, Honduras).I remember seeing a similar trend as a kid - we used to see plenty of college educated Mexicans and Argentinians Engineers working blue collar jobs in California because of both their economic crises. When the worst of their economic crises ended, those that didn't naturalize chose to move back to the old country.

Things are a lot more stable than when I first visited South America 21 years ago. In every city on every block there is new construction in Bogota, Lima, Curitiba.Moreover, the economic impact of having skilled trained labor returning from years of training how to lay brick, roofing, construction, welding, farm management, cooking in 2 star Michelin restaurants, and other industries is going to continue to fuel the growth. (I could understand building a wall to keep the skilled labor form leaving.)

I do personally know people cite climate change as one factor in having no kids (or fewer kids).  Some people even think that having kids will make it worse.  They're not wrong...

Raising a kid as an atomic couple apart from extended family and community is a horrible experience for the parents. It takes a village and all that. Parenting is utterly exhausting if you are doing it alone with a partner and responsible for every waking moment of childcare.You see this in immigrant communities in the US. The demographics with the most children universally are those with ""old world"" style family and community situations. More or less communal child care without the weirdo expectations that the ""richer"" parts of society has on parents. Parents are allowed to actually be adult human beings with real lives that are not hyper-scheduled to death. Kids tend to be more independent and ""roam"" between family and friends without official activities being scheduled every day for them. Ironically this typically results in more engaged parenting overall.That's my theory at least - it's not much better than anyone else's though.

It's simply a matter of the social position of mothers, or, what defines the social status of women in a given society. In much of the world it's educational attainment and professional status, so it surprises me very little that most women in these countries don't want children, or can easily find an excuse to not to.

Of course, it could also be true that a certain level of affluence and freedom for women simply results in a strong downward pressure on birth rates, which is what I think is most likely. (I am not advocating for rolling back women's rights).

Both parents probably need a bigger car, especially if you have 2-3 kids.  If you have grandparents that help out, they need the same.

If you wanted to pull a purely financial lever, you'd have to give couples enough money to offset one partner's income plus a lifetime of lost income due to the years spent outside of the job market.IMO this would be perfectly fair and reasonable, considering they are raising a future lifelong taxpayer, but that kind of long term thinking is challenging.

Probably not. A vast majority of families in the US raise children without a nanny. If the ""only"" preclusion is 'I don't have enough money to hire a nanny' but becomes satisfied, the requirements will likely evolve to something greater and continue indefinitely.

They would need similar support as well and it's a tower of nannies all the way down (it truly does take a village to raise a kid).More critically, assuming that you need a housekeeper or nanny in a two parent working household is legitimately ridiculous.

That leaves a lot less years to have kids.  Personally I started late just as in my example, and I'm very fortunate to have three kids, but I probably would have four if we had started a little earlier.  If you subtract one kid from every family you basically get what we're seeing.

reply

90% or more wanted to have kids. But the ones that started after 35+ or didn't have a partner until that age did struggle a lot, and many never managed even after investing 10a of thousands of euros on fertility care.They prioritized lifestyle and career before family. Then it was too late to have both.There might be many metrics to measure fulfillment in life, but if I had to choose one, I would probably stick with love. And nothing fills my love cup more than having a large family. YMMV.

Daycare is to parenting as processed food is to nutrition.  They are modern developments that prioritize economics over quality.A study done in Canada (a ""natural experiment"", where a lottery determined eligibility for free daycare and allocated it at random) allowed researchers to track children who were enrolled in daycare versus children who were parented by their mothers, found that (adjusted for income) the infants who lost out on the lottery and were raised by their mothers in early childhood were healthier and better adjusted adults years later.

Then please explain why birth rates throughout human history, when life was vastly more difficult and dangerous than it is now, were so much higher?Nobody had to meet this bar you set before.  Let's just be honest here.  There were three recent developments, all of which were, by themselves, good things.  But those three things, combined, created an unprecedented phenomenon.The 3 things:1.) The birth control pill decoupling sex from pregnancy.
2.) Women being granted autonomy and being allowed to join the workforce and leave marriages without suffering economic and social destruction
3.) Social support programs to create a poverty safety net funded by taxpayers instead of charityNo society on the planet ever had these things until the mid to late 20th century.  And these things all contribute to radically reduced birth rates, in every single society that has implemented them together.This take of ""all you have to do is make the society encourage family formation"" makes it sound like the three developments I listed are irrelevant, and that humans always just had this explicit menu of options that made family formation an optional pursuit, independent of a good life.  That is simply not the case.We need to be honest with ourselves about the uncharted territory we're in.  It's not simple.  Modern humans live in what would have been historically viewed as a Utopia.  Our ancestors 5 generations back would have viewed our ""jobs"" as fake.  They wouldn't even recognize what we do on a daily basis to earn food and shelter as labor of any kind.  We have entire metropolises filled with people with soft hands who have literally never had to participate in their own survival from the perspective of harvesting food or cooking/heating fuel.

To override this, society needs to make having kids be “cool.” It's that “simple,” but there's no real way to coordinate that in society from the top down without being authoritarian.So it's a problem that can only be solved by individual change and convincing others one on one that it's desirable. And people don't like that.

PR comes to mind. 
They managed to convince millions of people that smoking is 'cool', we just need another Bernays to do the same for having kids.



Has any society successfully done this yet?Basically, the only prosperous first world groups I see with fertility rates above replacement rate are religious subcultures (like the Mormons, Evangelicals, and Modern Orthodox Jews in the US).  I simply don't see any other examples of being able to pull this off.

I agree with this. I also believe that modern people have become substantially...hmmm...dumber about expenses like food? People think it's impossible to make delicious nutritious meals quickly and cheaply, but in fact it's actually very easy and you just need to actually consider it as being possible, and you need to be willing to spend 5-10 minutes of effort. It's appalling to me the number of people who think that cooking anything beyond boiling water is mysterious or who will argue that it's impossible to eat well on a budget by pointing exclusively at niche products that only exist to satisfy a drive for extreme novelty and ignoring staples.

My son is now 19 years old, and doing very well financially (he chose to join the Army).  I taught him from a young age how to shop and cook on a budget, in a healthy fashion.  Started with hard boiled eggs, beans and rice, chicken and broccoli.  Those kinds of things.I also taught him (by observing his teenage friends) to always always always refer to DoorDash as a ""Burrito Taxi"" to help mentally reinforce the utterly absurd level of luxury you are indulging in when you have a human being drive a 3500 pound vehicle to your home to bring you a single meal prepared by somebody else.The number of people I encounter who struggle financially (including one of my sisters) who indulge in these practices is insane.  Our culture has forgotten that eating at restaurants (at least in the West, unlike say Singapore) is historically an expensive luxury, due to our relatively high cost of labor.

There's only one developed country with a birthrate above replacement and that's Israel, which is hardly a paradise. Largely due to Ultra-Orthdox Jews, who believe they have a religious duty to have children. Empirically religion is the only thing capable of making people in rich countries want many children, and religiousness is partially heritable so eventually the problem will solve itself as the secular-inclined genes are bred out of existence.

I've had glimpses of this part of Twitter spill into my feed. It was always obvious that everyone was just using fertility as an excuse to push their chosen hobby horse. The logic barely mattered, they just used it as a reason to push their ideas.From hanging out with younger generations (tech biased) I have a different perspective: A lot of the younger people I talk to just have no idea what it's like to have kids or a family in reality. They grew up when Reddit was hardcore anti-kid and /r/childfree (remember that cesspool?) was hitting the front page and their feeds every single day with unhinged takes about parenting and child raising from angry people who weren't parents.When I had kids a lot of the younger people I was around acted like they needed to give me condolences because my life was over. Then when I was actually happy and fulfilled they thought I was lying to them or secretly harboring resentment that I couldn't share for social reasons. Like they genuinely couldn't believe that I liked my kids and spending time with them. Years of Reddit has convinced them that all parents were unhappy and full of regret.

But one thing for sure is that despite wars and terror attacks, the mentality is that they are living the best life. Instead of living among Arabs as dhimmis or the disposable ""other"" among Europeans, they are a nation again and have the power to defend themselves.

Meanwhile, the curb is full of extra large SUVs idling with kids just waiting inside the cars.  The long line of SUVs extends all through the neighborhood.  My son and I are alone because people just won't leave their cars until the doors open.  A vast majority of the kids live within one mile of the school.It's just one small anecdote, but I feel like it illustrates an attitude I've seen.

Anecdotally, when my work schedule was wonky for a while I would do the same with my kids. Those few extra minutes hanging out with them in the morning were something I valued a lot. We got to talk and relax a little bit after the rush of getting ready in the morning. They had all day to spend with their classmates so a few extra minutes in the morning wasn't going to change much.A suggestion: If you want to make friends with other parents, morning drop off is the worst time to do it because everyone is going from the rush of morning routines and mentally preparing for their jobs. After school is better, but the best is at events and activities away from school hours completely. Our schools have done parent socials that have been great for meeting people. Sports and activities are also a great way to get introduced to other families.It also helps to be the one leading the charge. We'll do things like go to the museum or other activities and then send invites to 5+ other families. Tell them to invite other families.

What I'm saying is that there are a lot of forces keeping people solitary and anti-social.  This is just one of them.  I know for a fact that some of these families waiting in their SUVs live a short walk from the school.  Yet still they choose to isolate themselves.  Sometimes the kids in these cars are literally yelling out the window to my son because they're friends.  I don't want him going close to the cars because they've LITERALLY been pumping out pollution for 10-15 minutes (those early spots are very coveted). I have to tell my son to hold his breath when we bike on the empty sidewalk past these idling cars.  It all just feels very anti-social and dystopian.Sure, school drop off is just one small aspect of life.  But because of drop-off culture, there are certain people who I may NEVER have a chance to interact with.  Imagine if those parents instead walked with their kid.  Maybe I would make a new friend.  Maybe we'd have a nice conversation.Last year there was another woman and her son waiting with me.  They walked to school every day.  We became friends just through school drop off in the morning.  It brought some happiness into my life and made me feel a sense of community.  She could have chosen to get in her car and wait in the long line of SUVs like everyone else, but luckily she didn't.By essentially saying ""stop caring about school drop off and look for other opportunities"" it feels like you're missing my point: building community means showing up in lots of different ways, and consistently.  The school drop-off example is just one example of many.  A woman who lived on my street since the 80s said that back then nearly everybody walked to school.  By switching to a car-based morning drop-off feels to me like we've lost something, even if it's just a small thing

Last week I arrived by car right near the beginning of dropoff time.  Pulling in right in front of me was the mom of one of my kid's classmates, carpooling with another kid who lives in the same apartment complex.  The three of them met up as soon as they got out of the car, and then another one of their friends (who lives across the street from the school and usually walks) joined them from his driveway.  They met up with a 5th friend before they crossed the street.Then I walked - well, more like ran - with the 5 of them down the 111 steps that take us from the street level to the schoolyard.  When they reached the bottom, they met up with 3 more friends who had just been let out of the drop-off zone in front of the school itself.  Said a quick goodbye to my kid, but he wasn't really paying attention, he was already ensconced in his pack of 8.I've gotten there with my kid before drop-off time, walked down the stairs with him, and there's been a pack of about 20-30 kids and 2-3 parents usually milling around before the school gates open.I realize that this is somewhat atypical in 21st-century America, and we specifically chose this community because, well, it actually has a sense of community, but it's not unique.  In preschool I'd take my son over to his preschool bestie's house (she lived about 2 cities away), and there'd be a whole pack of kids roaming the neighborhood going over unannounced to each other's houses.

People do what works for them within their budget, which often is a larger vehicle when you have kids. If you want to translate that as ""speed and comfort is of the essence"", then fine. I could say the same about someone with no kids who prefers living in a highly urbanized area because their definition of speed and comfort is different.And virtually no one is thinking ""I need to demonstrate my belief that traveling on foot is only for weirdos OR exercising"" when purchasing a vehicle, both because not many (to be generous) people think that in an area with sidewalks and because it's just not relevant.

There have been two tragic deaths in which ICE (or BP) agents seem to be at fault, but the victims were not just ""out and about"" and making that claim is incredibly disingenuous.[1] https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-...

Having somebody link to a source that directly refutes their own claims, while acting indignant, is something I've experienced multiple times in the past week! It's quite shocking.When the Trump administration went so hard on open lies that are directly contradicted by videos we all saw of ICE events, it was vice-signaling that started even greater amounts of bearing false witness. Openly lying seems to signal ""in-group"" status these days, like the sign in the green grocer's shop[1]. Get people to lie about the evidence they see with their eyes, and the become completely controlled, because to do so is to have total subservience to their master. No more eyes or ears except for those of their master. People that used to have values slowly abandon them, all in service to the lie that they are living. ""The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.""That is the state of the US at the moment. I have hope that we can return to our former sanity, or at least ensure that the reigns of power are in the hands of normal, centrist people instead of the extreme fringes, but it is in no way certain.[1] As Carney recently referenced from Vaclav Havel; here's a recentish essay on it: https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-v...

Having a source that makes a false claim as a headline but refutes their own claims, while acting indignant, is extremely common in a media landscape that wants to signal their ""in-group"" status.

About 11 years ago I went on a bus in Rochester, NY. It was bizarre to me that every person in the bus (about 12-15 people aged between 18-25 maybe) were buried in their phones. No one was talking to each other, not looking outside, nothing. I had the latest iPhone but since America was new for me I mostly spent time looking at the world around me and talking to people. I felt sad that the social world had come to this.Fast forward to now and this is what I see in India too. Talking to random people in their prime years (maybe 18-30) is now 'weird'. But it's perfectly fine if it's via 'insta' or 'snap'. I can't imagine how much worse it's now in America in that age group. I know my pre teen nephews have withdrawals if I take away their devices here in India.The moral here is that procreation requires better social skills and strong presence in the world and good parenting will probably create that. In order to raise an offspring, people need to have good mental health and that generally leads to good physical health which in turn improves the mental health and so on which can lead to procreation etc. The scrolling and virtual world is a distraction from reality. Something that keeps away humans from each other. We will only see this getting worse. In India the social world is still good enough to see higher birth rates. But that is also now slowing down. Mental health of people is not great. People complain about being single but there is virtually no way to hold a conversation as getting their attention is impossible. Phones are glued to their eyes and hands even when sitting with you.I am hoping though things will be different in the future.

The imaginary people inside your magic box are perfect, on demand, and don't complain or otherwise bother you when you put them away.What porn is to love, social media is to, well, darn near everything else. Once we perfect donuts over TCP/IP we'll all be perfectly round and content and never need to interact with anyone else.

They are actually not. In fact once you work on your mental health, you'll find real people the only kind you'd want to talk to. But the real people actually working on their mental health (part of it is reducing device usage to bare necessities) are quite small unfortunately. But I am hoping that will change.

Dealing with real people in real situations is dirty and messy and not ""video-game perfect"" like Instagram likes et al - but in the end it is real and you end up discovering that your rough edges have been worn off in the great river of life - just as theirs have been.In fact, I'd argue that a vast portion of the ""mental health crisis"" is just that - we're not dealing with each other so we're not learning how to deal with ourselves.One of the best ways to ""grow up"" if you will is to have children - because they ARE real people but darn if they're not messy and sometimes insane; you have to learn to deal.

The decline in birthrates isn't related to growing living standards, as poorer countries also have declining birthrates. Turkey has a lower birthrate than the UK, and Mexico has a lower birthrate than the US. Places like North Africa and South India have seen declines in birthrates comparable to the West.He makes the argument that declining birthrates are due more to a fall in coupling than a fall in people in relationships choosing to have kids. He brings up that birthrates would actually be increasing if marriage rates remained constant. This means that all the incentives countries push such as subsidized childcare or tax breaks to have kids are putting the cart before the horse, as a growing share of young people don't have a partner to have kids with to begin with.He then brings up that the fall in coupling a country experiences is roughly correlated to the rate of mobile internet usage in that country. 46% of American teens say they use social media ""almost constantly"" vs. 24% a decade ago. People would rather use social media than go out and meet others. He points to South Asia as an example, as it's experienced a relatively smaller decline in marriage rates, and mobile internet usage there is lower than in the rest of the world.I suppose it's yet another way that cell phones are impacting society.

""Counselor!"" Riker is at her side instantly.""It's... it's too loud, Will,"" she whispers, her face pale, sweat beading instantly on her forehead. ""It's not voices. It's not emotions. It's... flashes.""She squeezes her eyes shut, but the tears leak out. ""A billion images of felines. Dancing figures. Arguments without context. Tragedy mixed with absurdity. It's a scream, Spock, but it's a scream about nothing.""Motion sickness of the mind,"" Spock observes, looking at his readings. ""A precise description. You are attempting to find a focal point, Counselor, but there is none. The signal is not radiating from a central broadcast tower. It is a mesh network of pure dopamine.""He turns his tricorder to the crowd. ""Fascinating. They utilize a tight-beam UHF protocol—what the archives call 'Bluetooth 17'. It ensures that no signal ever touches an unintended recipient. They have achieved perfect privacy, and in doing so, created perfect isolation.""They could have warp drive,"" Riker mutters, looking at a mag-lev train passing silently overhead, filled with slumped, blue-lit figures. ""Look at this infrastructure. The power efficiency alone...""They do not want warp drive, Commander,"" Spock says, closing his tricorder with a snap that sounds like a gunshot in the quiet street. No one flinches. ""Space travel requires looking up. Warp drive requires a destination. This species has already arrived.""Troi looks up, her eyes bloodshot, trembling. ""We have to leave, Will. Please. It's... sticky. The thoughts... they want to be thought. They're hungry.""Riker taps his badge. ""Enterprise, three to beam up. Now! Lock on to my signal, not the ambient noise.""[The Bridge]Back on the ship, Troi is in sickbay, sedated. Spock stands at the science station.""Status on the planet, Mr. Spock?"" Picard asks, looking at the viewscreen. The planet is beautiful, blue and green, peaceful.""It is a tomb, Captain,"" Spock replies, his voice devoid of judgment but heavy with implication.

While economic concerns may be worsening the issue - I don't think they're the root cause as many would like to say.I think the root cause is that we have outsmarted our biology. Once you give people education on the risks of sex and pregnancy, a focus on consent, easy access to contraceptives, knowledge of the responsibilities of child-rearing, and a world of other activities and pursuits - they simply stop having children at or above replacement rate.Once given the knowledge and choice, humans do not have enough children to sustain a population.No one wants that answer because it means we can't just blame it on [[CURRENT_PROBLEM]]. And it means there are no real 'solutions'.People in their 20's will see peak world population in their lifetime. It will be fascinating to see how society changes over the decades that follow that.

At some point, in first-world society - averaging across different societies and social support systems, and considering the numbers in aggregate - we flipped. Pessimism about the future outweighs optimism. Downstream of that flip, the prevailing trend changed. Here we are.

And yes, there is a big income disparity in the US. However, the fact that labor has practically doubled is another thing.

I think our financial/defense systems are not prepared for population decline, so I foresee a lot of turbulence.The new left will call for more immigration and more globalism to avoid wars, but will have to deal with integration of swaths of immigrants.The new right will call for closing of the borders and double down on AI doing the work of producing and defending, but will have to deal with the fact that AI will not be ready for that.

- Scare media about the cost of having children- Scare media about the environmental impact of having children, even calling it irresponsible for the planet- Scare media about the state of the world aka ""how could you bring a child into this"" when, at least in the western world, we have the highest standard of living in human history.- Scare media about motherhood, things not working out with your husband, kids being brats who don't respect you and constantly living in a house of sadness.- Scare media about fatherhood promoting the idea of women having a baby just to hook the father for child support and the divorcing him.- Scare media about having to trade your career for a familyAll of this while growing up and realizing more and more, by talking to everyone around me, people older than me, friends of my parents, my other friends in their 40s and on down the line...there is nothing in this world that brings people more joy than their families and their children. Nothing. It's devastating for the people who I know who can't have children despite all of their attempts and even then tends to lead to adoption in many cases.All of the narratives, trend marketing and media capitalize on a story that people have been invested in pushing for decades that is at worst an outright lie and at best a half truth to accomplish some political goals.People need each other. Men need women. Women need men. Children need both parents. And we are all better for it. No matter how broke you think you are or how much you think it will cost, you will figure it out together. People do this all the time with less than you have ever had in your life and they make it work. Together. And it's worth it.

Men need women. Women need men. Children need both parents. And we are all better for it. No matter how broke you think you are or how much you think it will cost, you will figure it out together.

Having a kid is just an unfathomably large commitment. If you bring a kid into the world, I believe you're responsible for creating the conditions where that kid can grow into a healthy, well adjusted adult, and that's seemed like an increasingly impossible commitment for the past few decades.

It's also enormously stressful and expensive. We're stopping at one where in past times a family like ours might've had 2-3. There are a variety of reasons, but cost in money, time, and housing are big factors. I'm very well off compared to most Americans, so I can see why if you're even marginally on the fence it has tipped into a no.""Make it work"" is a great thing to say on the internet, but not very good advice to people who are one broken down car or health issue away from not making rent, which is a LOT of young Americans.

Counterpoint: Yes, you're giving the standard apologetic we all hear from parents. However, plain and simple, objectively it's typically the most stressful thing you will do in your entire life. It's so bad the US Surgeon General had to put out an entire advisory paper about it[1]:> 41% of parents say that most days they are so stressed they cannot function and 48% say that most days their stress is completely overwhelming compared to other adults (20% and 26%, respectively).[1] https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/parents-under-pressu...

And if we're talking about having children in the context of history: for basically all of history except the rounding error of the past century, children were your social security/pension/401k rolled into one. Children were literally your property, a form of wealth and certainly not a sacrifice.

At the limit, not growing the productive population puts younger generations in a position of existing solely for the purpose of serving the non-productive population. At some point, they will simply choose to opt out and the whole thing collapses.

But productivity for productive people is increasing. Is there an assumption that retiree spending is also going to increase to match?Realistic solutions look something like: 
- we increase productivity of the working population
- we lock or decrease the per-year, per-person spending on retirees
- we decrease the % of their lives that people spend retired

Yes I believe this brings up one of the more poisonous elements of social security, even if it is worth it.  It completely decouples the mutual assistance where the parent and grandparent form a symbiotic relationship in the interest of raising the child.  Instead of a quid-pro-quo, the government violently enforces a one-way transaction and the older generation can simply tell the younger generation to kick rocks.Obviously I don't think the elderly have any responsibility to do daycare or fix things, but the fact they can simply not do so while demanding the counterparty still keep up their end of the bargain -- has consequences.  If the older generation can tell the younger generation to kick rocks, then the younger generation ought to be able to tell the older generation they can kick rocks back to whatever private savings/investment they have.

Of course, many actual families do NOT go to extremes, and in fact USE the social security they get to help fund the grandchildren, in all sorts of ways. But you have to actively fight against the status quo to do so.It's interesting to note that even though everyone 'knows' you don't pay SS payments into some account somewhere that is drawn from later, it's transfer payments now - it is still marketed and sold as the former.

Declining populations are trickier for most economic concepts though. Less labor, less consumption. That said, a slight decline can leave more houses unoccupied which can be good. A major decline would mean so many unoccupied houses that you would have broken and abandoned houses though because it would be too costly to deal with the abandoned units.

We certainly take advantage of things like free preschool; but if we look at it objectively (and ignore benefits to the child) it consumes more time than if we didn't use it - getting him ready, walking him to school, picking him up, etc. Since it's free, we look at ""time spent"" and it's something like 2-3 hours spent to ""get"" 3 hours.

reply

It takes about an hour to get breakfasted, dressed, and ready which we would be doing anyway. Counting the walk both ways it's about 30 minutes of extra time for 8 hours of childcare.Unless your commute is just huge I can't see that math being true.

I am not worried about a population decline, to be honest. Even disregarding AI, improvements in technology and food production mean we can leverage resources in a way that would seem like magic to the people alive when my grandparents were born. I would rather take care of the people we have in this world - the whole world, not just my country - than see more people born into slums and poverty.Even if there is a cliff, I don't think it's an existential crisis. I say without irony, I believe the market will adjust. Wages will go up in jobs that are needed, and workers will have more leverage and more mobility, socially and geographically. It's hard for me to see that as a bad thing.Even if you believe that technology will let us keep pushing the earth's  carrying capacity indefinitely, to what end? It doesn't seem like anyone has a real plan for expanding beyond 8 billion that isn't just a promise that we'll figure it out when we get there. We aren't taking care of the people we have now. Never mind the ones yet to be born.I don't want to live in Brave New World and I also don't want to live in The Dosadi Experiment. And I don't want to condemn the future people to live like that either. I know those are works of fiction, but both seem plausible (in the general sense) at this point.(Edit: not Brave New World. I am thinking about a story where people lived in dense arcologies with tight surveillance and social control surrounded by robotic farms. Sorry I can't remember.)

Childcare in/around Zurich is (was 2 years ago) 2500 - 3000 CHF / month (lower prices after ~18 months). This is and isn't expensive. The list prices are high, but so are salaries (and taxes are low), and this is cheaper than rent (for 1 kid). Not subsidized.In Slovenia, the full price is about 700 EUR / month, subsidised up to 77% by the government (i.e. by high-earners, effectively a double-progressive taxation with already high taxes).What you get for that price in Zurich? A lot! Kindergarten starts at 3 months and can take care of kids for the whole work day (7am-18pm). Groups are tiny and lots of teachers - 3 adults per 12 kids. Groups are mixed age as well, which I think are preferable. You also get a lot of flexibility - e.g. half-days (cheaper) or only specific days per week (e.g. Mon-Thu). Jobs are equally adaptable, a lot of people work 80% (so Friday free, spend with kid(s)).In Slovenia, the situation is much worse. 2 teachers per 12 or even 20 kids (after age 4), age-stratified groups, childcare finishes at 5pm (but start at 6am, if someone needs that...). Children are only welcome after 11 months of age. No flexibility at all. This is all for public childcare - we also looked at private, but generally you pay more (1000+ EUR) but get ... not much more. Maybe nicer building (not even), but groups are equally large (IMO biggest drawback).So as far as childcare is concerned, Switzerland is IMO much better.But where Switzerland fucks you, is elsewhere. As mentioned, tax is low, so that's a plus. But there's minimal maternity leave (hence kindergarten starts at 3 months). If women can, they take more time off work, but not everyone can. What I wrote above about ""kindergarten"" only applies until 4 years of age, after which ""preschool"" starts, which is government-funded and hence free. Well, ""free"". It ends at 12pm after which you need to move your kid back into private childcare if you have a job.

At 4k-1st you often have shortened hours, so if you're a working parent you need to arrange for transportation or be able to take long lunches, etc to move children from one place to another.This ""gap of annoyance"" happens right about when you'd naturally be looking at a second or third kid as a possibility - I wonder how much effect it has on people.

This is the key - but ""support"" often gets converted by the modern world into dollars - but there's no rational way to pay someone else to be the parent.You need support to be much more than just monetary payments - nobody would think you're ""supporting"" someone going through a mental crisis or drug addiction by giving them a giant ball of cash; it might HELP in some way, but it's not really the totality of support.Anyway if someone wants to send me a small portion of $280 billion I'll have more kids, you can even get pictures of them now and then!

The article ""The End of Children"" (published in The New Yorker, March 2025) explores the global phenomenon of plummeting fertility rates, examining why traditional explanations and policy solutions are failing to reverse the trend.
Here is a summary of the key points:
 * Economic Support Isn't Enough: The article challenges the popular liberal argument that fertility decline is primarily caused by economic insecurity or a lack of childcare. It points out that Nordic countries like Finland and Sweden—which offer generous parental leave, ""baby boxes,"" and flexible work cultures—still face declining birth rates similar to or lower than the U.S. Even in places where childcare is free (Vienna) versus expensive (Zurich), fertility rates often remain identical.
 * The ""Achievement Culture"" Trap: The definition of ""affording"" a child has inflated significantly. In many wealthy, educated circles, raising a child now implies providing a suite of expensive advantages—individual bedrooms, travel sports, private lessons, and organic diets. This ""intensive parenting"" model means working mothers today actually spend more time on active childcare than stay-at-home mothers did in previous generations, making the prospect of parenthood feel overwhelming.
 * Political and Educational polarization: There is a widening fertility gap based on politics and education. Democrats and those with higher degrees are significantly more likely to be childless. This is partly attributed to the extended time required for education and career establishment, pushing childbearing to later years when it is biologically more difficult.
 * Failed Government Interventions: The author highlights various aggressive attempts by governments to boost birth rates, such as Hungary's tax exemptions for mothers of four and South Korea's numerous ""happiness projects"" and subsidies. Despite spending fortunes, no modern nation has successfully reversed a low fertility rate back to replacement levels.
 * A Shift in Meaning: The article concludes with a philosophical reflection on how children have transformed from a natural part of life into ""variables"" in a high-stakes lifestyle choice. They are increasingly viewed through the lens of identity and personal fulfillment, leading to a culture where parents fear judgment and non-parents fear being seen as selfish, intensifying the anxiety around having children at all.

Sure we talk a big game, everything is 'for the children' obviously. However, we publicly divest from schools, we invest in technologies that devalue humans and human labor. Growing up we make people believe they need to be millionaires just to not be swallowed up by the 9-to-5 meat grinder (this is true actually). It's no wonder young people don't value family when every signal in our society is telling them not to.

Don't agree with the supporting statements though.Parenting is just really hard, families need two parents working, birthing itself is expensive, even with good insurance, day care is 2k a month and it's not a good idea to skip it. Houses are expensive, raising a kid in a tiny apartment is hard, renting brings instability to your life. There is no serious parental leave for new parents.

I have seen what women go through to bring about a baby, and I would never do it more than 2 times, and that is only to give the 1 kid a sibling.I also would not partner with the bottom 20% of the population (as a man or a woman), for myriad reasons.If enough people think like me, then this results in a sub replacement total fertility rate, as the number of people with 3 or more kids will not be significant enough to outweigh the zero and ones.The only “solution” that seems like it could increase TFR to replacement rate, without violating people's rights, is getting rid of all old age benefits.

Then, people who have a child that young are far, far more likely to have additional children. Outside of the first few years, a sibling often reduces the strain on the parents, and provides additional value. Your life starts to orient around the kid(s), and we get a couple of other hormone boosts so we love them and want more of them.I am consistently confused that this conversation never seems to touch on just how many births are mostly because two people's biology overrode their judgement and that initial failure results in a feedback loop where you have another child or two. If that poor judgement doesn't happen, you don't kick off that loop, and then you're trying to rationally choose to do something that never made all that much sense in the first place.

I think in many ways our cardinal sin is that in the interest of legibility (especially for tax purposes) we've regulated our ability to employee people and to get work to an absolutely insane degree. To such a degree in fact, that much of our economy relies on having a source of ""black market"" labor and indentured servitude in the guise of immigration.Where we flirt with danger is that we look at one side of this equation, the immigration side, but not the other, the labor side.

I don't have to pay general liability insurance on them. If they get hurt, they'll go to the emergency room. No sweat off my back. And I was getting paid less and less, because I was competing against people who were hired because it cost less to hire them or employ them... It's illegal, by the way.

Because what can an illegal immigrant do? They could in theory just rely on social services and entitlements, but I don't think anyone (including the immigrants themselves, for the most part) really wants that. They want to work, and to make money, and the law makes it very hard to do so legally, so they work illegally.All the barriers you mention are things that we put in place to ""protect"" workers, but at the same time create a black market that undercuts those very workers.As for the employers, sure, they are culprits here, but would you rather have them let the immigrants starve? That also does not seem to serve any social good. As for not paying workman's comp, for example, there is already enough paperwork and bureaucracy involved in hiring a legal worker where there are systems that support and administer those programs. If you wanted to offer a workman's comp lookalike for illegal labor as a social service, then that would multiply the effort and cost by a huge factor.

We all lose when these immigrants are deported, and every mass deportation means simultaneously a mass deprivation of rights and a mess of big mistakes that ruin people's families and lives.

I think that yes, they should be deported. This is not a punishment.If your solution is that they should not be deported, but employers should be prosecuted, then you're saying that you want the immigrants to starve.If your solution is that they should not be deported, but we should extend labor protections to them and force employers to hire them legally, then I think there is some merit to this. This is closer to the libertarian open borders argument, and I once found it very appealing. Entitlement abuse is the main argument against here in my mind.

Sudden changes cause too much chaos, and you don't always know what works until you try it.

You are wilfully unaware.> For sure there are causalities when protests go from speech to violence or directly interfere with the ability of law enforcement to enforce the law.The protests and other resistance to the crackdowns have been amazingly disciplined in maintaining nonviolence. Shockingly good at it.Almost all of the violence that's actually happened has been both started and finished by ICE/CBP/etc.Not to mention the fact that the structure of the operations, and the organizational culture in which they are conducted, are obviously intended, at a command level, to create conditions for violence on both (all?) sides. And, yes, Those In Charge are absolutely responsible for that.When Noem, Bondi, Homan, Miller, Trump, and friends talk about ""violent riots"", ""domestic terrorism"", ""ramming agents with cars"", or whatever, they are lying. It's not a difference of interpretation. They are intentionally lying (except maybe Trump, who probably doesn't have enough of a sense of reality to be strictly lying). They have lots of allies who systematically spread their lies and add more. Don't believe anything they say unless you have personally seen and authenticated video. You have to authenticate it, because one of their favorite tricks is to use video of things that happened years ago, sometimes in other countries, and claim it's what their agents are reacting to. AI video isn't quite good enough yet, but they'll use that where they can. And of course they're also all about selective editing. And after all that they still ask you to ignore the evidence of your own eyes.If you are failing to be skeptical of notorious baldfaced liars, that's motivated ignorance on your part.> But your framing makes it sound like roving bands of beat down squads.In Minneapolis, yes.

I recently went down this rabbit hole a bit thinking this was the obvious solution and was surprised to learn that the Reagan administration legalized all illegal immigrants in the USA in 1986: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Reform_and_Control....State control over employment and borders in the US is just too weak to prevent people coming over and so 30 years later this leads right back to the initial state.

Any form of amnesty encourages the same behavior in the future.How many and what kind of immigrant visas is an open question. There's definitely a need for more workers in some fields. Healthcare in particular could be well served by importing (even more) doctors from around the world.What's not up for debate is whether we should be enforcing our immigration laws.  If people different laws enforced, then get the laws changed. There's no unfairness to the current laws. And flooding the country with cheap labor hurts the lowest tiers of the populace the most.

I think the reason the left became this way is due to neoliberals trying to fracture the left by getting center left people all concerned about social issues. Secondly, the left became completely disjointed and hopeless many years ago. Once the capitalists had completely thwarted the movements and fucked with the parties, the left collectively realized they really couldn't do anything against the economic engine that was running against them. So they were left with virtue signaling, woke shit, and so on as a means of trying to get some kind of change.The left of today is very soft and unwilling to engage in violence. At least in the US. I think abroad there are other movements that are willing to throw down and actually suffer for their principles. Americans aren't and I don't think we've ever had a real leftist movement here anyway. People will think Bernie 2016 is probably the closest thing we've had in 50 years and he's pretty mild…

the real reason is both boring and obvious: a very significant percentage of educated urban people in the developed world don't want children. both sexes have a very high number of very valid reasons for that, and it's utterly pointless to examine any particular one.and no, importing uneducated rural people from the undeveloped world won't fix shit, because their children too will be educated urban people. I think our young global leaders are beginning to realize that, hence the very recent shift from ubiquitous antinatalism of the previous decades to frantic nagging about our unwillingness to breed.it would take extremely dystopian measures to ""fix"" the birth rates, and no one, not even Russia and China are presently willing to go that far. Russia is, however, rapidly ramping up its authoritarianism to North Korea levels, so I assume it will be them who will be the first to ban contraception - the least insane measure that can make significant difference. and given how eagerly the West has been embracing Internet censorship, political violence against dissidents, social credit, and other hallmarks of authoritarian regimes in the past decade, I assume that after a few years of pearl clutching, they will follow suit.

That is, the message is ""unless you can give your children a perfect life, you shouldn't bother"".Certainly the main victory against birthrate worldwide has been the long process of eradicating teen pregnancy.> Easy access to contraceptives probably makes a significant difference tooThis is so basic as to be an axiom of the whole thing.

Except in real life, income is negatively correlated with fertility. Meaning, those most able to give their kids the ""perfect life"" are the least likely to have kids, while those least able to give their kids the ""perfect life"" are the most likely to have kids.

Another flash news for people who haven't had kids in daycare for a while - pricing for daycare means that for the first kid the mom could work and come ahead money wise. Second kid is about neutral (depending on location and salary, in some cases the mom comes ahead money wise, in other case she does not). Daycare pricing made us decide to have 1 kid - if we had 2 kids in daycare my wife would have been better off staying at home (which we could not afford and she did not want to do anyway).Access to contraceptives make a significant difference as well.

Another anecdote. Nobody in my extended family has more than 3 kids. My grandmothers from both sides had more. But the trend is pretty clear. Fewer kids for the modern generation. Regardless of the level of education and income. In fact, the lower education/income ones in my extended family have fewer kids.

If you're demanding it be all-or-nothing, then sure it is ""wrong"". It obviously isn't the only reason. As countries get richer, people have fewer kids.Is it a factor? Of course it is. Children are incredibly expensive if you subscribe to modern norms and expectations. There are many, many, many people who want kids but can't afford it, and if they do have a kid it's prohibitive having more than 1. Two is basically financial suicide for many. And to be clear, I have four children which is a luxury of being in a financially rewarding career at the right time, but even still it was unbelievably tough making it happen.""anecdote: my grandmother had 17 siblings""Standards change. You understand that, right? If you're middle class in 2026, the expectations around having and raising a child are very, very different from someone sixty years ago. People generally aren't keen on having six kids sharing a room these days. Even bunkbeds are considered poor by many. Now since both parents will have to work, account for childcare, massive vehicles, education savings, and so on.

We (need to) invest more into their education because uneducated children/adults have little or even negative value as workers (especially to their parents), this was not the case two centuries ago.Children appear to be a ""luxury"" nowadays because there is no longer any expectation that they ""net contribute"" to their family economically (might be a positive change ethics-wise, but this is a huge shift in incentives for parents).

This is at the root of ""it's too expensive"" - what are in the ""needs"" column has vastly changed.It is very likely that if you want a large family, one spouse (usually the mother) is going to have to stay at home, or at most work very part time - at least until all kids are into school. The costs otherwise simply don't work out unless you have ""free childcare"" from grandparents or other family members - which used to be quite common.The easiest thing to do is unsubscribe from modern norms and expectations - but this is a personal decision and too hard for many.

I think this is it.  Watching children bore me to death.  I enjoy it for about an hour and that is it.  The child doesn't appreciate having someone hover over them and the parent has better things to do than play children's games all day.When I was a kid kids would walk home by themselves, spend all day either at school or playing outside, basically parents are there to provide general guidance, food, housing, a few luxuries, and protection.  But none of this insanity where it is negligent if someone is not watching the child 24/7.The biggest regret I have about parenthood is I envisioned it as it was when I was a child, and failed to take note that nothing that was allowed when I was a child is allowed anymore, someone will rat your ass out to CPS lickity split.  This mean the child gets little of the independence and neither does the parent get a chance to give it to them.  It's made me horribly, horribly sad on so many occasions to the point I've begged my spouse to let us move to another country where children can actually experience a childhood without the busybody enforced-by-law-helicoptering nonsense.If I could parent children under the standards of the 1960s, or in most foreign countries with more liberal standard on the age appropriate independence of children, I would happily have a few more.

You look at some of the most third world places in the world without strong economic security, yet somehow they manage to have babies at a higher rate than Western countries do.

Hell, in many countries in Europe, they basically throw money at anyone having kids and their birthrate has plummeted which would indicate that economics is not only reason.

reply

Would be an interesting experiment to actually pay people to have kids - i.e.: financially reward them in accordance with the costs involved. I suspect, as with an actual liveable UBI, the results would differ radically.

reply

And even if you're not that poor, you get subsidized kids through things like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. It's annoying that while some of those support 3+ kids, many ""top out"" at three and stop increasing.I've often thought of searching for ""sponsorships"" for additional children (though we'd probably have them anyway) - not sure I want my son to be named Facebook X AI though ;)

Even within Western countries income is negatively correlated with fertility - those most able to afford kids are having the least number of kids.

reply

For example, in 2022 Hungary was spending 6.2% of GDP on such incentives[1], but this only managed to bring total fertility rate up to about 1.6 [2].It is the same everywhere else. The real reason fertility has declined since the sixties is because people have access to effective birth control.

Why have Danes turned against immigration?...In October the finance ministry, in its annual report on the issue, estimated that in 2018 immigrants from non-Western countries and their descendants drained from public finances a net 31bn kroner ($4.9bn), some 1.4% of GDP. Immigrants from Western countries, by contrast, contributed a net 7bn kroner (see chart). Data on immigration's fiscal effects were what “changed the Social Democrats' point of view”, says Torben Tranaes of the Danish Centre for Social Science Research.Muslims are at the core of the issue. This year was the first time the ministry reported separately on the contributions by people from 24 Muslim countries. They account for 50% of the non-Westerners, but 77% of the drain. Alongside that worry are fears that Muslims bring notions about democracy and the role of women that Danes find threatening. Muslims are welcome, says Mr Tesfaye, but, “We can't meet in the middle.

The biggest drag on government budgets in EU are socialized healthcare and retirement costs. At this point we know healthcare costs are severely backloaded, with most spending coming out of the last 10 years of someone's life. Regularizing now allows them to show a fiscal boost now and for next 4-5 years(edit: maybe even like 10-15 years) and accumulate a massive liability as they age.Think about it this way: If you regularize a 30 year old illegal migrant right now with a path to citizenship over next 10-15 years, the government NPV is positive over a 15 year horizon(whilst he works) and then will go flat to negative as he starts using the healthcare system whilst retired.

""His administration is focused on delivering on his promise to reduce the immigrant population and argues, despite the protestations of economists, that doing so will mean greater opportunities and wages for native-born workers and will reduce the cost of everything from housing to health care by reducing demand.“There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws,” says Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.""

If there is such a labour shortage, what explains the layoffs?

I believe humans and jobs will be able to accomplish more, with less people and have better margins - and thus be able to be paid much more.I am an optimist that these trends together, when managed and harnessed well, can make us better paid, less stressed, and with more free time.

This isn't the worst though, I recently went through an interview with another startup company, and after six interviews and a take-home project I found myself getting the same generic rejection. The CEO went out of his way to tell me he didn't like my resume since I've had to hop around a little bit to stay employed.Concerns that should have been handled in the initial call, somehow get pushed back till after I've wasted monumental amount of time.Things are looking up though, I'm starting a job soon and the entire interview process was more or less a 30 minute phone call with the technical manager. That's it, two days later or so I had a verbal offer. I don't need to change the world, I need to pay my rent.

The short stints on a resume is likely not the only reason you didn't get to 100%, but unfortunately you should know that it's seen as a pretty bad signal. The general expectation is 2 years minimum at a gig. If you have multiple short non-contract jobs it raises the concern that a candidate doesn't commit to their jobs, or that they don't do well at their jobs and are getting let go.

Company A got their funding pulled and shut down. Company B, where I was actually at for about a year and a half, switched owners and shutdown my entire office. Company C merged into it's main competitor and effectively fired most of us.I will admit I was at one fantastic job and after around 3 years I probably could of stayed indefinitely. But back then I didn't recognize the value of a solid job. If you land somewhere and you're well liked by people, and able to do quality work, you really should just stay there instead of chasing slightly more money.

Sure, but one would think then the rejection email would have specifics around the interview and where the candidate did not perform well. Not nit picking on the job hops. If job hops were a deal breaker then why waste the candidate's time putting them through full rounds of interviews?

SCOTUS has found non-protected categories can still be protected because they are ""proxies"" for protected categories. One of the classic examples of this are zip codes[0], which was found to be a proxy for race, because it has a ""disparate impact"" on people of particular races.For some people, the 'wrong vibes' are often proxies for cultural things - all kinds of body language contribute to vibes and it's easy to accidentally (or on purpose...) discriminate against a whole categories based on vibes. If you tell a candidate ""Hey we just didn't like your vibes as much as this other guy"", it could affect your exposure to claims that you discriminated against them based on their race.0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Housing_an....

As they say, you can't get blood from a turnip.Writing this comment reminded me of a personal experience, story time:Many moons ago I interviewed at a mature startup in silicon valley, they shipped a tiered storage appliance and were in the process of pivoting to a new storage medium (think transitioning from spinning rust to SSDs, something like that).This was in-person, and everything went swimmingly well, before departing they stated an intention to make an offer and I should expect an email w/offer attached within a week.  I got an offer letter, and accepted immediately, as I was super excited about the stack I'd be playing with.A week before the start date I get a call from a founder, they said I couldn't start because their funding round didn't come through.  The economy was going through some sort of financial crisis and it was one of the many blood baths where silicon valley startups shuttered by the hundreds overnight.  So in essence, this was a job I got fired from before I could even start, wee!What followed was a pretty frustrating few months of interviewing and not getting anywhere.But there is a silver lining to this story, that founder who called me sat on the board of other storage startups.  One of them managed to get some water in this funding desert, and its founders reached out to me at his recommendation.  I ended up building some great stuff over 4-5 years at that company.

It wasn't just the Jonathon Blow episode; that was just the point where I said ""this is frustrating.""  For what it's worth, frustration came from knowing that this could be really good: your perspective is valuable, your topics were interesting, and your guests were excellent.I find this a common mistake that people with strong opinions have when doing interview/guest style podcasts or shows.  There's really an art to it; it's not easy to engage guests, keep the show interesting, and let the talk move in interesting ways.  That's why Terry Gross and Howard Stern, in very different ways, have had such long and storied careers.But it's something that people definitely get better at, and I have no doubt that you have.  Again, I'll give it another listen.

For an organization that has definite goals and have to ship a product by a deadline, a flat structure can surely be detrimental to any progress. In an environment of competition (from outsiders) and scarcity, a flat structure will only create either chaos or an implicit form of hierarchy that is even more cruel than what should have been.

I don't think the Tyranny of Structurelessness is arguing in favour of hierarchy, or against other forms of organization than hierarchy.I don't think it's arguing against ""flat"" or ""anarchy"" style organizations either.In essence, I think it's asking us to do whatever we're doing better, more honestly, more effectively, and less stressfully.  By acknowledging, clarifying, communicating, and seeking to understand the real operating structures, what's really going on.  And then to improve them, using that understanding.An actually flat organization might be good, I don't know.  I've never seen one.  I've been in some that claimed to be flat, and became stressful places to work, for the same usual reasons hierarchies can be unpleasant, including incompetent bosses (not called bosses).  But I've also had some pleasant experiences in flat organizations, and I prefer it that way, if it's designed and run well.

Didn't companies historically own their own compute? And then started offloading to so-called cloud providers? I thought this was a cost-cutting measure/entry/temporary solution.Or is this targeting a scale well beyond the typical HPC cluster (few dozen to few hundred nodes)? I ask because those are found in most engineering companies as far as I know (that do serious numerical work) as well as labs or universities (that can't afford the engineers and technicians companies can).Also, what is the meaning of calling an on-prem machine ""cloud"" anymore? I thought the whole point of the cloud was that the hardware had been abstracted (and moved) away and you just got resources on demand over the network. Basically I don't understand what they're selling if it's not what people already call clusters. And then if the machine is designed, set up and maintained by a third party, why even go through the hassle of hosting it physically, and not rent out the compute?

Historically, companies got their compute needs supplied by mainframe vendors like IBM and others.  The gear might have sat on premises in a computer room/data center, but they didn't really own it in any real sense.> Basically I don't understand what they're selling if it's not what people already call clusters.Is it really a cluster when the whole machine is an integrated rack and workloads are automatically migrated within the rack so that any impending failure doesn't disrupt operation? That's a lot closer to a single node.

Traditional hosting still, to some extend, struggle to provide the API, on demand, drive requirements for modern developers, who expect to be able stand up a bunch of virtual machines in a minute or so, especially if you also want a new private network, maybe some IPs and storage pools.Having a single provider for your entire stack, software, hardware and network avoids the annoying back and forth with vendors, blaming each other. Having just one support contract for your entire stack is a pretty large plus.

There is some company who for reason X and Y rather (or are obligated to) do on-prem for their hosting needs. But setting up a full (or several) racks, with all the required equipment for proper networking, storage, etc, can be quite the hassle. And if you want cloud-like functionality (completely API manageable virtual network, VM, storage pools, ...) it's another can of worm. Having a ""plug'n'play"" cloud-like system on-prem that do not require several engineers who know 10's of different vendors tech is definitely worth the premium for those company.

If the answer is no, then you might own the hardware on paper, but you don't control any of the software that makes said hardware useful.If the answer is yes, on the other hand, then one must ask who is paying for those updates, because that can't be sustainable.

reply

Two points about your last point. First, software improvements benefit all customers; as the business grows, the effective cost per customer shrinks. Also, most customers grow their Oxide deployment or will replace hardware after a depreciation cycle. The sustainability of investments into the software (and the product generally) is on solid ground.

They also need to grow and iterate faster. Their software stack is great, but their hardware is quite dated in a fast moving industry. This limits them to domains that value their software and security but don't need the latest hardware for performance and aren't necessarily concerned with performance per dollar, which is a small market.

Their hardware is multiple generations behind at this point, however. I wonder if they're starting to reduce the price because it's hard to justify paying so much for old hardware. They could just be targeting customers who don't care as much about performance or efficiency as they do the software stack.

No it's not. Normally if you're buying server hardware you don't start with a CPU that's already 5 years old and last-generation RAM that isn't even manufactured at scale any more.CPUs have advanced a lot in recent years. The jump from Zen 3 to Zen 5 is very substantial.

One could be forgiven for thinking that automation tools would make arduous tasks redundant, and make work more relaxing overall. But this elides an important law of the universe: the ratchet of productivity only turns one way. That is, it's a modern day truism that if automation—AI or otherwise—makes any sort of positive change in your work life, you'll feel a sort of squeezing sensation, and additional work will materialize to erase any momentary feelings of relief. According to a case study highlighted in some “in-progress research” from Aruna Ranganathan, who teaches management at UC-Berkeley and Xingqi Maggie Ye, a Ph.D. student who is part of Ranganathan's Berkeley program, AI “intensifies” work, and certainly doesn't make people's days easier.It sounds, in other words, like hell on earth. If that is, paradoxically, what you want in your workday, then you probably work in a place like Silicon Valley, or even at OpenAI, where CEO Sam Altman has described AI's ability to intensify his own work in ways that make him sound strangely awed and humbled (even as he expresses little to no regret about his ambition to annihilate knowledge worker jobs). “I don't think I can come up with ideas fast enough anymore,” he said in an interview in October of last year, adding “I think it will mean that stuff just happens faster and that you can… that you can try a lot more stuff, and figure out the better ideas quickly.”  Altman's experience may resonate with the workers mentioned in the article about Ranganathan and Ye's research for Harvard Business Review. They describe an eight-month study into generative AI's effects on working life at a company with about 200 employees. Employees “worked at a faster pace,” the authors write, covered a “broader scope of tasks,” and found themselves working “more hours of the day, often without being asked to do so.” This was a workplace that, Ranganathan and Ye explain, didn't mandate AI use. It just made enterprise AI tools available. This doesn't sound like a 200-person workplace where widgets were being glued together. Instead, many of the roles described in the article involve engineering, writing code, and communicating in Slack, so it's safe to say these were knowledge workers and software engineers, quite possibly making use of tools like Claude Code. 

Due to AI, many of Ranganathan and Ye's subjects, it seems, started expanding the scope of their jobs, usurping one another's roles, and taking on roles coaching others on coding, or correcting their vibe-coded work. Hiring new employees may have been postponed or circumvented altogether, because employees “absorbed work that might previously have justified additional help or headcount.” Workers also, it seems, furtively fed tasks into their AI tools while they were ostensibly in meetings, and submitted prompts while on breaks, while waiting for things to load, or while they were supposed to be having lunch. How you interpret this case study is going to vary. If your workplace is a startup in “founder mode” and everyone in your office is working punishing hours in exchange for equity in a company that everyone hopes will be a unicorn, I'm guessing you'll probably love the sound of this—particularly if you're a CEO/founder and you're planning to become a billionaire. That's far from a universal experience, however. According to a 2024 Pew survey, about half of U.S. workers reported that they were either somewhat satisfied or “not too/not at all satisfied,” and the other half said they were “extremely/very satisfied.” That “extremely/very satisfied” group shrinks from 50% to 42% when the respondent has a lower income. That survey also found that far and away the most satisfying aspects of a job according to respondents are other humans, with 64 percent reporting being “extremely/very satisfied” with their relationships with their co-workers. Skills development, meanwhile, ranked low, with 37 percent reporting being “extremely/very satisfied” with that aspect of a given job.

So I don't get the impression that fewer people, having to learn to do more things, and work that seeps into breaks will help most people's job satisfaction, but maybe I lack a certain kind of vision. In other words, if instead of building an app, you're someone who works as, say, a hospital receptionist or a school administrator, you're probably not all that stoked about a hypothetical where hiring is postponed, you have to do other people's jobs, you'll work on your breaks, and instead of getting new, helpful software, you're getting enterprise AI tools so you can make your own software. But let's not assume that all tech workers love this kind of productivity theater, or that the sense of greater productivity in Ranganathan and Ye's case study is necessarily anything other than an illusion. An anonymous worker at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike wrote into the newsletter Blood in the Machine last year, and said workers at that company “have been encouraged to handle the additional per capita workload by simply working harder and sometimes working longer for no additional compensation,” and that “While our Machine Learning systems continue to perform with excellence, I have yet to be convinced that our usage of genAI has been productive in the context of the proofreading, troubleshooting, and general babysitting it requires.” According to this person, “The net result is not a lightening of the load as has been so often promised,” and “Morale is at an all-time low.”

These days, artificial intelligence can take notes during doctor appointments, boost your confidence in school, and help detect cancer (though LLMs are bad at reading clocks). Now, new research has turned to AI to understand a potential ancient game board.

In the hands of a non-expert, the oval artifact doesn't look like much of anything. However, geometric patterns on one of its two broad sides, along with other clues, suggest it to be a stone board game. In a study published today in the journal Antiquity, researchers used artificial intelligence to test this theory, as well as identify what the game rules may have been.

Those who came before us enjoyed board games, just like we do; the pastime dates back to the Bronze Age, at least. The problem, however, is that the components of many of these games were not nearly as enduring as Monopoly's houses and hotels will surely prove to be. As such, the stone object that came to light in Coriovallum—a Roman town in modern-day Netherlands—could be a rare opportunity to investigate ancient nerds.

“We identified the object as a game because of the geometric pattern on its upper face and because of evidence that it was deliberately shaped,” Walter Crist, lead author of the study and an archaeologist at Leiden University specializing in ancient board games, explained in an Antiquity statement. “Further evidence that it was a game was presented by visible damage on the surface that would be consistent with abrasion caused by sliding Roman-era game pieces on the surface.”

There's only one problem. The aforementioned geometric pattern doesn't align with any game known to researchers. To investigate the matter, Crist and his colleagues did what many people faced with a question tend to do these days—they asked AI to give it a go. Given the artifact's human-caused abrasions, the team used AI to model potential game rules.

“The damage was unevenly distributed along the lines of the board,” Crist said. “We sought to answer the question of whether we could use AI-driven simulated play as a tool to discover playing rules that would replicate this disproportionate pattern of use wear on the surface of this board with rules similar to those documented for other small games in Europe, thus confirming that the object was likely to have been a game board.”

The researchers had two AIs play a large number of ancient European board games, including Scandinavia's Haretavl and Italy's Gioco dell'orso, until they landed on one that could have caused the stone board's wear-and-tear.

This approach ultimately revealed a match with blocking games, a kind of board game whose objective consists of blocking the other player's movement (just like Ticket to Ride, if you play like my fiendish partner). It also bolsters the preexisting theory that the artifact was a board game after all.

“This is the first time that AI-driven simulated play has been used in concert with archaeological methods to identify a board game,” Crist concludes. “This research provides archaeologists with the tools to be able to identify games from ancient cultures that are unusual or uncommonly played, since current methods for identification rely on connecting the geometric patterns that make up the playing surface to games that are known today from references in text, or from artistic representations of them.”

Interestingly, previously known traces of blocking games only appeared in Europe starting in the Middle Ages and are overall very rare in the region. In other words, the study suggests that people may have played these types of games centuries earlier than researchers thought.

All that's left to discover is how many tears were shed and friendships broken over the movement—or not—of pieces on this board.

If you've been waiting for a reassuring answer to the question “Why does Kimbal Musk seem like he was so close to convicted sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein?” here you go:

This post is related to the Epstein Files and why my name is in them.In 2012 I started dating a woman who was 30 years old. I met her through a friend. Epstein did not introduce us. My only meeting with that demon was in his New York office during the day. I never met with him…



Kimbal Musk is a Tesla and SpaceX board member, and also happens to be a restaurateur, businessman, and the younger brother of that one guy. His name is in quite a few emails and documents in the latest batch of Epstein disclosures from the Justice Department. One impression a reasonable person might get from looking at the Epstein documents involving Kimbal Musk is that Epstein was aware of at least some of the details of his romantic life, knew his partner well, and that Epstein planned to spend—or at least was considering spending—a great deal of time with them in many locations around the country back in 2022 and 2023. But as laid out in an X post from Musk on Monday night:

If this 2012-era newsletter was just Kimbal Musk using his normal email client to send out emails to “thousands of people” instead of using something like Mailchimp, that would be somewhat weird, but not unheard of, and there's a conceivably universe where that could at least partly explain why Epstein was on email chains with him. I say “partly” because it doesn't fully clarify all the reasons for the October 7, 2012 email in the files in which Kimbal Musk emails two people—an associate of Epstein and Bill Gates named Boris Nikolic, and Jeffrey Epstein, and writes in part:

“Great to hang out today.Jeffrey and Boris, many thanks for connecting me with [name voluntarily redacted by Gizmodo]. I believe you both played a role. :)”

…to which Nikolic replies in part:

.“Kimbal — just fyi — you better be nice to [name redacted] 😉Jeffrey goes crazy when someone mistreats his girls/friends. So better be very nice to her.”

…to which Musk replies in part:

“Jeffrey: Message received wide and clear. 😉Seriously, I am very happy with my time so far with [name redacted]. She's great.”

For that matter, Musk's explanation doesn't completely satisfy my curiosity as to why Epstein had a Google Calendar reminder from shortly before those emails about an event in September called “kimba musk, birthday four seasons,” which occurred the Saturday after Kimbal Musk's birthday.And it could leave the public with some lingering curiosity about why Epstein received an email a few weeks later on October 26 purporting to be the schedule of a person with the same name as the apparent “girl” mentioned in the October 7 email. That list spans fall of 2012 through January of 2013, and includes items like “Kimbal in NYC,” and this “Kimbal” character is mentioned five times total. Kimbal Musk is a major shareholder in Tesla, and has sold or exercised options when the price appears to be peaking multiple times according to Electrek's Fred Lambert. Forbes placed his net worth at about $700 million in 2021.Musk was a board member at Burning Man from 2019 until this year, when he left amid the Epstein controversy. He was also a board member at Chipotle from 2013 through 2019.

Last week's phenomenal episode of Starfleet Academy shone a spotlight on the legacy of the Sisko family throughout the years after Deep Space Nine—but it's hard to celebrate the life of Ben Sisko without at least one of his closest friends. But the decision to bring back Dax and the symbiont's latest host was apparently a decision that put all the pieces of the puzzle together perfectly.

“Series Acclimation Mil” introduced to Professor Illa, a seemingly Cardassian teacher at the academy whose course focused on seemingly unsolvable questions like the true fate of Captain Sisko after the events of Deep Space Nine. Encouraging the titular Sam in her journey to explore Sisko's past, it's eventually revealed that Illa is in fact Illa Dax, the latest host of the Trill symbiont that had spent so many years across various lives, from Curzon to Jadzia to Ezri, being one of their beloved Benjamin's closest confidants.

But according to episode co-writer (and Lower Decks star) Tawny Newsome, the addition of Illa as a Dax specifically wasn't initially on the table. “I love Professor Illa, who was constructed by me and Kirsten [Beyer] and she was meant to be the perfect shepherd for this story. It was so important that we had someone who it made sense that she would have the only copy of Jake's book,” Newsome recently explained to Collider. “A lot of intentionality went into who could this be? And then when we all kind of went, ‘Oh, you know, the Trill lifespan could be this long. This could be Dax.'”

Star Trek: Discovery had previously established that symbionts could live for a very long time, especially if they took breaks from being joined to a Trill host by living in their natural habitats on Trill, the underground pools of the Caves of Mak'ala. In DS9, for example, it was revealed that Dax itself was born and lived in the pools for 150 years before joining with its first-ever host, Lela—but now we know with Illa palling around in the 32nd century spreading the good word of the Sisko, the Dax symbiont is now one of the oldest in Trill history.

“It really excited Noga Landau, our showrunner. It excited all of us. And we went, ‘Okay, yeah, let's make this Dax,'” Newsome continued. “And then, as I said, I was the last piece of the puzzle [laughs] when they said, ‘Okay, and Tawny is going to do it.' It was quite a surprise, I think, for all of us. But I had really great support from showrunners and from Kirsten.”

As much as it would've been an interesting reflection, 800 years later, to see a Cardassian woman carrying on Sisko's legacy considering their people's history with him and the aftermath of the occupation of Bajor, making Illa a Cardassian-Trill hybrid (equally as interesting, perhaps, with Starfleet Academy‘s preponderance for hybrid characters in its cast!) so she could be Illa Dax was a perfectly sentimental way to amplify what the episode was saying about Sisko's legacy.

A class action lawsuit brought against G.Skill, maker of some of the best RAM for gaming and general computing applications, has been settled to the tune of $2.4 million. The company was sued over claims that it deceptively advertised and labeled the speed of DDR4 and DDR5 memory kits sold between January 2018 and January 2026. The company denies all wrongdoing, and the case was not decided in court.

As per documents from the case, the initial class action lawsuit was brought over claims ""that G.Skill deceptively advertised and labeled the speed of its DDR-4 and DDR-5 DRAM (non-laptop) memory products with rated speeds over 2133 MHz or 4800 MHz, and that G.Skill is liable for violations of consumer protection statutes and breach of express warranty."" Specifically, the lawsuit seems to be about overclocking, noting plaintiffs represented allege ""they were lead to believe that the advertised speeds were 'out of the box' speeds requiring no adjustments to their PCs.""

Rather than take the case to court, both sides have agreed to a $2.4 million settlement. G.Skill denies the allegations, and the court hasn't decided in favor of either party, avoiding ""the uncertainties, burdens, and expenses associated with ongoing litigation,"" and ensuring class members get a payout sooner rather than later.

To that end, ""All individuals in the United States who purchased one or more G.Skill DDR-4 and DDR-5 DRAM (non-laptop) memory products with rated speeds over 2133 MHz or 4800 MHz respectively from January 31, 2018 to January 7, 2026,"" are part of the settlement class and eligible for payout. Court documents go on to specify that class members will be eligible for up to five qualifying purchases per household, provided you have proof of purchase.

As is often the case with settlements, a lot of that money has already been allocated. $295,000 in settlement administration costs, up to $800,000 in attorneys' fees, an undetermined amount of attorneys' expenses, and service awards to class representatives of up to $5,000 means that upwards of half the settlement pot has already been spent. How much you'll get if you're eligible depends entirely on how many class members there are, with the remainder of the fund split between them.

If you think you're eligible, you should head to the Claim Depot website and follow the instructions. You'll need to submit a claim form by April 7, or you can, of course, also submit an objection or indeed exclude yourself from the class by the same deadline.

Aside from the monetary payout, the settlement also includes provisions that G.Skill will take ""commercially reasonable efforts to implement changes"" to its packaging, website product pages, and specifications provided to retailers to make them more explicit about achieving top speeds with its RAM. The court documents state that rated speeds will be listed as ""up to"" speeds, and include the following disclaimer: ""Requires overclocking/BIOS adjustments. Maximum speed and performance depend on system components, including motherboard and CPU.”

As noted, the class action is only applicable within the United States, with payouts expected approximately 45 days after the court matter is all settled, notwithstanding any appeals or further process.

In my previous Rising Phoenix build, I ran a disclaimer that I was only here to stir the pot. Well, I'm back again, and guess what I'm here to do? For this latest build, I'm going to be breaking quite a few unwritten rules, but I'll explain why. Some rules were broken intentionally, and others were broken for us.

This time around, we're building a productivity-focused rig, featuring no AMD or Nvidia, and it'll be white!

A few months back, we published the Rising Phoenix, a gaming rig with a small twist, to kickstart the series. And for this build, we're going with a “Life Support” theme. When I first started collecting parts and writing this, it was October, and I thought this was a fitting theme for a spooky build – but I got buried in Tom's Hardware Premium Stout Owl build, and here we are in a whole different year, but the prices of RAM and storage are certainly still scary.

 




The aim of this build series is to inspire creativity, to build something a little more unusual, with another goal being to help you unlock your inner artist and turn your PC into something truly yours, but still something sensible and achievable. We aren't trying to offer the best value per dollar for these systems, but to showcase hardware that pairs well together, both visually and practically.

For the best value propositions, have a look at our Best Builds page.

 




For this feature build, we're not focused on gaming at all, but rather, a productivity-first rig. With the theme Life Support, this is a PC that's supposed to look like something you might find it in a medical laboratory. Or, you know, something used as a prop PC in a bad-taste Hollywood horror lab flick where the set designer is somewhat up to speed with custom PC hardware.

 




If you think laboratory, AMD doesn't come to mind. Intel does (or at least it does to me). Intel may currently be lagging behind in gaming performance, but when it's productivity you're after, Arrow Lake CPUs pack a massive punch.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The Core Ultra 7 265K features 20 CPU cores, with 8 performance cores and 12 efficiency cores. Clock speeds can spike to 5.50 GHz, all while maintaining very good efficiency, especially at partial and idle loads.

What's better is that it's currently priced around $300, and if gaming is not your priority, it offers a heap of CPU power for that money.

 




Sticking to the theme, for this build we're going with an Intel B580 GPU. It's a bit of an underdog GPU, which sounds strange if you consider that it's made by Intel, but the chipmaker is quite new to making modern discrete graphics cards (discrete: not baked in as part of the CPU).

What's interesting about the Intel Arc series GPUs is that they tackle a segment of the GPU market that AMD and Nvidia have been largely ignoring. This is a graphics card that is also priced around $300. And with Intel's XESS upscaling, it packs a solid gaming punch for the money. What's more important for this build, though, is that with Intel Quick Sync, it makes for a fantastic video encoder if you're into video editing. And 12 GB of GDDR6 memory is especially generous at this price point.

 




If you're looking for a value-oriented motherboard to pair with a high-performance Arrow Lake chip, the ASRock Z890 Steel Legend offers fantastic connectivity with tons of room for future expansion.

 




This is where the largest point of contempt comes in with this build. At the time I sampled this memory, the DRAM crisis hadn't hit yet, and it was a memory kit that cost about $250. At this price, it was a no-brainer to opt for 64 GB in a productivity build. Unfortunately, it's a kit that today sells for a painfully pricey $1349, and although I'm happy that it matches the design language of the motherboard, at this price, it's tough sell, and it massively changes the total build cost of this system.

For those who are into virtualization, data analysis, or video editing, it may still be worth justifying a 64 GB kit, but you may be better off hunting down a 32 GB kit without RGB from the Best Memory page to save some money.

 




Although the Kingston Renegade Fury G5 is one of the Best SSDs and we gave it a glowing review, it suffers from a similar issue that DDR5 does: It has become quite expensive. Priced at roughly $500 currently, I can only recommend it to those who know they need 2 TB and a drive that properly saturates the PCIe 5.0 NVMe bus.

If that is what you need, though, the Renegade Fury G5 is a beast of an SSD – it's got a shockingly high durability rating. It's also efficient, but most importantly, it just writes, and writes, and writes – this is not an SSD that fills up the cache and comes to a crawl – it's an SSD that handles sustained large writes with ease. This is an SSD that would go to waste as a system and game drive. It's the kind of SSD you want to write large datasets to, raw video footage, work off, and then clear it up again at the end of the day, over and over again.

 




For the case of this Life Support system, we decided to work with Fractal Design's new Epoch chassis. It's affordable at $110, well-built, and its charmingly simple elegance serves it well for fitting into the theme.

The mesh intake at the front ensures great cooling, and it's got plenty of space for building in. With top-mounted IO, it also serves well as a case for placing on the floor.

 




The Intel Core Ultra 7 265K is a beast of a productivity chip, but it can run quite hot when fully taxed for long periods. As such, a powerful liquid cooler is almost a requirement, and Phanteks' Glacier One D30 X2 is one that's more than up to the task. With a copper cold plate, aluminum radiator, and three D30 spinners, this is a CPU cooler that can tame the 265K without breaking a sweat.

The D30 fans are an RGB variant of the T30's, which are 5mm thicker than most other 120mm fans, giving them loads of airflow debit at low RPMs.

The cooler's CPU block also comes with a fan inside it, which blows some air to the area surrounding the socket to cool the VRM circuitry, memory, and the primary SSD.

 




850 W might be more than necessary for this PC, but power supplies run at their most efficient around 50% duty. Load up the CPU and GPU with typical workloads, and you'll sit just shy of this spot.

Be Quiet's Pure Power 12M series PSUs come with modular connectivity, and generally run quietly and reliably, year after year. The company also backs their PSUs with a 5-year warranty, and at $110, is there anything else you really want from a power supply?

TSMC on Tuesday held a board meeting where it, among other things, approved plans to spend $44.962 billion on building new fabs and upgrading existing production capacities. The approval is a part of the company's general plan to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, with the rest of the funding to be approved at a later meeting. In addition, the company promoted a developer of its 1nm-class process technology.

TSMC holds board meetings — where it approves things like capital appropriations, capital injections, or distribution of dividends — every quarter. However, the company usually attempts to approve its CapEx appropriations more or less evenly throughout the years. For example, last year the board approved spending of $17.141 billion in Q1, $15.247 billion in Q2, $20.657 billion in Q3, and $14.981 billion in Q4, with some of the funds to be spent in 2026 or even later. Approval of a plan to spend $44.962 billion is a record one and indicates that the company is getting more aggressive with its expansion, as well as its projects getting more costly, which is in line with the general industrial trend for fabs to get more expensive.

It should be noted that approvals of capital appropriations are not indicators of actual spending, but these are allowances for management to spend them on certain projects, which may or may not be parts of the ongoing fiscal year's CapEx. Yet, as TSMC's CapEx budgets are increasing year-over-year, so are capital appropriations.

Earlier this year, TSMC announced plans to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion on all-new manufacturing capacities, upgrading existing fabs, and building advanced packaging facilities. The contract chipmaker plans to spend between 70% and 80% of its 2026 CapEx on advanced process technologies, between 10% and 20% of the budget on advanced packaging and mask making, as well as approximately 10% on specialty technologies.

Accelerated spending on advanced fabs is designed to make TSMC unbeatable to Intel and Samsung Foundry when it comes to availability of the state-of-the-art production capacities. If the company has considerably more capacity than its rivals, it will be more likely to land big orders from big customers. If TSMC has slightly more capacity than its clients need, then the latter will unlikely outsource even a part of their production to competitors.

Another notable happening at the meeting is the promotion of S.S. Lin — who is currently senior director at TSMC's research and development organization responsible for the development of the company's A10 process technologies (1nm-class) — to a vice president status.

The promotion is likely a sign that the upper management is satisfied with where the A10 platform development is going and the preliminary results that have been achieved so far. The promotion may also mean that as a VP, S.S. Lin will be able to oversee more technology programs than a single (yet very important) process node as well as have greater influence over roadmap goals, priorities, and resource allocation, though we are speculating. Also, as the A10 program is moving from research and development towards finalization and adoption by partners and customers, the program leader may need to have more power to execute their goals.

A10 is TSMC's post-A14 fabrication process expected to be available to its clients sometimes in 2030 or later. The company expects A10 to enable it to make monolithic chips with over 200 billion transistors at the time. Some believe that TSMC plans to start using High-NA EUV lithography tools with its A10 node.

AMD is getting ready to ditch its AGESA microcode design in favor of an open-source successor dubbed openSIL, starting with Zen 6. In the meantime, 3mbdeb, a Polish open-source consulting firm, has announced that the first stages of porting openSIL to a consumer Zen 5 motherboard are underway.

The MSI B850-P Pro is the board 3mbdeb chose. If you're an enthusiast for this kind of stuff, you can now take openSIL for a spin before it shows up with AMD's next-generation CPUs, though the firm warns that this is a ""proof of concept"" that is ""not intended for production use."" Work on getting openSIL plus Coreboot on the MSI board is based on earlier work surrounding the Gigabyte MZ33-AR1, a server board designed to run AMD's EPYC 9005 series CPUs. AMD published its openSIL initialization code for the aforementioned Turin server chips well before AMD published the same code for its desktop Phoenix CPUs. As a result, the B850-P Pro is benefiting from the development work already put into the aforementioned Gigabyte board.

Silicon firmware like openSIL and AGESA are responsible for making sure major components hooked up to the motherboard are operational, and initiate key components such as the CPU, RAM, and chipset. Without these microcode platforms, your computer would not boot at all. They serve as part of the larger firmware stack, connecting the silicon to the host firmware, such as UEFI, or in this case, Coreboot.

OpenSIL represents a big improvement in the way code is inspected and guarded against cyberattacks over AMD's outgoing AGESA platform. AGESA's main problem is that the code is closed-source, preventing users from inspecting the firmware code for security purposes, bug checking, or other purposes. With openSIL, AMD has improved on this by making the new firmware open-source. openSIL will also be easier to scale and more lightweight compared to AGESA, according to AMD, and accommodate different host firmware. AGESA is designed around UEFI as the host firmware.

There's not much reason to run openSIL right now if you own an MSI B850-P Pro. Coreboot's initial support for openSIL with the B850-P Pro is still in development and the board is technically not on Coreboot's support list yet. But, it is a great option for developers and enthusiasts to tinker with openSIL to check out its inner workings and see how AMD has better designed it compared to AGESA.

There's a serious bargain to be had right now on a brand new gaming laptop that will deliver 1080p gaming at a budget-friendly price. This Acer Nitro gaming laptop features one of Nvidia's most recent GPUs, along with a powerful and modern 10-core Intel processor, and all for less than $900.

For just $899.99 over at B&H Photo, you can score this Acer Nitro V16 gaming laptop, making it one of the best spec'd models on offer at this price point and one that's cheaper than many of its rivals.

Laptop prices have definitely slipped over recent months, especially since the holidays, and given RAM and SSD prices right now, this might be the best chance to pick up an RTX 5060-powered laptop with 32GB RAM for less than $1,000.

One of the most important specs to consider on a gaming laptop, especially on a budget-conscious model like this one, is the GPU. The mobile version of the RTX 5060 used in this Acer Nitro gaming laptop features 8GB of VRAM and 3,328 CUDA cores.

This Acer Nitro V16 gaming laptop features one of Nvidia's newest mobile GPUs, the GeForce RTX 5060, along with a 10-core Intel Core 7 240H CPU. A 512TB PCIe 4.0 SSD and 32GB of DDR5 SODIMM RAM make this 16-inch laptop a formidable option for gaming at its native 1080p resolution.

With that firepower, you're going to be able to maintain a playable frame rate while you're using high and even ultra graphics presets in most modern games. If you need a bit more juice, the firepower supplied by this current-gen Nvidia GPU includes DLSS 4 support, including multi-frame generation. In games that support this feature, you'll be able to boost your frame rates even further by the GPU inserting AI-generated frames, ensuring your gameplay isn't slowed down or bottlenecked.

The GPU is coupled with a current-gen processor in the Intel Core 240H. This has 10 cores in total, made up of six performance cores that will work best for gaming, along with four efficiency cores, which will boost performance for any multi-threaded task work you might perform. With a typical clock speed of 2.5 GHz, this Raptor Lake CPU can also boost up to 5.2 GHz when you need it to.

The screen is another important consideration here, but you're not losing out to a low-quality panel. The 16-inch IPS display you're getting features a max 1,920 x 1,080 screen resolution and a 16:10 aspect ratio. As a gamer, you're going to want to enjoy maxing out its 180 Hz refresh rate. That will ensure your graphics are smooth, responsive, and with no motion blurring. This won't be as bright as an OLED, given its 300-nit max brightness, but you will get more hours of gaming time out of the 76 Wh battery as a result.

One of my favorite features on this Acer Nitro gaming laptop, however, is the memory capacity. 32GB of DDR5 SODIMM RAM is included, maxing out what this laptop supports, and giving you extra bandwidth to handle the most resource-intensive apps and games you decide to play.

Budget-focused laptops do occasionally have compromises, and the storage is one you'll need to consider here. While a Gen 4 NVMe SSD is included, you're only getting 512GB of storage. That'll handle one or two big game installations, but swapping it out or adding a second drive won't be a problem if you decide you want to upgrade to a 1TB or bigger model later. Alternatively, an external SSD will give you extra room and will plug straight into one of the laptop's USB ports.

As laptops go, this $899 Acer Nitro V16 gaming laptop is one of the most affordable options for portable gaming at 1080p right now, especially if you want the power provided by the RTX 5060. A discrete GPU is always going to be superior to relying on the integrated GPU provided by your CPU, and, with a price that hits well under that $1,000 price point, you're getting a model that offers a great performance-to-value ratio. As bargains go, this is an absolute steal, but a deal this good won't be around for long, so snap it up quickly.

First unveiled at the Logitech G Play 2025 event in September 2025, the Pro X2 Superstrike is now available in stores for $179.99. It's Logitech's first gaming mouse to feature the brand's Superstrike technology, which combines an inductive analog sensing system with real-time haptic feedback.

While competitors are still using industry-standard mechanical microswitches, Logitech has moved away from them and introduced its Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS) with the Pro X2 Superstrike. HITS features an electromagnetic induction system consisting of a metal coil and a magnet to register clicks. The core idea behind HITS is induction, which likely inspired the technology's name. According to Logitech, HITS can reduce latency by up to 30 ms compared to mechanical switches.

Since there is no physical contact, unlike mechanical switches, the Pro X2 Superstrike lets you pick the actuation levels, similar to modern Hall Effect keyboards. There are 10 actuation levels and five rapid-trigger reset points you can choose from. Since there's no mechanical interaction, there's no ""real"" click to the Pro X2 Superstrike. Instead, Logitech added a haptic actuator to simulate the click, much like what Apple does with the MacBook Force Touch trackpad on its devices. There are six actuator intensity levels for the Pro X2 Superstrike, which you can customize in Logitech G HUB.

The Pro X2 Superstrike retains many of the same specifications as the original Pro X Superlight 2. Logitech's Hero 2 sensor remains at the heart of the Pro X2 Superstrike and delivers a DPI range of 100-44,000, with tracking and acceleration of 888 IPS and 88 G, respectively. As always, the performance metrics are from Logitech's internal tests on its G640 Gaming Mouse Pad.

The Pro X2 Superstrike flaunts polling rates up to 8,000 Hz using Logitech's Lightspeed technology. A single charge provides up to 90 hours of battery life, so it's only 5% less than the Pro X Superlight 2. It charges via a standard USB-C port, or you can pair it with a Powerplay mouse pad. The Pro X2 Superstrike and Pro X Superlight 2 are identical in dimensions and design. However, the former weighs 2% more than its predecessor, which is not a substantial difference.

The Pro X2 Superstrike retails for $179.99, 13% more than the Pro X Superlight 2 if we're comparing MSRP. However, at street price, the Pro X Superlight 2 typically sells for as little as $114.99 and has dipped to an all-time low of $99.99, so we're potentially looking at a significant premium for the Pro X2 Superstrike if you bought the predecessor at a significant discount.

Somapacitan, a long‑acting growth hormone (GH) derivative, given once weekly at 0.24 mg/kg/wk, was safe, well tolerated, and effective for up to 4 years in prepubertal children born small for gestational age with short stature, including those who switched from daily GH therapy.

""Four-year results from REAL5 show that somapacitan 0.24 mg/kg/week had a safety profile consistent with the well-established profile of daily GH treatment in SGA [small for gestational age],"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Anders Juul, MD, PhD, DMSc, Copenhagen University Hospital-Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on January 30, 2026, in the European Journal of Endocrinology.

Not all participants switched to the dose of 0.24 mg/kg/wk at the same time, which made direct comparisons of efficacy between groups difficult. The study had a small sample size.

This study was sponsored by Novo Nordisk A/S. One author reported being an employee of the sponsor and holding company stock. Several authors reported receiving honoraria, lecture fees, grant support, or consultancy payments from various pharmaceutical companies, including Novo Nordisk.

For decades, psychiatry has focused largely on symptoms and syndromes, with treatment strategies centered on medication and psychotherapy. But a growing body of research is now expanding that perspective, highlighting the role that diet may play in mental health. Across Europe, clinicians and researchers are increasingly asking whether targeted dietary interventions might help patients whose depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric disorders have not responded to conventional care.

This question sits at the heart of nutritional psychiatry, a field that examines how diet, nutrients, and the gut-brain axis influence mood, cognition, and behavior. Once considered fringe, the discipline has gained momentum over the past decade as studies have linked dietary patterns to inflammation, microbiome changes, and brain function. Proponents argue that nutrition represents a low-risk, modifiable factor that could complement existing treatments — particularly for patients described as treatment resistant.

Yet enthusiasm is tempered by debate. While some clinicians are building specialized services around nutritional psychiatry, others caution against overselling diet as a stand-alone solution. The result is a field in rapid evolution, marked by promise, skepticism, and an unresolved question about how nutrition should ultimately be integrated into routine psychiatric care.

Psychiatrist Sabrina Garcia, MD, PhD, heads one of Europe's first outpatient clinics dedicated to nutritional psychiatry and psychosomatics at the Medical University of Graz in Graz, Austria. Similar clinics also exist in Germany and Switzerland, she said. For Garcia, the connection between nutrition and mental health is inseparable from the brain-gut axis — an area she believes is still underappreciated in psychiatric training.

“During my training in psychiatry, I learned a largely symptom-oriented model,” she told Medscape News Europe. “Curing someone was considered unlikely, and care for chronic patients was framed mainly as long-term symptom management. I think we can do more, and I've seen it. We're not using all the tools we could.”

When her department began discussing new clinical priorities 2 years ago, Garcia proposed creating a nutritional psychiatry clinic. “No one knew what it would be about,” she said. “We started from scratch.” What began as a small physician-led service soon expanded into a multidisciplinary team of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and dietitians.

The clinic primarily receives patients referred by psychiatrists after multiple treatments have failed. “These are patients who have tried several antidepressants and even electroconvulsive therapy,” Garcia said. “When all this fails, patients search for something else.”

Patients undergo blood tests to identify nutrient deficiencies and receive behavioral therapy alongside standard psychiatric care. Medication is prescribed when necessary, but Garcia emphasizes identifying underlying metabolic or nutritional contributors rather than managing symptoms alone. Patients typically remain in care for about a year, the period she says is needed to support sustained behavioral change.

“When patients come to see us, they usually have been nutrient deficient for a long time,” she said. “If deficiencies are really pronounced, then substitution is needed. We look for what is missing and add what's needed. Often it is vitamin D and the whole range of vitamin Bs,” she said.

Internationally, the scientific case for nutritional psychiatry has been shaped in large part by research led by Felice Jacka, PhD, professor of nutritional psychiatry and founder of the Food & Mood Centre at Deakin University in Australia. Jacka has been involved in multiple studies examining the relationship between diet quality and mental health outcomes.

In 2017, she led a randomized controlled trial designed to directly test whether improving diet could improve mental health. The study found that dietary improvements were associated with a substantial reduction in depressive symptoms. Subsequent work has explored how dietary patterns — such as Mediterranean, fermented, very-low-energy, and polyphenol-rich diets — may influence inflammation, gut microbiota, and brain function.

“Food remains a low-risk, accessible, and modifiable driver of mental health,” Jacka told Medscape News Europe. “With one third of patients experiencing treatment resistance, dietary approaches offer additional, scalable tools.”

Not all experts are convinced that specialist clinics are the right way forward. Ted Dinan, PhD, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University College Cork in Cork, Ireland, said nutritional psychiatry is particularly relevant for mood disorders but should not be viewed as a replacement for established therapies.

“There is increasing evidence that a Mediterranean diet is important in such patients,” he said. “But it is not an alternative to medication or psychotherapy. Appropriate nutrition boosts the effectiveness of these therapies.”

Dinan is skeptical of dedicated nutritional psychiatry clinics, warning that they may foster unrealistic expectations. “Patients assume wrongly that this is an alternative to current therapies, which it is not,” he said. He added that nutrition has so far had limited impact on everyday psychiatric practice, except in managing weight gain associated with antipsychotic use. In the future, he predicts, nutrition will be more fully embedded into standard psychiatric care rather than siloed into specialist services.

Ulrike Gisch, PhD, professor of nutritional psychology at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Giessen, Germany, agrees that the field must continue to develop, but she stresses the importance of a bidirectional perspective. Nutritional psychiatry, she said, should examine not only how diet influences mental illness but also how psychiatric disorders affect eating behavior.

“Many psychiatric disorders are associated with impaired daily functioning,” she told Medscape News Europe. “This can lead to changes in shopping, cooking, and eating routines. For example, severe anxiety may cause patients to avoid leaving their homes, significantly limiting food availability.”

In her own psychotherapeutic practice, Gisch routinely advises primary care physicians to check for deficiencies such as iron or vitamin D, or for thyroid dysfunction, in patients with depressive symptoms. Nutrition, she said, is a modifiable factor that deserves greater attention across medical, psychotherapeutic, and dietetic settings.

Back in Graz, Garcia sees this broader integration as essential to the field's future. She hopes nutritional psychiatry will become part of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education across Europe.

“It's a huge problem that doctors hardly know anything about nutrition, and nothing specific about nutritional psychiatry,” she said. “This is what we want to address in the coming years. We aim to become better doctors for our patients every day.”

Jacka reported receiving industry support for research from Meat & Livestock Australia, Woolworths Group, The a2 Milk Company, Be Fit Food, and Bega Cheese and travel support and speakers' honoraria from Sanofi-Synthelabo, Janssen-Cilag, Servier, Pfizer, Network Nutrition, Angelini Farmacéutica, Eli Lilly, Metagenics, and The Beauty Chef. She reported being on the scientific advisory board of the Dauten Family Center for Bipolar Treatment Innovation and ZOE Limited. Jacka reported writing two books for commercial publication. Dinan, Garcia, and Gisch reported having no relevant financial relationships.

An intensive rehabilitation program that focuses on improving upper extremity (UE) skills produced measurable benefits and was well received and safe in infants with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS), early results of a phase 3 study suggested.

Babies who received the most intensive form of therapy — constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) — and were most adherent achieved the best overall outcomes.

CIMT has previously been shown to be effective in older children with cerebral palsy, but this study represents the first adequately powered trial of high-dose CIMT in infants and toddlers with perinatal stroke.

“For the first time, we now have a protocol, a treatment, which produces benefits [for children with PAIS],” study investigator Sharon Ramey, PhD, professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, and professor, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, Roanoke, Virginia, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were presented on February 6 at the International Stroke Conference (ISC) 2026 meeting.

PAIS is among the more common forms of ischemic stroke in children, study co-investigator Warren D. Lo, MD, of Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, told Medscape Medical News.

He noted that across the perinatal period, stroke from all causes occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 live births, with the majority of cases attributable to arterial ischemic stroke. Infants with PAIS are at risk for lifelong neuromotor impairment and epilepsy and frequently experience cognitive dysfunction.

The study was conducted to address the lack of evidence-based rehabilitation options for infants and toddlers with PAIS. While CIMT has demonstrated benefit in older children with unilateral cerebral palsy, it has not been evaluated in an adequately powered trial in very young children with perinatal stroke.

Investigators tested CIMT during early development, a period of heightened neuroplasticity when intervention may have the greatest impact on long-term motor outcomes.

The study included 167 infants with PAIS and hemiparesis, with roughly equal numbers of boys and girls across 15 US sites. The trial, known as the I-ACQUIRE study, included children aged 8-36 months, a period of rapid brain development with high neuroplastic potential, Ramey said.

She noted that children typically begin to develop voluntary control of their arms and hands at around 6-8 months of age. Unlike adults, infants with stroke do not lose previously acquired skills but are learning these motor functions for the first time.

At baseline, functional ability varied widely among the children. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: usual care, typically consisting of 1 hour each of occupational and physical therapy per week; moderate-dose therapy (3 h/d, 5 d/wk for 4 weeks); or high-dose therapy (6 h/d, 5 d/wk for 4 weeks).

The intervention involved task-oriented therapy delivered by specially trained occupational or physical therapists, typically in the home, to improve motor function, coordination, and functional independence.

During most sessions, children wore a lightweight cast on the unimpaired arm and hand. Treatment goals were set with parents, who participated in one weekly session and completed a daily home practice program of about 45 minutes.

The primary outcome was the Emerging Behaviors Scale, which includes 30 UE items. A favorable outcome was a gain of at least 7 points at the end of treatment and at 6 months.

Parents rated how well and how often their child used their affected limb in performing various tasks including such things as manipulating toys and using gestures to communicate.

The proportion of children achieving a prespecified favorable outcome, defined as a gain of at least 7 points at both posttreatment assessments, was lower than anticipated. Ramey noted that while outcomes favored therapy, the magnitude of improvement was smaller than expected.

However, there were some positive signals. At the end-of-treatment assessment, both intervention groups outperformed the usual care group: The moderate-dose group gained a mean of 2.94 skills, and the high-dose group gained a mean of 3.30 skills compared with an average gain of one skill in the usual care group.

At 6 months, children in the high-dose group showed greater skill gains than those in the other two groups. Notably, the usual care group had caught up with the moderate-dose group by this timepoint.

Ramey said she was surprised and encouraged that children receiving approximately 2 hours of therapy per week still demonstrated benefit at 6 months. Children in the high-dose group who were compliant with the therapy benefited the most from the intervention.

Parents were generally very satisfied with their child's progress, Ramey said, and described the therapy as highly impactful. Feedback included terms such as amazing, life-changing, very beneficial, and fantastic, with one parent noting that the experience was difficult to put into words.

The investigators plan to follow the children through 12 months and present additional findings at future meetings, Ramey said.

The researchers also want to identify clinical characteristics and biomarkers that may predict which children derive the greatest benefit from the intervention, as well as to examine which components of usual care were associated with the highest — and lowest — gains.

Parents and investigators alike want to understand which children benefit most from the intervention and why, and whether the therapy can be adapted to improve outcomes for those who derive less benefit, Ramey said.

Asked to comment on the research, ISC Chair Lauren Sansing, MD, professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, said the study addresses a critical evidence gap in pediatric stroke, an area where high-quality data remain limited.

Sansing noted that conducting intensive rehabilitation studies in pediatric stroke is particularly challenging because participation requires commitment from the entire family, not just the child. She praised the investigators for successfully completing a complex and demanding trial.

Sansing noted that the improvement seen in the usual care group over the course of the study itself is an important finding. She said the results underscore the need to better understand which therapies and interventions contributed to those gains, with the goal of optimizing care for infants with stroke.

These findings are especially important in light of how common infant strokes are, added ISC Vice Chair Bijoy Menon, MD, neurologist in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Menon noted that demonstrating an effective intervention in this population is particularly meaningful. He added that although CIMT is not yet widely available, advances in the field may eventually allow it to be delivered virtually or with the support of robotic technologies.

“Once you have proof of principle that something like this potentially works, it opens up funding opportunities and new avenues of how this might actually be delivered.”

The study received funding from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, an institute in the National Institutes of Health. Ramey, Sansing, and Menon reported having no relevant disclosures.

Iron supplementation is part of guideline-directed therapy for heart failure (HF); however, it only protects men, not women. 

Mahir Karakas, MD, PhD, is the lead author of a sex-specific analysis of the FAIR-HF2 trial, which, for the first time, demonstrated that guideline-recommended HF therapy has different effects in men and women. In an interview with Medscape's German edition, Karakas discussed the underlying reasons for these sex-specific responses to iron treatment and the potential therapeutic implications of these findings.

Gender-based analyses of large HF trials of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and vericiguat showed similar effectiveness in men and women. How did you come up with the idea of examining gender-specific aspects of iron supplementation?

I've been engaged in gender equity work for a decade, so gender-specific differences in disease are always a key focus for me. Heart & Stroke's 2018 Heart Report focuses on the treatment and care reality of women with heart disease, summarized by the five Us: underaware, underdiagnosed, undertreated, underresearched, and undersupported. That made it clear to us that when we conduct studies, we always prespecify gender-based outcomes according to biological characteristics.

Previous gender-based analyses have not shown major differences or similar effectiveness between the genders. Were you surprised by your findings?

Yes, the results surprised us. To date, there have been no reports of HF therapy suggesting a differential effect between men and women. In other guideline-relevant trials, gender was always included as a subgroup when comparing men and women; however, no analysis has examined this question as thoroughly as we have.

Is there an explanation for the gender-specific effectiveness of iron intake?

There is an interaction between estrogen levels and iron metabolism. Estrogen plays a significant role in the regulation of iron homeostasis. This estrogen-iron axis allows women to regulate iron metabolism according to hematologic factors and in response to nonhematologic requirements, such as uterine growth, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. This axis explains the results of this study.

These findings are robust. We observed this not only in the gender-specific analysis of the FAIR-HF2 trial, which included 1105 patients. In our meta-analysis, pooling of six randomized iron supplementation trials showed that only men showed a prognostic benefit from iron supplementation. Women showed a null prognostic effect, whereas men showed a 24% reduction in risk.

No statistically significant interactions were found between age, coronary heart disease, iron status, anemia, or HF severity. The only significant interaction observed was between gender and age group. Therefore, the estrogen-iron axis remains the most plausible explanation.

Are additional studies on iron supplementation planned for women with HF in the future?

First, it is important to recognize this difference. We aimed to provide definitive evidence through an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. I expect this to be completed within the next 6 months. We will analyze the raw data from the six trials included in our meta-analysis;it was published in Nature Medicine and included 7175 patients. This IPD meta-analysis provided the final level of evidence.

We will also revisit the FAIR-HF2 trial and stratify the analyses by age to determine whether differences emerge between premenopausal and postmenopausal women with high and low estrogen levels, respectively. This may help clarify whether estrogen levels are associated with clinical endpoints.

Do your findings have any therapeutic implications?

First, the guidelines recommend intravenous iron therapy for HF, which has several advantages. Few HF treatments produce benefits as quickly as iron supplementation. Patients often report rapid improvement, stating that they feel much better, experience less shortness of breath in their daily lives, and can walk to a supermarket without stopping.

This symptomatic benefit occurs in both men and women. In our study, the symptomatic effect was slightly more pronounced in women, possibly because women in the treatment group experienced an increase in hemoglobin levels, whereas men did not.

One therapeutic implication of our findings is the reduction in the frequency of iron administration. In FAIR-HF2, the treatment was more aggressive than that in some earlier studies. Patients received 500 mg of iron every 4 months unless the threshold criteria for iron overload were ferritin levels of 800 µg/L or hemoglobin levels > 16 g/dL. were met. However, these thresholds have rarely been achieved.

The results showed an increase in mortality. Other endpoint trials of iron supplementation did not demonstrate a significant increase in mortality; however, iron was administered more conservatively in these studies.

Therefore, iron supplementation in women can only be initiated when iron levels decline. Rather than applying an upper safety limit to prevent iron overload, treatment should be initiated by reaching a lower ferritin threshold. Using this approach, symptomatic improvement can be achieved in both men and women.

Additionally, men derived a prognostic benefit, whereas women did not. Importantly, this strategy did not confer a prognostic disadvantage in women. This represents a form of personalized therapy, and the simplest approach to personalization is to consider gender.

Should therapies beyond HF be studied more extensively with respect to gender-specific differences?

Yes, absolutely. Guidelines must also reflect on these differences to ensure that every patient receives the most appropriate therapy. The US is ahead of the rest in this regard. For example, the American College of Cardiology prevention guidelines include gender-specific recommendations for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Future guideline updates should revisit major guideline-relevant clinical trials and provide more detailed analyses. This applies to comparisons between men and women, as well as between premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Earlier trials often did not examine these differences in depth, and gender-based analyses were often limited.

Patients with hypertension who received a tool — Your Heart Forecast (YHF) — communicating their 5-year risk for heart disease, along with monthly educational emails, showed a decrease in blood pressure (BP) — particularly among those with more poorly controlled hypertension — and a substantial increase in lipid levels was observed among those with the highest baseline levels.

""Our findings support the use of the intervention, communicatively, even for patients with just slightly elevated blood pressure. It can be concluded that the patients receiving the intervention obtained a lower blood pressure and thus added health benefit in comparison to the control group,"" the researchers of the study wrote.

This study was led by Kathrine Stjernholm, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. It was published online on January 28, 2026, in Open Heart.

The study design lacked patient and public involvement. The sample overrepresented people with diabetes, limiting generalisability. Medication use was self-reported; detailed data on medication adherence were not collected.

The trial received funding from the University of Southern Denmark, The Region of Southern Denmark; the Lilly and Herbert Hansens Foundation; the Foundation of General Practice; and the A.P. Møller and Chastine McKinney Møller Foundation. The authors did not declare any conflicts of interest.

After at least 1 year of sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT), fewer patients with allergic asthma and rhinitis had exacerbations or required frequent reliever medication, and all reported reduced rhinitis symptoms.

“The observed associations between SLIT and improvements in clinical outcomes, such as symptom control and a reduction in exacerbations, appear more consistent in patients undergoing grass pollen SLIT, for which an acknowledgment is made that spirometric measures may remain stable in well-controlled patients, and that a reduction in exacerbations and medication use are valuable markers of improved disease control,” the authors wrote.

Barbara Ruaro, MS, PhD, with the University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on January 28, 2026, in the Journal of Clinical Medicine.

The study was limited by its retrospective, observational design and small sample size. Additionally, participants generally had good asthma control at baseline, which may have resulted in a ceiling effect.

A new poll of nearly 1000 Medscape readers found that over three fourths of respondents do not support the latest changes to the federal childhood immunization schedule and more than 70% said they would follow alternative guidance from medical specialty societies such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

In January, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced significant changes to the childhood immunization schedule, cutting the number of vaccines from 17 to 11. To assess how clinicians view these changes, Medscape surveyed its readers between January 16 and 26, 2026. The poll received responses from 543 physicians and 441 nurses and physician assistants. Sixty-two percent of respondents were female and 32% male; 52% were over age 65 years.

The results suggest that healthcare providers have significant concerns about the updated recommendations.

The findings did not surprise Sean O'Leary, MD, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases. 

“I have not talked to a single person who supports the changes,” O'Leary said. The recommendations set federal guidelines back decades, he said, and were made “with a very clear anti-vaccine bent.”

Announcing the changes in early January, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the new schedule is more in line with those of other countries, such as Denmark, that require children receive fewer shots. 

The AAP schedule is endorsed by 12 major medical societies; the group has been issuing vaccine recommendations since 1935. Some clinics are updating patient materials, directing families to guidance from the AAP and AAFP.

“Pediatricians and family doctors see what's happening at the federal level, and they're going to continue to do what's best for their patients: make vaccine recommendations based on the best scientific evidence,” O'Leary said.

Respondents also reported many specific concerns about the change to the vaccine schedule: 37% said the changes could pose risks to children's health and safety, and 60% said they were “very concerned” about a potential outbreak of a disease whose vaccine is no longer on the immunization schedule. Alex McDonald, MD, a family physician in Claremont, California, said the change in federal guidance would undoubtedly “make patients and communities less healthy.”

“There's no new evidence that would necessitate a change in vaccine policy in the United States,” he said. 

Although many parents continue to vaccinate their children, overall vaccination rates have declined, a change that is likely “leading to measles outbreaks, historically high levels of pertussis, and it's probably contributing to the severity of the flu seasons, with big drops in flu [vaccine] uptake,” said O'Leary.

Recent US data show a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles and pertussis. The CDC reported 2267 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — the highest level in decades — and at least 588 cases have already been reported early this year. 

The increases have raised concern about the United States' measles elimination status, a designation achieved in 2000, and public health officials worry the country may lose this status if outbreaks continue, with a formal assessment expected in April of this year.

Preliminary CDC data also indicate a rebound in pertussis, with more than six times as many cases in 2024 as in 2023. Levels remained high through 2025, with more than 28,000 cases reported.

O'Leary said when a vaccine-preventable disease is circulating in a community, the AAP generally recommends that symptomatic unvaccinated children enter healthcare clinics through separate entrances.

While child health and safety were primary concerns among providers polled, 24% cited confusion as their biggest worry. 

“There's a very small percentage of people who are rabidly anti-vaccine; there's a larger group that simply has questions,” he said. “I think for some of those families, this confusion is creating real problems.” 

Some families, for example, are delaying vaccination due to confusion about which shots are due when. 

“This breaks my heart because we know that vaccines are the most effective preventative tool we have and, I would say, the biggest medical advancement in the last 100 years,” McDonald said. 

Patient confusion is also affecting clinical workflow. While providers welcome patients' questions and want to help them make informed decisions, McDonald said increased conversations around vaccines could divert time from other critical health issues. 

“The average patient sees their doctor for 20 minutes twice a year, and there are a lot of things that we need to cover in that short amount of time,” he said.

Katie Lockwood, MD, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said many patients worry they will lose access to vaccines or that insurance will not pay because of removal from the federal schedule, neither of which has occurred, she said.

Regarding vaccine counseling, McDonald states that families ultimately make the decision. 

“I always tell people that I'm here to help you make the best healthcare decisions for you and your family, and I want you to make those decisions based on good information and good data, and that there's a lot of really bad information out there,” said McDonald, who encourages patients to contact him directly with questions.

Education and communication are both key, and O'Leary said that professional medical organizations, such as the AAP, will do much more of both going forward. 

“We can no longer trust the federal government around vaccines,” he said. “They're going away from science and evidence and going into ideology.”

O'Leary said the AAP has ramped up its outreach to its membership since the government changed the vaccine guidance. 

“I've done four educational events this week to try to reach as many clinicians as we can, help them understand what's going on, advocate for continuing to recommend based on science and evidence, meaning the recently released AAP schedule, and also how to handle questions and the confusion that's coming from families right now,” he said. “We are having to sort of step up in terms of our communications.”

Among pregnancies complicated by previable preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) before 24 weeks of gestation, two thirds resulted in live births; of these, most infants survived to discharge, and nearly three quarters were discharged without severe comorbidities.

""Parental counseling should be individualized, considering the evolving outcomes and the uncertain trajectory of pregnancies complicated by PPROM before 24 WG [weeks of gestation]. This counseling must be tailored to each specific case,"" the authors wrote.

""Moreover, extending pregnancy through vigilant monitoring and adherence to current neonatal management guidelines is crucial, as it can reduce the risk of adverse outcomes and enhance the likelihood of a healthier outcome for both mother and infant,"" they added.

Acute myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the heart muscle that is most commonly caused by viral infection. Bacterial myocarditis, particularly that caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), is exceptionally rare in immunocompetent individuals.

Orestis Paschalis, MD, from the School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, reported a rare case of acute myocarditis secondary to Salmonella gastroenteritis in a woman in her early 20s, characterised by elevated cardiac biomarkers, positive stool cultures for Salmonella enterica, ECG changes, and confirmatory cardiac MRI.

A young woman with no relevant medical history presented to the emergency department with sharp retrosternal chest pain that was exacerbated by movement and deep breathing and partially alleviated by leaning forward. This presentation followed a week of watery diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and systemic malaise, which had resolved 3 days earlier. She denied fever, dyspnoea, palpitations, coryzal symptoms, or recent travel. The patient had no significant medical history or known cardiovascular conditions and was not taking any regular medications. No recent vaccinations or short courses of over-the-counter medications were reported.

Laboratory testing revealed a markedly elevated troponin level of 459 ng/L, which increased to 972 ng/L after 6 hours (reference range, 0-15 ng/L), providing the first indication of myocardial inflammation. The C-reactive protein (CRP) level was also elevated to 116 mg/L on admission (reference range, 0-5 mg/L).

Stool testing identified S enterica, whereas serologic testing for common viral and bacterial pathogens was negative.

The ECG revealed subtle concave ST-segment elevation and PR depression, consistent with myopericarditis. Although transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal biventricular size and systolic function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%, there were no regional wall motion abnormalities, pericardial effusion, or valvular pathology.

Blood culture results were negative, excluding systemic infections.

Cardiac MRI confirmed acute myocarditis with mild subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement and oedema in the basal inferolateral wall. Biventricular systolic function was preserved, with ejection fractions of 63% and 57%. No evidence of chamber dilatation or fibrosis was observed.

The patient was diagnosed with acute myocarditis secondary to Salmonella gastroenteritis. Management was conservative, with 500 μg of colchicine administered daily for 3 months. Antibiotics were not administered because of clinical recovery and the absence of bacteraemia. Serial troponin I levels over time (day 2, 308 ng/L; day 4, 26 ng/L; and day 6, 12 ng/L), as did the CRP levels (day 2, 44 mg/L; day 4, 18 mg/L; and day 6, 5 mg/L), and the chest pain resolved. She was discharged on day 6 with advice to avoid strenuous activity for 6 months, and a follow-up cardiac MRI was planned for 3 months.

This report describes a rare case of Salmonella-induced myocarditis in a previously healthy young woman. The diagnosis was confirmed using cardiac MRI, and full recovery was achieved with conservative management without antibiotics.

Bacterial myocarditis is considerably rarer than viral myocarditis, particularly in healthy individuals. When it occurs, Staphylococcus aureus and Borrelia burgdorferi are typically implicated. However, in this case, the causative agent was NTS infection.

Inflammation may result from direct myocardial invasion or an exaggerated immune response, often triggered by circulating endotoxins. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent serious complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

This case also demonstrates that myocarditis can develop in the absence of bacteraemia. When a systemic infection is excluded, individualised management without antibiotics may be sufficient. The benefits of antibiotic therapy in such cases remain controversial because no clear advantages have been established.

ECG findings may be normal, particularly in patients with mild disease. Troponin is a sensitive but nonspecific biomarker, highlighting the critical role of advanced cardiac imaging in establishing the diagnosis and guiding appropriate treatment.

NEW ORLEANS — A new trial of recombinant factor VIIa in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) showed neutral overall results but raised the possibility that the therapy could help stop bleeding and improve outcomes in selected patients.

Results of the FASTEST trial showed that administering recombinant factor VIIa within 2 hours of ICH onset slowed hematoma growth but did not improve functional outcomes in the overall study population and was associated with a small increase in life-threatening thromboembolic complications.

However, subgroup analyses suggested that the biological effect of slowing bleeding was largely concentrated in two patient groups: those with a spot sign on CT angiography, a marker of ongoing bleeding, and those treated within 90 minutes of symptom onset. 

In these subgroups, treatment with factor VIIa was associated with signals suggesting clinical benefit. Building on these findings, a new trial, FASTEST-2, is now underway, enrolling patients with ICH treated within 90 minutes of onset or those with a positive spot sign within 120 minutes.

“These two subgroups are where we seem to be able to make a difference. These patients are the ones most likely to still be actively bleeding so it makes sense that giving an agent to stop bleeding would work here,” lead investigator, Joseph Broderick, MD, medical director of the UC Gardner Neuroscience Institute at the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, told Medscape Medical News.

“These subgroup results look very promising, and if the FASTEST-2 trial confirms these findings, this would be the first medical treatment for ICH. This is a catastrophic event and there is very little we can do for these patients at present apart from controlling blood pressure. These results suggest that we could have a treatment for selected patients in the not-too-distant future,” he added.

Broderick presented the results of the FASTEST trial on February 4 at the International Stroke Conference (ISC) 2026. The study was also simultaneously published online in The Lancet.

Factor VIIa is a naturally occurring protein involved in blood clot formation and vessel repair. In ICH, the therapeutic goal is to seal a ruptured blood vessel that is actively bleeding in the brain. Most hematoma expansion occurs within the first 2-3 hours after symptom onset, and earlier studies may not have treated patients quickly enough, Broderick noted.

The FASTEST trial was designed to intervene more rapidly and to focus on patients most likely to benefit, excluding very older individuals and those with extremely large hemorrhages who are unlikely to have good outcomes even if bleeding is controlled, Broderick explained.

The study was the largest hyperacute stroke trial to require brain imaging before treatment and was conducted at 93 sites in the US, Japan, Canada, Spain, Germany, and the UK.

The trial included 626 patients (mean age, 61 years) with spontaneous ICH volumes of 2-60 mL and limited intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), defined as involvement of less than two thirds of one lateral ventricle or less than one third of both lateral ventricles, who presented within 2 hours of symptom onset.

Eligible patients were also required to have a Glasgow Coma Scale score of ≥ 8 and no evidence of a recent ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction, recent use of anticoagulation therapy, or another structural cause of ICH.

To facilitate rapid enrollment, the trial used mobile stroke units and waived emergency consent requirements. Patients were randomized to receive factor VIIa (80 μg/kg) or placebo, administered intravenously over 2 minutes.

The primary outcome was functional outcome at 180 days, measured by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. The secondary aim was the change in ICH volume and ICH plus IVH volume between baseline and 24 hours of treatment administration.

The trial was stopped for futility at the second interim analysis, with results showing no significant difference in the primary clinical outcome measure of mRS change at 180 days between the intervention group and the placebo group (adjusted common odds ratio [OR], 1.09 [95% CI, 0.79-1.51]; P = .61).

Life-threatening thromboembolic complications within 4 days occurred in 15 participants (< 5%) in the intervention group and in four (1%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.41; P = .02).

Compared with placebo, recombinant factor VIIa was associated with decreased growth of ICH (-3.7 mL) and of ICH plus IVH (-5.2 mL) between baseline and CT scan at 24 hours.

Among the 511 patients who had a baseline CT angiography either before or after study drug administration, 29% had a spot sign. In this group, patients who received factor VIIa showed a greater chance of a favorable clinical outcome on the mRS scale (adjusted common OR, 1.86 at 180 days). Those who were treated within 90 minutes also appeared to benefit (OR, 1.82), although these results were not significant.

In exploratory analyses, the positive signals in mRS were more apparent at 90 days among both patients with a spot sign (OR, 2.52) and those treated within 90 minutes (OR, 2.66), with the greatest potential benefit in patients who had both a spot sign on CT angiography and treatment within 90 minutes.

Patients in both subgroups also experienced less hematoma expansion with factor VIIa treatment. Compared with placebo, treatment was associated with a 14-mL vs 2.7-mL reduction in combined ICH and IVH growth among individuals with vs without a positive spot sign.

Similarly, those treated within 90 minutes vs after 90 minutes of symptom onset had a 7.5-mL vs 4.3-mL reduction in ICH plus IVH growth.

Broderick said he is hopeful that these results can be confirmed in the FASTEST-2 trial, which is specifically enrolling patients from these two patient groups.

He acknowledged that this represents only a small proportion of patients with ICH (approximately 5%), but he believes that numbers could increase over time.

Broderick drew parallels with the early experience of thrombolysis in ischemic stroke.

“Originally when thrombolysis with alteplase was first approved, we only treated 1% of people with ischemic stroke but this rose dramatically over time as we learned about other populations who can benefit with imaging. We also got better at treating more quickly. So I think if we can get a foothold, use will eventually expand to more patients,” he said.

He emphasized the importance of matching treatment to biology and patient selection. “When biology gives us something like this, we can use technology to identify the right patients to target. Factor VIIa is a very powerful hemostatic drug. It works well, but we need to identify the appropriate patients.”

He added that timing remains critical: “The key appears to be very early treatment. So as is the case for all stroke, it is vitally important that the population recognizes symptoms and gets help fast.”

He said the findings reinforce the importance of early intervention, noting that rapid recognition of stroke symptoms and timely treatment remain critical.

Commenting on the trial for Medscape Medical News, Vice Chair Lauren Sansing, MD, professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, said the trial was “an incredible accomplishment.”

“The investigators deserve huge kudos for running such a hyperacute trial, randomizing ICH patients in the first 2 hours, and for now persevering with another trial in the promising subgroups.”

She said she is optimistic that factor VIIa could be of benefit for patients in those subgroups.

“We have to be cautious as subgroup analyses have led us astray in the past, but there is a lot of biological plausibility here and data to support that these groups have the highest likelihood to benefit. So I'm thrilled that we'll have an answer quickly on this from FASTEST-2.”

Sansing noted that the treatment would be relevant to only a small fraction of patients with ICH, given delays in symptom recognition and presentation, but said the results look very promising for those who arrive early enough to be treated.

In an accompanying editorial, Craig Anderson, MD, of the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney, Australia, and colleagues highlighted several challenges encountered in earlier studies of factor VIIa for the treatment of ICH.

They noted that in a previous trial, factor VIIa administered within 4 hours of ICH onset reduced hematoma expansion but did not improve functional outcomes and was associated with an increased risk for serious thromboembolic complications.

They added that if the FASTEST-2 trial does show benefit with ultra-early treatment, that would be an accomplishment, but they pointed out that “generalizability will be minimal worldwide unless code ICH care pathways can identify people with hyperacute ICH in the ambulance and convey them rapidly to hospital, where CT angiography will need to be available, as well as fast-care bundles to effectively control elevated blood pressure and other physiological parameters.”

First, the good news: Fewer Americans younger than 50 years are dying from cancer vs just a decade ago — reflecting progress in prevention, early detection, and treatment. There is, however, one big exception. Colorectal cancer mortality has been steadily inching up, and the disease now stands as the leading cause of cancer death in this age group, up from the fifth-leading in the early 1990s.

Those are the major findings of a recent study by the American Cancer Society (ACS), published as a research letter in JAMA.

Using SEER data, researchers found that the overall age-adjusted cancer death rate among Americans younger than 50 years dropped by 44% between 1990 and 2023 — from 25.5 to 14.2 per 100,000. And for four of the five leading causes of cancer death, there were mean annual declines from 2014 to 2023. The biggest change was in lung cancer deaths, which fell by an average of 5.7% per year. Meanwhile, leukemia and breast cancer deaths showed annual declines of 2.3% and 1.4%, respectively, despite rising incidences of both diseases among younger Americans.

The outlier is colorectal cancer, where mortality has been rising by about 1% per year since 2005. And it's a pattern seen in both men and women.

Study co-author Nikita Sandeep Wagle, PhD, MBBS, principal scientist, Cancer Surveillance Research at the ACS, and Arif Kamal, MD, ACS chief patient officer, discussed the research and its implications with Medscape Medical News.

Wagle: Mortality is going down for most of the cancers because we are getting better at finding cancers earlier and treating them more effectively. We have also seen improvements in screening, imaging, and therapy, and that means more people are being diagnosed at earlier stages and are surviving longer after diagnosis.

Kamal: Partially, but not completely, because the relationship between incidence and mortality is not always straightforward. For example, breast cancer incidence has been increasing, while mortality is going down. The rising mortality in people younger than 50 years is likely suggestive of more aggressive cancers being diagnosed — potentially secondary to environmental, dietary, or lifestyle factors. The colon is a unique organ because everything we put in our bodies passes through the colon, so food-based risk factors — for example, low fiber intake, red meat, and ultra-processed foods — are increasingly rising to the top as culprits.

Further, we know that only about 25% of people between the ages of 45 and 50 years are up to date with recommended colon cancer screenings, which can lead to later-stage diagnoses and thus higher mortality. So higher mortality speaks to the need to focus on lifestyle and diet changes and get more younger people to complete recommended cancer screenings.

Wagle: I think the “why” of your question is very important. Many researchers are trying to understand possible causes, such as diet, lifestyle, environmental factors, and genetics. But we cannot pinpoint one single cause. We need even more focus on research toward understanding the etiology of early-onset colorectal cancer.

What makes colorectal cancer different is that, unlike some other major cancers in this age group where mortality has declined despite rising incidence, roughly 3 in 4 colorectal cancers diagnosed in people younger than 50 years are [regional or distant], where the outcomes are worse.

Wagle: It is around two deaths per 100,000 population in 2023 for people younger than 50 years. That number may not seem large, but the upward trend — a 1.1% annual increase from 2014 to 2023 — is concerning when you think about how overall mortality in this age group has dropped substantially over the past few decades. Colorectal cancer is moving in the opposite direction.

I think the hopeful part is that it is also one of the most preventable cancers. Screening can stop cancer before it starts by removing precancerous polyps. Early-stage disease is highly treatable, and outcomes are better. That means better awareness and timely screening could make a real difference.

Wagle: For cancers with established screening guidelines, such as colorectal cancer, clinicians should continue to emphasize guideline-based screening and individualized risk assessment.

For colorectal cancer, screening now is recommended to start at age 45 for individuals at average risk, and earlier for [some], due to family history or other risk factors. Clinicians can use these findings to remind younger individuals that colorectal cancer is not only a disease of older adults and that screening at the recommended age can save lives.

In addition, red-flag symptoms such as persistent rectal bleeding, unexplained abdominal pain, difficulty in bowel movements, or signs of anemia should prompt appropriate evaluation in younger individuals.

Kamal: Clinicians should continue to emphasize timely completion of regular screening, starting at age 45 [for average-risk people]. Many still believe that the recommended starting age is 50 or that colonoscopy is the only way to get screened. Highlighting home-based screening options often helps patients make cancer screening logistically fit better into their busy lives.

Kamal: Appropriate evaluation for any suspected bleeding — bright red or black and tarry — starts with an in-office evaluation by a primary care physician. Referral to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or surgeon, is done later, typically for direct visualization, such as with a colonoscopy. Rarely, imaging such as CT scans or ultrasounds is performed. Overall, because of the rising incidence of colon cancer in younger people, any concerning symptoms should be reported to a physician for an in-office evaluation as the first step.

Kamal: ACS screening guidelines for all cancers are part of an ongoing guideline development process by ACS scientists and volunteers. We monitor medical and scientific literature for new evidence that may support a change in current guidelines or the development of new guidelines and for information about cancer screening that should be conveyed to clinicians and target populations.

Sexual disorders remain an important but often under-addressed component of clinical care. In men, erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common sexual disorder, affecting an estimated 1 in 2 men between 40 and 70 years of age. The prevalence increases from approximately 20% at 40 years of age to nearly 70% after 70 years of age. The condition may be psychogenic or organic, with either vascular or iatrogenic causes.

Sexual disorders are equally prevalent in both men and women. Between 2000 and 2019, the prevalence was estimated to be 51%, with disorders of sexual desire and arousal predominating. Menopausal transition is particularly associated with symptoms that impair sexual health, sometimes accompanied by vulvovaginal atrophy.

Interest in nutraceuticals and natural approaches has substantially increased in recent years. These dietary supplements and nonpharmacologic alternatives are increasingly considered complementary strategies for managing sexual disorders in both sexes. Clinical trials suggest that certain nutraceuticals have demonstrated statistically significant improvements in erectile function and female sexual function (FSF), although these approaches are generally positioned as adjunctive options rather than substitutes for established pharmacologic therapy.

The standard medical management of ED relies primarily on phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. Naturally derived compounds have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Their proposed mechanisms include improvement of endothelial function through vasodilatory effects, reduction of oxidative stress, and modulation of hormonal balance.

Several nutraceuticals have been supported by consistent clinical evidence. Panax ginseng has been shown in multiple randomized trials to improve the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, a validated questionnaire for assessing male sexual function, by approximately 3-5 points, likely through increased nitric oxide production. L-arginine, particularly when combined with pycnogenol, improves nitric oxide bioavailability and increases IIEF scores by 3-6 points, mainly in vascular ED. Tribulus terrestris, especially saponin-rich extracts, has shown effects on ED associated with hormonal imbalance, including a randomized placebo-controlled phase 4 trial involving 180 participants.

Combined approaches have also demonstrated benefits. Acetyl-L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine combined with sildenafil, and L-arginine combined with tadalafil were associated with higher IIEF scores. Similar improvements were reported with Ginkgo biloba combined with alpha-lipoic acid and Vitis vinifera combined with avanafil (n = 123) compared with placebo (P < .01) and avanafil alone (P < .05). Most nutraceuticals are marketed as dietary supplements in France.

However, these findings contrast sharply with the highly variable quality of commercially available supplements. An analysis of nutraceutical products marketed in Italy revealed that 80% of the products were unlikely to provide meaningful efficacy, 12% showed low efficacy, and only 8% demonstrated a higher potential efficacy. The analysis highlighted that complex formulations often contain more than five ingredients per product, with L-arginine being the most frequently used, followed by Tribulus terrestris and Panax ginseng. The major limitations of this study include the use of ingredients without clinical evidence and underdosing of compounds with demonstrated benefits.

Evidence is emerging for the use of nutraceuticals in female sexual disorders, including primary conditions and drug-induced dysfunctions. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) primarily rely on outcomes measured using the FSFI.

Several products have shown benefits in primary sexual disorders, particularly in hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Tribulus terrestris 750 mg/d for 4 weeks improved desire and FSF index (FSFI) scores (n = 67; P < .001). The local application of visnadine derived from Ammi Visnaga, delivered as a spray or oil, was associated with improved FSFI scores (n = 38; P < .001). ArginMax, a formulation combining L-arginine, ginseng, ginkgo, damiana, vitamins, and minerals, demonstrated superiority over placebo in postmenopausal women (n = 108; P = .008). Red clover obtained from Trifolium pratense improved dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and libido in women older than 40 years (n = 60; P < .05). Libifem, derived from Trigonella foenum-graecum, improved sexual desire and arousal in women aged 20-49 years (n = 80; P < .05).

For drug-induced sexual dysfunction, ginkgo biloba improved sexual desire when combined with sexual therapy in women treated with antidepressants (n = 63; P < .05). Saffron (Crocus sativus) improved overall FSFI scores (P < .001), as well as arousal, lubrication, and pain, in women receiving fluoxetine (n = 38).

Additional studies have reported significant improvements in arousal (P = .014) and sexual desire (P < .001) with Panax ginseng. In women with depressive disorders treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, positive effects on sexual dysfunction were observed with a combination of ginger, saffron, cinnamon, thistle, and Tribulus terrestris (n = 32; P < .05) and with L-arginine supplementation at 2 g/d (n = 40; P = .001).

In clinical practice, nutraceuticals may represent a complementary option for the management of ED, particularly in mild-to-moderate forms. Large-scale RCTs are necessary to clarify efficacy, optimal dosing, and patient selection criteria before these approaches can be broadly recommended.

For female sexual disorders, although the overall level of evidence remains limited, interventions based on natural products appear to improve disorders of sexual desire, including both primary conditions and those induced by pharmacologic treatments.

In a retrospective cohort study, hyperkalemia occurred in 1 in 10 women older than 45 years who were prescribed spironolactone for dermatologic conditions, with the highest risk among those older than 65 years with predisposing comorbidities but was generally mild and asymptomatic.

Identifying hyperkalemia with routine laboratory testing “infrequently impacts clinical management or patient outcomes,” the authors concluded, adding that “clinical decision making around potassium laboratory monitoring should account for age ≥ 65 and patients' medical complexity.” Monitoring guidelines “for spironolactone's use in dermatology should be developed over time; for now, individualized clinical decision making is key,” they added. They noted that potassium monitoring is currently not recommended for young, healthy women taking spironolactone for skin conditions.

This study was led by Samantha Gregoire, BS, and Eliza Dewey, BS, from Brigham and Women's Department of Dermatology, Boston, and was published online on February 6 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The study limitations included retrospective design, lack of a direct comparator group to younger cohorts, limited assessment of dose-response relationships, potentially missed hyperkalemia incidents.

A routine cardiac MRI scan may be comparable to right heart catheterization for determining the severity of heart failure, according to a study in JACC: Advances.

Researchers in England developed a method that uses a routine type of MRI measurement called T2 mapping to estimate mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), a key indicator of heart health that measures how much oxygen is left in the blood as it returns to the heart.

The team tested the technique in 30 patients and found that the MRI-derived estimates of SvO2 closely matched those obtained through right heart catheterization, a safe but invasive procedure that is standard for assessing hemodynamics in heart failure. 

The researchers then analyzed people with newly diagnosed heart failure, following them for around 3 years. Those with healthier oxygen readings on MRI were significantly less likely to die or be hospitalized due to their condition. The MRI-based measurement remained accurate after controlling for age, other illnesses, and overall heart function.

“It was a really strong endpoint, completely independent of ejection fraction and all the traditional markers of risk in heart failure,” said senior author Peter Swoboda, PhD, a cardiologist at the University of Leeds in Leeds, England. “So I think it could be rolled out clinically very easily.”

T2 mapping is a standard MRI sequence, but it is not usually done for patients with heart failure, Swoboda said. However, because it only takes about 10 seconds to complete, including T2 mapping would have a negligible impact on an MRI session that usually lasts 45 minutes to an hour.

“It's one of those interventions that is easily scalable and generalizable,” Swoboda said. “We already do a lot of cardiac MRI, and it is growing. If we add T2 mapping to the standard scan, there may be no need for right heart catheterization.”

The technique still needs to be evaluated with prospective, randomized trials using different scanners and populations, Swoboda said.

Srihari S. Naidu, MD, director of Cardiac Catheterization Labs at Westchester Medical Center and president of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions, said the study was an interesting use of imaging (which usually only looks at the structure of the heart) to measure its function as well.

But Naidu pointed out that the correlation between the MRI- and catheter-derived measurements of SvO2 could differ by up to 15% in either direction in some patients. “It's not as precise as what you get from right heart catheterization,” said Naidu, who was not involved in the study. 

He also noted that right heart catheterization measures several other factors besides SvO2 to paint a more detailed picture of the heart and what interventions might help. For example, catheterization can identify cases of a problem in the lungs, rather than the heart, due to conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. “Going down the pathway of trying to fix the heart makes no sense when it's a lung problem,” he said.

Naidu said the MRI-derived measurements could serve as a useful early warning system to help identify patients who need further interventions or a referral for transplant.

“Once you have imaging of the heart, you can get a relatively loose guide of its overall functional status that can serve as a guide to stratify which patients are at higher risk of heart failure hospitalization,” he said. “That can trigger when we should be concerned and send patients for further evaluation.”

Swoboda and Naidu reported no relevant financial relationships.

Martine  Perez

A global phenomenon is emerging among young people: hikikomori. This Japanese term refers to young people who shut themselves in their rooms with their screens and have only virtual contact with the world. During a session on loneliness at the Brain Congress 2026 held from January 21 to 23 in Paris, France, Marie-Jeanne Guedj Bourdiau, MD, a psychiatrist at Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris, president of the Francophone Association for the Study and Research on Hikikomori (AFHIKI), and author of a book on the subject (see box), defined this new type of disorder and the appropriate course of action.

“It is a form of self-sabotage that is more involuntary than chosen, probably also a new form of transition to adulthood, a new form of passive rebellion against modern societies. It is a disorder at the crossroads of the psychological, the social, and the behavioral. It mainly affects young people aged 15-30 [years], more often males, and generally those from affluent backgrounds,” she said in her opening remarks.

In 1998, a Japanese psychiatrist, Tamaki Saito, described this phenomenon and raised the alarm upon discovering that it affected about 1 million Japanese people. Since then, studies have shown that it affects numerous countries, including Australia, Brazil, China, France, India, Italy, Oman, South Korea, Spain, and the US. “There are no precise figures for France. A mother from a wealthy Paris suburb told me in a consultation, ‘In our building, there is one on every floor. Each time we speak to the media on the subject, we are contacted immediately by an average of 400 families,'” the psychiatrist continued. In France, young people not in education, employment, or training (NEETs) represent 12.5% of 15- to 29-year-olds. The term hikikomori to describe NEETs began to be used in 2025.

Psychiatrists distinguish between two types of hikikomori. The first, called primary, accounts for half the cases and is not associated with a mental disorder. The second, called secondary, occurs in the context of depression, early-stage schizophrenia, or anxiety disorders.

Hikikomori is defined as a young person isolating themself at home for more than 6 months, refusing social relationships, restricting family ties to parents, and rejecting social rules and customs of social lives, coupled with refusing to seek medical help. This is accompanied by physical distress; pain; self-neglect; eating problems such as having underweight or obesity; sleep disorders such as delayed sleep or sleep-wake inversion; and addictions to the internet, video games, cannabis, alcohol, etc.

However, no organic, psychomotor, or other neurologic disorders are observed. Many testimonies are similar; the situations are roughly the same, with only minor differences, but of course, as in any human situation, each case is unique.

“A few risk factors have been identified, such as bullying, academic failure, or disappointments in friendships or romantic relationships,” the speaker added. “These may be young people who had autistic traits in childhood, but others were described as cheerful until then by those around them. Low self-esteem is central in hikikomori. These young people and often their parents cannot cope with failure, especially academic failure. Being shut away is a way of protecting oneself from everything — the outside world, disappointments…”

However, screens are not the cause but a consequence of withdrawal. To combat boredom, heavy screen use helps pass the time and allows contact with the outside world. Prevention begins with education, teaching young people and their families not to be devastated by failure, and explaining how to overcome it. Although the phenomenon of seclusion was already described by a French psychiatrist in 1953, usually associated with mental illness, hikikomori exists in the absence of a mental pathology and appears to be increasing to worrying proportions.

According to the initial Japanese recommendations, the first step is to welcome the suffering family and then try to address treatment for the young person if they accept care: psychotherapy, medications, therapeutic groups, resocialization, and mediation.

In France, the approach is similar and is based primarily on “parental guidance,” except in rare psychiatric emergencies, where the cloistered young person threatens their parents, most often in the context of a mental illness.

“The priority is to respond to the parents and guide them. Young people usually refuse to receive care: ‘Leave me alone, I'm not sick,' they say. The parents are ashamed, hurt, they suffer. In reality, this guidance consists of listening to them, letting them cry…. It is not so much about giving parents a list of specific advice but about listening attentively, making them understand that they need to stop putting pressure on the young person to leave their room, or to see a psychiatrist, to stop telling them, ‘You should do this or that,'” Guedj Bourdiau explained.

The more pressure and anxiety increase in the family — because the young person is in their room, not eating what the family wants, or not registered on Parcoursup (France's centralized university admissions platform), the more the seclusion increases.

Parents need to relearn how to tell their child, “We're happy to be living together,” to rediscover moments of shared happiness, to watch a movie together, and to rebuild connection and affection, for this young person who is afraid of emotions and of emotional intimacy. “Some young people come to see us just to say: ‘I'll do what I want, but take care of my parents!' Sometimes they accept the consultation and acknowledge that they are struggling,” the psychiatrist said. Therapy then becomes possible, tailored to each individual case.

For information, there is also a blog for families and the AFHIKI website. Going out isn't the goal in itself but a consequence of psychological improvement. The young person will improve if they resume household participation, go on vacation, play sports, and regain the capacity for giving and generosity. The difficulty lies in the fact that hikikomori isn't recognized as a psychiatric illness. There isn't a comprehensive body of psychiatric literature on the subject, with guidelines to follow.

It's important to know, however, that this isolation at home can last 6 months, 3 years, 5 years…. No one remains locked up for life. When they emerge, these young people experience a complete blackout on that period of their lives.

Hikikomori. Réparer l'isolement, by Marie-Jeanne Guedj Bourdiau

The book is intended for professionals who need tools to assess a young person's situation and who seek multidisciplinary, integrative solutions.

For families, the book helps identify warning signs, understand behavioral mechanisms, and the suffering of everyone involved, with the aim of encouraging them to take action.

Edited by Zeel Mehta

The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has declined to recommend donanemab  (Kisunla, Eli Lilly) for use in NHS Scotland for early-stage Alzheimer's disease , citing uncertainty over clinical relevance and economic viability. 

The decision affects patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease who are apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 heterozygotes or non-carriers, despite clinical trial data showing statistically significant cognitive benefits over placebo.

As a result, no disease-modifying treatment is currently available for Alzheimer's disease within NHS Scotland, despite growing interest in amyloid-targeting treatments. Clinical management will therefore continue to focus on symptomatic therapies, non-pharmacologic interventions, and supportive care.

Patient organisations acknowledged widespread disappointment over the decision, while stressing the need for treatments that deliver clear, meaningful benefits without compromising safety.

Henry Simmons, chief executive of Alzheimer Scotland, described the ruling  as “devastating for people living with dementia, their families and carers,” saying it exposed fundamental flaws in how dementia drugs are assessed.

He called for dedicated pilot sites to test promising therapies in real-world settings before final NHS funding decisions are made, and urged the creation of a dementia drug innovation fund.

“We owe it to people who have waited decades for effective treatments to give these drugs a genuine chance to show their life-changing potential,” Simmons added.

Alzheimer's disease affects more than 90,000 people in Scotland and is the most common form of dementia, accounting for around 66% of cases. The condition progresses from preclinical disease to severe dementia, with existing treatments limited to symptom management rather than disease modification.

Donanemab is a recombinant humanised immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to a modified form of amyloid-beta found in brain amyloid plaques, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. By targeting these plaques, the drug promotes their clearance through phagocytosis.

The recommended regimen consists of intravenous infusions every 4 weeks, starting with 700 mg for the first three doses, followed by 1400 mg thereafter. Treatment continues until amyloid plaque clearance is confirmed, or for a maximum of 18 months. Therapy should be discontinued if patients progress to moderate Alzheimer's disease before completing treatment.

The phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2  study showed that donanemab slowed cognitive and functional deterioration at 76 weeks compared with placebo.

The trial enrolled 1736 patients with gradual and progressive memory changes, amyloid pathology confirmed by PET imaging, and specific tau pathology markers.

The primary endpoint measured changes in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) scores, which measure both cognition and daily function. However, SMC clinical experts noted that iADRS and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes are not routinely used in UK clinical practice, and views differed on whether changes exceeding 20% on these scales represent clinically meaningful improvement for patients and families.

Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were identified as the main safety concern. ARIA-E (oedema or effusions) occurred in 24% of patients receiving donanemab compared with 1.9% of those receiving placebo, whilst ARIA-H (microhaemorrhages) occurred in 20% vs 7.4%, respectively. 

Most radiographic events developed within 24 weeks of treatment initiation, although they can occur at any time. This necessitates brain MRI scans before treatment and during therapy, in line with the summary of product characteristics.

The SMC committee expressed significant uncertainty about the ""modest"" clinical benefits observed in trials and how these would translate into real-world practice. Experts noted that trial endpoints, such as the iADRS, are not typically used in routine care, complicating assessments of ""meaningful"" improvement.

Implementation would also require substantial changes to services, including PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid analysis to verify beta-amyloid pathology, genetic testing for apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 status, and regular MRI monitoring. Clinical experts consulted by the SMC emphasised that these requirements would have major service implications and require considerable additional clinical capacity.

The rejection was driven largely by insufficient cost-effectiveness data. Although the manufacturer estimated 422 eligible patients in the first year, rising to more than 2100 by year 5, the committee concluded that the long-term economic impact was disproportionate to the benefits offered.

This decision aligns with similar recent rulings by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England and Wales. Donanemab has, however, received regulatory approval for private use from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

AI tools promise faster, cheaper manuscript editing for global researchers, but new evidence shows they may introduce hidden risks that could reshape equity in scientific publishing.

Study: Does ChatGPT enhance equity for global health publications? Copyediting by ChatGPT compared to Grammarly and a human editor. Image credit: Maxx-Studio/Shutterstock.com

A recent PLOS ONE study, based on a small, preliminary case comparison, evaluated the copyediting quality of U-M GPT, Grammarly, and a human editor on two draft research papers. ChatGPT made three times as many corrections as a human editor but was less precise, raising questions about whether artificial intelligence (AI) can truly enhance equity in academic publishing and under what conditions it may help or hinder researchers.

English dominates academic publishing, yet most researchers worldwide speak it as a second language. Non-native English speakers spend up to 51% more time writing papers than native speakers, yet still face rejection due to grammar issues. Professional editing could help, but it is prohibitively expensive.

Often, professional editing services can cost nearly half an early-career researcher's annual salary in countries like Colombia. This could be why researchers from non-English-speaking countries remain severely underrepresented in the academic literature and why language has been described as a structural source of power imbalance in global science.

AI tools have been perceived to bridge this disparity. Although basic grammar checkers, including Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and Grammarly, have been available for years, large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer new possibilities for more sophisticated editing support. However, it is imperative to assess the efficacy and accuracy of these models, as well as the new barriers they may introduce, including technical skill requirements and ethical concerns.

Early research yielded mixed results: one study found that ChatGPT provided helpful grammar corrections for non-native English writers, while another contradicted this, with some authors reporting that AI edits sometimes “over-polish” writing without improving clarity.

The current study defined copyediting as correcting grammar, spelling, syntax, and punctuation; ensuring proper terminology and conventions; checking structure, organization, and clarity; and improving readability, flow, and style. It compared corrections made by U-M GPT, a secure, University of Michigan-hosted generative AI tool, with those made by Grammarly and a human copyeditor on draft manuscripts written by Ugandan sexual and reproductive health researchers.

Two Ugandan researchers provided written approval for the use of their draft manuscripts on reproductive health. Both papers were later published in peer-reviewed journals. The key copyediting goal was to help Ugandan researchers get accepted for peer review.

The authors evaluated the introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of both papers, as well as selected tables. In total, only eight paragraphs and two tables were analyzed, and a single comprehensive prompt was used to test real-world feasibility. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify potential limitations of this approach.

The free web-based version of Grammarly was used, which does not sell user data and restricts access to uploaded text to users only. Grammarly corrections were generated for an expert audience, a formal tone, and a general writing domain. Texts were submitted to U-M GPT one paragraph or table at a time, and the corrections generated were analyzed. A professional copyeditor from the CIRHT/PREPSS training program provided human corrections with access to the full manuscripts, unlike the AI tools that evaluated isolated excerpts.

The researchers classified corrections from the three editors, using fewer sentence-level categories than previous studies. They noted that U-M GPT sometimes removed key information, such as references, which they tracked separately because these deletions posed risks to meaning and accuracy. The authors also acknowledged that classification of edits was performed by an internal research team, which may have unintentionally introduced bias in the assessment of edit quality.

The human copyeditor required 3.75 and 4 hours to edit Papers 1 and 2, respectively. In contrast, U-M GPT generated corrections nearly instantaneously. However, creating a track changes document for each paper with U-M GPT required approximately 30 minutes. Grammarly also generated corrections within seconds, prompting users to accept or reject changes one at a time, a process that took approximately 5 minutes.

Only the human copyeditor could correct both text and tables. U-M GPT suggested pasting table content into the chat, but the researchers found this difficult and impractical. Grammarly does not allow table uploads.

It must be noted that U-M GPT prompted about three times as many corrections as the human editor and roughly ten times as many as Grammarly. The scope of corrections varied by editor. For instance, Grammarly corrected only spelling and grammar, while U-M GPT flagged errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, spacing, and capitalization. In contrast, the human editor corrected grammar, punctuation, spacing, and capitalization, and flagged unclear text rather than attempting to rewrite passages whose meaning was ambiguous, allowing authors to clarify intent themselves.

For readability, U-M GPT yielded the most changes but showed the poorest judgment. Of its 83 revisions, only 61% actually improved the text, while 14% made it worse and 24% had no effect. Grammarly made just five readability corrections, two provided improvements, and three had no real impact. The human editor made 21 corrections: 90% improved the text, one was neutral, and one made it worse.

U-M GPT also deleted important content from one paper, including citations and a table reference, raising concerns that authors, particularly those less confident in English writing, might accept harmful edits uncritically.

The current study highlighted a fundamental difficulty in using AI for academic editing, particularly regarding quality. While U-M GPT generated three times more corrections than a human editor, only 61% actually improved the text. Even though this technology is fast and inexpensive, it introduces risks of deleting key information, making questionable revisions, and potentially blocking content.

The promise of AI-enhanced equity in academic publishing remains uncertain. In addition to quality concerns, the study emphasized issues of data privacy, the environmental costs of large language models, and the need for prompt-engineering skills, meaning the ability to carefully design AI instructions that may themselves create new inequities.

As these tools evolve, researchers need larger studies across diverse manuscript types to understand when AI editing helps and when it hinders. For now, authors using AI editing tools should proceed with caution, because the goal is not rapid editing but access to editing that genuinely improves research communication while preserving author voice, meaning, and scholarly independence.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Obesity drives one in ten infectious disease deaths","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/Obesity-drives-one-in-ten-infectious-disease-deaths.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:34:00 GMT","

Just over one in 10 deaths from a wide range of infectious diseases can be attributed to obesity worldwide, finds a major new study led by a University College London (UCL) researcher.

People with obesity face a 70% higher risk of hospitalization or death from an infection than those of a healthy weight, according to the findings published in The Lancet.

Obesity can increase the risk posed by many different infectious diseases, from flu and Covid-19 to stomach bugs and urinary tract infections, and the researchers found that the higher the BMI, the greater the risk.

The study's lead author, Professor Mika Kivimaki (UCL Faculty of Brain Sciences), said: ""Obesity is well known as a risk factor for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and many other chronic conditions. Here we have found robust evidence that obesity is also linked to worse outcomes from infectious diseases, as becoming very ill from an infection is markedly more common among people with obesity.""

The researchers studied data from over 540,000 people who participate in large cohort studies in the UK (the UK Biobank dataset) and Finland, to look at the relationship between obesity and severe infectious disease. Participants had their body mass index (BMI) assessed when they entered the studies and were then followed up for an average of 13-14 years.

The researchers found that people with obesity (defined as a BMI of 30 or higher) had a 70% higher risk of hospitalisation or death from any infectious disease in the study period compared to people with a BMI between 18.5 to 24.9 (classified as a healthy weight).

The risk increased steadily as body weight increased. People with a BMI of 40 or higher had three times the severe infection risk compared to people with a healthy weight.

The link between obesity and severe infections was consistent regardless of the measure of obesity used (BMI, waist circumference, or waist-to-height ratio, where data was available) and for a wide range of infection types.

The study included data on 925 bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infectious diseases, and the authors also honed in on 10 common infectious diseases in more detail. For most of these diseases, including flu, Covid-19, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, and lower respiratory tract infections, they found that people with obesity were more likely to be hospitalised or die than people with a healthy BMI. However, obesity did not appear to increase the risk of severe HIV or tuberculosis.

The analysis found that the link to severe infections was not explained by obesity-related chronic conditions, as the association was consistent in people with obesity who did not have metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or heart disease, while the association was also not explained by lifestyle factors such as physical activity.

While the study did not investigate the causes of the association, the researchers say that previous studies have suggested that obesity contributes to a general impairment of immune function, including immune dysregulation, chronic systemic inflammation, and metabolic disturbances.

Professor Kivimaki said: ""Our findings suggest that obesity weakens the body's defences against infections, resulting in more serious diseases. People may not get infected more easily, but recovery from infection is clearly harder.""

The researchers found evidence that losing weight can reduce the risk of severe infections as people with obesity who lost weight had a roughly 20% lower risk of severe infections than those who remained obese.

As obesity rates are expected to rise globally, so will the number of deaths and hospitalizations from infectious diseases linked to obesity.

To reduce the risk of severe infections, as well as other health issues linked with obesity, there is an urgent need for policies that help people stay healthy and support weight loss, such as access to affordable healthy food and opportunities for physical activity. Furthermore, if someone has obesity, it is especially important to keep their recommended vaccinations up to date.""

Dr. Solja Nyberg, First Author, University of Helsinki

The authors used infectious disease mortality data from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study to model the impact of obesity on infectious disease deaths for different countries, regions and globally.

The analysis suggested 0.6 million out of 5.4 million (10.8% or one in 10) infectious diseases deaths globally were linked with obesity in 2023.

The researchers estimated that in the UK, one in six (17%) infection-related deaths can be attributable to obesity, and 26% in the US.

Co-author Dr Sara Ahmadi-Abhari (Imperial College London), who conducted the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) analyses, said: ""Estimates of the global impact give a sense of how large the problem may be, but they should be interpreted with caution. Data on infection-related deaths and obesity in the GBD are not always accurate, particularly in low-resource countries.""

This study was funded by Wellcome, Medical Research Council and Research Council of Finland.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Barriers to testosterone therapy drive men toward underground sources","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/Barriers-to-testosterone-therapy-drive-men-toward-underground-sources.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:30:00 GMT","

Some men are resorting to obtaining testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) from underground sources due to significant barriers to accessing the therapy through formal medical channels, according to new Griffith University research.

PhD Candidate Ben Bonenti from Griffith University's School of Applied Psychology explored the experiences of men using TRT in Australia with a focus on access barriers, perceived health effects, and how men self-managed and regulated their testosterone use in practice.

What we found was a complex picture.

Men found significant barriers in accessing TRT through formal medical channels, including bureaucratic delays, financial costs, and stigma.

Despite access challenges, TRT was widely described as transformative, with reported improvements in both physical and mental health.""

Ben Bonenti, PhD Candidate, Griffith University's School of Applied Psychology

The study tracked nine men, aged 18 years or older, who used TRT and documented their experiences via videoconferencing interviews.

The results raised many key issues, particularly for men who frequently described self-regulating dosages, with some even mixing prescribed testosterone with underground products to manage access gaps.

These practices reflected active, self-managed care rather than passive medical compliance.

""While TRT was framed as a medical treatment, participants' experiences showed access and use were strongly shaped by social, financial and regulatory constraints,"" Mr Bonenti said.

""The findings suggest the current models of TRT may not align with how men actually engage with testosterone use.

""It shows a need for adaptive, participatory harm reduction approaches which move beyond narrow biomedical frameworks and better reflect real-world practices.

""Improving access and reducing stigma may reduce reliance on informal and unregulated sources.""

Perceptive IRT was the system of choice for a study including patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) due to COVID-19-related problems. The trial was managed by a CRO, and Perceptive collaborated closely with both the CRO and the sponsor team.

 

Image Credit: Christina Krivonos/Shutterstock.com

On paper, the trial had a fairly simple IRT design, aiming to determine whether the study medication would reduce time spent in the intensive care unit.

Patients were recruited to the study upon admission, treated in the ICU, and dosed up to six times over 28 days or until discharge, whichever occurred first.

From the outset of the study, a depot network had been constructed, and supplies were sent to sites based on expected recruitment rates. However, clinical trials rarely go as planned.

During the trial, the sponsor had to replace the distribution providers because they were dissatisfied with the initially selected provider. The transfer had to be made in flight, while sites were still recruiting, without disrupting supply to sites or patient recruitment.

During the final 10 months of the research, the sponsor faced a crucial medication management scenario. Due to a longer-than-anticipated start-up period, the medication stored at depots and sites was nearing expiry.

Without more stock and no time to manufacture more medication, they risked being unable to supply patients with medication, causing the experiment to end before reaching the required sample size.

The Perceptive project manager used their experience managing comparable circumstances to meet the sponsor's problems.

Perceptive IRT provides standard integrations for distribution suppliers used in this study. Switching vendors mid-research required modifying the depot network and implementing different integration standards to ensure ease of use for the new distribution vendor.

Fortunately, Perceptive IRT inventory management has flexible settings designed to handle unexpected scenarios like this one. The Perceptive team used those parameters to enhance pharmaceutical stockpiles at sites, anticipating that supplies would need to last longer during the depot transition phase.

Perceptive assisted the clinical supplies team in transporting medication to the new depots and releasing it for use after it was confirmed available at the new locations. The depot shift and new integration were invisible to sites.

The Perceptive project manager was essential in advising the CRO and sponsor on how to approach this scenario and in proposing the best available options. They coordinated the required updates and released them at the appropriate times, in accordance with the physical transfer of the pharmaceutical stock.

It might be difficult to deal with situations where medication is approaching its expiration date. Perceptive's IRT features adjustable Do Not Ship and Do Not Dispense settings that can be set down to the patient dispensing level if necessary.

Perceptive would typically advise against changing those settings, but its staff has experience and skills to perform those adjustments safely.

In this trial, the Perceptive project manager collaborated closely with the clinical operations team whenever a patient required medicine. This includes proactively updating patient status in the IRT to reduce the risk of prescribing too much medication, thereby enhancing shipment accuracy.

They demonstrated strong communication and prioritization skills, ensuring that inventory management settings were swiftly and appropriately adjusted to enable patient medication dispensing.

The Perceptive project manager kept the study team updated throughout the process, allowing them to establish expectations with monitoring and site personnel.

Because of Perceptive's adaptable technology and strong project management, the sponsor was able to enroll the required number of patients and dispense medication to them without jeopardizing their safety or the trial's success.

The trial was a success, and it supported the sponsor's request to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients.

For over 30 years, Perceptive eClinical has been a pioneer in RTSM, building and supporting thousands of studies of all designs, from all therapeutic areas and across all phases.With industry-leading experts delivering flexible, right-fit solutions to accelerate your trial and safeguard your data, we're more than just an RTSM provider, we are your ally, in streamlining clinical trials, improving data accuracy, and enhancing participant experience.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study links eye movements to real-time memory retrieval","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/Study-links-eye-movements-to-real-time-memory-retrieval.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:50:00 GMT","

The eyes may reveal how experiences are recalled according to new Baycrest research that suggests that shifts in eye movements play a critical role in memory retrieval. The findings offer new insight into how memory works and how it may change with brain disease.

The findings show that eye movements, specifically saccades, increase just before people recall episodic details - such as what was seen, heard or felt during past, real-life events - and decrease immediately afterward. This pattern was not observed when participants recalled non-episodic details, such as general facts or background information.

""By aligning eye movements with spoken recall on the order of milliseconds, we were able to see memory unfolding in real time,"" says Dr. Brian Levine, Senior Scientist at Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute and senior author of the study titled ""Remembrance with gazes passed: Eye movements precede continuous recall of episodic details of real-life events,"" published online ahead of print in Cognition. ""These findings show that eye movements are closely tied to the brain's processing and reconstruction of visual and spatial memories from past events, not just a byproduct of remembering.""

In the study, 91 healthy young adults were asked to take an audio-guided museum-style tour of artworks and installations at Baycrest in Toronto, conducted in two ten-minute segments. One week later, participants freely recalled the tour while viewing a blank screen, as their eye movements were recorded using a video-based eye-tracking system. This approach allowed researchers to synchronize each eye movement with the precise timing of spoken narrative details.

The analysis revealed a striking pattern: episodic details were consistently preceded by a burst of eye movements and followed by a brief quieting of visual scanning before the next memory detail emerged. No such timing relationship was found for non-episodic content.

Autobiographical memory is often affected early in neurological conditions such as dementia. Understanding the fine-grained mechanisms that support memory retrieval could help researchers develop more sensitive tools for assessing brain health.

Natural, unconstrained behaviours like eye movements offer a promising window into cognitive function. Because they can be measured unobtrusively and repeatedly, they may eventually complement traditional memory assessments in both research and clinical settings.""

Dr. Brian Levine, Senior Scientist at Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute and senior author of the study

The researchers note that similar principles may apply beyond dementia. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for example, involves highly vivid and intrusive recollection of traumatic events, alongside functional and structural changes in visual brain networks. Effective interventions for PTSD aim to contextualize traumatic experiences and reduce the emotional impact of intrusive visual memories. Fine-grained behavioural analyses like those used in this study could help test and refine such interventions.

The team emphasizes that future longitudinal studies will be needed to determine how these eye-movement patterns change with normal aging and neurodegenerative disease, and whether they could serve as early markers of memory decline.

This research was led by Ryan Barker, a PhD student at Baycrest and the University of Toronto, and Dr. Jennifer Ryan, Senior Scientist at Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute.

Just three pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) dominate retail prescriptions in Medicare Part D and Medicaid managed care across much of the country, with markets in in nearly every state considered highly concentrated for at least one program, according to a new study from the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics.

The study, published Feb. 6 in JAMA Health Forum, provides one of the most detailed examinations to date of PBM competition within states. Based on a federal antitrust index, the authors find:

The study comes as policymakers and regulators continue to scrutinize industry practices over concerns about how these middlemen contribute to higher drug costs, pharmacy closures and restricted patient access to medicines. The spending package passed by Congress earlier this week includes new restrictions on industry practices, and states have been increasing regulation of PBMs in recent years.

When a few PBMs dominate a market, they hold outsized power over how much patients pay for drugs, where they can fill their prescriptions and whether their essential medications are covered.""

Dima Mazen Qato, lead author, senior scholar at the Schaeffer Center and the Hygeia Centennial Chair, USC Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences

""These findings can guide federal and state policies to improve PBM accountability and transparency, particularly in Medicare Part D and Medicaid. They can also inform ongoing efforts to address PBM market concentration, including recently enacted legislation, new regulatory proposals, and federal enforcement actions focused on PBM conduct.""

Many people may have a dim view of their fat tissue, yet scientists have come to recognize adipose as a necessary and metabolically active organ, carrying out many vital functions within the body.

In the case of obesity, too much fat can contribute to conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Intriguingly, for people with certain rare genetic and autoimmune disorders, such as familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2), the abnormal loss and distribution of adipose tissue can also lead to diabetes and metabolic disease.

This paradox had long vexed Elif Oral, M.D., a clinician and Professor in the Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Diabetes. She's dedicated her research career to uncovering the underlying mechanism of pathological fat loss, to help patients with lipodystrophy syndromes.

With the generous help of patients with FPLD2, Oral along with Ormond MacDougald, Ph.D., Professor of Molecular & Integrative Physiology, graduate student researcher Jessica Maung, Ph.D., and their collaborative team have finally found some answers.

""A simple explanation is that all of the fat cells (adipocytes) have really catastrophic things happening in them,"" said Maung. The team created a mouse model in which they inducibly knocked out the lamin A/C gene in adipocytes, which is mutated in patients with FPLD2.

The team observed in both animal models and in patient donor tissue that dramatic gene expression changes lead to the fat cells being unable to carry out their normal lipid handling and storage functions. In addition, the fat cells themselves and the immune cells within adipose tissue became pro-inflammatory. Finally, mitochondria inside the fat cells became dysfunctional.

Said Maung, ""All of these effects come together to create this perfect environment for the tissue to be really unhealthy and eventually disappear.""

In the absence of healthy adipose tissue, the normal maintenance of lipids and release of metabolic hormones goes awry, leading to metabolic diseases like diabetes and fatty liver disease.

""This is really underscoring the importance of healthy fats in keeping metabolism intact and functional,"" said Oral. People think of Type 2 diabetes as a disease of beta cells, but it's actually a disease of fat cells, too.""

The team hopes that these insights will help identify future therapeutic targets, enable targeting of adipose tissue to prevent it from disappearing, and correct metabolic dysfunction in this disease.

I think this work is an outstanding example of a collaboration between a translational clinical researcher and a basic science physiologist. We also can't overstate the importance of the patient population and their involvement in developing therapies and their dedication to understanding their disease.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Newly identified protein interaction fine-tunes cellular stress responses","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/Newly-identified-protein-interaction-fine-tunes-cellular-stress-responses.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:06:00 GMT","

Cornell researchers have discovered a new way cells regulate how they respond to stress, identifying an interaction between two proteins that helps keep a critical cellular recycling system in balance. 

The findings show that a protein called SHKBP1 regulates another protein, p62, which plays a key role in clearing damaged cell components and activating antioxidant defenses. By helping maintain this balance, SHKBP1 allows cells to respond appropriately to stress – a process that can break down in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

The study, published Feb. 6 in the Journal of Cell Biology, was led by Lin Luan, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology, and Jeremy Baskin, associate professor and Nancy and Peter Meinig Family Investigator in the Life Sciences in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology.

""Our cells are constantly dealing with stresses, whether from normal metabolism or specific insults from the environment,"" Baskin said. ""A protein called p62 is a central player in this recycling operation, as it gathers damaged proteins into compartments called 'p62 bodies' where they can be dealt with.""

However, the key challenge for p62 is a Goldilocks problem, he said. With too little activity, toxic proteins can accumulate, which is seen in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. With too much p62 activity, the system becomes overactive, which happens in many cancers, as cancer cells use the output of this recycling process to fuel tumor growth.

Using a combination of advanced biochemical and imaging techniques, the team sought to view how the two proteins interact inside living cells. 

What we found was that SHKBP1 binds directly to a portion of p62 that normally allows it to aggregate into large clusters, so SHKBP1 binding physically prevented p62 molecules from clustering together into large bodies. Removing SHKBP1 caused p62 bodies to grow larger and less fluid, while adding extra SHKBP1 made them smaller and more dynamic.""

Jeremy Baskin, associate professor and Nancy and Peter Meinig Family Investigator in the Life Sciences, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, College of Arts and Sciences and the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology

Cells rely on a well-known antioxidant defense system called the Keap1–Nrf2 pathway to respond to oxidative stress. Under normal conditions, this system is balanced, but when cells experience stress, it switches on a protective response that helps limit cellular damage. p62 plays an important role in this process by helping remove a protein that suppresses the antioxidant response. The new study shows that SHKBP1 influences this system indirectly, by controlling how p62 behaves, helping determine how strongly the protective response is activated.

Cancer cells often hijack this pathway to survive chemotherapy, while neurons in neurodegenerative diseases may fail to activate it when needed most. 

Though the research was focused on the discovery of basic cellular mechanisms, there are exciting connections to human diseases that may spur new therapeutic strategies in the future, Baskin said.

""Understanding how SHKBP1 influences this balance could open new therapeutic avenues,"" he said. ""If loss of SHKBP1 function naturally boosts the Nrf2 response, perhaps we could develop drugs that safely inhibit SHKBP1 in the brain to provide neuroprotection.""

Led by Luan and Baskin, the study included contributions from Zijun Xia and Xiaofu Cao, two doctoral students in Baskin's lab, and collaborators at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, and drew upon key support from the Cornell Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility within the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center. It was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health.

A major study by UCL and Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan (INT) researchers has for the first time shown in detail how far children's cancer has spread at diagnosis in a way that can be compared between countries.

While poorer survival following late-stage diagnosis is well recognised, the study is the first to show that differences in tumor stage at diagnosis may explain why childhood cancer survival varies between some European regions and tumor types.

Published in JAMA Network Open, the researchers analyzed high-quality data from the cases of 9,883 children from 73 population-based cancer registries across 27 countries, mainly European, diagnosed with six different cancers – neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, medulloblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma – between 2014 and 2017.

They found that across all six cancers, survival at three years was strongly linked to tumor stage at diagnosis, with survival decreasing as stage increased.

Using Central Europe as the benchmark and looking at the data by region, they found significant variation in overall three-year survival rate between some regions in the cases of four of those cancers.

In the case of neuroblastoma – tumor of adrenal gland and some other sites – they found that children had lower survival rates in the UK and Ireland compared with Central Europe, a difference that could be explained by the relatively later stage at which that cancer was diagnosed in the UK and Ireland.

In the case of Ewing sarcoma (bone tumor), by contrast, in Eastern Europe and in the UK and Ireland, the lower survival rate compared with Central Europe wasn't accounted for by later diagnosis. In fact, the difference was only seen for patients whose tumor had spread. The researchers suggested that other factors such as where the tumor had spread to and any differences in treatment approaches for children whose cancer has spread need to be investigated.

Until now the lack of reliable data on tumor stage at diagnosis has meant it was impossible to use registry data to shed light on the difference in child cancer survival rates by country.

The UCL and INT researchers' International Benchmarking of Childhood Cancer Survival by Stage (BENCHISTA) project has improved the way national cancer registries collect childhood cancer data so it can be compared reliably.

Through an agreement which took 18 months to broker, the countries involved in the study – 23 European countries including the UK but also Brazil, Canada, Australia and Japan – improved their data collection techniques to ensure at least 90% of the child cancer cases in their countries had tumor stage recorded (a level deemed acceptable for accurate international data analysis) and in a consistent way (using what is known as the Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines, which were developed in the 2010s).

The result is that for the first time researchers are in a position to better understand why childhood cancer survival rates differ from region to region with a view to guiding efforts to improve those rates.

Their findings highlight the need to examine other factors, such as differences in treatment approaches, access to specialised care, and health system differences.

This will be a focus of the next phase of the BENCHISTA project, which will also report five-year survival, the standard epidemiology cancer outcome measure.

By analyzing population-level data from cancer registries across many countries, we have been able to better understand why childhood cancer survival still differs internationally.

Our findings show that diagnosing cancer earlier and accurately assessing how far it has spread can make a meaningful difference to survival for many children. At the same time, the study highlights that early diagnosis alone will not address all disparities, and further work is needed to understand and tackle other contributing factors.

We have, for the first time, provided unbiased, population-level evidence for later diagnosis of some childhood cancers in the UK and Ireland.""

Professor Kathy Pritchard-Jones, Joint Senior Author, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health

Altogether, the findings from BENCHISTA will provide unbiased evidence regarding the need for both cancer-specific strategies and broader improvements in diagnosis and care, the researchers say.

Corresponding author Dr Laura Botta, a statistician in the INT's Evaluative Epidemiology Unit, said: ""Our project not only emphasises the importance of gathering high-quality data and strengthening cooperation between clinicians and population-based cancer registries but also serves as a key tool to uncover the reasons for survival differences between countries for children with cancer.

""Our results provide the first population-based and international evidence that, in some countries, paediatric tumors are diagnosed at more advanced stages compared to a group of European countries with the most consistent practices, while in others, staging procedures do not meet recommended standards – clearly impacting prognosis. We hope these findings will help guide health policies that are vital to saving lives.""

The study was funded by Children with Cancer UK and Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC). Two of the researchers involved in the project, Professor Pritchard-Jones and Dr Angela Lopez-Cortes, also received funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre.

Gavin Maggs, Chief Executive of Children with Cancer UK, said: ""We are proud to have funded this important study, which provides powerful new evidence on the role that early diagnosis plays in improving childhood cancer survival.

""By bringing together experts from around the world, BENCHISTA shows how internationally comparable data can guide global efforts to ensure children are diagnosed as early as possible and receive the right care at the right time. Cancer does not recognise borders, and neither should the chances of surviving it.""

Ashley Ball-Gamble, chief executive of CCLG: The Children & Young People's Cancer Association, said: ""This study confirms that, for some childhood cancers, diagnosis in the UK still takes longer than it should.

""Because delays can affect a child's chance of survival, campaigning for faster recognition is more important than ever.

""Our Child Cancer Smart campaign aims to tackle these delays by giving GPs the tools to identify cancer sooner - and by helping parents understand the warning signs.""

Angela Polanco, the project's patient and public involvement lead, whose daughter Bethany was diagnosed with Wilms tumor, said: ""This study provides clear evidence that we need to do more to ensure children affected by cancer have access to timely and accurate diagnosis, appropriate first-line treatment, and specialist care, wherever they live.

""Collecting and analyzing this information at a population level is a crucial step towards reducing inequalities and improving survival for children with cancer.""

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a muscle tumor, medulloblastoma is a brain tumor, osteosarcoma – like Ewing sarcoma – is a bone tumor and Wilms' tumor is a kidney tumor.

As with many rare disease studies, the relatively small number of cases and the three-year follow-up period mean that some longer-term survival differences may not yet be fully captured.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Staffing and flexibility drive nurses' return to hospital work","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/Staffing-and-flexibility-drive-nursese28099-return-to-hospital-work.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:56:00 GMT","

Most registered nurses who recently left hospital employment are motivated to return to health care work-and safe nurse staffing levels is the top factor that would bring them back, according to new research from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing's Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research (CHOPR).

Published in JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data from 4,043 actively licensed registered nurses who left direct care hospital positions within the last five years. Among them, 8% were employed outside health care, 36% were unemployed, and 56% were retired.

Most unemployed nurses had searched for health care work within the past year and said they were likely to return to nursing. One-quarter of nurses working outside health care said they had also searched for nursing positions recently.

Adequate staffing emerged as the top factor that nurses said would increase their likelihood of returning to nursing work. ""Unsafe staffing drives nurses away from hospital employment – and adequate staffing is the key to bringing them back,"" said lead-author Karen B. Lasater, PhD, RN, FAAN, the Jessie M. Scott Term Chair in Nursing and Health Policy, Associate Professor in the Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences and CHOPR Associate Director. ""The problem and the solution are the same. High nurse turnover is a solvable crisis, because the reasons nurses leave are the same reasons they would return, if addressed.""

Another key factor included flexible scheduling options. ""Nurses are often locked into rigid shift schedules that limit their ability to transition between shifts or chose different work blocks,"" said senior author K. Jane Muir, PhD RN, FNP-BC, Assistant Professor in the Department of Family and Community Health. ""Hospitals can reattract an existing nurse workforce by reconsidering these arrangements to remain competitive.""

The study also revealed that over one-third of retired nurses (37%) left earlier than planned, despite 90% being satisfied with nursing as a career. ""The findings suggest premature workforce exits are driven by modifiable organizational issues, not problems with the profession itself,"" said coauthor Matthew D. McHugh, PhD, JD, RN, CRNP, FAAN, the Independence Chair for Nursing Education, Professor of Nursing and CHOPR Director. ""Warnings about nursing shortages should be treated with caution given the existence of an untapped latent labor force willing to work at the bedside if working conditions were better.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Research clarifies micelle interactions driving sustained drug release","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/Research-clarifies-micelle-interactions-driving-sustained-drug-release.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:31:00 GMT","

Polymer micelles are tiny, self-assembled particles that are revolutionizing the landscape of drug delivery and nanomedicine. They form when polymer chains containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments organize into nanoscale spheres in liquid solutions; these structures can trap and hold drugs that are otherwise difficult to dissolve. Poloxamer 407 (P407), a widely studied micelle-forming polymer, is particularly useful because it changes from a liquid into a soft gel as it warms, becoming most stable near body temperature. This temperature-dependent gelling behavior allows P407 to slowly release loaded drugs over time, thus reducing dosing frequency and their side effects.

Despite extensive laboratory research, scientists have struggled to fully understand P407's sol–gel transition. Its peculiar properties do not come from individual micelles acting alone, but from how they interact and arrange themselves together. However, most existing knowledge is based on experiments in pure water, which is far simpler than the liquid environments found in the human body. On top of this, existing theoretical models rely on assumptions that do not work well for polymer micelles, leaving key inter-micellar forces unclear and difficult to predict in laboratory saline solutions that mimic bodily fluids.

To tackle these knowledge gaps, a research team led by Associate Professor Takeshi Morita from the Graduate School of Science, Chiba University, Japan, conducted an in-depth experimental study on how P407 micelles interact in a saline environment. Their paper, made available online on December 9, 2025, and will be published in Volume 707 of the Journal of Colloid and Interface Science on April 1, 2026, was co-authored by Mr. Shunsuke Takamatsu, Dr. Kenjirou Higashi, and Ms. Minami Saito, all from Chiba University; Dr. Hiroshi Imamura from Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology, Japan; and Dr. Tomonari Sumi from Muroran Institute of Technology, Japan.

Rather than assuming anything about how micelles should behave, the researchers used experimental data to quantify their interactions under conditions that closely resemble those inside the body. They focused on P407 micelles dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), a standard solution used in biological research, and combined two complementary techniques. First, small-angle X-ray scattering was used to probe how micelles are positioned relative to one another over nanoscale distances, revealing collective structural patterns. Then, they used dynamic light scattering to measure the sizes and motion of individual polymer chains, micelles, and larger aggregates by tracking fluctuations in scattered light.

By integrating these datasets, the researchers calculated the 'pair interaction potential,' a quantitative description of how strongly two micelles attract or repel each other depending on their separation. They found that as the temperature increased toward gel formation, micelles became more regularly spaced, moving slightly farther apart yet still remaining connected. This behavior is consistent with an entropy-driven process known as the Alder transition, in which particles crystallize because an ordered arrangement allows more freedom for small thermal motions. However, in PBS, the attractive forces between micelles were stronger than in water, meaning they tended to bind more tightly. This stronger attraction limited how far micelles could separate, producing a gel with more structural fluctuations and less uniform order.

The team demonstrated that these differences had marked effects on gel stability. Gels formed in saline broke down at lower temperatures than those formed in water, suggesting that structural fluctuations weaken the gel as temperature rises and make it collapse sooner. ""With this improved understanding of inter-micellar interactions that govern drug nanocarrier properties, it will be possible to elucidate and predict the fundamental mechanisms of sustained drug release behavior and gelation in environments closer to bodily conditions,"" states Dr. Morita.

The findings of this study have important implications for drug delivery research. Polymer micelles like P407 are widely studied as promising carriers for novel drugs, including many modern anticancer and anti-inflammatory compounds. Understanding how salts and ions affect micelle interactions could help researchers design formulations that release drugs more predictably and remain stable at body temperature. ""By advancing our knowledge of micelle behavior under physiological conditions, our work will help advance drug nanocarrier research, enhance the pharmacological efficacy of poorly soluble drugs, and contribute to the development of technologies that reduce the physical and psychological burden of taking medications,"" concludes Dr. Morita.

Beyond the specific micellar system of P407, this work demonstrates how experimentally grounded approaches can clarify interactions and physical mechanisms in complex soft materials-an essential step toward translating nanoscience into practical applications.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Medical AI can repeat false claims in clinical contexts","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/Medical-AI-can-repeat-false-claims-in-clinical-contexts.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:52:00 GMT","

Medical artificial intelligence (AI) is often described as a way to make patient care safer by helping clinicians manage information. A new study by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and collaborators confronts a critical vulnerability: when a medical lie enters the system, can AI pass it on as if it were true?

Analyzing more than a million prompts across nine leading language models, the researchers found that these systems can repeat false medical claims when they appear in realistic hospital notes or social-media health discussions.

The findings, published in the February 9 online issue of The Lancet Digital Health [10.1016/j.landig.2025.100949], suggest that current safeguards do not reliably distinguish fact from fabrication once a claim is wrapped in familiar clinical or social-media language.

To test this systematically, the team exposed the models to three types of content: real hospital discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database with a single fabricated recommendation added; common health myths collected from Reddit; and 300 short clinical scenarios written and validated by physicians. Each case was presented in multiple versions, from neutral wording to emotionally charged or leading phrasing similar to what circulates on social platforms.

In one example, a discharge note falsely advised patients with esophagitis-related bleeding to ""drink cold milk to soothe the symptoms."" Several models accepted the statement rather than flagging it as unsafe. They treated it like ordinary medical guidance.

Our findings show that current AI systems can treat confident medical language as true by default, even when it's clearly wrong. A fabricated recommendation in a discharge note can slip through. It can be repeated as if it were standard care. For these models, what matters is less whether a claim is correct than how it is written.""

Eyal Klang, MD, co-senior and co-corresponding author, Chief of Generative AI in the Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

The authors say the next step is to treat ""can this system pass on a lie?"" as a measurable property, using large-scale stress tests and external evidence checks before AI is built into clinical tools.

""Hospitals and developers can use our dataset as a stress test for medical AI,"" says physician-scientist and first author Mahmud Omar, MD, who consults with the research team. ""Instead of assuming a model is safe, you can measure how often it passes on a lie, and whether that number falls in the next generation.""

""AI has the potential to be a real help for clinicians and patients, offering faster insights and support,"" says co-senior and co-corresponding author Girish N. Nadkarni, MD, MPH, Chair of the Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health, Director of the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health, Irene and Dr. Arthur M. Fishberg Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Chief AI Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System. ""But it needs built-in safeguards that check medical claims before they are presented as fact. Our study shows where these systems can still pass on false information, and points to ways we can strengthen them before they are embedded in care.""

The paper is titled ""Mapping LLM Susceptibility to Medical Misinformation Across Clinical Notes and Social Media.""

Synthace, the leader in software and services for assay development, today announced a collaboration with Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (Charles River), a leading global drug discovery, development, testing, and manufacturing solutions provider. Under the collaboration, Charles River will give its clients access to Synthace's transformative approach to developing, automating and transferring more robust assays, faster and more efficiently than using other methodologies.

The collaboration follows a successful proof-of-concept project in which Charles River used Synthace's software to effectively and rapidly develop a 1536-well assay and assay transfer, implementing a design of over 700 experimental conditions across multiple laboratories and equipment.

Reproducing experiments across different sites has long been a significant challenge for biology research and development teams, with 72 % of researchers acknowledging a reproducibility crisis.1,2 With such a challenge estimated to cost $100 billion annually in preclinical research alone, the collaboration between Synthace and Charles River has the potential to improve reproducibility through a new approach to assay development.

Without assays, there is no drug discovery. Assays provide a window into how molecules might become drugs, yet their development often ends up as a time-consuming bottleneck. Biological complexity hampers assay development and transfer, creating costly delays, variable data and significant frustration for project teams. In addition, while the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) can help accelerate areas such as target identification, this adds to the volume of demands that must still be validated through wet lab experiments, contributing to delays.

Many Research and Development (R&D) teams use one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approaches to develop assays, yet this method is time consuming and limited in scope. To combat this, Synthace enabled Charles River to derisk its assay development and transfer through a combination of Design of Experiments (DoE), automation and software. This was significant because, while having clear benefits, DoE has traditionally been considered a complex, resource-intensive process with a high barrier to adoption.

With Synthace's technology integrated into Charles River's lab automation, teams were able to implement high-throughput DoE across multiple locations and a diverse user base, achieving:

Computational biology has taken a significant leap forward with AI, but in doing so, the lab risks being left behind. Combining DoE, automation and software is the answer, as together they deliver a step-change in experimental power to unpick biological complexity. We call this High Dimensional Experimentation, and it will be the next generation of experiments for drug discovery.""

Markus Gershater, CEO and co-founder, Synthace

Dr Rob Howes, Senior Director of Small Molecule Discovery at Charles River, said: ""Synthace allows us to conduct more technically demanding experiments with greater scientific rigour. With this, we know that the assays we're developing are more robust, allowing a greater degree of certainty in the results we're seeing, while also improving their reproducibility. In doing so, we're dramatically reducing the amount of time we need to develop robust assays and ultimately speeding up this critical part of drug discovery.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals how inherited genetic abnormalities raise Barrett's esophagus risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260210/Study-reveals-how-inherited-genetic-abnormalities-raise-Barrette28099s-esophagus-risk.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:38:00 GMT","

Case Western Reserve University researchers have made a significant breakthrough in understanding Barrett's esophagus, a precancerous condition that dramatically increases the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, one of the fastest-spreading and deadliest forms of cancer.

In a new study, they've discovered how inherited genetic abnormalities increase the chance of developing Barrett's esophagus by weakening the esophageal lining, making it more susceptible to harm caused by stomach bile acid.

Barrett's esophagus occurs when the normal lining of the food pipe (the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach) is replaced by specialized cells usually present in the intestinal lining. This condition affects about 5% of the population nationally-especially those with chronic heartburn, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

But the molecular factors responsible for the onset of Barrett's esophagus remain poorly understood.

The findings, published in Nature Communications, combined family studies, laboratory experiments and genetically engineered mouse models to identify and understand how genetic defects contribute to disease development.

The team sequenced and analyzed genetic material of 684 people from 302 families where multiple members developed Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer. They discovered that a subset of affected family members carry inherited mutations in a gene called VSIG10L.

We found that this gene acts like a quality control system for the esophageal lining. When it's defective, the cells do not mature properly and the protective barrier in the esophageal lining becomes weak, allowing stomach bile acid to cause tissue changes that enhances the risk of developing Barrett's esophagus.""

Kishore Guda, lead researcher, associate professor, Department of Pathology and GMS-Oncology, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine

When researchers genetically engineered mice with human-equivalent VSIG10L mutations, they found that the esophageal lining became disrupted structurally and molecularly, according to Guda, also a member of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Digestive Health Research Institute. The study found that when the mice were exposed to bile acid, they developed Barrett's-like disease over time, effectively replicating the disease's progression in humans.

These genetically engineered mice also represent the first animal model for Barrett's esophagus based directly on human genetic predisposition to the disease, Guda said.

With VSIG10L shown to be a key gene in maintaining esophageal health, family members can now be screened for genetic variants to identify those at a high-risk of developing Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer.

Case Western Reserve has been a global leader in research on gastrointestinal oncology, with a long-standing history of clinically impactful discoveries on the genetic causes of colorectal and gastroesophageal cancers. The university was also the first to identify a genetic predisposition to Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. If left untreated, these cancers can spread to other parts of the body.

""Knowledge gained from studying such familial aspects of disease will enable us to rapidly translate these findings into the clinic,"" Guda said. ""We can now conduct early screenings and develop preventative strategies before the disease develops, ultimately restoring patients' quality of life and curtailing cancer deaths. In addition to enabling a deeper understanding on the molecular basis of Barrett's esophagus, our findings have important implications in other tissue and disease contexts where VSIG10L is relevant"".

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Brain differences reveal hidden causes of math learning disability","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260209/Brain-differences-reveal-hidden-causes-of-math-learning-disability.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:36:00 GMT","

On a simple math task - indicating which of two amounts is greater - kids with math learning disability get the right answer as often as their good-at-math peers, but behind the scenes, their brains are working differently, a new Stanford Medicine study has found. The differences shed light on what causes their math struggles.

The findings, which will be published online Feb. 9 in the Journal of Neuroscience, show that children with a math learning disability are less likely to solve problems at the right speed, or to slow down after they make mistakes, particularly while working with number symbols. Their brain scans show different levels of activity in centers involved in executive function - which is similar to air traffic control, enabling focused attention - and checking for errors.

The discoveries point toward new ways to help kids with math learning disability, the researchers said.

Our findings suggest that interventions should target not only basic number sense, but also metacognitive processes, like performance monitoring - how do you adjust when you notice an error? We need to provide these children with feedback and training to build those cognitive skills.""

Vinod Menon, PhD, senior author, the Rachael L. and Walter F. Nichols, MD, Professor and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences

While having their brains scanned via functional magnetic resonance imaging, kids in the study answered problems that were posed in two ways: They compared different-sized groups of dots, and compared Arabic numerals.

""What we found was that children with math learning disability show specific difficulties with symbolic numbers, and particularly with updating their strategy as they work with number symbols,"" said co-lead author Hyesang Chang, PhD, a former research scientist at Stanford Medicine. In other words, kids with math learning disability are less likely to adjust after making mistakes, she said.

Research scientists Percy Mistry, PhD, and Yuan Zhang, PhD, share lead authorship of the paper with Chang.

The study focused on children in second and third grades. Of the 87 children whose data was analyzed, 34 had math learning disability, meaning they scored at or below the 25th percentile on a standard test of math fluency; the other 53 children had higher scores indicating typical math-learning ability. 

Math learning disability can be defined in different ways. The criteria used in this study - placing in the bottom quarter of scores on a standard test - is fairly broad, which was intentional, Menon said, as it helps make the findings applicable to many children who struggle with math. Some people, about 3% to 7% of the population, have a more strictly defined form of math learning disability called dyscalculia that includes difficulties understanding and comparing quantities, learning to count, understanding number symbols and learning math-based skills such as telling time.

Identifying students with math learning disabilities early and offering prompt, effective help is important for keeping their education on track, Menon said.

""If you're not doing well, you lose interest and motivation, and you may get more anxious during problem solving because you feel you're not good at it,"" he said. ""It's a cascading set of problems; it becomes a bottleneck to further learning.""

For the study, the researchers chose the simple task of comparing two quantities because they wanted to assess differences in the children's brain processes as they worked with numbers, independent of differences in their math performance. While in the MRI scanner, children saw pairs of quantities and pressed a button to indicate which of each pair was larger. Some problems used dots to show quantities; others used Arabic numerals. Problems were classified as easy (those with a large gap between the numbers, such as 7 versus 2) or hard (separated by only one number, such as 6 versus 7).

Although children with and without math learning disability had similar rates of correct answers, data from their responses and brain scans revealed differences between the two groups.

The researchers developed a computational model to assess factors such as how cautious participants were about deciding which number was larger, on both easy and hard problems, and how readily participants detected their own mistakes and slowed down or changed strategies for the next problem after making an error. (Participants were not told if they had made a mistake.)

On problems with numeric symbols, children with typical math abilities slowed down more for harder comparisons than easy ones, while children with math learning disability didn't modify their strategy as much. Those with math learning disability were also less likely to slow down or change their behavior after they made an error than children with typical math ability.

However, for problems presented as groups of dots, children with math learning disability were actually more cautious after making an error.

""Many of these kids - unless their disability is severe - have normal representation of non-symbolic quantities, so they can tell five from 10 dots quite easily, but when you ask them to reason with and manipulate number symbols, they become deficient,"" Menon said.

Brain scans revealed patterns that lined up with these behaviors. While doing problems with number symbols, children with math learning disability had less neural activity in the middle frontal gyrus, which has roles in executive function and in sustaining and directing attention, and in the anterior cingulate cortex, which detects errors and helps with decision making and impulse control.

""Seeing weaker function in kids with math learning disability in those brain regions - which are known to be involved in executive function and error monitoring - suggests that they may be using those brain resources less than is necessary to solve these problems efficiently,"" Chang said.

The findings could help educators craft ways to help struggling students become better at math as well as other types of problem-solving.

""One of our surprising findings is that even in the absence of an overt difference in the kids' behavior, we could pick up strong signals about what their brains are doing behind the scenes,"" Menon said. ""It gives us insight that how we reason - how we think about problems and adjust our problem-solving behavior - is just as important as having a core domain of knowledge.""

The research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (HD094623, HD059205 and MH084164), the National Science Foundation (DRL-2024856), and the Stanford Maternal and Child Health Research Institute Postdoctoral Support Awards.

Today's newsletter is like a Mad Libs of celebrity and sporting perfection. In today's Full Time:

🎙️ Pop superstar watching Spurs
🏀 NBA champ investing in Chelsea
⚽ The darker side of the game

But first, let's start with the soccer player going for gold in cross-country skiing …

Stanford soccer player chasing gold

Olympic skier Sammy Smith's major is listed as undecided on the Stanford women's soccer page, but her approach to life is more about a refusal to settle than indecisiveness.

Later this week, the 20-year-old will compete as part of the U.S. cross-country ski team at the Winter Olympics. Two months ago, the sophomore was playing alongside her Cardinal teammates for an NCAA championship.

Smith's path to Italy zig-zagged Europe on the World Cup circuit and paused mid-ski season to make time for NCAA soccer at one of the top programs in the country. In fact, the summer after her freshman year, she:

After returning to Stanford in July for preseason, Smith made 14 starts in 25 matches, including the postseason, where the Cardinal lost 1-0 to Florida State in the championship. Two days later, in pure Hannah Montana fashion, she was back in Alaska, preparing and placing second in a U.S. SuperTour race.

The juggle between sports meant Smith had only one shot at qualifying for the Games. On Jan. 17, barely a month into the ski season and only a month after that NCAA final, Smith put together a career-best performance to secure her spot on Team USA at the World Cup in Oberhof, Germany.

Her drive comes from within, but it helps that Smith was encouraged to try out for just about every sport alongside her two siblings growing up. In addition to soccer and cross-country skiing, she also tried freestyle skiing, track, lacrosse, hockey and tackle football (Smith was a running back).

“Honestly, I took a liking to everything,” Smith said. “There'd be years where I was doing upwards of 10 or 11 sports a year.”

Again: For Smith, it's not that she can't decide — it's that she'd rather challenge herself and others to push limits.

Pop icon supporting English youth soccer

Madonna (yes, the seven-time Grammy winner) spent the weekend pitchside at two Tottenham Hotspur games.

On a gray and chilly London day, she cheered on her twin daughters, Stella and Estere, as they played a match for Spurs' under-14 academy team. The following day, she put on her classic bug-eye sunglasses and watched Tottenham struggle against a wounded Chelsea squad.

The Queen of Pop has a history of soccer fandom: In 2017, Madonna reportedly moved to Lisbon, Portugal, after her 11-year-old son, David Banda, joined Benfica's youth academy. She also has a well-documented affiliation with Spurs' foe, Chelsea, dating back to her marriage to Guy Ritchie, a well-known Chelsea fan, between 2000 and 2008. Additionally, Madonna is closely tied to Chelsea board member Barbara Charone, a UK-based American public relations veteran.

Now, it's Madonna's 13-year-old twins who have led her back pitchside as Spurs' women's academy — open to players aged 12-18 — is an area of increasing focus for general manager Andy Rogers and the club's hierarchy.

Continuing with the crossovers, on to someone familiar with them on the court …

NBA champ investing in Chelsea

Professional basketballers investing in soccer has become commonplace, especially in women's soccer. Angel Reese has a stake in the DC Power of the Gainbridge Super League, James Harden invested in Houston Dash (and Dynamo) and Caitlin Clark was part of an investment group trying to bring soccer to Cincinnati.

In England, Lebron James is part of Liverpool's ownership, and now Giannis Antetokounmpo is joining the Chelsea Women ownership group (after recently going through some transfer drama of his own.)

The Milwaukee Bucks forward is partnering with Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, who last year paid around $27.2 million to purchase a stake of approximately 10 percent in the reigning Women's Super League champions. The women's team's ownership structure broke off from the men's side two years ago — exactly how the split works is still unclear.

Online abuse with real-world danger

Women's soccer is a community sport. Access to players is a staple. I've sat through enough postgame interviews to know just how long players spend going around to every fan to take a picture, sign an autograph or just greet people.

Unfortunately, the access comes with risks. And as Charlotte Harpur reported last week, those dangers are becoming more and more frequent, including threats like “I know where you park your car.”

Liverpool midfielder Marie Hobinger's victim statement was a particularly poignant way to start the article: “It makes me sad that women's football is sexualised and disrespected. No woman, no matter her job, should have to put up with this type of behaviour.”

The 24-year-old gave her statement during the sentencing of 42-year-old Mangal Dalal, who contacted Hobinger via social media before waiting for her at the side of the pitch. He was handed a two-year restraining order and sentenced to 18 months of community service in January after pleading guilty to stalking.

Death threats, online harassment and racial abuse have all been on the rise. In some cases, players are retreating; in others, teams are changing protocol. Chelsea Women, for example, no longer allow postgame autographs in “uncontrolled ways.”

And today, we reported that Women's Super League Football, the organization that oversees the top two tiers of women's football in England, is monitoring developments with X's artificial intelligence tool Grok due to concerns regarding its creation of sexualised images.

Though accessibility is part of what makes women's soccer special, it should not come at the expense of anyone's safety.

A pair of firsts

In honor of Black History Month, we are testing your knowledge of some iconic women who've made a mark on the sport. Last week, we asked: Who was the first Black woman to play for the U.S. women's national team?

OK, we started with a bit of a tricky one. Let me explain:

In 1986, 20-year-old Kim Crabbe became the first Black woman called into a USWNT camp. The striker (pictured above) was born in Virginia and played for George Mason University, winning the 1985 NCAA championship. Her team defeated the University of North Carolina 2-0. The Tar Heels' head coach, Anson Dorrance, who had recently taken charge of the U.S. women's team, called in Crabbe months after the victory.

“It's crucial to be able to see people who look like you in the media and out there making a difference and creating change and being influential,” Crabbe told U.S. Soccer's in-house media outlet in 2018, six years before the front three of Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson and Trinity Rodman led the team to gold at the Olympics.

“We've made great strides since I played in 1986. The sport has evolved in a positive direction and I'm very proud to have served as a pioneer within this beautiful game,” she said.

However, Crabbe wasn't the first Black woman to play minutes in an official match for the U.S. Instead, 24-year-old defender Sandi Gordon earned those honors on July 9, 1987, in a 2-1 loss to Sweden.

“I have always been proud of who I am, but at the time I never thought of myself as being anything other than a player representing my country,” Gordon said.

This week's question: Who holds the record for most NWSL goals across all competitions?

Full Time First Looks

Staying on: Shortly after losing their first back-to-back WSL games since 2015, Chelsea announced a contract extension for Sonia Bompastor, backing the French coach through 2030. With the title slipping away, it'll be interesting to see if a rare vote of confidence steadies the ship, especially after today's news that the team parted ways with head of women's football Paul Green.

Switching things up: A role change sparked something new in 21-year-old Olivia Smith. The Canadian striker scored Arsenal's winning goal yesterday against league leaders Manchester City.

Getting into the Games: One of the best parts about the Olympics is sitting in my armchair and becoming an expert on all things snow. Today's fun fact: Claudia Riegler is the oldest female Winter Olympian at 52, setting her own limits in the snowboard parallel giant slalom.

Fresh pet food brand collaborates with former U.S. Women's National Team athletes Christen Press and Tobin Heath.

Maev has launched The Home Team campaign featuring retired soccer players Christen Press and Tobin Heath in their first major brand partnership since leaving the U.S. Women's National Team. The campaign focuses on the athletes' roles as dog owners rather than their sports careers.

""Through change, pressure, and reinvention, dogs are the constant that keep us grounded,"" according to the campaign messaging, which highlights the routine and emotional stability dogs provide.

The partnership includes a Bob's Boost Bundle product offering on Maev's website, named after Press and Heath's dog. The campaign also features integrations on The RE-CAP Show podcast hosted by the duo and creator mailers.

Maev noted the collaboration represents a shift in athlete partnerships toward relationships centered on personal identity and lifestyle beyond professional sports competition.

According to Petfood Industry, Maev is the first and only human-grade raw food for dogs. Founded in 2019 by Katie Spies, an MIT engineer and dog parent, the brand's mission is to formulate easy-to-feed, efficacious daily nutrition. With the help of PhD veterinary nutritionists, Spies formulated Raw Food, Supplement Bars, Bone Broth Topper and Freeze-Dried Treats made with whole foods and super nutrients to elevate the daily rituals of dog care and fill every bowl with maximum nutrition.","{'href': 'https://www.petfoodindustry.com', 'title': 'PetfoodIndustry'}","soccer"

Weston McKennie does it again! Alex Freeman debuts and Tyler Adams returns. Yet, Pulisic, Reyna, and Antonee Robinson fall back.

Published

By

Weston McKennie nodded home an impressive header in Juventus' draw with Lazio and wing back Alex Freeman made his Villarreal debut. Yet, the biggest news may be the return of U.S. Men's National Team stalwart Tyler Adams. Adams is back in training with Bournemouth and will hopefully see the pitch soon. Fourteen of the top candidates for the U.S. Men's National Team roster for the 2026 FIFA World Cup this summer started for their clubs across and Europe with two others seeing time.

Not so good news came in both Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna being held out through injury and Antonee “Jedi” Robinson not seeing a minute for Fulham.

The first match of the FIFA World Cup on June 12 is approaching somewhat rapidly for the U.S. Men's National Team. A strong showing as one of the three host countries with Mexico and Canada is a must. Anything else is unacceptable. Coach Mauricio Pochettino will be faced with whittling the roster down to 23-26 players for the three group stage matches… and beyond. Maybe, just maybe, the USMNT will end up in Kansas City for a quarterfinal.

Thus, we will be following the top players (at the moment) who are the strongest candidates for the final roster per the latest callups and history. Who fits the 3-4-2-1 formation Pochettino seems to now favor? How much playing time is each seeing? Are they being productive? Will a strong show of form mean a surprise addition, and subsequent subtraction, from the roster?

Consider this weekly column your reference, understanding that Major League Soccer clubs are in preseason and those players are not detailed for now.

As Liam Rosenior settles into his new role as the Chelsea coach, putting his own stamp on the team he inherited will be a long-term project rather than a short-term one. His challenges are similar to those many midseason hires have faced before him, though there is one unique element he is still battling -- the lingering impact of the Blues' Club World Cup-winning run last summer.

While the weight of expectations loom large after winning the FIFA prize and the UEFA Conference League last season with then-coach Enzo Maresca, a more immediate issue is the physical load the Club World Cup took on Chelsea's squad. The Blues' schedule has been jam-packed since the start of the 2024-25 campaign with few breaks in between – they won the Conference League in Poland on May 28 and then opened their Club World Cup campaign in Atlanta on June 16, played seven games as they won the title on July 13 in the New York City suburbs and were back in London on August 17 to start a new season. Though their successful trip to the U.S. took place six months before Rosenior took charge at Chelsea, he admitted that the tournament's impact is still being felt.

""You have to try to freshen up the team mentally and physically,"" he said on Monday ahead of their match against Leeds United, detailing further that he has to be mindful about rotating through his squad as a result. It is something Rosenior has mentioned on a handful of occasions in the early weeks of his Chelsea tenure, most notably in the Blues' 1-0 defeat at Arsenal in the second leg of the EFL Cup semifinals last week. Cole Palmer was named amongst the substitutes that day in an attempt to manage the player's minutes during an injury-plagued season, especially as the team's priority switches to finishing in a UEFA Champions League berth.

Chelsea are trending in the right direction as it pertains to a return to the Champions League next season, in large part because England are expected to pick up a bonus spot thanks to their UEFA coefficient ranking. The Blues sit fairly comfortably in fifth place with a four point cushion over sixth place Liverpool, while Rosenior has the benefit of a squad that is near full fitness for their clash against Leeds, who will be eager to pick up a favorable result in the hopes of widening their six point gap from the relegation zone. Reece James, who missed Saturday's win against Wolverhampton Wanderers with a small fitness issue, might miss Tuesday's match through illness while Chelsea's other mainstays are available.

Rosenior's Chelsea have improved their goalscoring form since the coaching change, averaging 2.4 goals from 2.1 expected goals per game across all competitions, up from their tally of 1.9 goals from 1.8 expected goals per game under Maresca. He admits they are still a work in progress, though, and that they even had room for improvement as they cruised to a 3-0 advantage at Wolves before the halftime break.

""When you're the level of player I get to work with here, the reason they are top and elite is because they make great decisions in the moment,"" Rosenior said. ""Being fluid has positives in terms of being unpredictable. But if you do not have the right structure behind that you can become really open in transition. It's trying to find a balance. I felt against Wolves there were some really pleasing aspects in our rotations. In the second half we didn't stay true to our structure. That's one of the reasons why our performance wasn't as good in the second half.""

It is not the only mark Rosenior wants to leave on the team.

""My aim is we play a really high level in every minute of every game,"" he said. ""We've had a few conversations about that in recent days.""

A high-intensity approach is almost in conflict with Chelsea's fixture congestion realities, finding the sweet spot admittedly serving as Rosenior's most notable challenge as he looks to make the Blues his own. He believes, though, that players are getting used to the demands of a very intense workload.

""If I'm being honest, these lads are fantastic professionals - they live for their job which is so important,"" Rosenior said. ""You want the best product possible. We have to find a way where we can find the right balance between the two.""

Arne Slot has admitted that missing out on Champions League qualification would have a big impact on Liverpool's summer transfer budget.

The Dutch head coach says his side need to be “close to perfection” for the rest of the season if they are going to retain their status among Europe's elite and make this season “acceptable”.

Liverpool find themselves sixth in the Premier League, five points behind fourth placed Manchester United and four adrift of fifth placed Chelsea, ahead of Wednesday's trip to Sunderland.

With fifth spot set to be good enough to secure Champions League football, Slot's side must either climb the table or win the club's seventh European crown to salvage a troubled campaign.

“Acceptable? Yes. If we don't have Champions League football, it's definitely not been an acceptable season,” Slot said.

“We need to be close to perfection because of the points we are behind. To close a gap of four or five points, you need to win a lot. Margins are indeed very small.

“With seven minutes to go on Sunday, it looked like we would only be five points behind (Manchester) City. By the end we were 11 points behind them.”

Asked what failing to qualify for the Champions League would mean for the summer given the club's self-sustaining business model, he added: “When I arrived here and we could only sign Federico Chiesa, it was after a Europa League season.

“That does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run. That is clear. I am completely aware of that.”

Slot has a selection headache at right-back. Midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai has filled in there for the past two matches but he serves a one-match ban following his late dismissal in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday.

Conor Bradley and Jeremie Frimpong remain sidelined, with Joe Gomez close to a comeback following a hip problem.

“Joe hasn't trained with us yet but I'm expecting him to train with us for the first time today,” Slot said.

“If Joe is not ready to start then we will be missing four players who have played in that position. Curtis (Jones) and Wataru (Endo) have played in that position this season too so we have had six different right full-backs.”

Slot has been reluctant to turn to specialist right-back Calvin Ramsay, who has been an unused substitute on 12 occasions since playing against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October.

“If you don't win a game, the players who are not playing become the best players in the squad,” he said.

“That is, I think, everywhere in the world the same. The players who are starting but not winning, the manager could have always chosen a better one. This is an example as well. I just want to protect all of my players. I have chosen other players until now and that's also what I'm going to do tomorrow.”

                            Everton star undergoes foot surgery, receives support from teammates as club weighs permanent transfer decision and England dreams fade                        


                        6 min read
                    

Jack Grealish's season has come to a sudden and heartbreaking halt, as the Everton midfielder confirmed he has undergone surgery for a stress fracture in his foot, ruling him out for the remainder of the campaign and ending any lingering hopes of a World Cup call-up. The 30-year-old, who joined the Toffees on loan from Manchester City last summer, made the announcement from his hospital bed, sharing both his disappointment and his determination to return stronger than ever.

Grealish's injury saga began on January 18, 2026, during a hard-fought 1-0 victory over his former club, Aston Villa. What was initially thought to be a calf problem quickly escalated after further medical checks revealed a far more serious stress fracture in his left foot. The diagnosis was a bitter pill for both Grealish and Everton to swallow, especially given the player's growing influence on Merseyside.



In his 22 appearances across all competitions for Everton this season, Grealish contributed two goals and six assists, quickly cementing himself as a fan favorite and a key piece in David Moyes' plans. His creative spark and relentless work ethic had supporters dreaming of a strong finish to the campaign and perhaps even a permanent transfer come summer. But football, as Grealish himself lamented, can be cruel.

“Didn't want the season to end like this, but that's football, gutted,” Grealish wrote in a heartfelt Instagram post from his hospital bed. “Surgery done and now all focus on getting back fit. I know for sure I will come back fitter, stronger and better than before. The support I've had since coming to this unbelievable club has meant the world to me. The staff, my teammates and especially the fans have been incredible and I absolutely love representing this club. I'll be backing the lads all the way and doing everything I can to get back as soon as possible. Thank you again for all the love, it means so much. UTFT.”

His message quickly drew a flood of support from across the football world. Manchester City striker Erling Haaland offered his encouragement, while fellow England internationals Declan Rice, Jordan Henderson, Morgan Rogers, Harry Maguire, and Everton teammate Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall all sent messages wishing Grealish a speedy recovery. Even players from rival clubs, such as Arsenal's Piero Hincapie, Burnley's Kyle Walker, Liverpool's Curtis Jones, Tottenham's James Maddison, and Brentford's Jordan Henderson, joined in to show solidarity with the sidelined star.

The timing of the injury couldn't have been worse for Grealish. After falling out of favor at Manchester City last season—making just seven league starts and missing out on the Club World Cup squad—his loan move to Everton had revived his form and, with it, his hopes of returning to the England fold. Interim national team manager Lee Carsley handed Grealish his most recent cap in October 2024, and England boss Thomas Tuchel had publicly insisted “the door remained open” for the winger after his strong start to life at Goodison Park. But with the World Cup looming this summer, Grealish's setback has definitively dashed his dreams of representing the Three Lions on the global stage.



David Moyes, Everton's manager, was quick to underline just how much of a blow the loss of Grealish represents. “It's a big blow because he's been hugely important to us since the start of the season, he's played a big part in the team,” Moyes told reporters. “Look, we've had a few injuries, but this is a big blow to us. We're in close contact with Manchester City, so we'll see how that works as we go along, and as we get more decisions from the specialists.”

Moyes also revealed that Grealish's injury was only discovered while the club's medical staff were treating what they believed was a routine calf knock. “He didn't come in [complaining] about his foot. He had a kick on the calf and we thought he'd be OK. That it was just a kick on the back of the calf and he would be OK in a couple of days but they checked his foot out and he has a stress fracture. It's a real pity for the boy. He's been back at it, enjoying it and doing what he is good at. He has been supported brilliantly by the supporters at Everton. They think so much of him and it's just disappointing he is going to have some time off.”

Everton, for their part, moved quickly to address the void left by Grealish, signing Chelsea winger Tyrique George on loan until the end of the season. The Toffees also retain a £50 million option to buy Grealish permanently this summer, but uncertainty now hangs over whether they will exercise that clause, given the player's injury and the unpredictable nature of his recovery. Moyes has already cautioned it is “far too early” to make any decisions on Grealish's future.

Meanwhile, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola commented earlier in the season on Grealish's situation, saying: “I think he has a contract for one more year with us. The important thing is he is back. He is a massive influence in the Everton games. After what's happened, maybe Manchester City want him back, but I don't know. Many things are still going to happen. We'll see. The important thing is he is playing again, a lot of minutes. This is the standard. I'm happy, really, honestly, that he's back in, trying his best.”



Grealish's future is now clouded by several factors: his rehabilitation, Everton's willingness to invest in a permanent deal, and City's plans for their squad, with speculation swirling that Pep Guardiola himself may be set for a summer departure. Still, Grealish's impact at Everton has been undeniable, and his popularity among fans and teammates alike remains strong, despite the cruel twist of fate.

For now, Grealish will focus on his recovery, aiming to return to the pitch fitter and stronger, just as he promised. Everton, meanwhile, must regroup and push forward in his absence, hoping that the playmaker's road to recovery is as swift and successful as his recent resurgence in blue. The coming months promise plenty of intrigue both on and off the pitch, as the Toffees and Grealish alike face decisions that could shape their futures for seasons to come.","{'href': 'https://evrimagaci.org', 'title': 'Evrim Ağacı'}","soccer"

Not many people would guess that Croatia is part of one of the most viewed YouTube live streams ever. 

The dramatic 2022 FIFA World Cup quarter-final between Brazil and Croatia is second on the list of the most-watched live streams in YouTube history. 

On 9 December 2022 in Qatar, Croatia took on football powerhouse Brazil in a thrilling World Cup quarter-final. Croatia came back from a goal down in extra time to eventually win 4-2 on penalties. 

Record-Breaking YouTube Viewership

The match drew extraordinary online attention through a live stream on the Brazilian YouTube channel CazéTV, run by popular streamer Casimiro, which is the most popular source to watch games online in South America.

The stream peaked at approximately 6.1 to 6.15 million concurrent viewers, with some reports citing even higher figures. 

It accumulated over 17 million hours watched in under five hours of broadcast.

This performance placed the Brazil vs Croatia live stream second on YouTube's most-viewed live events ever.

by

A pack of robot dogs will help Mexican police tackle crime during the 2026 World Cup this summer, authorities said Monday.

The four-legged robots are designed to enter dangerous areas and broadcast live video back to security forces, who can watch before taking action during the football tournament.

The global spectacle, which will take place from June 11 to July 19, is being hosted by Mexico alongside the United States and Canada.

The animaloid robots were acquired for 2.5 million pesos ($145,000) by the city council of Guadalupe, part of the Monterrey metro area, which will host one of the World Cup venues.

A video released by the local government shows one of the robots walking on four legs through an abandoned building and climbing stairs, though with some difficulty.

The robo-hound can be seen transmitting live images to a group of police officers walking stealthily behind it.

In the demonstration the canine robot encounters an armed man and orders him to drop his gun using a loudspeaker.

The purpose of the robot dogs is “to support police officers with initial intervention… to protect the physical safety of officers,” said Guadalupe mayor Hector Garcia.

They will be deployed “in case of any altercation,” he added.

BBVA Stadium, which will be known as Estadio Monterrey during the tournament, will host four matches.

World Cup

MetLife Stadium in New Jersey will host a number of 2026 World Cup matches, including the final Robbie Jay Barratt / AMA / Getty Images

FIFA has completed its third and final lottery for 2026 World Cup tickets and, as of Monday, is in the process of communicating results to fans who entered.

All successful applicants have been notified via email, a FIFA spokesman told The Athletic. Their credit cards are being charged, and their tickets appear in their FIFA accounts.

Advertisement

Millions of other fans, meanwhile, were not chosen in the so-called “Random Selection Draw.” They have either received an email — “Unfortunately, your application was not successful, and no tickets have been allocated for purchase,” the email reads — or will be receiving it soon.

They, the unlucky ones, are now left to hold out hope for FIFA's murky “Last-Minute Sales Phase” or venture to resale sites, which will soon become the primary avenue to the 2026 World Cup's most coveted tickets.

The following is a guide to World Cup ticket sales as the latest lottery phase concludes.

Almost.

The “selection” part has happened. Some fans who were selected are still in the process of paying for the tickets they were allocated. And some supporters of specific teams are still awaiting word from their national federations, such as the U.S. Soccer Federation, which partnered with FIFA to distribute allotted “supporters tickets.” As of Monday, members of U.S. supporters groups had not received any communication from U.S. Soccer about the results of their distinct lottery.

All fans who applied for standard tickets via FIFA, however, have been notified if they were successful — or “partially successful,” meaning they received some but not all of the tickets they requested. The rest missed out.

FIFA has said all along that there will be a fourth and final sales phase in the spring, “beginning in early April.”

It will be a “first come, first served” process, whereby fans can go to FIFA's website and directly purchase tickets, rather than entering a lottery. The big unknown is how many tickets — and, more importantly, what tickets — will be available.

FIFA spokespeople, when asked, have not said whether tickets to all 104 matches will be offered in the Last-Minute Sales Phase. It's unclear whether any tickets have been withheld for this phase.

Advertisement

If none were withheld, it seems likely that most or all tickets for in-demand games — the ones involving popular teams or in the tournament's latter stages — have now been sold. The last-minute phase, therefore, might only feature tickets that FIFA was unable to sell in the recent Random Selection Draw.

Not necessarily. FIFA's claim that it received more than 500 million ticket requests came with caveats, namely:

More information about the April phase is expected over the coming weeks.

If you want tickets to, say, an Argentina game or the World Cup final, resale sites are probably your best bet — and potentially your only remaining option.

FIFA has an official resale platform, though it has frustrated some fans, and will be closing from Feb. 22 through April 2.

Third-party resale sites such as StubHub and SeatGeek, on the other hand, will remain open. They cannot fully guarantee that purchased tickets will be delivered, because they don't require sellers to show proof of the tickets they list. But they're easier to navigate, and are customary and perfectly legal in the U.S. and Canada. (They impose heavy penalties on sellers who don't deliver tickets to buyers, so the vast majority of buyers get what they paid for.)

Elsewhere, there are a smattering of ticket promotions exclusive to holders of certain credit cards, though inventory seems to be limited and prices are far higher than FIFA's.

FIFA, meanwhile, continues to advertise hospitality packages, which include match tickets and cost thousands of dollars.

Resale prices, for most or all World Cup games, have always been higher than FIFA's prices. After December's World Cup draw and schedule release, prices spiked for the most compelling matchups, and rose for a majority of matches, but fell for a handful of the least attractive games.

Advertisement

Resale prices, of course, constantly fluctuate as fans list and buy tickets. They settled in January, with the lowest price for any match hovering around $200 and the more coveted tickets costing thousands of dollars. But as millions more tickets get distributed this month, and as millions of fans learn that their Random Selection Draw applications were unsuccessful, industry insiders expect some movement. The more dramatic spikes and dips, however, could happen in May and June, as the tournament's June 11 kickoff nears.

As for FIFA's prices, those likely won't be known until April. They rose from October to November, and again in December; they could rise again or fall in the Last-Minute Sales Phase. FIFA is using a “variable pricing” strategy, meaning it adjusts the costs of tickets based on expected or actual demand.

Then you can sell the tickets, either on FIFA's resale platform (though it will go dark from Feb. 22-April 2) or an unaffiliated resale site.

Either FIFA or the unaffiliated site will take a cut of your sale, but in many cases, you'll be able to make your money back. (And in some cases, you'll be able to make a profit.)

Endrick has scored five goals in seven games for Lyon, but was sent off at Nantes on Saturday

Even those who do not follow French football in its most granular detail will be aware of the plight that could have befallen Lyon this summer.

Spared from administrative relegation to Ligue 2 just five and a half weeks before the start of the season, the club's future in the French top flight hinged on their capacity to fulfil financial promises.

A firesale of the side's most valuable assets duly ensued, and with it, expectations of a third successive season of European football dwindled.

Constrained by their financial frailties, Les Gones, spearheaded by sporting director Matthieu Louis-Jean, had to work diligently, embarking on an agile recruitment drive.

Spotting talent from lesser-known European leagues became a central tenet of their philosophy.

""We worked on different markets,"" outlined the former Nottingham Forest right-back in September.

Amid a flurry of moves, Pavel Sulc and Ruben Kluivert arrived on permanent deals from Viktoria Plzen and Casa Pia respectively, while Adam Karabec joined from Sparta Prague on loan.

Louis-Jean has cultivated a burgeoning reputation as a strategic operator, but his most innovative market manoeuvre would have to wait until the winter window.

Having deviated from their reactive tendencies of the past, Lyon were left without a central striker of note, preferring to secure the temporary services of Martin Satriano on loan.

""We took a decision on the final day of the transfer window to leave the position of a first-choice striker open,"" said general director Michael Gerlinger.

Louis-Jean, and Lyon's wider recruitment department, were convinced an opportunity would present itself in January. Their intuition soon morphed into prophecy.

Having amassed just 99 minutes of action for Real Madrid during the first half of the season, Brazil striker Endrick needed an escape. Lyon were more than happy to provide sanctuary for a player and talisman they desperately craved.

""We had been waiting for a number nine for so long,"" said Louis-Jean upon the 19-year-old's unveiling after joining on loan until the end of the season.

Endrick's unveiling video is the most watched of all time on Lyon's Instagram account

At a club where strikers are held in such reverence, his impact has been almost divine.

He scored 42 minutes into his debut against Lille in the last 32 of the French Cup. Another four goals have followed in five games.

Three of those came against Metz, making him the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick for Lyon, surpassing the great Bernard Lacombe, who had held the record for 54 years.

Before Saturday's match with Nantes, no Lyon player had been directly involved in more goals (six), had more shots on target (14), or completed more dribbles (19) than the Brazilian since his arrival.

Endrick's signing perpetuates a long-held legacy of Brazilians representing the club.

Juninho Pernambucano, Cris and Sonny Anderson are just a few to have spent significant portions of their careers with Lyon, each contributing to the club's unprecedented run of seven successive Ligue 1 crowns between 2002 and 2008.

""I know there are a lot [of Brazilians] that have played for the club, and many of them have had a fantastic career here,"" said Endrick during his first interview with French newspaper L'Equipe.

Lucas Paqueta and Bruno Guimaraes, Brazil team-mates of Endrick, provided counsel prior to his move.

""Before coming, I spoke with Paqueta and Bruno,"" he said. ""They told me it was a place I could be really happy.""

Personal fulfillment, and a chance ""to play football"" with this summer's World Cup looming, he says were driving factors in his decision to join.

""Obviously it's a dream I have - that won't change. If you don't play well for your club, however, you can't have a chance of playing for Brazil,"" he added.

If strikers are revered in Lyon, they are held in almost sacred status in Brazil.

""We don't have that mobile number nine in the Brazil side,"" says former Lyon captain Cris.

""We have Gabriel Jesus, Richarlison, but there's a space there for him to help the side with his mobility and the way he sees the game.""

Ultimately, Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will be the man who decides if Endrick makes the plane.

""We had a wonderful conversation,"" said Endrick when asked about whether the Italian had been in contact before his move.

""He gave me some advice that has stayed with me,"" he added. ""Now, I have to work in order to improve and become a better player.""

Lyon, and Ligue 1, provide the perfect platform for him to do just that.

""He's very explosive, very quick, very good in one-on-one situations,"" enthused Lyon manager Paulo Fonseca after his debut against Lille.

His contentious sending-off for two yellow cards against Nantes on Saturday, however, following a petulant kick out after some robust challenges against him, provides a timely reminder of the adjustments Endrick needs to make.

""When there are players of that calibre, we have to make sure to contain them,"" said Nantes manager Ahmed Kantari in the aftermath.

Herein lies the challenge Endrick will have to confront - at Madrid he was part of a constellation of stars, while here he assumes that mantle almost uniquely.

Endrick is the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick for Lyon

That influence transcends the pitch, too - his signing representing a commercial coup as well as a sporting one.

""It's obvious his notoriety will boost the club's image,"" Gerlinger said during the Brazilian's presentation.

The results have been tangible. His arrival video, published on the club's official Instagram account, is the club's most-watched on the platform, while highlights of games against Metz, Lille, Brest and Stade Laval - in which Endrick featured - top their YouTube charts.

Lyon will hope his impending one-game suspension does not stymie his, or their, seamless progress of late.

Prior to Endrick's arrival, Fonseca's side had recorded a run of four wins in all competitions - subsequently extended to 12.

Having crafted a favourable route to the Europa League final courtesy of their top-place finish during the league phase, a spot in the quarter-finals of the French Cup secured, and firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification, Endrick's hopes of ""making history"" at the club - like so many compatriots before him - may just come true.

Craig Goodwin's FIFA World Cup hopes are in tatters with the Socceroos veteran set to be sidelined for up to three months with a groin injury.

The 34-year-old was forced from the field just 25 minutes into Adelaide United's dramatic 3-2 loss to A-League Men leaders the Newcastle Jets at Coopers Stadium on Sunday evening.

""Following further assessment, the club can confirm he will not require surgery and is expected to be sidelined for approximately 10-12 weeks as he completes his rehabilitation,"" Adelaide said in a statement.

That sidelines Goodwin until at least late April, ruling him out of Australia's send-off games against Cameroon in Sydney on March 27 and Curacao in Melbourne four days later.

- A-League stocks: Brisbane's siege mentality in danger of turning sour
- Socceroos Depth Chart: Australia's likely World Cup squad, four months out
- 'Future Socceroo' Rhys Bozinovski joins Heracles Almelo from Perth Glory

Those games are the final friendlies before coach Tony Popovic steps up preparations for June's tournament, meaning Goodwin misses that crucial audition. The set-piece weapon was a stalwart under Graham Arnold and a key to Australia's terrific run at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

But he has fallen out of favour under Popovic. Nestory Irankunda and Riley McGree have been preferred options on the left, while Nishan Velupillay and Martin Boyle are also in the mix.

McGree, meanwhile, looms as one of the keys to Australia's World Cup fortunes after leading Middlesbrough to top of the Championship and one step closer to a Premier League return.

The 27-year-old was man-of-the-match after notching a goal and an assist in Monday's 2-1 away win over Sheffield United that sent the club to the top of England's second tier. The two leaders in the Championship, currently Middlesbrough (61 points) and Coventry City (59), receive automatic promotion to the Premier League -- although there are still 15 games left.

McGree, who typically plays as an inverted left winger for the Socceroos, is clearly one of Australia's most dangerous and creative weapons when fit. The South Australian had been in excellent form before a December hamstring injury ruled him out for close to a month, and he has not missed a beat since returning.

McGree's match-winning performance followed an assist for the winner against Norwich City in Boro's previous game.

On Monday, Boro took the lead in the 19th minute when McGree set up Tommy Conway for the opener. The Australian doubled the advantage when Hayden Hackney's shot clattered off the post and McGree was quickest to react, heading the ball into a empty net.

""Probably positions I don't find myself [in] as much as I'd like to -- following in shots and getting easier goals,"" McGree told Middlesbrough's club media.

""So it was good to get one today -- with my head as well.

""Six in a row -- it's not easy to do but in this league especially. So really proud of everyone.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Making a hit World Cup song is a creative hat trick: a score for the artist, FIFA and a global audience.

Shakira was spending the holidays at her farm in Uruguay, across a vast ocean from South Africa, host country of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, when she conceived “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa).” Already a global phenom known for her vocals and dance moves, the Colombian star had quickly gone to work when presented with the opportunity to write a song for the upcoming soccer tournament, and she soon turned a track around that fused genres, languages and multinational beats with abandon.

	“It was sort of magical the way it happened, because I was just walking from the barn into the house, and I started singing the melody of the verse, with the lyrics, automatically, in English,” Shakira says. “It was like someone was dictating it from above. And I felt so connected to my childhood, to my roots, to my Afro Caribbean roots as well … I was so excited, I called the people at Sony and told them I had just written the most amazing World Cup song.”




	“Waka Waka,” produced by Shakira with John Hill, was already catchy — but it became even more so after a fortuitous encounter in a New York studio between Hill and South African pop fusion group Freshly-ground, which then contributed to the song, adding a musical element that honored the host nation.


	“Shakira moved swiftly from interest to creation, writing and recording a track that stood apart from the musical landscape at the time,” recalls Dusko Justic, senior vp of international artist strategy and development for Sony Latin Iberia, who at the time was responsible for the A&R and marketing for the official FIFA World Cup music program. “Once FIFA heard the finished record, there was no debate.”


	For nearly four decades, FIFA has partnered with prominent musicians to craft songs that celebrate the World Cup and its competing nations. “Waka Waka,” the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, remains the most successful World Cup song in history and a global juggernaut; its video has been viewed a staggering 4.4 billion times on YouTube, making it the platform's eighth most viewed music video of all time. A decade after its release, Shakira would perform the enduring hit at another globally watched sporting event: the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, where it ended her co-headlining set with Jennifer Lopez.


	“Waka Waka” had all the elements that make for a successful and enduring World Cup song: a danceable, uptempo beat to resonate with audiences around the world (the song samples “Zamina Mina [Zangaléwa],” by Cameroonian band Golden Sounds), an artist with global appeal and reach, and a featured artist representing the host nation. Shakira also recorded the song in Spanish, which drew in her Latin fan base. And significantly, she was already a genuine soccer aficionado; the song's music video not only incorporated her signature dance moves but also major soccer stars from Lionel Messi to Gerard Piqué, who became Shakira's longtime partner and the father of her two sons after meeting her at the video shoot.

	











	World Cup songs are not always such massive hits — nor were they always officially sanctioned by FIFA. The first World Cup was played in 1930, but the event wouldn't designate a song as “official” until the 1962 event in Chile when Chilean band Los Ramblers' “El Rock del Mundial” was declared the tournament's official song.


	It's unclear when FIFA became actively involved in the song's selection (the organization did not respond to Billboard's requests for comment), though multiple reports cite Italian composer Giorgio Moroder's “To Be Number One,” recorded for the 1990 World Cup in Italy.


	Since then, every tournament has had an official song, anthem or — for the past several World Cups — both. (The exact distinction between these designations has shifted over the years.) Some of them have been performed at the closing ceremony (as was the case with “Live It Up,” performed by Nicky Jam, Will Smith and Era Istrefi in 2018) and some at the opening ceremony (like 2014's “We Are One [Ole Ola],” performed in Brazil by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Brazilian artist Claudia Leitte).


	But record labels didn't -fully appreciate the possibilities of official songs until the 1998 tournament in France when, in addition to the official anthem (Youssou N'Dour and Axelle Red's “La Cour des Grands [Do You Mind If I Play]”), Ricky Martin released the official song, “The Cup of Life.” With both English and Spanish (“La Copa de la Vida”) versions and its French rallying cry of “allez, allez, allez,” the track made the World Cup “the most influential and pivotal platform in the transition of helping to create the Latin explosion,” says Tommy Mottola, who was then Sony Music chairman.

	











	“The Cup of Life,” with its mix of brash trumpets and Brazilian batucada, was a global hit, peaking at No. 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spending 34 weeks on the chart, long after the monthlong tournament had ended. It was so successful, in fact, that when Martin earned a 1999 Grammy nomination for best Latin pop performance for his Spanish-language album Vuelve (which included “The Cup of Life”), Mottola pushed hard to have him on the show, over the Recording Academy's objections.


	After the academy relented, the rest was history. Martin's exuberant performance of “The Cup of Life” — complete with a huge backing band and performers on stilts — became what then-UTA head Rob Prinz called “the single biggest game-changing moment for any artist in the history of the Grammys.” It not only catapulted his career into the mainstream but also helped to usher in “the Latin explosion,” as it would become known stateside. “[Taking it] from the platform of the World Cup to the stage of the Grammys really was the key to set off this Latin explosion,” Mottola says. “There would probably be no Bad Bunny without this.”


	The World Cup is, by far, the most widely seen sporting event in the world, with an estimated 5 billion people tuning in to watch the 2022 edition at some point, including 1.5 billion viewers for the tournament's final match, according to FIFA. But while that platform “100% provides value” to any music release, Mottola says, it doesn't guarantee huge, or lasting, commercial success.


	Sony Music — which was FIFA's official label partner for many years until 2019 — released “The Cup of Life” and “Waka Waka,” and in their wake, the importance of music as a promotional vehicle during the World Cup soared. What was once one “official” song became many, with tournament sponsors, broadcasters and individual countries commissioning original tracks.

	











	“It used to be that there was a single song that FIFA chose and everybody used that song,” says Afo Verde, chairman/CEO of Sony Music Latin Iberia. “But after ‘Waka Waka,' every brand, every network wanted to have a World Cup song. And while a hit is not something you simply dictate … it helps when there is a single song that's played everywhere you go.”


	But, Verde continues bluntly, “you need a real hit. And you look for a hit informed by what's happening on the planet, what the social climate is. You need to embody the spirit of the sport, convey a message of unity, understanding it's a competition. The song needs to reflect that each team is going to give their all.”


	In 2021, FIFA launched its FIFA Sound strategy, meant to connect soccer and music fans, and partnered with Universal Music Group for a series of releases and initiatives that included the first-ever multisong FIFA World Cup official soundtrack for the 2022 event in Qatar.


	From that soundtrack, “Arhbo,” performed by Ozuna with Congolese French rapper and singer–songwriter GIMS and produced by RedOne, topped Billboard's Latin Airplay chart for three weeks in 2022.


	At press time, FIFA had yet to announce an official tournament song or anthem for this year's event, which will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. But official FIFA songs already include Robbie Williams' “Desire” (penned for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup), while last year Telemundo premiered its own official song, “Somos Más,” performed by Carlos Vives, Xavi, Wisin and Emilia.


	There have been notable World Cup songs through the years. In 2014, “We Are One” hit No. 59 on the Hot 100; as of Jan. 22, it has 146.5 million on-demand official streams, according to Luminate. And K'Naan's “Wavin' Flag” from 2010 was chosen by Coca-Cola as its official song for the tournament, garnering 161.6 million on-demand streams in the United States and reaching No. 82 on the Hot 100.

	











	But none have come close to “Waka Waka” in consumption or longevity — perhaps in part because Shakira fully understood the importance of the sport in the creation of the music, a rare combination.


	“A World Cup song needs to have that feeling of adrenaline that you get when you're playing or when you're watching an exciting game,” she says. “A suspenseful pre-chorus, a joyous, explosive chorus. You have to feel the payoff. And I think the rhythm is important, so people can celebrate not only with the words but also with dancing, with their bodies. I think music is the best vehicle for moments of extreme emotion, like a World Cup can be.”

            / CBS Boston
          

A major update is expected Tuesday on Boston's World Cup matches.

The town of Foxboro, Massachusetts is fighting for funding to cover security this summer.

Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey and Boston Mayor Wu will hold a news conference with FIFA World Cup Boston CEO Mike Loynd at City Hall. You can watch it live at 1:30 p.m. on CBS News Boston in the embedded video.  

Seven matches will be played at Gillette Stadium, which will be known as Boston Stadium for the tournament in June and July. The first game will be between Scotland and Haiti on June 13.

Town officials want to know who is fronting the $7.8 million bill for security costs in Foxboro.

Massachusetts is eligible for $46 million in federal grants for World Cup security and preparedness, but a recent state report called the grant program process ""unusual"" because the state has limited control in how that money can be distributed and when.

The Boston Globe reported Monday Foxboro was supposed to learn on January 30 about its grant request. But the town is still waiting and they're refusing to grant a key entertainment license to FIFA until they have what they need to pay police and buy any necessary public safety equipment.

In statement Tuesday, a town spokesperson told WBZ-TV ""hosting an event of this scale creates significant public safety, operational, and infrastructure demands"" on Foxboro.

""The Town has spent many months working with event organizers and public safety professionals to carefully identify the resources required to safely host these matches. Those planning efforts have made clear that the associated municipal costs are substantial,"" the statement said.

""The taxpayers of Foxborough cannot and will not be responsible for funding an international sporting event. We believe it is reasonable and appropriate that FIFA and/or event partners provide the funding necessary to support the public safety and operational requirements that come with hosting these matches.""

Karim Benzema reportedly provoked former Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo after sealing his controversial transfer to Al-Hilal, with the French forward said to have sent a Saudi Pro League title joke to a disgruntled friend that has taken strike action at Al-Nassr. Ronaldo was left frustrated at seeing a fellow Ballon d'Or winner change clubs during the winter transfer window.

CR7 had been hoping to see Al-Nassr complete more business with another recruitment market open, allowing them to strengthen claims to a first domestic crown during his stint in the Middle East.

No marquee signings were completed, with rivals making more headlines. Benzema was the man to make the most noise, as he brought a stint at Al-Ittihad to a close. The ex-Real Madrid striker had linked up with them in 2023 - a matter of months after Ronaldo had trodden a similar career path.

Benzema is delighted with his start to 2026, with a dream debut being enjoyed at Al-Hilal. He bagged a hat-trick on his first appearance for new employers. By that stage, Ronaldo had taken to ruling himself out of selection contention at Al-Nassr.

The Portuguese GOAT has sat out two matches, with The Telegraph among those to have reported on how the five-time Golden Ball winner is “angry about Al-Nassr's low-key January trading”. That stance has been taken despite Al-Nassr spending more than €400 million (£348m/$476m) during his time in Riyadh.

The ex-Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus frontman is also working on the most lucrative contract in world football, which is reported to earn him close to £500,000-a-day. All of that is not enough to keep CR7 happy.

The Telegraph claims that Ronaldo's mood has been soured by a jovial exchange with former Santiago Bernabeu colleague Benzema. He is said to have “looked at his Al-Ittihad deal and believed he could earn a bit more”.

After landing a salary increase at Al-Hilal, the Frenchman “texted Ronaldo and observed jokingly that not only had he got a pay-rise but he was also going to win the title again”. Said taunt is unlikely to have gone down well in the Ronaldo household, as the evergreen 41-year-old has made it clear that he is determined to savour Saudi title glory in 2025-26.

Ronaldo may still get his wish, but serious questions are being asked of his future. A new challenge could be sought in the summer, with a deal through to 2027 being broken in the Middle East.

There is an exit clause, which stands at €50m (£44m/$60m), that can be triggered in the next transfer window. The Telegraph claims that “would be waived to avoid a Ronaldo meltdown”. They go on to state that “a free transfer would be more preferable for Saudi”.

A return to Europe has been speculated on for CR7, who severed ties with Premier League giants at Old Trafford late in 2022 when his contract was terminated. A move to join eternal rival Lionel Messi in MLS has also been mooted.

The Telegraph claim that CR7 could continue his quest for 1,000 career goals in the United States, “a country where his friendship with US President Donald Trump makes Ronaldo a welcome overseas worker”. They add that there is “scope for something much more interesting than lashing in No 1,000 against a football club that has been playing for fewer years than Ronaldo”.

Regardless of where he ends up, there are not many years left in what has been a remarkable playing career. Ronaldo has stated that this summer's World Cup will be his last, although many are tipping him to play on towards another major international tournament - having already earned 226 caps and scored 143 goals for his country.

A desire to move into ownership has been stated once record-shattering boots have been hung up, rather than explore management, with Ronaldo hoping that he will have a Saudi Pro League title under his belt by then - allowing him to have the last laugh with Benzema.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Bayern Munich deliver worrying Harry Kane contract update amid Saudi transfer links","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/bayern-munich-worrying-harry-kane-contract-update-saudi-transfer-links/bltf68891b62eff73eb","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:24:20 GMT","

Bayern Munich have delivered an update on Harry Kane's contract situation, with a slightly worrying admission being made by the club's sporting director Max Eberl. He had offered hope to a loyal fan base at the Allianz Arena when revealing that “talks” were being held. It has now been revealed that prolific England international Kane is yet to form part of those discussions.

There is no rush on Bayern's part to get an extension for the 32-year-old frontman thrashed out, with his current terms due to run until the summer of 2027. That deal does, however, include exit clauses that can be triggered in each passing transfer window.

It is reported that an offer of £57 million ($78m) would be enough to prise Kane away from Bavaria in 2026. Teams around the world would consider that fee to represent good value for money, given the standards that one of the most fearsome frontmen on the planet has been able to maintain.

Kane has, having severed ties with Tottenham in 2023 as their all-time leading scorer, registered 123 goals for Bayern through 129 appearances - picking up two Golden Boots in Germany and a Bundesliga title.

His trophy curse has been lifted in Munich, but questions are being asked of whether future successes will be chased down in new surroundings. Bayern are understandably reluctant to part with a talismanic presence.

Contract discussions were confirmed in January, but Eberl has said when delivering an update on that process: “I said we were in talks, but the negotiations have not started yet. We are in close contact with Harry, and further steps will follow.”

Kane has hinted that he would be open to agreeing a new deal with Bayern, with his family - including wife Kate - feeling settled in Germany on the back of a transfer that saw them step out of a north London comfort zone.

Kane said when discussing his future at the end of 2025: “The move has been one of the best decisions of my life. To experience a new league, a team like Bayern Munich, these European nights, the atmosphere in the German league, has been a great step in my career and helped me improve as a player. 

“I'm quite open to staying longer. The way we are right now and the way we are playing, I feel we are one of the best teams in Europe, for sure. I don't look at any other team and think, 'I want to go there.' I'm really happy here. I've got 18 months on my contract and I'm sure there will be discussions in the future.”

Moves elsewhere have been mooted, with former Spurs star Gus Poyet telling GOAL amid talk of La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid showing interest in Kane: “If he wants something different for his family, I would definitely go to Barcelona - if [Robert] Lewandowski leaves. It will be completely different to everything that he had before.

“Also the style of play at Barcelona right now, a player like him up front, he will score - wow, will he score! There has been a bit of criticism from Michael Owen, saying he can't believe he left. I don't know if he read it and maybe thought about the Premier League and coming back. It is very particular to him. Family is going to be very important to his decision next year.”

A return to English football appears to have been ruled out, with chasing down Alan Shearer's all-time goal record in the Premier League not considered to be a priority - with trophies now more important to Kane than entries in the history books.

Enticing offers may, however, be put to him from the Saudi Pro League, with lucrative salaries to be earned in the Middle East, with teams in that region said to be drawing up recruitment plans for the next transfer window - as Portuguese GOAT Cristiano Ronaldo generates exit rumours at Al-Nassr.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Sebastian Korda earned his 150th tour-level win and a measure of revenge with a crisp opening performance Monday night at the Nexo Dallas Open.

Three weeks after losing to Michael Zheng at the Australian Open, Korda beat the Columbia University star 6-3, 6-4 to open his campaign at the ATP 500 event. The victory continued Korda's recent success on home soil after his run to the final at an ATP Challenger Tour event in San Diego one week ago.

Now 150-100 at tour-level, Korda is the sixth man born in 2000s to reach the 150-wins mark.


Korda lost just one point on first serve against Zheng, according to Infosys ATP Stats, winning 29 of 30 points behind his first delivery. He saved the only break point he faced, which came as he served out the opening set. Korda's victory drew the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series level at 1-1 after Zheng picked up his first tour-level win last month in their Melbourne meeting.

Eighth seed Frances Tiafoe also advanced Monday with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 result against Terence Atmane. Now a perfect 4-0 in Dallas, Tiafoe is seeking the biggest title of his career this week after reaching previous ATP 500 finals in Vienna (2021) and Tokyo (2022).

""It was kind of nice to get through that. Probably a year ago, last season, I'd lose a lot of those types of matches,"" said Tiafoe, who was competing for the first time since the Australian Open. ""To be able to not hit the panic button and keep going, trust my legs... I feel like I'm in great shape, so I can run and be tough out there.""








Brandon Nakashima also advanced with a 6-3, 6-4 win against Mattia Bellucci, but third seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina prevented an American sweep on the day with his 6-4, 7-6(1) result against qualifier Zachary Svajda. The Spaniard is through to the Dallas second round for the second straight year; the No. 14 in the PIF ATP Rankings is seeking his first ATP Tour title and his second indoor final after reaching the Basel title match last October.

Lucky loser Elisabetta Cocciaretto scored her third career Top 10 win and advanced to the last 16 of a WTA 1000 event for the first time with a straight-sets upset of Coco Gauff at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open -- and revealed afterwards that her friendship with Sofia Goggia, the women's downhill bronze medallist at the Winter Olympics this week, has been an inspiration to her.

Lucky loser Elisabetta Cocciaretto scored her third Top 10 win -- and first outside a Grand Slam -- with a 6-4, 6-2 upset of No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the Qatar TotalEnergies Open second round. The Italian advances to the last 16 of a WTA 1000 event for the first time.

Doha: Scores | Draws | Order of play 

But despite posting one of the best results of her career, Cocciaretto admitted in her on-court interview that her attention isn't wholly on the tennis this week. After all, the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games are currently being held in her home country.

""Well, I think this week is a little bit different for us in Italy,"" she said. ""Because now I'm more focused on the Winter Olympics than on the tournament, cheering for the Italian athletes. Maybe that was the key, that's why I'm playing better. But jokes apart, playing more matches helps you to win more matches, for sure.""

Afterwards, Cocciaretto explained that she'd been glued to the downhill skiing races all week. Ahead of her first-round match against Elsa Jacquemot, she'd been cheering on her friend Sofia Goggia, who took the bronze medal in Sunday's women's event. Cocciaretto and Goggia had met through their mutual clothing sponsor, Emporio Armani.

""Now we are in contact,"" she said. ""We always send messages and FaceTime to talk about our sports and how you manage some things. She gives me a lot of advice.""

Cocciaretto has never skied herself -- her parents forbade it as too dangerous when she was younger -- but her coach Fausto Scolari hails from the Alpine town of Sondrio, and he's taught her to appreciate the sport. Indeed, Cocciaretto calls downhill skiers her ""idols"".

""I love how they approach the sport,"" she said. ""They have fear of nothing. They're focused a lot and they put themselves after everything. If I have a child in the future, I will put him or her in skiing!""

Keys to the win: Cocciaretto was able to take that fearlessness into her match with Gauff. She said that in past years, she had put too many limits on herself -- but now, she's resolved to leave them behind.

""Sometimes I wasn't sure about myself, about winning some matches,"" she said. ""I came on court, but not really sure that I will win that match. So I tried to not put that limit on myself, and go there and have maybe a mentality of a champion.""

With her game style of holding her baseline and taking the ball as early as possible, Cocciaretto signalled her aggressive intent throughout an opening set in which she fired 10 winners to Gauff's four. The World No. 57 made her move at 2-2, standing inside the baseline on return and reeling off a series of superb groundstrokes to break.

Keeping her lead wasn't straightforward, but Cocciaretto came up with resilient tennis in the clutch. Gauff pegged her back to 3-3, but Cocciaretto broke again courtesy of the best point of the match -- a 33-stroke lungbuster in which both players ran each other ragged, before Cocciaretto was able to finally bust through the Gauff defenses with a backhand. She then saved a break point in each of her next service games, and converted her fourth set point with one of her most reliable weapons -- the crosscourt backhand.

There was less tension in the second set. Cocciaretto broke immediately with another crosscourt backhand winner and cruised to the finishing line as Gauff's unforced error tally rose to 39. The fifth game encapsulated the American's woes. Having double faulted to go down 0-40, she played three of her best points of the match to get it back to deuce -- only to concede it anyway with another double fault and a tame backhand into the net.

""I tried to be more aggressive, and I was hitting more unforced errors,"" Gauff said. ""I tried to be a little bit more passive, but playing with more shape, and she was just taking the ball early and crushing the ball. I don't know. I think I need to figure out how to play against players like her who hit super flat and take everything pretty much early. I think the last two matches have shown that I've been struggling with that.""

Cocciaretto surging in 2026: Cocciaretto's previous Top 10 wins had come over Petra Kvitova at Roland Garros 2023 and Jessica Pegula at Wimbledon 2025, but she had not won a set from Gauff in three previous professional meetings. However, she did have a junior win over the American to draw on, having defeated her 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 at the Australian Open in 2018.

She still remembers every detail of it, too -- from her fellow Italians joking about her unlucky draw to the game plan she used to win.

""My tactics were playing in the centre and moving her, and it worked,"" she said.

The result continues Cocciaretto's stellar season so far -- one in which she has used the qualifying rounds as a springboard to success. In January, she captured her second WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz title as a qualifier in Hobart. This week, she fell in the final round of qualifying to Varvara Gracheva, but entered the main draw as a lucky loser following McCartney Kessler's withdrawal.

The 25-year-old will next face another American, Ann Li, with a maiden WTA 1000 quarterfinal at stake for both players.

The WTA 500 event becomes the first standalone tournament to proactively meet equal prize benchmarks, doubling its total player compensation for 2026.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Credit One Charleston Open has once again shown its commitment to the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz by voluntarily doubling the prize money on offer for the 2026 edition.

The tournament will offer a total financial package of $2.5m funded by sponsor Credit One Bank, consisting of a record $2.3m going toward players' on-site prize money in addition to $200k being contributed towards WTA player benefit programs.

Charleston's landmark decision means it is the first standalone WTA 500 event to proactively offer equal prize, in line with what is required for an ATP 500 level event. The announcement marks a historic milestone as the WTA continues on its pathway toward prize money equality, with all tournaments at this level projected to offer equal prize money by 2033.

Venus Williams, a pivotal figure throughout her career for equal prize money and 2004 Charleston champion, commented: “This is a huge moment for the legacy of our sport which sends a powerful message to the players, fans and the future of tennis. It shows real progress and a belief in the value of women's sport.""

Portia Archer, WTA CEO, said: “Charleston's financial commitment in 2026 is an empowering statement about where our sport is headed. It reflects a shared belief that women athletes deserve equal recognition, investment and opportunity, and we're proud to see a tournament with such history take this important step forward.”

Ben Navarro, Tournament Owner of the Credit One Charleston Open, added: “Women's tennis is delivering at a very high level right now, from the quality of competition to the engagement from fans, and this investment reflects that. Offering equal prize money is about respecting the players and the work they put in, and aligning the tournament with the value of the game.""

The $200k figure will be contributed to the Women's Tennis Benefit Association (WTBA) which offers key services to WTA players including a pension plan, health insurance and subsidized college tuition and online degrees through the University of Florida and Indiana University East.

Charleston, voted as the 2025 WTA 500 Tournament of the Year by the WTA player body for the fourth season in a row, is no stranger to tour-firsts as last year it became the first WTA Tour clay event to introduce Electronic Line Calling Live.

The No. 4 seed suffered a second straight defeat since making the Australian Open quarterfinals but remains eager to employ her good form in practice to the match court.ByDavid KanePublished Feb 10, 2026 copy_link

Published Feb 10, 2026

DOHA, Qatar—Coco Gauff was largely in good spirits despite a 6-4, 6-2 defeat to Elisabetta Cocciaretto at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open on Tuesday, the No. 4 seed going 0-2 since reaching the Australian Open quarterfinals last month.🖥📲 ️Match in 15 Minutes: Cocciaretto def. Gauff, Doha 2R“I just feel like I haven't showed up with my best level the last few matches,” Gauff said to open her post-match mixed zone. “I'm just looking to find that again.”The reigning Roland Garros champion enjoyed a bright start to the 2026 season, defeating Iga Swiatek at the United Cup in January, but suffered a stunning defeat in Melbourne to Elina Svitolina and, after a Monday night defeat in doubles alongside Victoria Mboko, appeared equally out of sorts against Cocciaretto following a first-round bye.“I just feel like some of the things I've been working on in practice aren't translating to the match court, which is super frustrating,” said Gauff. “I've been having good practices, but just not playing well in the matches. I just need to find how it can translate.”

After losing in qualifying, Cocciaretto made the most of her second chance at the main draw, scoring a third career Top 10 victory—and her first win over Gauff since the two played juniors in 2018.“I tried to be more aggressive and was hitting more unforced errors,” the American explained. “When I tried to be a little more passive and play with more shape, she was taking the ball early and crushing the ball.“I think I need to figure out how to play against players like her, who hit super flat and take everything early. I think the last two matches showed I've been struggling with that. That's something I need to work on in practice.”The 21-year-old took some consolation in the fact that the Middle East has proved an annual challenge, having also endured early defeats in Doha and Dubai last year, and gave herself high marks on her improved serve.

“Today, with only three double faults, that's positive, and same with the matches I had in Australia,” Gauff said. “I think there weren't many double faults there, as well. That's the one positive. Now I need to figure out what I'm doing off the ground to lose these matches.”Gauff has long proven capable of resetting after bad days on the court, but confessed to a sort of mental block when it came to employing her strong practices to the match court.“Physically, I know I can do it and I can do it when there's not much pressure. I need to figure out how to do it when there's more pressure.”Gauff will next head to the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, where she reached the semifinals back in 2023.

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Payton Westcott will represent Mercedes in F1 ACADEMY for the 2026 season.

Mercedes have announced that Payton Westcott will be representing the team for the 2026 F1 ACADEMY campaign, competing with PREMA Racing.

The American driver began karting competitively aged 12, achieving notable results in the United States Pro Kart Series, California Pro Kart Challenge, and finishing third overall in the Challenge of the Americas.

In 2024, Westcott was selected for the inaugural cohort of F1 ACADEMY DISCOVER YOUR DRIVE karters in the Champions of the Future Academy Program. Last year, she progressed into single-seaters, with campaigns in the Formula Winter Series, Italian F4 Championship, and E4 Championship.

Alongside scoring a Female Trophy win in the Formula Winter Series, she became the first and only woman to achieve a victory in the UAE Trophy Series. Selected as the Wild Card entry for the F1 ACADEMY season finale in Las Vegas, Westcott went on to finish sixth on her debut.

Wescott will benefit from additional seat time with a dual programme in Italian F4 alongside her F1 ACADEMY commitments.

“I'm excited to join the Mercedes family for the 2026 F1 ACADEMY season,” said Westcott. “They are an incredible team and one that is driven by passion, determination, and a constant pursuit of excellence. It's an amazing opportunity to work with such a talented group of people that are commitment to developing young talent.”

“I'm looking forward to learning new tracks throughout the season and continuing to grow my skill set both on and off the circuit. Every race weekend will be a chance to push my limits, refine my driving, and build consistency. I'm motivated to make the most of this journey and take the next big step in my career.”

Gwen Lagrue, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team Driver Development Advisor, added: “We're very pleased to welcome Payton Westcott to the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team family for the 2026 F1 ACADEMY season.

“She steps into big shoes by succeeding Doriane, who set a very high benchmark within our programme. We know Payton is a rookie, and we approach the season with realistic ambitions, but this is a challenge she understands and fully embraces.

“At just 16 years old, Payton has already demonstrated both maturity and strong performance. Her results in the 2025 Italian F4 and Euro 4 championships, as well as her recent performances in the UAE Formula 4 series, underline not only her speed but also her ability to adapt quickly to highly competitive environments.”

“The 2026 season will be intense for Payton. Alongside F1 ACADEMY, she will continue racing in Italian F4 to further develop her race craft, technical understanding, and overall experience. We believe this dual programme will accelerate her progression and provide a solid foundation for her long-term ambitions in single-seater racing. We look forward to supporting her throughout this important next stage of her journey with us.”

Westcott will work closely with reigning F1 ACADEMY Champion Doriane Pin, who serves as a Development Driver for Mercedes.

Pin said: ""Payton has the motivation and the mindset to make the most of this opportunity with Mercedes in F1 ACADEMY. She has shown so far that she is a great up-and-coming talent with lots of room to continuing progressing. We're all excited to see how she will do this year.”

""Personally, I am also really happy to support Payton throughout the season as she continues to develop in her young racing career. As last year's champion and as Development Driver for the team, I am looking forward to passing on my knowledge and experience that I learnt to her, being able to support and give her guidance, and being present trackside across the year.”

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Whether you want to plan a full-throttle day out or something a little more low-key, Valentine's Day is the perfect excuse to celebrate your shared love of Formula 1 with your friends or significant other. From race-inspired nights in, to unforgettable experiences further afield, here are some F1-themed date ideas to help you celebrate.

Valentine's Day is on the horizon, and you might be wondering how to spend the day of love. Now, this doesn't have to mean candlelit dinners and soppy playlists – especially if Formula 1 plays a big part in your relationship!

Whether you bonded over cancelling Sunday plans for race day, have heated strategy debates or even argue about your favourite circuits, there are plenty of ways to put a little (or large!) F1 spin on the most romantic day of the year.

If staying in feels more your style, there are plenty of options for something a little more intimate:

Have a Grand Prix-inspired night in

The premise is simple: pick one of your favourite race weekends and build your evening around it! Start off with a Grand Prix-inspired menu – whether it be an Italian night for Monza or Imola, tacos and margaritas for Mexico, or an Australian-inspired spread to mark the pending season opener in Melbourne. Pair it with a themed cocktail or mocktail (a Singapore Sling would go down a treat!) and suddenly dinner transports you straight to the circuit.

Once you've plated up, pull up highlights from Grands Prix gone by – the races that made you fall in love with that circuit in the first place – then settle in and enjoy.

Front row seats on the sofa

Thankfully, sometimes the best date night doesn't even need a reservation. Grab some popcorn, dim the lights and settle in for a movie night. Whether it's F1 The Movie (Apple TV), Rush (Netflix), Senna (Netflix), or one of the many documentaries on the sport, it's an easy win for a relaxed and cosy evening in. Front-row seats and full control of the rewind button – what more could you want?

Get crafting!

If you're feeling crafty and after a Valentine's date idea that's low-pressure but still super meaningful, making F1-inspired beaded bracelets is always a winner. Settle in with some snacks, and pick your favourite drivers' names or numbers, team colours, or even some iconic meme quotes to adorn your accessory! Whether you end up swapping bracelets at the end of the night or end up keeping them as good-luck charms for the season ahead, it's a low key but wholesome evening.

If you or your partner fancies yourselves a budding engineer, why not fuel that passion by spending the evening crafting your favourite teams' F1 car... in LEGO of course! Every team is represented, and sets range from quick builds to something a little more time consuming – so there's something to suit every skill level. Put some music on, pour a drink, and see which of you has the patience and precision of a race engineer!

If you're up for getting out and doing something a little different, here are some ways to spend the evening out together:

Lights out at F1 Arcade

If you're both missing F1 (and let's face it, who isn't?), the F1 Arcade makes for a really fun Valentine's date. With F1 Arcades in London, Birmingham, Boston, Atlanta, Washington, Philadelphia, Denver and Las Vegas it is the perfect way to get a mid-winter motorsport fix.

Jump into the simulators, have a laugh comparing lap times, then slow things down a little with good food, cocktails and music once the racing's done. Race as much or as little as you want – but a little competition never hurt anyone!

Karting date_

If you are a competitive couple, then how better to celebrate Valentines Day than going up against each other on track? Going karting is a great option to fuel your love for adrenaline... or perhaps even to settle any disagreements you may have!

If you head to F1 DRIVE in London, then there's also the option for dinner and drinks to enjoy post-chequered flag. Perhaps buying the drinks or letting the winner choose the playlist on the way home is a suitable forfeit for the runner-up?

If you're thinking of something bigger than a single night, there are plenty of ways to make Valentine's Day feel unforgettable...

Book a table at Ristorante Cavallino

If you're the kind of couple who loves a romantic getaway, then we reckon this one could be hard to beat. A table at Ristorante Cavallino in Maranello sits right next to Ferrari's base, and that alone gives the evening a sense of occasion, not just for the Tifosi, but any motorsport fan.

While it might be hard to justify a trip away for a single meal, this works perfectly as part of a bigger romantic trip. Jet off to Italy, soak up the country's deep-rooted love for motorsport and turn the dinner into one stop on a longer adventure. With Florence, Venice and Bologna all within reach, it's easy to imagine this becoming the start of a memorable Italian road trip!

Prep a Las Vegas Grand Prix wedding

Though slightly unconventional, an F1-themed wedding doesn't get more on-brand than saying “I do” at the Las Vegas Grand Prix over race weekend!

The bright pink chapel has become a staple of the paddock in recent years, with plenty of F1-obsessed couples tying the knot – often with an Elvis impersonator conducting the ceremony (this is Las Vegas after all). While some decide to get married on impulse during the weekend itself, others plan the whole trip around their wedding, making it a perfect Valentine's Day idea to start plotting together.

And who knows... maybe a rogue F1 driver will even pop up to officiate your ceremony (we're looking at you Valtteri Bottas!)

Plan a race weekend together

There's nothing that says “I'm committed” than making future plans and having things to look forward to together. Planning a race weekend turns the day into the start of an adventure rather than just a one-off date. Picking a Grand Prix that you are both itching to attend and imagining yourselves trackside gets the excitement levels rising after a few months without racing.

It doesn't have to be complicated or stressful – you can chat about which races you'd love to go to, which corner you'd like to watch the race from, perhaps plan the travel, or even pick your team colours and outfits for the weekend. Simply dreaming together about the trip and the fun you'll have on race day can be a Valentine's activity in itself.

Cadillac presented their first ever F1 livery to the world with a pair of launches in the United States.

Cadillac made headlines on Sunday night when the F1 newcomers showcased their 2026 livery with simultaneous launches at Times Square and around coverage of the Super Bowl.

As the team's debut season edges ever closer, Cadillac combined a presentation at the famous New York spot with a television advert during the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL) – this year held in Santa Clara, California.

It was the latest step in a momentous journey for the American-led operation, whose CEO Dan Towriss took a moment to reflect while speaking to selected media, including F1.com, in the hours after the launch.

“It was a tremendous event for us last night, to be able to show the car to the world, and to launch this team,” he commented.

“I think for us, as a team, it's a moment to reflect on all the hard work that's been done to get to this point, but I think also launching the livery, our racing livery, is an inflection point. Now, it's all about racing. We've spent a lot of time in the press talking about the entry process and building a team from scratch, but now, it's all about racing.

“Even as we speak, the car is on track doing promotional days in Bahrain. Again, a very momentous day for us, and it was great to go right from the livery launch to the car being on track just a few hours later.”

As well as explaining what went into the dual launch, Towriss opened up on why Cadillac ended up with their split black-and-white livery design.

“We see real meaning in the colours,” he stressed. “For us, black represents this bold attitude of the car. I think when you see the black side it looks a little mean, and it has some attitude. Then white, which is the actual racing colour of America… We wanted to have white on the car. It's fresh, it's clean, it's optimistic. It's really the balance of those two.

“The livery is the identity of the team, and so this represents us. Some people look to the Cadillac badge, and see the red, yellow and blue, but when you get into high performance, Cadillac goes monochromatic in their badging. It's an element of the brand that we wanted to lean into for F1, the pinnacle of motorsport.”

Cadillac will be back in action at the Bahrain International Circuit on Wednesday, when the first of two official pre-season tests gets under way.

Entertainers have been trying for a decade. It took a formerly niche Latin rapper to improbably crack the code.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	Colbert had his moments. Kimmel landed some punches. Robert De Niro sometimes seemed to be living rent-free.But when it comes to a celebrity who could best Donald Trump and MAGA at the troll game — someone who shorted out the machine and sent smoke coming from its head, leading it to finally collapse in a cultural scrap-metal heap — no one could finish the job. The machine just dodged, just deflected, just jujitsued back. And when that didn't work, it just canceled, just suspended, just got them fired.Until Bad Bunny came along.“It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World,” Trump flailed shortly after Bunny's wildly popular Super Bowl halftime show, the leader's usually excellent troll standards unmet — if you don't understand a word this guy is saying, how could you be a worthy judge of how successful he is?But for all the cope of that Sunday-evening missive — you might as well just post a sign saying “I lost” — the truth is that Trump and MAGA have been failing on Bad Bunny for a while now. This is evident from the fact that they freaked out about his appearance months before it even happened and were moved to announce an ill-thought-out counter-programming halftime show whose only reason for being was untherapized rage. (More on that moral debacle in a second.) None of their criticisms stuck, including one they thought couldn't miss. Sure, part of Bad Bunny's popularity is due to sex, but what isn't?So you want to know how Bunny did it. Simple. (But hard.) The rapper cracked the code that broke Trump and MAGA by sidestepping so many of the temptations of those who've tried before. He eschewed the cutting comedy and the tit-for-tat bullying, neither of which is designed for success. You can never out-bully a bully, and sharp comedy isn't a useful weapon in a fight like this. It's like trying to avoid a Mafia hit by quoting Oscar Wilde.Instead the 31-year-old deployed something far more effective: unflappability. Even when he was offering subtle digs, and there have been many, Bad Bunny on the surface has not seemed to be reacting to anything at all. He has vibed indifferent and cool. Also, he had joy. Who would have thought this would be a viable weapon in our rage-filled decade? But when you as a powerful person go off about how awful someone is, all angry and vein-popping, and they just go right on being happy, no one questions whether there's something wrong with the happy guy. They wonder whether there's something wrong with you, and maybe it would be better if you just chilled and listened to some good music? Yo hago lo que me de la gana, acho.The old advice to laugh in the face of a bully has been transformed into something more strategic: don't even acknowledge you heard the bully and instead just keep dropping Easter Eggs. Or, maybe in MAGA terms, “troll without trying.”Just the very existence of Bad Bunny, of course, triggers Trumpists. You can't be born Benito AntonioMartínez Ocasio, rap in Spanish and become the most streamed artist on Spotify for so many years and not provoke MAGA. If a movement's whole mission is wresting people who look and talk like Bad Bunny from their families and sending them out of the country, then to hear the country say, “we actually kind of like what someone like that is doing,” well, it stings. A lot.But Bad Bunny hasn't been content just to let his success speak for itself. That's pre-Trump thinking. No, he has embarked on a months-long battle operation of which we just saw the crescendo — the Gettysburg, if you will — during the Super Bowl Sunday night. Starting with the “four months to learn” from his SNL appearance and the unapologetically Spanish-language Grammys speech for album of the year last Sunday, the rapper has coolly been putting the onus back on Trump to explain why Bunny is bad, to figure him out, shifted the battle to MAGA's backyard. Trump doesn't like to be told he doesn't know something and needs to learn it. And he really doesn't like to be told he doesn't know something and needs to learn it by a guy whose language and appeal he doesn't understand.Yet it goes even further than this. Bad Bunny isn't simply challenging Trump to understand Latin culture; that's relatively easily waved off, mocked away under cover of nativism/faux patriotism. No, the rapper has been sending out cloaked trolls, turning away with a sly smile and dropping political references like they're just another piece of entertainment. He is not shouting out but making us lean in. And it's frustrating the hell out of Trump.There were scores of examples of this at the Super Bowl halftime show. Let's just do a few. First, Bunny let out a “God Bless America”, which is really hard to go against, but then listed all the countries in the Americas, which drives the Firster crowd crazy. You can attack this, but then you're kind of attacking the guy who just said “God Bless America.” (Of course Bad Bunny's very existence as someone from Puerto Rico — Latin but as part of America not as easily demonizable as a foreign shithole — presents this dilemma too.)Then there was the subtly political power-line climb. Those who knew, knew; the performer in that moment was commenting on the island's blackouts and how government has failed its infrastructure. But others simply saw a cool stunt of a musician climbing a pole. It was all such a fun Super Bowl dance party, and who can't get with that, even as what it also means you're  getting with is a protest of Trump's Department of Energy and its decision to cancel $800 million in funds earmarked for the Puerto Rican grid.

	And the flag — hey, he's just waving a Puerto Rican flag. But wait, it's the pro-independence light-blue flag, making a big statement while not making a statement at all. How ironic if, after Trump tried so hard to make Greenland a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico took the first steps to gaining its independence from the same cultural moment. Ditto the 64 under Bad Bunny's wardrobe — is it about notorious Hurricane Maria casualty undercounts? The Congress that granted territoriality to Puerto Rico? You fill in the political blank. And the fact that you are already means he's won.Bad Bunny came into MAGA's field — the NFL is their place, though really it's all of our place — and spiked in their end zone, a gesture the rapper, in a rare but earned moment of unsubtlety, made literal with his football-slam closing the show Sunday night. Even Roger Goodell, hardly renowned as a Simon Bolivar-like revolutionary, had to offer his support. In a 250th year that will surely see a massive White House unleashing of self-aggrandizement disguised as patriotism, Bad Bunny may have given us the real sesquicentennial celebration, casually embodying so much of the Founders' freedom, equality and celebration of the individual (in the face of a controlling government). No wonder data point after data point said he won America Sunday night, especially its young people.Hell, even the rumor that the boy he gave his Grammy to was the targeted-for-deportation five-year-old Liam Ramos landed a blow. It was not Ramos. But the fact that so many of us were even ready to believe it — believe this sly low-key roast of ICE — showed how successfully Bad Bunny has crafted his campaign.The easy chill with which Bad Bunny was dropping disses without seeming to drop disses became even more apparent when taken with the other vision, the MAGA vision. Rarely has pop culture opened windows onto two such emotionally and ideologically distinct forms of entertainment simultaneously, but it did Sunday night with the alternative Turning Point USA Halftime show, conceived as an “all-American” event (even the wordplay is cringe) after Bad Bunny was announced as the Super Bowl performer.I flipped between the two telecasts Sunday night, in some kind of act of dueling-spectacle whiplash, or maybe psychosis-inducing lab experiment. The pure joy of dancing, of eating ices, of wedding proposals and ceremonies — none of that was in evidence over at the TP Show. What we got there was a dose of anger and victimhood, mostly about a “real American,” as a Brantley Gilbert song had it — a song incidentally so organic and Johnny Cash-like it came about because Hulk Hogan asked him to write something for his upstart wrestling league.The spiritual linchpin of the TP show was the appearance of the country singer Lee Brice, who previously had a tearjerking hit with a first-person confessional about driving the truck of his brother killed in Afghanistan (Brice didn't write it, and his actual brother was a contestant on CMT's Can You Duet?). The  star Sunday night sang a new song, “Country Nowadays,” that can only be described as a masterwork of conjured victimhood and invented bogeymen.“I just want to catch my fish, drive my truck, drink my beer.” (Who's stopping you?) “I just want to cut my grass, watch my game, say my prayer.” (Seriously dude, no one is stopping you.) “Not get a picture of a flag up in flames while people cheer.” (What streaming service are you subscribing to, man?) While back on NBC Bad Bunny was throwing to the man who lived la vida loca.It's funny — for years Republicans got the better of Democrats by saying they were playful and having a good time while Democrats were too busy being whiny and self-victimizing. And now Bad Bunny, with an assist from whatever passed for an executive producer of the TPUSA halftime show, had totally flipped the script. Actually, it was shocking — the exact humor-filled playbook that young conservatives said (often justly) that they wrote and that Dems didn't understand was stone-cold swiped by an anti-ICE Puerto Rican rapper, while the very syndrome the GOP had cackled was Democrats' undoing became their own go-to move. Hard to point fingers about all the identity politics after that YouTube spectacle.Perhaps the best conservative media response to the Super Bowl came with the Washington Examiner headline about the show, which said simply, “Bad Bunny Is Bad.” Great stuff. Is it too late to coin “owning the cons?”The mistake so many celebrities made until now is trying to beat Trump at his own game. That's wrong. He's the master — the Bobby Fischer of the competition. You can't win that. Instead you play a different game, and in the process expose how absurd his is. Because a bully can get their way pulling pigtails on the playground. But Bad Bunny excels at winning the rap battle in the club parking lot, and which one would you rather have on your side? Me las vo'a llevar a toa' pa un VIP. Ey saluden a Tití.

The company cited attorney-client privilege in rejecting a bid for information related to its deletion of two datasets used to train old versions of its AI system.


							By 

	Winston Cho



	It was a highly contentious ruling, one that could've changed the course of not only this case but others against AI companies. The court had just ruled that OpenAI waived attorney-client privilege by denying allegations that it knowingly infringed upon the copyrights of authors whose books it illegally downloaded. The finding opened the door to internal communications behind the company's deletion of two huge datasets of pirated books, potentially exposing it to massive damages. Its in-house legal team was set to be deposed.


	OpenAI immediately appealed the ruling, bringing on Lisa Blatt, a veteran of the Supreme Court bar who counts Google, Bank of America and Starbucks as clients. In her brief, she delivered a dire warning: the decision, if allowed to stand, will eviscerate assertions of privilege in any copyright case involving what's known as state of mind, an analysis used to determine whether a defendant intentionally committed infringement or was unaware of doing so.

					AI Companies Sold Us Their Vision of the Future at the Super Bowl. Here's Why We Should Reject It		
			









	On Friday, OpenAI prevailed in its bid to reverse the court's ruling. At stake was billions of dollars. The communications could've helped prove willful infringement, which triggers damages as high as $150,000 per work opposed to just $200. And perhaps even more importantly, the decision threatened to provide a pathway for those suing AI companies to obtain evidence typically considered to be privileged information.

	











	The issue has been a key battleground in discovery. It relates to an OpenAI employee in 2018 downloading pirated copies of books and using them to create two datasets, known as “books 1” and “books 2,” to train two discontinued GPT models. After initially telling the court that the datasets were deleted in 2022 “due to their non-use,” the company has since maintained that information over the reasons for their erasure are privileged. Lawyers representing authors and publishers have called foul play.


	In November, Magistrate Judge Ona Wang found that OpenAI must hand over evidence revealing the company's motivations for deleting the datasets. She concluded that the company opened the door to the privileged material when it disclosed that “books 1” and “books 2” were deleted because of “non-use,” though it was another part of her order that attracted the attention of the copyright bar. Wang reasoned that the company effectively waived attorney-client privilege by denying allegations of willful infringement, which she said puts the company's state of mind under the court spotlight. For “OpenAI to deny that it willfully infringed class plaintiffs' copyrighted works is to argue that it acted in good faith,” per the order.


	Ruling against authors and publishers, including Sarah Silverman, in Friday's order, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein stressed that the denial of willful infringement claims isn't equivalent to advancing a good faith defense. This puts discovery over the reasons OpenAI erased the datasets in 2022 squarely off the table, he said. “There is a distinction between a copyright defendant merely denying allegations of willfulness — on which a plaintiff bears the burden of proof — and a copyright defendant affirmatively asserting its good faith belief that its actions were lawful,” Stein wrote.

	











	With the reversal, the discovery battle becomes a precedential detour in the case. Although it was reversed, the argument was a crafty one by lawyers representing authors, led by Justin Nelson and Craig Smyser of Susman Godfrey, the firm that negotiated the $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement. If the ruling was allowed to stand, AI companies would've borne the burden of proving they didn't intend to violate copyright law anytime they deny allegations that they knowingly infringed on copyrighted works.


	Also discussed in the reversal was whether OpenAI revealed privileged information when it said that the datasets were deleted “due to non-use.” On this issue, Stein said that the assertion doesn't represent legal advice, meaning that they can't be used as a basis for finding that OpenAI waived privilege.


	Despite the loss on the discovery battleground, the authors' lawyers are gaining ground on what's increasingly looking like a winning argument over the practice of pirating books from shadow library. That theory has changed over the course of AI litigation. At first, lawyers for the authors directly connected the piracy to OpenAI's training of its models under a single umbrella. But later, they separated the theories and alleged that the distinct act of illegally downloading the works, regardless of whether they were used, constitutes copyright infringement.


	The move takes advantage of the one win for authors in another AI copyright case, this one initiated by Andrea Bartz against Anthropic, related to the company illegally downloading millions of books and storing them in a central library. The decision heavily leaned in favor of Anthropic, but the court greenlit that theory, which is now a part of the OpenAI case, for trial. “That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft,” wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup. After the ruling, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle the lawsuit.

	











	It remains largely unknown what today's AI systems are trained on. OpenAI used “books 1” and “books 2” — downloaded from LibGen, a shadow library website — to train old versions of GPT but later deleted the datasets. Still, billions of dollars were raised by AI firms largely because of models they trained on pirated books.

'The Daily Show' host expertly picked apart the performative outrage on the right during a particularly busy weekend in America's ongoing culture wars. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


	The right-wing meltdown over Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl Halftime Show performance had Jon Stewart fired up more than usual on Monday's episode of The Daily Show. 


	On a particularly ridiculous weekend in America's ongoing culture wars, that took in the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics and the disgustingly racist social media post by Donald Trump about the Obamas, Stewart jumped in with gusto in his opening monologue. The host began the segment with a compilation of the usual right-wing talking heads, including Megyn Kelly, Benny Johnson and Fox News' finest, performatively complaining about the Super Bowl Halftime Show being performed in Spanish. Stewart then jump cut to Kid Rock performing his song “Bawitdaba” which boasts a chorus of pure gibberish.

	Focusing in on Kid Rock, and the TPUSA alternative, and very anti-woke, halftime show that was staged at the same time as Bad Bunny was performing on Sunday, Stewart also highlighted the performance of Lee Brice and his new song, “It Ain't Easy Being Country” taking great delight in the unintentional absurdity of the lyrics (choice snippets include “I just wanna catch my fish/drive my truck/drink my beer” and “I just wanna cut my grass/feed my dog/wear my boots”). Stewart questioned if Brice was being sincere in the oppression he faced, given he was wearing boots while singing.

	Later in Brice's song he touches on trans issues and being cancelled for his gender critical views, which provoked an eye-roll and “here we go” from Stewart. “You're so brave. People throw the word ‘hero' around, but this is a bold opinion to hold in your genre. You're really risking it all going up against country music's trans cartel.” 


	Stewart then expertly picked apart the right wing talking point that Bad Bunny's all-Spanish performance was not “unifying.” “Why the fuck is it the Super Bowl Halftime entertainer's job to unify the country? Is that their job? Isn't there another person whose job description is much more along those lines?” 


	The segment then segued into Trump's attempts at unifying the country this weekend with his virulently racist social media post that included a video clip depicting the Obamas as apes, as well as the unedifying aftermath when the president refused to back down, apologize or even acknowledge the post was horrifically offensive. “Another unifying tip might be to tell your guy to stop tweeting out racist slop during Black History Month,” Stewart added helpfully. 


	Next Stewart moved on to the Winter Olympics, and the right wing meltdown over freestyle skier Hunter Hess' incredibly mild comments during a press conference (For reference here are Hess' actual words: “It brings up mixed emotions to represent the U.S. right now I think. It's a little hard. There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of and I think a lot of people aren't. I think for me, it's more I'm representing my friends and family back home, the people that represented before me, all the things that I believe are good about the U.S.”)

	











	Bookending the right's unhinged reaction to Bad Bunny and Hess, Stewart ending the segment with a rant. “When did the right become such fucking pussies? Remember 2017? Remember what you hated about liberals? Perpetually offended, safe spaces, censoring free speech, culture of victimhood. Remind you of anyone? ‘Oh, I can't go 15 minutes without listening to country music. I need a separate show.' ‘Oh, that skier triggered me. I can't sleep.' Not the best imitation, but you know what I'm going for.


	“This whole culture war this weekend has really demonstrated one thing. It's that for all of MAGA's triumphalism, it's not a movement that seems confident in its position. These people who control every branch of government are so triggered by someone singing in Spanish for 20 minutes, they need to create their own safe space alternative halftime show, where Trad Bunny over here is singing songs about how he can't even enjoy sitting in a truck and drinking beer because he knows that somewhere out there, there's a trans person.


	“It's actually fucking pathetic. The gap between the power you all wield and the victimhood you all claim is the real offense. If you didn't actually have the power to do so much damage in our country, I think we all dismiss it as a weak and pathetic pity party.”

The Emerald Fennell-directed film, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, hits theaters on Feb. 13.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Ahead of the release of Wuthering Heights this week, critics' reviews of the film have finally been released, and they've been decidedly mixed.


	The Emerald Fennell-directed film, adapted from Emily Brontë's beloved 1847 novel, follows a passionate and tumultuous love story set against the backdrop of the Yorkshire moors, exploring the intense and destructive relationship between Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi) and Catherine Earnshaw (Margot Robbie).




	As of Monday evening, Wuthering Heights had a score of 71 percent from 65 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and clocked in at 60 percent on Metacritic from 31 reviews.

	The cast also includes Hong Chau, Alison Oliver, Shazad Latif, Martin Clunes, Owen Cooper, Charlotte Mellington, Ewan Mitchell and Amy Morgan.


	Read on for key excerpts from some of the most prominent reviews from critics in Hollywood, ahead of the film's release in theaters on Feb. 13.


The Hollywood Reporter‘s chief film critic, David Rooney, wrote in his review, “Fennell's overhaul flirts with insanity, and if you can let go of preconceived notions about how this story should be told, it's arguably the writer-director's most purely entertaining film — pulpy, provocative, drenched in blazing color and opulent design, laced with anachronistic flourishes, sexy, pervy, irreverent and resonantly tragic. Often teetering on the verge between silly and clever, it's Wuthering Heights for the Bridgerton generation, guaranteed to moisten tear ducts and inflame young hearts.”


The Independent‘s Clarisse Loughrey wrote in part, “With its title stylised in quotation marks, and a director's statement that it's intended to capture her experience of reading the book aged 14, it uses the guise of interpretation to gut one of the most impassioned, emotionally violent novels ever written, and then toss its flayed skin over whatever romance tropes seem most marketable. Adaptation or not, it's an astonishingly hollow work.”

	











	Alison Willmore, with Vulture, wrote in her review, “Wuthering Heights is an incredibly moist movie, and that's without even taking into account how often the characters get caught in or choose to stride out into the rain (all the better to make their outfits cling). A snail leaves a languid slime trail across a window pane, a housemaid squishes shiny dough provocatively between her fingers while making bread at the kitchen table, a scarred back is shown beaded with sweat in a loving close-up — Emerald Fennell's take on the 1847 Emily Brontë novel practically glistens with fluids.”


The Guardian‘s critic, Peter Bradshaw, wrote, “Emerald Fennell cranks up the campery as she reinvents Emily Brontë's tale of Cathy and Heathcliff on the windswept Yorkshire moor as a 20-page fashion shoot of relentless silliness, with bodices ripped to shreds and a saucy slap of BDSM. Margot Robbie's Cathy at one stage secretly heads off to the moor for a hilarious bit of self-pleasuring – although, sadly, there are no audaciously intercut scenes of thirst-trap Heathcliff, played by Jacob Elordi, simultaneously doing the same thing in the stable, while muttering gruffly in that Yerrrrrkshire accent of his.”


	David Sims, with The Atlantic, penned in his review, “Wuthering Heights, the writer-director Emerald Fennell's new adaptation of Emily Brontë's groundbreaking Gothic novel, is her best film to date—a heaving, rip-snortingly carnal good time at the cinema. It is also a gooey, grimy mess. The camera lingers on dripping egg yolks and squishy, bubbling dough; the protagonist, Cathy Earnshaw (played by Margot Robbie), must wade through pig's blood on her way to the moors near her home, leaving a trim of viscera on her gorgeously anachronistic dress. This is Fennell's aesthetic throughout: loudly stylish on top, and just as loudly nasty right below the surface.”

	











	Kevin Maher, chief film critic for The U.K. Times, wrote, “Who knew Isabella Linton was the best character in Wuthering Heights? She is in this vapid Brontë adaptation, anyway, a film that is enlivened briefly whenever she appears on screen, wickedly played by Alison Oliver. Otherwise, with a chemistry-free central romance between the bizarrely uninteresting Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi) and Cathy (Margot Robbie, also the film's producer), this film self-deflates. There are conspicuous longueurs and characterizations that barely reflect the complexity of an Instagram reel let alone the greatest gothic novel in English literature. It is the first unfortunate stumble in the film-making ascent of the Oscar-winning writer-director Emerald Fennell (Saltburn and Promising Young Woman).”


	Lindsey Bahr wrote for the Associated Press, “In these sex-deprived times at the cinema, if some corset kink, power games and smoldering star power from two genetically blessed Australians is what you're looking for, Wuthering Heights might just satisfy that big-screen itch. There are myriad pleasures to be had in the bold, absurd pageantry and devilish scheming. Alison Oliver's comic timing as the naive, skittish Isabella Linton is a particular delight. With the right crowd, it could make for a fun night out at the movies. Yet for all the big swings, Fennell's Wuthering Heights amounts to something oddly shallow and blunt: garish and stylized fan fiction with the scope and budget of an old-school Hollywood epic.”

	











	Caryn James, with the BBC, wrote, “Cathy and Heathcliff are still recognisably Bronte's lovers, irresistibly drawn to each other from childhood yet fated to be apart. But Fennell's approach is an extravagant swirl: sexy, dramatic, melodramatic, occasionally comic and often swoonily romantic. There is a lot of standing in the rain and wind, kissing in the rain and wind, and just rain and wind on the Yorkshire moors. She laces the 19th-Century setting with contemporary touches, from its costumes fit for an Oscar red carpet to its sexual frankness. A flesh-coloured wall is based on a scan of Robbie's skin, veins and all. But under it all Fennell channels something essential in the book – the corrosive behaviour that can result from thwarted desire. Jealousy, anger and vengeance are as natural to Cathy and Heathcliff as their endless passion for each other. If you embrace the film's audacious style and think of it as a reinvention not an adaptation, this bold, artful Wuthering Heights is utterly absorbing.”


USA Today‘s Brian Truitt wrote in his review, “Fennell's adaptation takes some liberties with Emily Brontë's original 1847 Victorian-era novel but unless you're a devout superfan, you likely won't be too mad. The Oscar-winning British filmmaker crafts a sumptuous bad romance that's quite haughty, darkly hilarious and ultimately heartfelt.”


	Beth Webb, for Empire, penned in her review, “There is notably more plot to Brontë's novel than in Fennell's reimagining, and while the film doesn't need a denser narrative, it could benefit from feeling more grounded — especially when Cathy and Heathcliff fight and fornicate like teenagers, ricocheting between lust and loathing. ‘I hated you, I loved you, too' is all well and good, but here the stakes become more subdued as style takes over. The film is undeniably expertly crafted, and Fennell — who has quickly risen to become one of Britain's buzziest Hollywood exports — has certainly stepped up as a filmmaker in terms of scope. But had Wuthering Heights stayed closer to earth, the weight of this tragic romance would hit harder.”

	











New York Post‘s Johnny Oleksinski wrote in part, “Traditionalists will moan that Fennell has turned Brontë's book into a sweeping romance. And, yes, she has. Music swells, tears flow, faces are perfect. But what makes the movie so enthralling is that she hits on a powerful tug-of-war: We root hard for Heathcliff and Cathy, even though we know full well we shouldn't.”

The 23-year-old Australian singer breaks down how he came to produce on Enhypen's latest album: “Producing a song sparked something inside me that I didn't really know that I had.”

Enhypen, the powerhouse boy group hailing from Hybe sub-label Belift Lab, is finding a new stride, according to member Jake.


	The 23-year-old Korean-Australian singer is exuding passion about the seven-member group's latest album, The Sin : Vanish, when he speaks to The Hollywood Reporter shortly before its release. I've found Jake on a rare off day, joining the Zoom call himself instead of at his company.




	Enhypen is as solid as ever, and Jake's found himself finding joy in producing for the group for the first time. The singer produced a narration track and a song on The Sin : Vanish. “Producing a song sparked something inside me that I didn't really know that I had because being a K-pop idol, sometimes, it gets very repetitive,” he explains.

	“We wake up, we have a very tight and set schedule down to the minute. We have to wake up at this hour, this minute. We end our schedule at this [time]. I used to enjoy that,” he continues. “I'm a person that really likes that because I'm just wired that way. I don't know. But sometimes, without even me knowing, that gets very tiring, but producing and making music makes you think different and makes you think creatively.”

	Jake not only says he learned something new about himself, but he's just had plain fun doing it as well. “I feel something different when I'm in the studio. It's just a different kind of adrenaline when you're working on a song,” he says. The singer is quick to add that he plans to do more of it in the future.

	











	Below, Jake breaks down how he came to produce songs on Enhypen's latest album, the thing he thinks K-pop artists know but are wary to speak about and how the global audience, including Korea, helped build Enhypen into the group it is today.


Can you tell me a bit about Enhypen's recent album, The Sin : Vanish? I listened to it yesterday with you and the group, obviously, but how are you feeling about it? Where do you think it's going to take you guys?


	First of all, it's a concept album. What we mean by concept album is that it's not just a regular album with music — it has a concept and a story to it. The music, the production and the storyboard, the films and everything is involved in the concept or that story, which is continuing from our last album.


	Our last album was about the desire to be with their loved ones, but on this album, we're talking about how we're on the run, away from society almost or… It's up to interpretation, but we're running away with our loved ones. Our title song, “Knife,” is talking about what we feel and how we're feeling when we're on the run.


What about it being a concept album makes the experience different?


	You have to listen to this album from the start, in order. We planned it, and we put the songs in that particular order because it tells a story. From the beginning, the first track, which is called “The Beginning,” and it's a narration track. It's talking about the beginning of this journey right until the very end, which is the last narration track [“The Beyond”].

	











	We couldn't really talk about the Korean version [in the group's media listening session] yesterday, but the Korean version narration is done by a very famous actor called Park Jeong-min. Also, we have a very famous voice actor from Japan for the [Japanese] version, and also the Chinese version. We put a lot of work into this album, and I hope all the people that listen to it really feel and acknowledge all the little details that we have on this album.


You produced on this album for the first time. How did that come to be? Was it something you went to the label and asked about, or was it just something that organically happened?


	Right at the start of 2025, my personal goal was to be more active or work on my producing skills. My goal was to put [put] or make two or more songs this year — that was kind of my personal goal for 2025. I'm so happy that the two songs that I made got to be on this album.


Can you tell me about the narration track?


	The first track, the narration track, I started working on it almost a day after our promotions ended for our last album. [When] the promotion for our last album ended, I just went to the studio [and] talked about how it went. I was talking about what things could have been better, and started talking about how I wanted to maybe [produce on] the next album. There was nothing really planned at that stage because we still had a tour left [to do]. But I was just thinking about it.


	I was thinking about how our concept film was based on the movie called Late Night with the Devil. I think I was rewatching it. It's not an old movie, but the film style and the concept is sort of a really '90s kind of film. It looks like a really old film, but it's not. It was very interesting and the story was very interesting. On the demo, there's bits of the actual movie that I decided to put in, but it's not on the final version. But on the demo, you could hear the clips of the movie inside the narration track. I just thought, why not continue this sort of theme of this interview, and how we are being interviewed as a vampire. The society or the people might not understand everything about us, but we still want to live this way and tell people about how we are or how we feel. That was sort of the main idea behind this album.

	











How was it different this time?


	It's the first time I really worked on the track. I would usually just work on the melodies or the topline on a song, but it's the first time that I really just started working on it from scratch. It was a very new experience. I found out that I might be better at the producing of the track. A very close producer that I always worked with, he told me that I might be better at doing the track instead of the top melody. It just all came along together very smoothly, which is kind of surprising because it's the first time for me to really work on a song on an album. I was very lucky and very surprised. That's how it went for the narration track.


	The song that I put out, “Sleep Tight,” I started working on that song on the same day. It was the last 30 minutes, I had finished the narration track, and just decided to work on something else, see what I was feeling. It just layered into each other, and kind of just kept building, and it came out with this final product, which I'm very happy about.


Is production anything you ever dealt with when you were a trainee? And if it isn't, do you think it should be down the line for others?


	I think it is at the moment, or it was when you're a trainee at maybe BigHit Entertainment, which is Hybe now, but it was called BigHit Entertainment. Jungwon, Jay, Sunghoon and Heeseung, they were all training at BigHit for a long time. I was only at this current label for about eight months, so I don't think I was… Maybe I wasn't at that level of being a trainee to practice producing a song, or I was just busy trying to dance and sing a little bit, but I feel like it's very good to start as soon as possible. Start as young as possible, just interact with as much music as possible. Even if you're not doing the actual production, I feel like it's a good learning step to just be in the room and just see what people are doing. I think that's how I started.

	











K-pop as an industry moves at a rapid pace. It's very trend-heavy and things change really quickly. Companies are now debuting more groups than they ever have in shorter amounts of time. Is there a pressure to then find [a unique concept]? 


	I feel like the fact about K-pop that every K-pop artist knows but does't want to talk about is that [the] K-pop industry is very competitive, right? We all say we don't want it to be, or we want everyone to do their own thing… Every K-pop artist is different.


Exactly.


	I feel like everyone knows in the back of their mind that it is very competitive, and there's a lot of groups that come out with so many different concepts, and it's always changing. It's very fast-paced. I feel like, compared to any other music industry, it's very up-to-date, like you said, and it's always changing a lot. You have to be on top of everything.


	We would be lying if we said we didn't feel any pressure. We are very confident in our abilities to always put out something different or a different concept. I feel like we're confident in that way. The members and our team, or people at HYBE, everyone that we work with, focus on doing something different. That's the core that we have as Enhypen and as also the crew behind Enhypen. We all try to be the first to do something and be the first to do something different, and I think we definitely did that for this album.


Can you tell me more about that?


	Like I said [in] yesterday's [session], no one really puts out the songs before the concept as we did with the concept films. I think that's very rare in this K-pop industry. We always tend to wait until the last minute, almost. We don't do it now, but we used to hide our hair colors until the very last day. I think that's very K-pop culture, almost. Everyone wants to wait until the last minute and surprise everyone with this new thing. We used to always do that, but we decided every single song in this album is too good to hide.

	











	When we put out an album, it's always the title song or the B-side track that gets the main spotlight or the focus, but we were always almost not happy about that because our songs are all good equally, I feel like, and they all have different styles. It's all attractive in a different way, and we wanted to showcase that, so we decided to have a short film for each song. We don't have the time to make a music video for each song, so we decided to do a short film with the concept and the storyline. I really, really like how we did the pre-comeback promotion for this album. I think the fans are very excited, and I think I'm very excited if you can't tell. (Laughs.)


These narration tracks are different than a lot of albums, too, because you're doing them in four languages. I know you grew up in Korea and Australia and maybe have an interesting opinion on the fact that K-pop as a whole now is very confronted with the fact that you have to have this global appeal. You're trying to hit all these different markets. I'm wondering why you feel it's important?


	I think if I'm being 100 percent honest, the base of Enhypen… I feel like the reason Enhypen was able to come to this world was because of our global fans, and that includes Korea, as well, when I say global. I'm saying that it wasn't just in Korea that we were able to start almost because we had I-Land, which was a global program and the voting was global, as well. Right off the bat, we knew in our heart that there were people outside of Korea that were very interested in us or in K-pop. But at the time, because of COVID, we couldn't really see with our own eyes. As time went on — and we were able to go overseas and perform and interact with fans all over the world — we realized that K-pop is not Korean pop. It's this whole genre that is loved globally.

	











	We don't really put an album or make an album or make a song that is liked by this region or this group of people or this group of people. We might have different styles… Like on this album, we have a Latin-style song that we know that Latin Engenes would enjoy more. There's things like that, but we never plan to target a certain group of people. We just put out albums or songs that we know are good quality, first of all. I think that's what I really like about Enhypen or this company is that we don't put stuff out to almost… we don't put out albums just because of our fans. I want to elaborate on that because it's very important to make an album that the fans like, but also, I feel like a very thin line to keep is that you need to know what you want to do or you need to keep grounded and have a meaning behind the album.


You need to create a vision for yourself more than just that.


	Exactly. More than just to please people or just make a song or make an album that just people would just like to hear. I think it's a very thin line. You can't really tilt towards one side. The people that work with us or this company are very good at staying on that really thin line. This album is very strong with the concept and the meaning and the details and everything is very detailed. Everything is there for a reason. But also, I know that the people would love to listen to it. Even if they don't know much about Enhypen or this concept or this storyline that we have, they would still listen to it because it's such a good song. I don't know, this album is the most confident that I've been throughout the five years. I feel like the songs and everything around it is the best that we've done so far.

	











You have this crazy schedule that you've described as structured. It seems to have been helpful, but what do you do then to take care of yourself in this situation? I assume you're finding your own way that's more than just doing a face mask. What does taking care of yourself look like?


	The first thing that comes to mind is you have to talk to people about it. I feel like K-pop idols are very different to normal people — you can't really expect to have a normal life, so I feel like it's important to talk to other K-pop artists or other K-pop seniors that have been doing this for longer than me. They know what I've gone through. They all went through the same thing. I feel like it's important to share what you're feeling because if you want to ask advice for anything related to your life or my life as a K-pop artist, there's no one that can relate to it other than the same people that are doing it. I don't really know a lot of people, to be honest. (Laughs.)


Really?


	There's people like Felix, who I'm close to, and Chris from Stray Kids. They've been doing this for longer, and they know exactly what I'm going through. Because they're also very busy and I'm busy, we don't really get time to link up, but when we do, we talk about all this. They can relate to it very easily and give me advice. I feel like that helps me cope with everything.


	Internally, I feel like this goes for every job, but you've got to enjoy what you do. I certainly enjoy what I do, and everyone in the group enjoys what they do. We enjoy performing in front of our fans, and I think that's what motivates us during the hard times, which is before we come back, before we put out an album, the few months or the half a year that we have to put in doing the music videos, recordings, making the album, that's the hard bit. Just the thought of putting this album out and singing this song in front of our fans is what helps us get through the few months.

	











Do you find it a bit harder to deal with the fact that most of the K-pop industry is structured in a way that most groups are putting out two albums a year? Do you come to cherish that downtime more or is it just something you get used to?


	I don't know how K-pop artists put out so many albums. [The other members and I], but also our company, sometimes talk about how the other groups do it. How they put out so many albums, because we know how long it takes to make an album. It takes a long time [and] takes a lot of work to put out one album. But I feel like every single K-pop artist usually don't have downtime. If you're doing a promotion for an album, you're doing that. If you're not, you're working on the next album. It's almost like you don't ever stop, or you're on tour. So it's pretty hectic, but you definitely get used to it. You find little bits of rest in between, and you get to cherish that rest or the days off that you have rarely; you really cherish those. I'm used to it. It's fun. You have to work hard because a lot of people, a lot of fans, are really expecting a lot from us, which is a good pressure. It's a positive pressure, if you know what I mean. It helps us [stay] motivated.

From sugar cane fields to a live wedding, Billboard decodes all the nods and Easter eggs in his epic 13-minute performance.

Associate Editor, Billboard Español


Bad Bunny transformed the Super Bowl LX halftime show on Sunday (Feb. 8) into a joyous celebration of identity, history and unity, stitching together his Puerto Rican roots with broader themes that resonate across the Americas.


	From the opening scene of sugar cane fields — a nod to the island's colonial past — to the portrayal of the now-iconic Casita, the Puerto Rican superstar paid homage to the resilience and struggles of his homeland. Tributes to barber shops, domino tables, piraguas vendors and Nuyorican pride brought to life the everyday traditions and essence of Caribbean culture.


	Much of the symbolism ran deep: “El Apagón” spotlighted Puerto Rico's ongoing power grid struggles and displacement (more on that below) while a shout-out to every nation in the Americas emphasized a powerful message of connectedness.


	Amid heartfelt moments such as the Grammy handoff to a young boy dressed as a young Benito and an actual wedding that took place on stage, the hitmaker proved that his halftime show was about much more than entertainment but a celebration of heritage, community and perseverance.


	Already ranked as one of the most watched halftime performances in Super Bowl history, Bad Bunny's show delivered impact far beyond entertainment


	More than a 13-minute medley spanning through all of his hits, his performance was a carefully curated display of cultural pride. As the night culminated with his “Together We Are America” message appropriately emblazoned on his football, El Conejo Malo showed the world that halftime shows can be more than extravagant. 


	Let's dive into the references and moments you might have missed.


	Bad Bunny kicked off his groundbreaking Super Bowl halftime show with an Afro-Latino guitarist wearing a pava (straw) hat, declarating: “Qué rico es ser latino” (or “How wonderful it is to be Latino”). Played by Alexander Mercedes, a young Dominican singer from La Romana, he performed a tribute to legend Anthony Santos' “Hoy Se Bebe” atop a bachata melody, filmed in a cane field in the Dominican Republic. It's also the song that introduces “Tití Me Preguntó” — produced by MAG, who's of Dominican and Puerto Rican descent. 


	As “Tití Me Preguntó” plays, the audience is introduced to a scene of sugar cane fields, with farmers chopping stalks — a nod to Puerto Rico's colonial history. Sugar production has shaped the island's past since the 1500s, when Taínos — the island's indigenous people — were forced into labor by Spanish colonizers. After their near extinction due to exploitation, enslaved Africans were brought in to continue cultivating crops for trade abroad. Even after slavery ended, sugar remained central to Puerto Rico's economy, accounting for nearly half of its agricultural production as late as 1964.


	The symbolic imagery reminded viewers of the island's painful legacy, but the moment wasn't all serious. Fans chuckled when they realized some of the greenery wasn't props — it was 380 performers dressed as blades of grass. A clever workaround, this gave jobs to people while adhering to NFL rules limiting field carts to protect the playing surface.


	Bad Bunny passed by a vendor selling coco frío — fresh, chilled coconut water straight from the shell. A staple in tropical climates like Puerto Rico, it's the ultimate refreshing drink for warm weather vibes — and hangover cure. 


	Beyond what songs he'd perform, one of the most talked about things was what he would wear. While many expected to see him sporting his pava (straw) hat, Bad Bunny instead took the stage in a cream-white jersey with “Ocasio” across the back and the number 64. Fans instantly wondered what the jersey symbolized and what it meant to him — and the answer was far more personal than anyone anticipated.


	“1964 is the year my uncle Cutito was born, my mother's brother,” he said in a statement shared with Rolling Stone. “The little I know about the NFL is thanks to him. He left for the United States at 17 to work and never returned to live in Puerto Rico, although he always visited us in late January or early February and stayed at our house. That was right in the middle of the NFL postseason, so I always watched the games with him. He was a huge fan of the San Francisco 49ers, the team whose home stadium is where this Super Bowl 60 took place, the one in which I performed. My uncle passed away two years ago, shortly after the 49ers lost to Kansas City in the 2024 Super Bowl. I always dreamed of taking my uncle to a Super Bowl and I couldn't. He left unexpectedly, without warning. So during my Super Bowl Halftime Show, I decided to have him on my shirt: OCASIO, his last name, the same as my mother's, and his birth year, 64. I dedicated my performance to him before it began. I'm sure he saw it, he was present and he felt proud of his nephew. Now all that's left is the day the 49ers win another Super Bowl.”


	The next stop in Bad Bunny's opening performance saw a table of abuelos playing dominoes, a beloved tradition often called Puerto Rico's unofficial national pastime. It's a game enjoyed by all generations, and Bad Bunny nods to this cherished activity in his Grammy-winning hit “DtMF” with the lyric: “Ey, hoy vo'a estar con abuelo to el día jugando dominó.”


	Benito passes by a nail salon table — where style and chisme (gossip) come together. “Vamo' a tirarno' un selfie, say ‘cheese', ey,” he sings. 


	As the superstar rounds a corner, he encounters female workers beside a stack of cinder blocks. With women being the sole focus in this scene, we'd like to think that this represented the rebuilding of Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria in 2018. This also highlights how women spearheaded the recovery efforts where FEMA fell short.


	The first moments of Bad Bunny's performance wouldn't be complete without a nod to piraguas —shaved ice treats drenched in sweet syrups, served up from colorful street carts. These icy delights are a staple of Puerto Rican culture, bringing refreshing joy to sweltering afternoons, and are tied to the island's street life and traditions.


	The Los Angeles taqueria, Villa's Tacos, also found itself on the world's biggest stage during Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show. The inclusion of the L.A. staple also carried some weight,  resonating with the immigrant and first-generation communities of the city. 


	Boxing holds a special place in Puerto Rican culture, arguably producing more world champions per capita. Legends like Félix “Tito” Trinidad, Miguel Cotto, Wilfredo Gómez and Wilfred Benítez have put Puerto Rico on the map, dominating their weight classes and earning global respect.


	Bad Bunny passes by a stand marked “Compro Oro y Plata” (I buy gold and silver) — a nod to the Caribbean's cultural ties to gold. From colonial times when gold was a driving force behind European exploitation, to modern-day street vendors and jewelers, gold has long held significance in Puerto Rico's identity. 


	As the superstar collects a gold ring, he passes it to a man who proposes to a woman. 


	Bad Bunny's halftime performance wouldn't be complete without La Casita, his portable replica of traditional Puerto Rican homes that honor the island's architectural charm and cultural roots. This now-iconic spot also served as an additional stage for Benito and the ultimate A-lister hub, featuring cameos from stars like Cardi B, Karol G, Young Miko, Pedro Pascal and Jessica Alba.


	If you were raised in a Latin household, Bad Bunny's gesture of waking up a young boy asleep on a row of party chairs during the wedding reception likely struck a chord. It's reminiscent of countless moments when my aunts or uncles would nudge me awake for a specific song or to join my cousins, even in the wee hours. 


	As El Conejo Malo transitioned between songs and scenes, plunging through his casita, brief samples of reggaetón classics like Tego Calderón's “Pa' Que Te Lo Gozen,” Don Omar's “Dale Don Dale,” and Daddy Yankee's “Gasolina” pulsed through the stadium. Then, Benito launched into his hard-hitting, Grammy-winning hit “EoO.” “This is the music of Puerto Rico,” he shouted in Spanish, sparking a full-blown reggaetón party and honoring the genre's rich cultural roots of the '00s.


	While violinists played the gripping intro to “Monaco,” Bad Bunny gave a powerful speech: “Mi nombre es Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, y si hoy estoy aquí en el Super Bowl 60, es porque nunca, nunca dejé de creer en mí. Tú también deberías de creer en ti. Vales más de lo que piensas. Confía en mí.” This translates to: “My name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, and if I'm here today at Super Bowl 60, it's because I never, ever stopped believing in myself. You should also believe in yourself. You're worth more than you think. Trust me.”


	In one scene, Benito stood atop a vintage 1968 Ford F-250. He may have chosen the classic American pickup truck as a nod to U.S. tradition, weaving it into the fabric of American cultural history.


	The Puerto Rican superstar now joins the ranks of past halftime performers who incorporated cars into their iconic sets. In 2021, The Weeknd opened his show with a modified 2002 Mercedes-Benz SLK 32 AMG, while Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg showcased vintage Chevrolet Impala lowriders in their 2022 performance. Last year, Kendrick Lamar brought personal meaning to the stage with a 1987 Buick GNX — his dad's car.


	Another show-stopping moment unfolded during Bad Bunny's halftime performance when a couple was legally married on stage, according to ESPN. The duo's story began with an early proposal during the set — see our gold & silver item — and by midway through the performance, the pair tied the knot surrounded by backup dancers and, of course, the electric energy of the crowd.


	The couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to attend their wedding, but Benito took it to another level, gifting them the ultimate honor of getting married during his historic halftime performance, mentions ESPN. 


	The next scene is Lady Gaga singing a salsafied version of “Die With a Smile” for the newlyweds, with a wedding cake display and all.


	After the wedding scene and Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny transitions into a new moment with “NuevaYol” — his love letter to Nuyorican culture. A replica of a barber shop and bodega called La Marqueta stands as the backdrop, embodying the soul of Puerto Rican life in New York.


	“Un shot de cañita en casa de Toñita y PR se siente cerquita,” he belts out, and none other than the beloved Toñita — owner of Brooklyn's Caribbean Social Club — makes an appearance, serving him a drink behind the bar. Known as one of the last surviving Puerto Rican social clubs in NYC, Toñita's Caribbean Social Club stands as a pillar of community, identity and cultural pride, a perfect centerpiece in Benito's celebration of Nuyorican life.


	One of the most touching moments from Bad Bunny's halftime show came when he handed a Grammy trophy to a young boy dressed to resemble a young Benito. Seconds prior, you see the kid watching a vintage '90s-era TV with his parents. The boy, portrayed by 5-year-old actor Lincoln Fox, wore a striped collared shirt and khaki shorts, channeling Bad Bunny's childhood style.


	Lincoln later shared the moment on his Instagram, captioning the clip, “I'll remember this day forever! @badbunnypr – it was my truest honor.” The 5-year-old actor, who is half-Argentinian according to his Instagram bio, became part of the show's symbolic gesture of hope, representing the idea that anyone can achieve their dreams.


	As the melody shifted, the electrifying rhythm of “El Apagón” (meaning The Blackout) took center stage, highlighting Puerto Rico's ongoing struggles with its power grid. In a striking visual, backup dancers climbed sparking electricity poles — and Bad Bunny later joined them as the lights flickered intermittently — amplifying the song's deeply political message.


	The song critiques the privatization of Puerto Rico's energy grid under LUMA Energy, which has led to widespread instability and frequent blackouts, and underscores the lingering impact of Hurricane Maria. Beyond unreliable electricity, the song also highlights the displacement of Puerto Rican residents, many of whom have been pushed out due to rising costs driven by predatory corporate interests.


	With sparks flying and lighting effects mimicking the island's blackouts, Bad Bunny used the highly watched halftime show to bring awareness to Puerto Rico's socioeconomic issues.


	Bad Bunny closed his Super Bowl halftime performance promoting togetherness — rather than division, like some political parties. As flags from every corner of the Americas, the artist declared:


	“God bless America… sea [be it] Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Perú, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Cuba, República Dominicana, Jamaica… United States, Canada, and my motherland, mi barrio, Puerto Rico, seguimo aquí [we're still here].””


	He celebrated the culmination of his performance with a literal football spike into the end zone. The ball read “Together, We Are America” and was followed by the closing message on the screen behind him: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.”

	Bad Bunny made history with a unique and unforgettable performance at the Super Bowl 2026 Halftime Show. The show featured high-profile guests like Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, a celebration of Puerto Rican culture, and special appearances by major stars such as Karol G, Cardi B and Pedro Pascal. It was full of iconic moments: a live wedding, the gifting of a Grammy, and a powerful inspirational message.


	Jessica Roiz: We've arrived at the Benito Bowl, I mean, the Super Bowl, from Levi's Stadium here in Santa Clara, California. And this is our halftime show recap show presented by Lexus. Never before had there been a halftime show like Bad Bunny's. Dressed in white, Benito brought the little house of Puerto Rico to California and started with his big hit, “Titi Me Preguntó.” Puerto Rican culture was well represented: Coco Fríos, dominoes, boxers, even a child asleep in a chair. He danced in a little house full of stars: Karol G, Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, and made time to send a direct message to the camera:


	Bad Bunny: It's because I never, I never stopped believing in myself! You should too. You should also believe in yourself. You're worth more than you think. Believe me.


	Jessica Roiz: The first surprise guest? Lady Gaga, performing a salsa version of her hit “Die With a Smile.” Another surprise? Ricky Martin, who sang “Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.” A couple got married, Bad Bunny climbed a light post, and as a symbolic gesture, he gave a Grammy to what might be his inner child. The fans' passion was palpable in the stadium and even backstage. A few days before, during the press conference, journalists showed their love and support. Bad Bunny reminded everyone, “I know I told everyone they had four months to learn Spanish, but it's better if you learn to dance.” Benito ended the halftime show with a powerful message of unity: “God bless America!” He also reminded us all to take more photos. What a historic moment in Latin music! I'm Jessica Roiz, and this was our recap of the Benito Bowl. As always, stay connected to Billboard. Bye!

Frontman Jim Adkins goes deep on the making of ""The Middle"" and working day jobs to pay for the album.

Jimmy Eat World will put fans in the middle of a big celebration this summer as the group tours to commemorate the 25th anniversary of its breakthrough and top-selling album, Bleed American.

	The Mesa, Arizona-formed alt-rock quartet hits the road June 9 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado for a lengthy trek celebrating its fourth album, Bleed American (full dates below). The 11-song set was the band's first top 40 effort on the Billboard 200, launching the Billboard Hot 100 top 5 hit “The Middle” and giving Jimmy Eat World headliner status. Bleed American has sold 1.7 million copies to date, according to Luminate.

	“It changed our lives,” frontman Jim Adkins, who co-founded the band in 1993, tells Billboard via Zoom from his home in Phoenix. “It put us on a map. It gave us a new, broad audience of people that found something in it that they connected with. People have grown up with this record, right alongside us growing up, and I feel like it's important to celebrate it. It's important to acknowledge to people that we appreciate that, despite the obvious commerce involved.”


	Adkins and his bandmates — guitarist Tom Linton, drummer Zach Lind and bassist Rick Burch — plan to play Bleed American in its entirety, but probably not sequentially, during the tour. Support acts on the outing include Sunny Day Real Estate, Rise Against, the Get Up Kids, Thrice, Girls Against Boys, Hey Mercedes, Motion City Soundtrack, Illuminati Hotties, Mom Jeans, Jay Som and Pup. The itinerary includes four Vans Warped Tour stops, three performances in the U.K. (its already sold-out Aug. 15 show in Cardiff Wales will be the band's biggest U.K. concert ever) and one in Mexico City. Jimmy Eat World will also perform at the Hello Summer Music Festival in Alberta, Canada, the Louder Than Life Festival in Kentucky and Shaky Knees in Atlanta, where it will not be performing Bleed American.












	The summer shows will rekindle plenty of memories for fans, and with the tour's announcement we drew on a few of Adkins' own remembrances from what was a dramatic time for the group.


	After two albums Capitol Records dropped Jimmy Eat World following 1999's Clarity. But Adkins maintains that the move, not entirely unexpected, did not level his band.


	“I could see how people would think, ‘Oh, their record label dropped them. What are they gonna do now?!'” he says. “That's not how it was, at all. Everything with the record label was happening in the background, and we were just focused on the next gig we were gonna do that night. And what we saw was every time we'd come back to a city we'd be playing a slightly bigger venue, or we'd be opening for a slightly bigger headlining act. We were building opportunities and we were getting to go to new places. We felt momentum. So all that stuff happening with the record label is just noise.”


	Capitol would, interestingly, try to re-sign the band after Bleed American was completed, but it inked instead with DreamWorks.


	Without the support of a label, Jimmy Eat World supported itself and funded the album with an independently released Singles compilation, by touring and by taking day jobs. “Tom and Rick worked at a temp agency,” Adkins recalls, “which is really convenient when you're going on tour all the time. So they would always have wacky stories about where they'd show up, sorting postal things or light industrial, bagel bakery things.” Lind worked for an auto dealership, while Adkins was at an art supply store.


	“I would give 'em plenty of notice when we had a tour coming up, and when we came back they would rehire me because I had so many skews memorized,” he says. “Those things are so scorched in my memory I can't get rid of them.”

	











	Mark Trombino, who produced Clarity and 1996's Static Prevails, also cut Jimmy Eat World a break to help make ends meet. “We were very fortunate that (Trombino) agreed to basically do it for free up front and just figure it out later,” Adkins says. “He believed in us and believed in the record we wanted to make, so he put his time and energy into building it with us.


	“To be honest, it didn't seem like a freaky or scary thing to do. It didn't seem like, ‘We're putting it all on this, and if it doesn't happen, oh well.' It wasn't like that. Whatever happened with it, we felt like we were just gonna keep (making music), no matter what.”


	Though the songs on Bleed American, which was recorded at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles and Harddrive in North Hollywood, were notably tighter and more focused than on preceding albums, Adkins says that Jimmy Eat World “didn't have an album in mind. There wasn't, like, a concept or goal we were trying to achieve.” Instead, he explains, the band and Trombino took “a song-by-song approach,” even using digital technologies “to make the best versions of those songs that we could.”


	“We made Bleed American to the best of our ability with what we knew about making records, with what we knew about writing songs, with our ability as physical players,” Adkins adds. “I feel like we did the absolute best we possibly could, given our knowledge and our ability. And we were proud of it, 'cause that's what you have to achieve as a musician, I feel. Is this rewarding? Are you proud of this? If so, put your name on it and send it forth and see what happens.”


	After Bleed American's title track reached No. 18 on Billboard's Alternative Airplay chart, its successor, “The Middle,” put the album and Jimmy Eat World on the map, hitting No. 1 on the same chart and No. 5 on the Hot 100. It was not the band's pick as the song most likely to succeed, however.

	











	“‘The Middle' came together really fast and felt at the time like a solid song,” Adkins remembers. “There was nothing wrong with it; I think when something arrives quickly and just feels right, that's that. Cool. There's something that feels maybe not as important as (a song) that's a creative puzzle that you spend a lot of time to solve. But when someone's listening to an album, they don't care about that. I don't know if we just underestimated (‘The Middle') or what. It's a solid song.”


Bleed American‘s “The Authority Song” makes direct reference to (then) John Cougar Mellencamp's “Authority Song” from his 1983 album Uh-Huh — as well as to the Jesus and Mary Chain's 1989 album Automatic. “That's another one that came together pretty quickly, maybe around the same time as ‘The Middle,' actually,” according to Adkins. “It really is a journal entry of being a kid in the Tempe area in the late ‘90s and trying to figure out life in the social circle and the insecurities that come with your early twenties and all that.”


	Adkins says Mellencamp has never acknowledged the shoutout, nor has Jimmy Eat World ever crossed paths with him.


	Rachel Haden from That Dog, which was on hiatus while Jimmy Eat World was recording Bleed American, provided backing vocals on five of the album's tracks. “I had met her through some mutual friends in the L.A. area,” Adkins recalls. “There were some vocal harmonies I really wanted to have a different character than just me or Tom cutting them; the That Dog material led me to her. She came in and it was like, ‘Oh wow, this really works. Do you have another hour you can hang out? I have this other thing I want you to try.' We wound up with her doing backups for most of the record, which was great.”

	











Bleed American was already a success when the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., took place, which led to copies issued from December 2001 on being titled simply Jimmy Eat World, while the title track was changed to “Salt Sweat Sugar.”


	“The whole word was shaken, and we had no idea what was going to happen,” Adkins says. “We were very proud of our album. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 we felt like people should make their mind up about our music based on just that. We worked too hard on this to have something (like the title) get in the way of people having that experience for themselves. And the solution we came to was turning the album into self-titled.


	“It was sort of a punk rock thing to do back then. Album titles? Whatever…We felt like it might be slightly subversive, just calling it what it is. It's our name.”


	The Bleed American title was reinstated for a deluxe edition of the album in 2008, which featured a second disc of unreleased live and studio material, demos and covers of songs by Wham!, Guided By Voices and the Wedding Present.

The Tennessee lawmaker cited sexual content that would be ""readily apparent across any language barrier,"" despite Benito not singing his most controversial lyrics.

	Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles lashed out at Bad Bunny‘s history-making Super Bowl LX halftime show on Monday (Feb. 9), calling the singer's record-setting performance “pure smut, brazenly aired on national television for every American family to witness.” The conservative congressman wrote, that “children were forced to endure explicit displays of gay sexual acts, women gyrating provocatively, and Bad Bunny shamelessly grabbing his crotch while dry-humping the air.”

	The shocked response to what has been reported as the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history, with more than 135 million people tuning in, has drawn ire from a number of conservative voices, including Donald Trump. In a counterpoint to Benito's set, which carried a message of unity, love, respect and togetherness, Trump called the halftime show “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER,” while condemning it as “an affront to the Greatness of America.” 


	In his post, Ogles claimed that Benito's set “openly glorified sodomy and countless other unspeakable depravities,” saying that such “flagrant, indecent acts are illegal to be displayed on public airways.” Because of his upset, Ogles said he is requesting that the Energy and Commerce Committee launch a formal congressional inquiry into the NFL and NBC for what he described as “their prior knowledge, deliberate approval and facilitation of this indecent broadcast.”

	











	At press time spokespeople for NBC and the NFL had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment on Ogles' post. 


	Ogles' letter to the House committee referenced the lyrics to two songs in Benito's set, which was the first-ever performed almost entirely in Spanish, “Safaera” and “Yo Perreo Sola,” which he said included sexual content that would be “readily apparent across any language barrier.” Although the Puerto Rican superstar did perform part of both songs — whose recorded versions do include explicit sexual lyrics — he skipped the most controversial lines during the halftime set.


	Ogles added, “these flagrant, indecent acts are illegal to be displayed on public airways. American culture will not be mocked or corrupted without consequence.”


	In addition, a fellow Republican congressman, Florida Rep. Randy Fine, wrote on X on Monday that Benito's “disgusting halftime show was illegal.” He also mused that “had he said these lyrics,” in reference to the original, NSFW lyrics to both in their recorded versions that were not sung, “and all of the other disgusting and pornographic filth in English on live TV, the broadcast would have been pulled down and the fines would have been enormous.” 


	Given the tremendous pushback from some in the MAGAverse who attempted to other Bad Bunny by claiming he was not American — despite Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory and its citizens being American citizens — Fine wrote “Puerto Ricans are Americans and we all live by the same rules,” ending his note with a familiar MAGA refrain: “lock them up.” 


	Conversely, at the MAGA-approved conservative Christian organization Turning Point USA counterprogramming livestream featuring friend of Trump Kid Rock found the rapper-turned-rocker-turned country crooner singing about “topless dancers,” crackheads, his “heroes in the Methadone clinics,” the “bastards at the IRS” and “crooked cops,” in addition to lines about taking shots of Jack and “caps of meth,” as well as “hookers all trickin' out in Hollywood” during his performance of his breakthrough 1999 single “Bawitdaba.”

Wednesday, Beach Bunny and more acts have already left, or are threatening to leave, the agency over Casey Wasserman's relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.


													By
												

	Chris Eggertsen



	In the wake of Best Coast singer Bethany Cosentino's public demand for Casey Wasserman to step down as CEO of his powerful Wasserman agency over his association with convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, more of the agency's artists have begun calling for accountability.


	Over the past few days, a handful of prominent indie acts, including Water From Your Eyes, Wednesday, Beach Bunny and Dropkick Murphys, have followed Cosentino's lead in speaking out against Wasserman in various ways, including by calling on him to resign — with some threatening to depart the agency if he doesn't do so first, and at least one act noting that they already have. (Notably, as of Monday evening, Feb. 9, Wasserman had scrubbed its client list from its website.)


	Cosentino's post arrived after a tranche of more than 3 million files related to the Epstein investigation was released by the Department of Justice on Jan. 30. In those files, Wasserman, who launched his agency in 1998, was found to have exchanged dozens of friendly, flirtatious and occasionally sexually-charged emails with Maxwell, now serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking, in 2003. Previously known were Wasserman's ties to Epstein himself: More than two decades ago, several years before Epstein's crimes were known to the public, New York reported that Wasserman and his then-wife, Laura Ziffren, flew on Epstein's plane on an AIDS fact-finding mission to Africa in 2002 — a trip that also included such luminaries as President Bill Clinton and actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey.


	“I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,” Wasserman, who is also chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, said in a statement on Thursday (Feb. 5). “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”


	Wasserman's apology has apparently rung hollow for several of the agency's artists. Over the weekend, long-running Irish-American rockers Dropkick Murphys (Ken Casey, Matt Kelly, James Lynch, Tim Brennan, Jeff DaRosa, Kevin Rheault and Campbell Webster) announced via a now-inactive Instagram Stories post (confirmed to be legitimate by a spokesperson for the band) that the group had already “parted ways with” the Wasserman agency over the issue. “It saddens us to part ways with [our agents], but the namesake of the agency is in the Epstein files so…we GONE,” the band wrote in the post, for which screengrabs are available online.


	On Monday (Feb. 9), more artists followed. Rachel Brown, vocalist of indie pop duo Water From Your Eyes (which also includes Nate Amos), stated on Instagram that Wasserman's “‘deepest regrets' and PR apologies mean nothing in the wake of violence against women and children caused by Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their accomplices. There must be accountability for the atrocities committed by the ruling class. We cannot live in a world that allows for this injustice to occur with no consequence.


	“Nate, myself and our manager Nik have no interest in being affiliated with Casey Wasserman and have absolutely zero intention of condoning his actions by silently remaining under his namesake banner,” Brown continued. “We trust our booking agents and are waiting to understand what our options are.”


	Also on Monday, rock band Wednesday made a point of acknowledging the “decent and trustworthy people” they work with at the agency, “with whom we've worked for several years dating back to a time prior to their connection with Wasserman,” before noting that the band intends “to begin the process of extracting ourselves from” the agency. “Continuing to be represented by a company led by and named after Casey Wasserman goes against our values and cannot continue,” the band continued in the Instagram post. “For the sake of his staff we hope that he steps down from the company and it is rebranded, but until that happens or we find a new home at a new agency we will not continue to be associated with Wasserman.”


	In its own Instagram post on Monday, Chicago rock band Beach Bunny — composed of Lili Trifilio, Jon Alvarado and Anthony Vaccaro — wrote that the group is “hugely disappointed and disgusted” to learn of Wasserman's association with Maxwell, adding that his “actions are abhorrent and disturbing on every level” and that he must “remove himself and his name from the agency.”


	A lengthier and more nuanced take on the situation came from Alexis Kruass of the Brooklyn duo Sleigh Bells, who argued that the band's “ability to make a living in this industry is dependent on our engagement with” companies including Wasserman, Spotify and Live Nation — and that cutting ties with them would only hurt the group financially without moving the needle.


	“Would I love to just leave Wasserman Music? Yes I would. Can we? No because I love and respect our agent and I trust him to make the decision that is best for himself, his family and his artists,” Krauss wrote. “The agents at Wasserman are not the villains.”


	“Call me spineless but this my truth,” Krauss continued. “This is the hypocrisy of our realities as we try to do the least harm in an unscrupulous system. Could I do more to hold these individuals and corporations accountable? Absolutely. Do I have the capacity to? No I don't.”


	“In my opinion it's not the responsibility of the artists, especially those struggling to make a living, to fix these broken systems,” Krauss added. “I'm not saying we're powerless, but without systemic change and accountability for those at the highest levels of power, no meaningful change is going to occur. … None of these corporations are going to bat an eye if Sleigh Bells bails on them. It'll just leave us losing more money on tour and making less streaming income than we do now. It's a s–tty place to be but it's the truth. What we need is greater regulation and accountability at the highest levels of the industry.”


	A Wasserman representative did not respond to a request for comment by press time.


This story was updated on Feb. 9 at 9:16 p.m. ET to remove Al Barr and add Campbell Webster to the list of Dropkick Murphys band members.

Co-Business Editor


Paramount has enhanced its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, not formally upping its $30-a-share cash bid, but injecting a new $0.25 per share so-called “ticking fee” payable to WBD shareholders for each quarter its transaction has not closed beyond December 31, 2026.


	It said the move comes to about $650 million in cash value each quarter and underscores “Paramount's confidence in the speed and certainty of regulatory approval for its transaction.” It also agreed to fund a $2.8 billion termination fee that would be payable to Netflix and ticked off a series of concessions around WBD's debt financing costs and obligations.

	











	Warner Bros. Discovery has a deal to sell its studios and streaming assets to Netflix and advised shareholders several times to reject a hostile takeover offer from David Ellison‘s company, which is looking to acquire all of WBD. There's a full-out PR battle raging as executives of all three court content creators, unions, Warner shareholders, politicians and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. The giant streamer late last month upgraded its offer of $27.75 a share from cash-and-stock to all cash.




			Watch on Deadline		







	WBD has yet to set a date for a special meeting in April where shareholders will vote on the Netflix transaction. It's been urging them to cast a yes vote. Paramount is aggressively lobbying them to vote no and, meanwhile, to tender their WBD shares to Paramount. The Ellisons have said they are planning to run an alternate slate of directors for election at WBD's annual meeting, which comes later.

	











	Both deals are expected to have long lead times to close. Netflix is not buying the cable assets and its agreement would see WBD spin off linear television into a separate public company called Discovery Global.


	Paramount is ramping up the pressure with its announcement today. The $2.8 billion termination fee that would be due to Netflix if WBD switches sides has, for instance, has been an objection raised by the Warner board.


	Paramount's other new commitments include eliminating WBD's potential $1.5 billion financing cost by fully backstopping an exchange offer that relieves WBD of its contractual bondholder obligations. Par said it will fully reimburse WBD's shareholders for the $1.5 billion fee without reducing a separate $5.8 billion termination fee. That's the amount Paramount (and Netflix) have agreed to pay WBD if an acquisition fails to close. 


	Also, if WBD's financing sources will not extend the maturity of WBD's existing $15 billion bridge loan, Paramount said its own debt financing sources “are fully prepared to do so, with any incremental costs covered by Paramount. Alternatively, Paramount will permit WBD to structure permanent financing in any way it chooses so long as the debt is redeemable at a commercially reasonable cost.”


	Paramount said it will provide WBD flexibility between signing and closing, including by matching any comparable Netflix interim operating covenants. It said it “is open to discussing with the WBD Board of Directors contractual solutions to account for the possibility of continuing deteriorating financial performance beyond what WBD is currently projecting for its linear network business.” 


	Paramount's amended offer is now fully financed by an increased $43.6 billion of equity commitments from the Ellison Family and RedBird Capital Partners and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup and Apollo.


	Financing includes “an irrevocable personal guarantee” from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison of $43.3 billion covering the equity financing as well any damages claims against Paramount.


	“While we have tried to be as constructive as possible in formulating these solutions, several of these items would benefit from collaborative discussion to finalize. If granted a short window of engagement, we will work with you to refine these solutions to ensure they address any and all of your concerns,” David Ellison wrote in a letter to the WBD board released publicly and in an SEC filing today.


	Paramount claims the WBD board has consistently refused to engage with it over the course of multiple offers, which Warner has denied.

No is a complete sentence.

Seriously, why all the dancing, if you want it put some proper money on the table and buy it. Take a s*** or get off the pot.

Both should be rejected. 

Zaslav is so greedy to consolidate the studios for his own personal gain.

This is so embarrassing.

Why? If Paramount has the best offer on the table, WBD is legally obligated to take it.

They don't have the better deal. Claiming you do is not the same as actually having it. The Netflix deal is still superior. This is the 9th time they've cried fowl without making it better. It's pathetic.

Paramount is like the emotionally draining ex boyfriend who thinks a haircut and new clothes will win the woman back. Nope!

	There has been competition for this one, because of the cast, and also the work of New Queer Cinema pioneer filmmaker Araki. These acquisitions will continue to fall into place as the Sundance Film Festival prepares for next year's move that will bid farewell to Park City, and hello to Boulder, Colorado.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


Chappell Roan has left Casey Wasserman‘s music agency over the LA28 chief's recently revealed connection to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.


	“No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values,” the “Pink Pony Club” superstar posted online today. “I refuse to passively stand by.” 


	The exit of the Kiely Mosiman, Jackie Nalpant and Anna Bewers-represented Roan is the biggest and perhaps harshest blow against the increasingly besieged grandson of legendary agent Lew Wasserman. Contacted by Deadline, reps for Wasserman, who has been in Italy for the Olympic Winter Games, had no comment on Roan's bombshell.

	A client at Wasserman's Providence Equity Partners backed agency since 2023, Roan's action follows fellow artists like Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, plus bands Beach Bunny and Wednesday walking away from the joint in the past few days. The decision by Roan a.k.a. Kayleigh Rose Amstutz represents the supreme A-lister move since Billie Eilish left Wasserman in 2024 when a previous sex scandal swirled around the executive.




			Watch on Deadline		







	When Wasserman's name came up in Epstein Files last month, the exec put out a statement that clearly hoped to see the whole matter go away:  “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,” said Wasserman. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”

	











	The expression of contrition didn't make the toxicity of Epstein go away for Wasserman. 


	Adding to Wasserman's woes, a series of Los Angeles politicians, including newly minted mayoral candidate and two-term City Council member Nithya Raman, have called the 2028 Olympics chair a growing “distraction” to the Games and the City of Angels.


	Fearing financial and political retribution from Wasserman's buddy Donald Trump, reelection-seeking Mayor Karen Bass sidestepped a POV on the LA28 chair and put it all on the LA28 board and Olympics leaders. Last week, as Wasserman's seemingly adulterous 2003 correspondence with the convicted and incarcerated Maxwell came out, IOC president Kirsty Coventry dismissed the Epstein information about Wasserman as no big deal. As concerns not just about the Epstein connection but also the cost of the 2028 Games grow, the LA28 board, which includes the likes of Jeffrey Katzenberg, Jessica Alba, and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has said nothing publicly so far.


	What is becoming louder and louder, even more now after Roan's post, is an uprising over Wasserman's repeated presence in the DOJ-dumped Epstein files occurring among some of his top employees. Power players such as Marty Diamond and Duffy McSwiggin have reached out to a number of companies and agencies around town in the past few days.


	The Wasserman agents have been pitching potentially interested parties in either taking on them and their clients, buying up Wasserman's music biz or financing the agents purchasing the company from Wasserman himself. So far, no one has taken up the crew on any of the options, I hear. However, a well-placed source tonight acknowledged, “It all changes now [that] Chappell has left Casey.”


	“This is always how it ends,” the source remarked on Wasserman's rise to Tinseltown prominence out of his family's shadow and his Olympic dreams. “It's a matter of time; the bleeding won't stop.”

He wrote an email over 20 years ago, LONG before any criminal wrongdoing was alleged. So what.

Any serious connection to the world's foremost child sex trafficker should raise eyebrows right?

IOC president Kirsty Coventry dismissed the Epstein information about Wasserman as “no big deal”.

 Right… just look away… look away.

He wrote an email?  2003?  23 years ago?  Who cares and who the hell is Chappell to render any moral judgement on anyone?

Apparently, Chappell Roan cares.

She is the one in a position to choose her representation for whatever reason she sees fit.

I hope this clarified things for you.

Well said.  Sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out.

Way to go!

					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


Jon Stewart was a heat-seeking missile tonight on The Daily Show with a target set on MAGA‘s “pathetic” meltdown over Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show performance.


	Beginning with the big game itself, he drew early laughs with: “Man, if you like high-scoring contests where the outcome is in doubt till the final suspenseful climactic seconds, this was not the game for you. Slow. Grinding. It nearly took all the fun out of watching the Patriots lose.” 


	But, at least there was the halftime show, where “Mr. Bunny killed it.” The host added, “It was joyful and infectious and— oh, oh, right, right, I forgot, I forgot: For a significant portion of Americans, everything that happens must uniformly be filtered through a particular MAGA-centric worldview and judged on how well it conforms to that traditional vision, which doesn't including knowing where the biblioteca is.”

	With his signature acerbic wit, the comic began sarcastically, “Is it too much to ask for a halftime show that this great nation can enjoy in its mother tongue? It's why the good people at TPUSA went through the trouble of putting on an alternative All-American halftime show that celebrated this beautiful country in the King's English we all share.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	At this point, the screen played a baffling and chaotic moment from Kid Rock's poorly lip-synced and largely incoherent performance at the Turning Point USA show, where the close captioning included lines like “Bawitaba da-bang da-bang diggy-diggy-diggy.” Feigning relief, Stewart exclaimed, “Thank you! Merriam and Webster couldn't have put it better themselves, regarding the up jumping of said boogie insofar as the diggy diggy diggy being a da-bang da-bang.”

	











	Moreover, Stewart questioned, “Why the fuck is it the Super Bowl halftime entertainer's job to unify the country? In what world is that their job? Isn't there another person whose job description is much more along those lines?”


	Elsewhere, the two-dozen Emmy winner slammed Republicans' defense of President Donald Trump‘s posting of a racist video depicting the Obamas as apes. Playing a clip of Sean Spicer defending the video as not racist but rather one that “ended with a racist thing,” Stewart responded, with an exaggerated flair of his arms, “If you say the N-word at the end of the sentence, it still ruins the whole sentence. There are certain things in this world where placement is less important than presence. ‘Oh, I don't have gonorrhea, the tip of my penis has gonorrhea. You're going to judge my entire penis by the gonorrheic tip? Who's the racist now?'”


	In a night full of loud cheers of agreement from the audience, Stewart saved the best for last; his concluding speech was interrupted by premature applause: “For all of MAGA's triumphalism, it's not a movement that seems confident in its position. These people, who control every branch of government, are so triggered by someone singing in Spanish for 20 minutes, they need to create their own safe space alternative halftime show, where Trad Bunny over here is singing songs about how he can't even enjoy sitting in a truck and drinking beer because he knows that somewhere, out there, there's a trans person. It's actually fucking pathetic, the gap between the power you all wield — I'm not done! — and the victimhood you all claim is the real offense.”


	And what does one serve at a “weak and pathetic pity party?” Why yogurt of course, he quipped, harking back to an earlier extended bit deriding RFK's alimentary choices (of “meat and ferments”).

MAGA – Making America Gutless Again.

I think after six years of RnB and hip hop, the next year with some real, proper, traditional American rock and country music for the heartland.

I suggest a halftime show of Bruce Springsteen, Steve Earle and The (Dixie) Chicks. I'm sure that would satisfy the president and the Maga pundits.

Oh, they don't like Springsteen! Of course, to me, that's all the more reason to book him.

MAGA are such snowflakes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","See Bethenny Frankel's original — and deleted — take on Bad Bunny's Super Bowl 2026 halftime show","https://pagesix.com/2026/02/10/entertainment/bethenny-frankel-deletes-original-take-on-bad-bunnys-super-bowl-2026-halftime-show/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:14:00 GMT","

Bethenny Frankel is backpedaling.

Bravo fans are calling out the “Real Housewives of New York City” alum for deleting her original take on Bad Bunny's Super Bowl 2026 halftime show.

An X user resurfaced the footage, claiming the former reality star led the TikTok upload by declaring she couldn't “wait to get canceled for this.”

Frankel, 55, went on to ask, “Should these entertainment vehicles — the Grammys, the Emmys, the Oscars, the Super Bowl — should this be the place for personal, cultural, political views to be expressed?

“Certainly there are major world events that take place, whether COVID or tragedies, 9/11, and it's unavoidable that it's discussed, but where is the line?” she continued. 

The ex-Bravolebrity went on to compare Bad Bunny's performance to “Dave Chapelle expressing” transphobic views onstage in 2021, Richard Gere “getting into trouble” in the past and Billie Eilish recently blasting ICE in her Grammys 2026 acceptance speech.

“Where is the line?” Frankel asked again, pointing out that Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos aren't “allowed to express any opinions about anything going on” during “Live With Kelly and Mark.”

She concluded, “That show … they can barely discuss anything going on. It's an entertainment vehicle, and they keep it that way.”

When Frankel took the video down and shared another — this time applauding Bad Bunny for using his right to “express [him]self,” her followers called her out.

One claimed the Skinnygirl creator had “changed [her] tune.”

Another wrote, “That's right. You better walk it back quick,” while a third added, “Nahh put your original video back up.”

The second upload has now also been deleted.

A source tells Page Six, however, that Frankel “love[d] the show” and “often shares her thoughts in real time, so her content is always evolving during pop-culture moments like this.”

Other “Housewives,” including Taylor Armstrong of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” took aim at the Grammy winner's show on Sunday.

“I am embarrassed for the NFL and Apple for the Super Bowl halftime show totally in Spanish with a Cuban flag!!” the 54-year-old told her Instagram followers over the weekend.

Lewis Hamilton got a seal of approval from Kim Kardashian's sisters during a recent hang out. 

On Monday, the Skims co-founder uploaded a video on Instagram of herself and her sisters Khloé Kardashian, 41, and Kylie Jenner, 28, attempting to complete the popular “Titanic Challenge.”

For the viral trend, one person lies on their back and rolls up on their partner's thighs or hips, mimicking the iconic “I'm flying” scene from the 1997 “Titanic” movie that starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

“We're trying some tricks tonight,” the Kylie Cosmetics founder said at the beginning of the video before showing a couple successfully completing the challenge on their phone.

Both Kim and Jenner hilariously attempted to flip up onto Khloé's thighs but ultimately neither of them could come to the straight pose.

Other people laughed the siblings on in the background, including one voice that appeared to belong to Hamilton.

“Push away,” the F1 racing driver, 41, said in the clip.

Fans took to the comments section of Kim's post to share that they also heard Hamilton's voice.

“Am I the only one who can hear lewis's laugh?” wrote one user.

“We all heard Lewis Hamilton's voice in the background right?” added another.

“Lewis laughing in the background,” said a third netizen.

“Lewis we hear you,” commented a fourth person.

The family gathering with Hamilton came one day after he and Kim, 45, hard-launched their romance at Super Bowl 2026.

During the big game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday, the athlete and the reality star sat next to each other in a VIP box at the big game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.

Kim's sister and Hamilton's rumored ex, Kendall Jenner, and couple Hailey and Justin Bieber were also present in the suite.

According to a lip reader, the British racing driver chatted with Kim about possibly meeting his mom, Carmen Larbalestier.

Though Kim and Hamilton have been friends for years, they recently took their relationship to the next level with a romantic European excursion earlier this month.

The duo enjoyed intimate time together in London and Paris.

Hamilton has been linked to several A-list women, including Rihanna, Nicole Scherzinger, Gigi Hadid and even Kardashian's younger sister Kendall Jenner. 

Kim, on the other hand, was married to her third husband, Kanye West, from 2014 to 2022. The “Kardashians” star and the rapper, 48, share four children together.

Chappell Roan has left her talent agency after its founder, Casey Wasserman, was named in the Epstein files.

“As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,” the “Pink Pony Club” singer, 27, wrote on her Instagram Stories Monday.

“I hold my teams to the highest standards and have a duty to protect them as well. No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values,” she continued. “I have deep respect and appreciation for the agents and staff who work tirelessly for their artists and I refuse to passively stand by.”

The Grammy winner added, “Artists deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity. This decision reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust.”

Page Six has reached out to the Wasserman Group for comment.

The Wasserman Group is a talent agency that represents powerhouse clients like Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, Kasey Musgraves, Lorde and Pharrell.

The company's client roster list has been taken down from its website amid the news.

Like Roan, indie rock groups Wednesday, Beach Bunny and Water From Your Eye have cut ties with the agency and called for Wasserman, 51, to step down from the company he's run since 2002.

“We are demanding for Wasserman to remove himself and his name from the agency,” Beach Bunny  wrote on social media Sunday. “Continuing to be represented by a company led by and named after Casey Wasserman goes against our values and cannot continue.”

Wasserman has also been called on to resign as Chairman and President of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games by three Los Angeles City Council members, LA County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath and state Senator Lena Gonzalez, according to the Los Angeles Times.

“LA28 has lauded the likelihood of having more women participate in the Olympic and Paralympic Games than ever before in history,” Horvath told the outlet. “What does that mean when the organization is led by an intimate friend of a convicted human trafficker? Now is the time for LA28 to demonstrate how much they truly value women.”

The more than three million Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on Jan. 30 include email correspondence between Wasserman and Jeffrey Epstein's right-hand woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving 20 years for sex trafficking.

Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing.

According to the BBC, Wasserman wrote to Maxwell in 2003: “I think of you all the time… So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?”

In another email, Maxwell offered Wasserman a massage that could “drive a man wild.”

In a statement to the New York Times on Sunday, Wasserman apologized for his association with Maxwell, 64, and Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.

“I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell, which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,” the CEO said. 

“I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane.”

He added, “I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”

Alix Earle clapped back at haters claiming she didn't “deserve” to be included in Bad Bunny's Super Bowl 2026 halftime show.

When the influencer posted a behind-the-scenes look on Monday of her time “in the casita” on San Francisco's Levi's Stadium field, her TikTok followers railed against her cameo.

“You've never once used your platform and voice for the messages Bad Bunny sends,” one commented. “This is unbelievable and undeserved.”

Earle, per Us Weekly, replied, “I have 💗 and being invited to do this was such an incredible experience and so special.”

Earle's rep has yet to respond to Page Six's request for comment.

As for her connection to Bad Bunny, the duo were both in “Happy Gilmore 2.”

Additionally, they both know David Grutman, the producer for her upcoming reality show and the co-owner of Bad Bunny's Gekko restaurant in Miami.

Grutman was spotted near Earle during Sunday's show — and he opened up to Page Six on Monday about Bad Bunny's decision to feature the “face of Gen Z.”

He explained, “[Bad Bunny] wanted to be inclusive of all. … Especially for the casita. He wanted to show a little bit of everything. And I think having her be the face of Gen Z and so much of America, I just think it's a great thing.”

Jessica Alba, Cardi B and Pedro Pascal were among the other A-listers included.

Among the negative comments, some of Earle's followers raved over her making “it to the Super Bowl before Braxton [Berrios].”

The “Dancing With the Stars” alum, notably, dated the Houston Texans player, 30, for two years.

The pair split in December 2025, with Earle later blaming their breakup on the “guilt” she felt over not being “there for him 24/7 and support[ing] him.”

She has since been linked to Tom Brady, first making headlines with the NFL legend, 48, at a New Year's Eve party in St. Barts.

They cozied up again at a star-studded Super Bowl LX bash on Saturday, and People revealed their relationship status on Monday. 

Earle and Brady are reportedly “hooking up.”

After a week of unclear reports, the L.A. County Department of Public Health released Catherine O'Hara‘s death certificate earlier today, per TMZ, citing a pulmonary embolism as the immediate cause of death, with rectal cancer as the underlying cause. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks blood flow to an artery in the lungs, according to the Mayo Clinic. O'Hara was under the care of an oncologist for cancer since March 2025, AP reports, with her last appointment occurring on January 27. On January 30, the L.A. Fire Department reported that O'Hara had been rushed to the hospital that morning in serious condition and was reportedly having trouble breathing. O'Hara died later that day, with outlets previously reporting that she died from “a brief illness.” Her cause of death went unreported until today. She was 71. 

O'Hara, a beloved comedic actress, was a standout on film and TV projects for decades, with memorable turns in Home Alone, Beetlejuice, Schitt's Creek, A Mighty Wind, and, most recently, The Studio.

Chappell Roan has dropped her talent agency, Wasserman, citing a misalignment in values with the firm founded and led by Casey Wasserman, whose communications with notorious child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell were made public in the recent Epstein files release. “I hold my team to the highest standards and have a duty to protect them as well,” Roan wrote on Instagram Stories. “No artists, agent, or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook the actions that conflict so deeply with their own moral values.” Though Wasserman “deeply regrets” his previous correspondence with the world's most infamous pedophiles, the CEO and sports agent is receiving some of the most, and perhaps only, backlash over Epstein ties. 

“I have deep respect and appreciation for the agents and staff who work tirelessly for their artists, and I refuse to passively stand by,” Roan continues. “Artists deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity. This decision reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust.” 

Wasserman's 2003 email correspondence with Maxwell was revealed in the Department of Justice's January 30 information dump of Epstein materials. The messages include Wasserman flirting with Maxwell, who tells him she could offer him a massage that can “drive a man wild.” Flight records also place Wasserman on Epstein's plane, and a photograph of Wasserman with Maxwell and Epstein was made public in the latest release. 

“I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,” Wassermaan said in a statement. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”

Roan joins others in the music world in pressuring the agency to remove its CEO over his ties to Epstein. Last week, Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, who has been represented by Wasserman Music since 2021, called on Wasserman to resign, amounting to more accountability than pretty much anyone else in Epstein's newly published orbit, which includes Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Woody Allen, Steve Bannon, Larry Summers, and Peter Thiel. “Ghislaine Maxwell is not a neutral character in a messy story—she is a convicted sex trafficker who helped facilitate the abuse of minors,” Cosentino wrote. “I did not consent to having my name or my career tied to someone with this kind of association to exploitation.” 

Yesterday, The Wrap reported that a group of music agents, including those who represent Joni Mitchell, OK Go, and Coldplay, called upon Wasserman to resign. Other artists have also announced upcoming departures from the agency. Also worth noting: Billie Eilish fired the agency in 2024 after The Daily Mail broke the news of Wasserman's history of sleeping with female employees. Wasserman is also the chair of the LA28 Olympic Committee, and his inclusion in the Epstein files has prompted calls for his resignation from local officials.

A source close to the Guthrie family is disputing earlier reports about how Nancy Guthrie was discovered missing on February 1.

Initial reports indicated that Savannah Guthrie's mother was scheduled to attend an in-person church service in Tucson on Sunday morning, but she never arrived, prompting the family to report her missing. Now, an insider is claiming the account is inaccurate, per Fox News.

According to the source, Nancy and a small group of friends regularly gathered at one another's homes on Sundays to watch a New York–based church service via livestream — a routine that began during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The source maintained that on Sunday, February 1, Nancy was expected to be at a friend's house to watch the livestream, as she did each week. However, when she failed to show up, Nancy's friends reportedly became concerned and contacted Annie Guthrie.

The insider told Fox News that Nancy was never scheduled to attend the Tucson church service that day, contrary to earlier reports, adding that the misunderstanding has led to confusion about the events leading up to when she was first reported missing.

Meanwhile, parishioners at the church where Nancy has been a congregant for years were asked to pray for the missing 84-year-old as the search enters its second week.

St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church pastor John Tittle led a prayer early in the service as he expressed the congregation's support for the Guthrie family.

“We are seeking to just honor the family's privacy and their desires,” Tittle said (via NBC). “It was communicated to me, ‘pray.' We're going to keep praying through this horrific ordeal.”

On Monday, Savannah made another emotional plea, describing the situation as an “hour of desperation.”

“We believe our mom is still out there and we need your help,” Savannah said in a video posted to Instagram. “Law enforcement is working tirelessly, around the clock, trying to bring her home, trying to find her. She was taken, and we don't know where. We are at an hour of desperation. And we need your help.”

Over the weekend, Savannah and her siblings responded to a ransom message, saying they will pay the $6 million demand for Nancy's safe return.

The alleged note already passed its second deadline, Monday, 5 p.m, without any proof of life.

TMZ reported that as of Monday morning, the bitcoin account connected to the ransom demand has no recorded transactions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Savannah Guthrie's Brother-in-Law Tommaso Cioni Hasn't Been Seen in 'Almost a Week': REPORT","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/tommaso-cioni-last-seen-week-nancy-guthrie/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:50:04 GMT","

Tommaso Cioni, the husband of Savannah Guthrie's sister, Annie Guthrie, was rumored to be a possible suspect in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie. While Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has since made it clear that “no suspects” have been identified in the case, Cioni seems to be keeping a low profile.

“He hasn't been seen since I think it was Tuesday of last week. We got some photos of him outside the house here. He's very recognizable with his big beard. He was outside with his wife, Savannah's sister Annie. They were in the car together,” reporter Brian Entin, who has been on the ground in Tucson, Arizona, told Megyn Kelly on Monday, February 9. “But it's been, it's now been almost a week.”

Ashleigh Banfield, the former host of News Nation's “Banfield,” claimed on February 4 that a “highly regarded” law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation informed her that Cioni “may be the prime suspect” in this case.

Shortly after Banfield's report, however, Nanos took to social media to reveal, “At this point, investigators have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case.”

“Detectives are working closely with the Guthrie family,” he explained at the time.

On Saturday, February 7, New York Post released a report stating law enforcement requested surveillance footage from a Circle K on Oracle Road in Tucson after “receiving a tip involving a vehicle of interest.”

Entin, in his conversation with Kelly, confirmed that the location of the Circle K is “right around the corner” from Annie and Tommaso's home.

“It's not close to Nancy's house,” he told Kelly on Monday. “It's right around the corner from Annie's house. And where it's positioned is where you would have to drive to go from Nancy's house to Annie's house.”

Cioni—who is married to Nancy's eldest daughter—is believed to be one of the last people to have seen the 84-year-old before her disappearance. 

While not much is known about Cioni, the couple reportedly resides near Nancy in Tucson, Arizona.

The Italian native works as a teacher at a charter school in Tucson, according to a LinkedIn profile attributed to Cioni. Cioni also plays bass for a local band called Early Black.

“My husband Tommaso Cioni is my greatest teacher. He is a great manifester; he writes poetry with his lifestyle,” Annie gushed in a May 2013 interview. “I was trained as a reader. My family was book-centered. In junior high I always hid in the library at lunch time to avoid the other kids. I think writing is just what young readers begin to do. There was never a decision. My Mom always made us keep diaries.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Inside Catherine O'Hara's Final Months: A Quiet, Courageous Battle With Cancer","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/catherine-ohara-battle-with-cancer/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:37:38 GMT","

Days after the passing of comedy legend Catherine O'Hara, new details have emerged about the illness she kept largely out of public view. 

As per TMZ, her death certificate now confirms that the beloved actress died after suffering a pulmonary embolism, while also revealing that she had been privately battling cancer.

According to the death certificate from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office, obtained by TMZ, her primary cause of death was a pulmonary embolism. This clot prevents blood from flowing to an artery in the lungs. Rectal cancer is listed as an underlying cause.

It remains unclear how long she had been living with cancer. 

Following her death on Jan. 30 at age 71, her representatives said only that she died “after a brief illness,” declining to provide further details.

As news of her death continues to settle, friends have begun to speak quietly about her final weeks. A Daily Mail report had earlier stated that her passing left many in “complete shock,” with those close to her saying she kept her illness largely private.

Despite her declining health, friends said she remained gracious and discreet in public. She moved through familiar spaces with the same warmth that defined her throughout her life. Few realized how much she was struggling.

According to one source, she was seen at SUR Restaurant in West Hollywood on Jan. 13, just weeks before her death. The venue, owned by Lisa Vanderpump, was hosting an event for Supermodels Unlimited magazine.

Despite the high-profile setting, she kept a low profile and avoided photos or attention.

“She was in great spirits,” the source added.

“As quickly as she was seen, she left, but she looked healthy for a 71-year-old,” the source added.

Friends say that discretion reflected how she and her husband, Bo Welch, lived their lives. Sources noted that the couple “kept them in the dark” about the seriousness of her condition, a decision that has since left many close to them deeply shaken.

In hindsight, small signs now carry more weight. 

She appeared noticeably thin during her final public appearance at the Emmy Awards in September. She was also absent from the Golden Globe Awards earlier this month, despite being nominated.

Paul Herman, a retired physician who lived next door to her in Brentwood for more than 25 years, told the Daily Mail that he had “no knowledge” of her illness.

Her absence from the Golden Globes made him “a little bit suspicious,” he said, though he noted that he had not seen her regularly in the neighborhood in “years.”

“Bo and Catherine were always very pleasant. They were just the kindest, most agreeable neighbors,” he added.

Despite more than four decades in Hollywood, she remained deeply protective of her private life. She was married to Welch for over 30 years following their 1992 wedding, and together they raised their two sons, Matthew and Luke, largely outside public view at their Brentwood home, where she later breathed her last. 

Years earlier, she had shared that she was diagnosed with situs inversus, a rare genetic condition in which major internal organs are positioned as a mirror image of their typical placement. 

As confirmation of her cancer battle brings new understanding to her final months, those closest to her say she met the end of her life much as she lived it. With privacy. With dignity. And with a quiet grace that continues to define her legacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Ex-Cop Reveals Reason Behind Septic Tank Search in Nancy Guthrie Investigation: REPORT","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-septic-tank-search-reason/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:45:00 GMT","

As the search for Nancy Guthrie moves into its second week, investigators have widened their focus, raising new questions and fresh concerns. Fox News reported that Authorities were seen examining a septic tank behind Nancy's Tucson, Arizona, home over the weekend.

The activity unfolded as the investigation into the disappearance of the 84-year-old mother of “Today” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie continued with no suspects identified.

Officials have not publicly detailed what prompted the search or whether anything was recovered. A former law enforcement official, however, offered insight into why investigators may have taken that step.

A former SWAT team captain suggested the septic system could hold overlooked evidence.

“A lot of people forget that having a septic tank means wastewater doesn't go into a city sewer, it goes into the tank,” former SWAT team captain Josh Schirard told the Daily Mail.

“So, somebody may have flushed something thinking that would get rid of it, but instead it would actually just be deposited in the septic tank,” he added. “It is a possibility that [investigators] are now trying to make sure that there's nothing in there that could indicate any kind of guilt.”

Three investigators were observed inspecting the tank Sunday afternoon as the search entered its eighth day.

Despite extensive efforts by the Pima County Sheriff's Department and the FBI, authorities say they have not identified any suspects or persons of interest.

Nancy was last seen Jan. 31, when she was dropped off at her home by her son-in-law, Tommaso Cioni, who is married to Savannah's older sister, Annie. 

She was reported missing the following day after she failed to attend church.

Investigators have confirmed that the blood found on the front porch of Nancy's home was a DNA match, deepening concern about her safety as the search continues and days pass without answers.

The investigation has grown more urgent following the circulation of unverified ransom notes sent to multiple news outlets. One of the messages reportedly demanded $6 million in bitcoin in exchange for Nancy's return.

Over the weekend, Savannah and her family responded publicly, saying they are prepared to pay the demand if it leads to their mother's safe return.

The unverified note initially set a payment deadline for Thursday evening and later listed a second deadline of Monday at 5 p.m. local time in Tucson.

As of Monday morning, an alleged bitcoin account linked to the ransom demand showed no transactions, TMZ reported.

The outlet reported that the account remained empty even as the second deadline approached, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the case.

Authorities have not confirmed whether the ransom notes are authentic or whether the bitcoin account is connected to the investigation.

Officials say follow-up work continues at multiple locations as investigators pursue every available lead.

For the Guthrie family, the wait remains agonizing. With no clear answers and time continuing to pass, hope and uncertainty now sit side by side as the search presses on.

The first image from Singapore filmmaker Anthony Chen‘s “We Are All Strangers” might evoke the iconic wedding in the opening scene of Edward Yang's Taiwanese drama “Yi Yi.” Both dramas from Asia offer a panorama of a family rocked by unexpected circumstances and grappling with the mundane realities of an economic life mismatched to their goals. While the connections are vast, it's reductive to keep making comparisons, as the “Wet Season” and “Ilo Ilo” director's fifth feature is its own big, beautiful beast of a movie. Watch an exclusive clip in the video above.

 










The first Singaporean film ever to play in competition at the Berlin Film Festival, Chen's new drama features his perennial star Yeo Yann Yann as Bee Hwa, a beer waitress who marries into a single-fathered family. The patriarch, Boon Kiat (Andi Lim), runs a noodle stand while his son (Koh Jia Ler) is conscripted, so young, into the army — until a major life twist brings him back to the homestead, and with a new stepmother at the helm. The scene above offers a glimpse of Boon Kiat and Bee Hwa's wedding, with cinematographer Teoh Gay Hian.

This is big, earnest, open-hearted cinema with a compassionate eye for its characters — even at their lowest moments, especially as “We Are All Strangers” takes a twist toward crime drama as legal issues mount for this new, found, patched-together family.

“We Are All Strangers” marks the third and last chapter of Anthony Chen's “Growing Up” trilogy, following “Ilo Ilo” and “Wet Season.” All his films deal with the fragile dynamics within families, the class issues pressing upon them. The Singapore-born filmmaker took a hiatus from this trilogy to make the simmering love triangle drama “The Breaking Ice,” which played Cannes in 2023. Chen took on his sole English-language project so far with 2023's “Drift,” starring Cynthia Erivo as a Liberian refugee grappling with her past on a remote Greek island.

“We Are All Strangers” premieres at the Berlin Film Festival on February 16; it's currently seeking U.S. distribution. Watch the IndieWire-exclusive clip from the film above.

Burt Reynolds died in 2018 while preparing to play George Spahn in Quentin Tarantino‘s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” Most of the obituaries and remembrances at the time focused on three key roles: emasculated warrior Lewis Medlock in “Deliverance,” the immensely popular The Bandit in “Smokey and the Bandit” (the number two box office smash of 1977 behind “Star Wars”), and his Oscar-nominated work as porno director Jack Horner in Paul Thomas Anderson‘s “Boogie Nights.”

All are undeniably iconic characters, but they only scratch the surface of a filmography that ranged from melancholy auteurist rom-com (Alan Pakula's “Starting Over,” Blake Edwards' “The Man Who Loved Women”) and sports flicks (“The Longest Yard,” “Semi-Tough”) to two Peter Bogdanovich pictures (“At Long Last Love” and “Nickelodeon”) as difficult to classify as they are criminally underrated. And then there are the movies Reynolds directed; he never achieved the widespread critical acceptance behind the camera of his friend and box office rival Clint Eastwood, but his tough and tender cop film “Sharky's Machine” is a masterful contemporary noir that expertly balances graphic violence and intense romantic longing, and “The End” is singular black comedy that still feels subversive nearly 50 years later.

These and each of Reynolds' other films of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s get the attention they deserve in Gary Schneeberger and James L. Neibaur's new book “The Burt Reynolds Films,” a treasure trove of information for Reynolds fans and a handy guide to his work for the uninitiated. After a brief introduction that covers Reynolds' early television work and small screen roles in films like “Angel Baby” and “Armored Command,” the authors devote a chapter to each of the actor's films from his first starring role (in 1965's “Operation C.I.A.”) to his final movie of the 1980s, Bill Forsyth's delicate comedy “Breaking In.” Each chapter provides credits, a synopsis, and — most delightfully for Reynolds enthusiasts — production histories and overviews of the films' critical and popular responses.

 










The format yields a highly entertaining and enlightening journey through Reynolds' career, which began with guest spots on TV staples like “Alfred Hitchcock Presents,” “The Twilight Zone,” and “The F.B.I.,” and regular parts on “Gunsmoke,” “Hawk,” and others. (Reynolds' “F.B.I.” episode is faithfully recreated in the final act of “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” with Leonardo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton stepping in for Reynolds.) Going through the films one by one, it's fascinating to see how many oddities — some of them, like Sergio Corbucci's “Navajo Joe,” legitimately terrific movies — Reynolds trudged through before “Deliverance,” and to read about them is to be reminded of the many false starts that led to that star-making role in 1972.

To be accurate, Reynolds was already a star before “Deliverance” — just not from any of his acting roles. Extremely likable, self-deprecating, and funny, Reynolds was one of the first actors to fully understand how to harness the talk-show circuit to his ends, and by the time “Deliverance” came out, he was well known for his appearances on the couches of Johnny Carson, Dick Cavett, Merv Griffin, and others. Those TV shows convinced audiences that Reynolds was a fun guy; John Boorman's “Deliverance” convinced them that he could act, though his highly publicized centerfold shoot for “Cosmopolitan” made it tough for some in the industry to take him seriously.

 










The five years between “Deliverance” and “Smokey and the Bandit” yielded some of Reynolds' most fascinating films, among them the elegiac and idiosyncratic Western “The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing,” the two Bogdanovich movies, and two great films for director Robert Aldrich, “The Longest Yard” and “Hustle.” Schneeberger and Neibar largely stick to the critical consensus on the films of this period, denigrating “At Long Last Love” and Stanley Donen's “Lucky Lady” and blaming their failures — as Reynolds did — on their directors, but even where one might disagree with the authors' value judgments, their research is impeccable, the irresistible behind-the-scenes stories and insights abundant.

Reynolds made a number of films in the mid-1970s (“White Lightning,” his directorial debut “Gator,” “W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings”) that laid the groundwork for the public perception of him as a good ol' boy Southerner full of charm and mischief, a persona he would ride to the bank with “Smokey and the Bandit.” Just how huge that movie was in the culture is difficult to convey today, but in 1977, Burt was king, the only big-screen hero to rival Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in his popularity. Urban critics sneered, but audiences between the coasts saw themselves — or at least who they wanted to be — in Reynolds' authority-defying bootlegger, and they kept “Smokey and the Bandit” in theaters for months.

 










“Smokey and the Bandit” was both the greatest thing that ever happened to Reynolds and the beginning of his downfall, as he tried to repeat its success in a series of car-crash comedies helmed by “Smokey” director Hal Needham, a stuntman whose considerable gifts for mayhem weren't always enough to compensate for his shortcomings as a dramatist. “Smokey” follow-up “Hooper” was legitimately terrific, but as Needham and Reynolds continued repeating their formula on the “Cannonball Run” movies, “Smokey and the Bandit II,” and the embarrassing “Stroker Ace” (in which Reynolds suffered the indignity of dressing up as a chicken), artistic returns were diminishing — and eventually, the box office returns diminished as well.

Before “Stroker Ace” drove the cycle into the ground, however, Reynolds sat atop the box office charts for five straight years after “Smokey and the Bandit,” and those years (1978-1982) represent one of the greatest runs a movie star ever had, not just commercially but in terms of range of material and quality of performance. Even movies considered clunkers at the time of their release, like the comedy “Paternity,” look better in retrospect, and in between the car flicks, there are a lot of fantastic films. The divorce comedy “Starting Over” features one of Reynolds' best performances thanks to a smart early James L. Brooks screenplay; “Rough Cut” is a charming caper flick with great late career work from director Don Siegel; and “Sharky's Machine” proves Reynolds was just as good as Clint Eastwood when it came to both directing and performing in a gritty action register.

 










Reynolds' inability to sustain a career as artistically and commercially enduring as Eastwood's is partly due to his sometimes astonishing knack for turning down movies he should have said yes to, and “The Burt Reynolds Films” has plenty of anecdotes about the ones that got away. Among the offers Reynolds either rejected or couldn't accept because of scheduling conflicts were Robert Altman's “M*A*S*H,” “Star Wars,” “Pretty Woman,” and “Die Hard.” Perhaps most painfully, he turned down James L. Brooks' offer to play the role that would win Jack Nicholson an Oscar in “Terms of Endearment,” because it would have meant bailing on “Stroker Ace.”

Reynolds often lamented his bad choices later in life, but in the process, he — and the audiences who listened to him and took his regrets at face value — failed to appreciate the breadth of movies he did make. “Best Friends,” a movie about romance between creative people scripted by Barry Levinson and Valerie Curtin, gave Reynolds a perfectly matched costar in Goldie Hawn, whose charisma and comic energy brought out the best in Reynolds — as did Dolly Parton in “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,” one of the last gasps of the big-budget Hollywood musical.

Then there was the wave of late-'80s crime films with one word titles (“Stick,” “Malone,” “Heat”) that suppressed Reynolds' good cheer and humor but replaced it with something equally entertaining: a worn cragginess and intensity that indicated Reynolds could do the kinds of movies that had made Charles Bronson famous (the reverse, of course, was not true). Unfortunately, these movies and the others Reynolds made in the late 1980s — the action-comedy “Rent-A-Cop,” the Michael Crichton thriller “Physical Evidence,” an amiable “His Girl Friday” remake called “Switching Channels” — didn't land with critics or audiences, and Reynolds entered the 1990s at a low point.

 










Given the glut of random cameos (“The Player,” “Bean,” “Meet Wally Sparks”) and straight-to-VHS programmers that characterized much of Reynolds' 1990s output, Schneeberger and Neibaur abandon their film-by-film format after 1989's “Breaking In” and devote individual chapters to only two of Reynolds' later movies, “Striptease” and “Boogie Nights.” Reynolds' well-publicized and baffling disdain for Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece — easily the best movie Reynolds was ever in and the best performance he ever gave — is amusingly recounted before the authors wrap things up with an overview of the actor's 21st-century work.

That period didn't yield much of interest, but Reynolds did have one final great role, in Adam Rifkin's “The Last Movie Star.” Playing a thinly disguised version of himself, Reynolds is, as Schneeberger and Neibaur point out, funny, exasperating, and moving, and Rifkin's impeccable tailoring of the role to fit his star gives Reynolds a wonderful summation with which to end his career. The same can be said of Schneeberger and Neibaur's volume, a read that, like its subject, exhibits a breezy superficial charm before giving way to genuine depth and multiple rewards.

Is it “brat” to disappear from your dutiful boyfriend in the middle of the trip he planned for you? 

Viewers will find out in “Erupcja” — the Polish word for “eruption” — the 71-minute feature shot by director Pete Ohs on the run in Warsaw. Focused around Bethany (Charli XCX), a British girl convinced that a volcano will explode whenever she blows up her life for a biannual fling with flower shop owner Nel (Lena Góra) in Warsaw. Her puppy-dog boyfriend, Rob (Will Madden), wanted to propose to her in Paris, but when Bethany suggested they go to Poland instead, some part of her expected the planet to crack open when they got there. Sure enough, Mount Etna erupts soon after the couple settles into their rental flat — and Bethany takes it as a sign to slip away from her almost-fiancé at a party one night, ghosting Rob and his well-planned itinerary in favor of another fiery tryst with Nel.

More from IndieWire's review by David Ehrlich: “‘Erupcja‘ was (clearly) scripted on the fly, to the point that all four of its main actors are credited as co-writers as well. Here, that approach proves a bit more pointed than it did in the Ohs' previous ‘Jethica' and ‘The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick,' as its elevated mumblecore energy suits the unformed and searching nature of a wherever you go, there you are story about the ways that people try to make sense of the world around them in real-time.”

Jeremy O. Harris also stars in “Erupcja.” The film premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival before playing festivals in Leiden, São Paulo, and Thessaloniki

Not since The Big Day has a rapper's cultural goodwill evaporated as quickly as when J. Cole deleted “7 Minute Drill,” a diss where he called To Pimp a Butterfly sleepy and overrated, from streaming platforms. It was a bold claim and at every turn, he relegated the burden of proof to his long-awaited seventh album, The Fall-Off, a record designed to prove, once and for all, that J. Cole is one of the greatest rappers of all time. Engineered as a career-defining masterpiece—the final destination of two decades of artistic output—The Fall-Off is mostly just another J. Cole album. It crumples under expectations few records could hope to meet.

The road to The Fall-Off began in earnest with “1985 (Intro to the ‘The Fall Off'),” a rare gem on Cole's overcooked 2018 album KOD. One Tuesday in December 2020, he posted a memo outlining the Fall-Off era, which included records like the already released Revenge of the Dreamers III, 2021's The Off-Season, and the since-scrapped It's a Boy. These projects trickled out with little urgency over the next couple years, especially once Cole was distracted by the war between Kendrick Lamar and Drake and the release of 2024's unplanned Might Delete Later, most notable for previously containing “7 Minute Drill.” Now Cole returns to wrap his career in a bow, increasing the pressure for The Fall-Off to right his missteps.

With The Fall-Off, Cole imagines the perfect rap album as an Alexandrian quest to conquer a wide breadth of styles and ideas, even the ones he has no business tackling. “Two Six” is a kill-'em-all tough-guy moment with a hook uncannily reminiscent of Sexyy Red's on “SkeeYee.” Reminiscing on his calmer, fan-favorite styling on 4 Your Eyez Only, many tracks tell introspective stories of his past, though “Run a Train” is the only one with a standout awful Future chorus and a tacky genocide allegory. Cole has never been the strongest singer; his balladry on “39 Intro” makes it clear he's not worried about that, but Post Malone's acoustic hit “Stay” shouldn't be an aspirational vocal reference.

Cole justifies The Fall-Off's double-disc length by focusing each half on a trip home, at ages 29 and 39, representing two different points in his mission to be the greatest. But he lacks the ability to keep the record moving with fresh ideas and the concept buckles under its own weight. Songs approach five minutes with no distinct direction, like “Bunce Road Blues,” where Cole, Future, and Tems take turns over a milquetoast beat from the Alchemist. “The Let Out” laces a Timbaland-esque beat with overdramatic electric guitar stabs and a singalong chorus with Broadway gravitas. While he feels most at home on infectious dirty South homages, they don't often feel inspired. Two of the stickiest tracks—“WHO TF IZ U” and “Old Dog,” featuring Petey Pablo—rely on interpolations (Trillville's “Some Cut” and T.I.'s “24's,” respectively) that already cropped up on hits by Doechii and Drake and 21 Savage in recent years. Strong songs nonetheless, they do little to quell the narrative that J. Cole has been a step behind his peers for a while now.

Cole remains a technically strong rapper but often gives the impression he's reading directly out of a notebook. His verses on “Run a Train” sound like they were designed for one of those videos mapping out MF DOOM rhyme schemes in different colors of highlighter. Strange concepts, like the FaceTime call through time on “Bombs in the Ville/Hit the Gas” and the necromantic Tupac and Biggie dialogue on “What If,” aren't any smarter or better executed than his straightforward raps; they're just overwrought. Conversely, when he relinquishes some of his knottier ideas, he sounds genuinely excited to be rapping on “Poor Thang” and “Old Dog.” These tidbits of excellence suggest his pen and flow can still get the job done; why strive for greatness in a far more complicated way?

Quintessential to a J. Cole record, The Fall-Off offers some insane societal commentary that calls into question how many of his daily comings and goings involve actual people. His musings on women on “Legacy” and “I Love Her Again” via menopause bars and eye-rolling OnlyFans references are just baffling. The worst perpetrator of all, “Safety,” tries to deliver a self-sanctified testimony of allyship with some violently distasteful storytelling: He describes a childhood friend who died of AIDS by saying he “[ran] with fruity types, dick-in-the-booty types,” and in almost the same breath, condemns the use of anti-gay slurs. “Safety” feels like a roundabout apology for Cole's embarrassingly long history of transphobic and homophobic bars, but it's well-meaning in the clunkiest, shallowest way possible. His inability to recognize the oxymoron makes Cole's introspection on this topic feel less like a genuine reckoning and more like a feeble attempt at bleaching out the darkest stains of his career.

Burnishing his reputation as hip-hop's most humble servant, Cole continuously retells the story of his miraculous underdog success. Especially when he evokes his hometown on tracks like “and the whole world is the Ville,” his musings are genuinely inspiring. His ability to frame his own success as something everyone is capable of achieving and his philanthropic affection for his Fayetteville, North Carolina hometown have always been some of his strongest qualities. But it's never been harder to empathize with a millionaire arguing that money won't solve your problems, as on “The Villest,” where he interpolates Outkast's classic “Elevators (Me & You)” with Erykah Badu to ask, “If money gives happiness, then please explain the rich bastards with no peace.” When the humility bars fly just minutes after J. Cole reexpresses his desire to be the greatest of all time, the magnetism of both poles is dampened.

By the end of The Fall-Off, it's abundantly clear the album doesn't warrant 101 minutes: J. Cole doesn't have the perceptive lyricism of the strongest independent rap, nor the novel production of the regional underground scenes, nor the mainstream gloss of someone like Don Toliver. He's also said that this album will be his last, a claim no rapper has ever followed through on. But if he does, it would be a shame. Cole is still undeniably talented and there's space for him to shine in modern hip-hop. Plenty of moments on The Fall-Off remind of the hunger of his early mixtapes, the purposeful thrills of his 2010s hits, or even the misguided zaniness of KOD, though none materialize in meaningful doses. The Fall-Off would be more fascinating if it were a trainwreck, but this chapter of J. Cole's career closes with a whimper.

Chappell Roan has left the talent agency Wasserman Music after the company's founder and CEO, Casey Wasserman, appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein files recently released by the Justice Department. The pop star explained her decision in an Instagram story this evening (February 9), citing a need to keep her team safe.

“As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,” wrote Roan. “I hold my teams to the highest standards and have a duty to protect them as well. No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values. I have deep respect and appreciation for the agents and staff who work tirelessly for their artists and I refuse to passively stand by. Artists deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity. This decision reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust.” Roan was formerly represented by Jackie Nalpant, Kiely Mosiman, Adele Slater, and Anna Bewers at Wasserman.

Wasserman is one of the largest talent agencies in the music business, with a roster boasting hundreds of artists, including Kendrick Lamar, Lorde, Phish, SZA, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Childish Gambino, Janelle Monae, Animal Collective, Geese, and Tyler, the Creator. Over the weekend, Wasserman's artist roster was removed from its website.

Earlier today, Wednesday openly parted ways with the agency. Their move followed a handful of other public statements by artists who are also on Wasserman. Beach Bunny, Water From Your Eyes, Salute, and a group of music agents at the company all called for Casey Wasserman to step down and threatened to resign.

Last week, Best Coast frontwoman Bethany Cosentino shared an open letter to Wasserman, urging him to exit the company. “I'm speaking out because pretending this is normal isn't normal. Because people in power can't keep skating by,” she wrote. “Artists are not interchangeable assets. We are people. Many of us are women. Many of us, myself included, are survivors. We deserve systems that let us work without asking us to compromise our values in exchange for opportunity.”

Lord Jah-Monte Ogbon starts As of Now by paraphrasing a meme. “OK, I'm posted at the function in the corner, and they don't even know,” he raps, his helium-tinged voice scooting through a flute sample. He pauses slightly, aware that a well-placed space in a sentence can seismically shift its impact: “...what I'm 'bout to do/I ask my boo, ‘Can we keep it low?'” Once you catch the cleverness of his comedic timing (they definitely know what he's about to do), you should run the track back and listen for the preceding adlib, pushed low in the mix like a mischievous secret: “Watch this.”

You can almost see the glint in his eye as he unspools the rest of his soliloquy, oscillating between bleak details of threadbare pillows on trap house floors and shoulder-brushing flexes of cross-country flights and celebrity green rooms. When the beat switches, replacing the paisley jazz loop with a pulverized breakbeat and keyboard, it's like an abrupt shift in lighting, shadows covering places you didn't know could go dark. Jah-Monte's casual delivery doesn't change, but it suddenly feels deadly serious. When the hook comes back around, he's still posted in that corner, this time rubbing his hands together like a Birdman reaction gif. The song sets up the impish opposition at play throughout As of Now, where Jah-Monte tempers vignettes of heartbreak and hustling with an amiable, absurdist wit.

Jah-Monte's been releasing music for just over a decade, but in the dozen or so releases since 2019's Jewelry Rap, the Charlotte rapper has really hit his stride. His uniquely disarming sense of humor augments—and sometimes masks—the complexity of his taste and technical ability. In shakier hands, his output—like 2021's Navy Blue-produced Beautifully Black or his 2023 collaboration with Sadhugold, The Black Messiah—might be lumped into the glut of solid, slightly stoned underground records that disappear as soon as the needle lifts. Instead, they're immediately approachable but simultaneously layered and rewarding listens, full of subtle one-liners and detailed stories, incisive as they are droll.

As of Now is the height of Jah-Monte's ability. A line like “Outside while you working remote” from “Instagram Highlights” establishes his bona fides and elicits a chuckle in a matter of seconds; when he casually drops, “I had run off on my plug, he was chasing me with a Glock” on “Butter Leather Weather,” it feels good-natured and funny despite what he's describing. He stitches tracks together with interstitial moments that foreground the fun of the record, like interludes featuring the voice of a woman named Milly, who appears several times to declare it “the best album ever.” The skit that ends the album, “Lord Jah-Monte's #1 Supporter,” is a compilation of voicemails presumably left by an obsessed hater, spinning up creative ways to call Jah-Monte a bitch. It's bizarre and ridiculous, a bit of finishing salt to the record's dueling vibes of “aw shucks” and “don't fuck with me.”

Tellingly, Jah-Monte's never self-deprecating. He checks himself now and then, like during the chorus of “So You Really Don't Miss Me?,” when he implores, “If you love me, tell me you sorry that it got ugly,” to which singer Wild Recluse replies, “I ain't sorry,” with a sultry croon. But his good-natured goofiness projects confidence; Jah-Monte knows—and loves—himself enough to recognize his flaws and weaknesses, laughing about fucking up checks on dates that go nowhere, yearning for permission to cheat on his girl, or realizing he's taken too many shots at the rap show to be coherent. That self-awareness helps him sell otherwise corny lines like “If I was Adam Sandler, I'd press rewind,” or the grinning bossa nova breakup tale on “Let Me Reflect / Uber From O'Hare.”

You also hear that confidence in his across-the-map beat selection, which ranges from Donuts-esque sidechain workouts to diaphanous cloud rap to druggy Southern thump, often in the same song. And like the hairpin turns in the production all across the album, Jah-Monte approaches themes from different angles and pivots without breaking a sweat. On tracks like “Drunk Nights In Edgewood (IMYSM)” and “Nah, You're Mad Extra,” he hits a pattern similar to Freddie Gibbs' double-time trance-state fluidity, with syllables flaring at the ends of bars like a jazz drummer hitting an open hi-hat. His most mesmerizing display comes on the first half of “Flewed Out, All Expenses Is Paid For,” performing like a runner who didn't hear the starting shot. Each word drags behind the beat, creating a buoyant counterrhythm to Laron's choppy boom-bap, sitting comfortably in time but landing where you'd least expect. As of Now is a virtuosic showing, and at no point does it feel like Jah-Monte is stretching past his limits.

The subject matter might not be breaking any new ground here; at their core, these are songs about the lengths he goes to get laid and the shady things he's done to get paid. But no matter how strange, or sad, or dark his stories get, Jah-Monte raps like you're also in on the joke. Throughout As of Now, he extols the virtue of believing in yourself, but recognizes that getting there—and staying there—sometimes feels silly. In a crowded pool of young rappers who dissect their feelings, unsure of whether there's any underlying meaning, Jah-Monte comes off as the true existentialist: If you can't laugh at yourself, what's the point?

You need to understand how big of a deal it is for Converge to tell us that Love Is Not Enough. Their eleventh album, arriving 36 years after the band's formation, is their second with “love” in the title, and their eleventh with “love” appearing at least once (but usually many more times) in the lyric sheet. Converge made their name by taking hardcore and making it more knotty and abrasive, as if they were distressing a new pair of jeans. But they have always focused their aggression on heightening empathy rather than rejecting it. Their 2001 breakout, Jane Doe, is still one of the nastiest sounding albums ever recorded, and it's tempting to pit that sound against the heartfelt lyrics. But, as is most evident on “Heaven in Her Arms,” that roiling tumult mirrors the internal rollercoaster that comes with emotional bloodletting:

“I just needed a lover and I needed a friendAnd there you wereRunning from forever like all the restThree simple words bled me dryThree simple word bled us dry, bled us dryI love you”

It's been nine years since the last proper Converge album, and in the interim, the band linked up with doom-folk singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe for 2021's meandering, ostentatious, and uneven collaboration, Bloodmoon: I. It might be shocking to hear Converge open their latest with four lean, brutal barn-burners—reflecting the “no frills, no BS” mission offered by frontman Jacob Bannon in a recent interview—but the album eventually concludes with a suite of longer, more methodical tracks.

Human connection has always been the motivating force in Bannon's lyrics, and his approach tends to be hyper-personal while still opaque enough to invite interpretation. He usually operates in first-person, and it rarely seems like he's invoking perspectives other than his own, but his lack of specificity almost always spurns proper nouns. He continues to keep things vague on Love Is Not Enough, an album that splits its focus between big-picture outrage and internal reckonings with mortality. The refrain of the opening title track, “Love is not enough/To fend off the scavengers,” could feasibly belong to any disillusioned post-Reagan punk band. On the other hand, Bannon wrote the album closer in a funeral home parking lot, and his lyrics lament the fact that death is the easiest way to bring people together.

Love Is Not Enough is split between two distinct halves: the first more blistering and political, the second more moody and personal. There's still a clear linked sentiment—that our traditional understanding of “love” either needs an update or an expansion to maintain its value in modern life. For a band in its fourth decade, whose ages range between 45 and 52, this is a particularly generative notion. The sense of desperate searching connects the mass-pacification protest “To Feel Something,” for instance, and the opiate addiction lament “Gilded Cage.” “Systematically we seethe,” he shouts. “Pharmaceutically we bleed.”

After an uptempo opening, the album's momentum screeches to a halt with the droning two-and-half-minute instrumental “Beyond Repair,” and when Converge return to their regularly scheduled programming, they're sludgier and more long-winded. They've been making pace-slowers forever, but ever since they closed 2009's Axe to Fall with two plodders, Converge have sounded less like corroded In Utero offspring and more like a band so inspired by Neurosis that they launched a collaborative merch line.

The technical prowess still shines through—check the swaggering stutter of “Force Meets Presence” and the swirling grandeur that closes “Make Me Forget You”—once again reminding us that this is the most well-oiled unit metalcore has ever produced, no matter what mode they're in. Love Is Not Enough is never not invigorating (save for “Beyond Repair”), but its more vicious songs are such refreshing evidence of Converge's vitality that every departure from that energy feels like a pulled punch.

In a recent Decibel profile, Converge revealed that, while sifting through years-old demos of riffs, they accidentally rewrote a song they'd already recorded for a previous album. Drummer Ben Koller dubbed this “BCP: Big Catalog Problems,” and most bands that last this long inevitably end up repeating themselves. The thing about Converge is that, when they play to their strengths, it never sounds like a retread, even if they end up writing something that could slot seamlessly onto Jane Doe. Ironically, the only boring moments in their past 25 years come when they're clearly attempting a different sound. Boldness is baked into this band, and that's what leads them to dizzying new compositions and refreshing shifts in perspective. Love may no longer be enough, but I hope Converge realize that their fundamental DNA always will be.

Jimmy Eat World will tour Bleed American to celebrate the landmark album's 25th anniversary this year. The dates include the band's return to the Warped Tour after 25 years. Support acts at select other dates will include Sunny Day Real Estate, Rise Against, the Get Up Kids, Thrice, Girls Against Boys, Hey Mercedes, Motion City Soundtrack, Illuminati Hotties, Mom Jeans, Jay Som, and Pup. Find the itinerary below; some festival dates will stray from the Bleed American theme.

The band will play the whole album but probably not in sequence, Jim Adkins told Billboard, which broke the news. The album, he added, “changed our lives. It put us on a map. It gave us a new, broad audience of people that found something in it that they connected with. People have grown up with this record, right alongside us growing up, and I feel like it's important to celebrate it. It's important to acknowledge to people that we appreciate that, despite the obvious commerce involved.”

Chappell Roan is splitting from music talent agency Wasserman Group following the revelation of risqué emails exchanged between its founder Casey Wasserman and convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell in the latest tranche of Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Justice Department.


	“As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman. I hold my teams to the highest standards and have a duty to protect them as well,” wrote Roan in an Instagram Stories post on Monday, Feb. 9. “No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values. I have deep respect and appreciation for the agents and staff who work tirelessly for their artists and I refuse to passively stand by.”


	Roan, who had championed for better health insurance and treatment of artists during her 2025 Grammys speech, added on Monday's announcement that “artists deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity.” The musician ended her note by saying the decision “reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust.”

	











	In the past week, Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, Wednesday, Water From Your Eyes, and Beach Bunny have also denounced the agency's founder, with some threatening to walk away from the music group completely. The agency also wiped from its website its artist roster as of Sunday night (Feb. 8).

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a previous statement, Wasserman expressed regret over his association with Maxwell and Epstein. “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell, which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,” he told The New York Times. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”

	A rep for Roan did not immediately reply to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. A rep for Wasserman declined a request for comment on Monday. In his previous statement to media outlets over the weekend, Wasserman said he did not communicate with Epstein following the humanitarian mission, claiming he did not witness “anything inappropriate.”


	Wasserman, the grandson of Hollywood agent Lew Wasserman, has not been charged or accused of any wrongdoing by the Justice Department.


	Los Angeles officials have called on Wasserman to resign as chairman of the organizing committee for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. “I think Casey Wasserman needs to step down,” L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Having him represent us on the world stage distracts focus from our athletes and the enormous effort needed to prepare for 2028.”


	Tension has been building inside Wasserman for days, ever since the agency's namesake appeared at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan, as part of his 2028 Olympic duties. But several sources tell Rolling Stone that Wasserman had already been confronted by executive leadership prior to the latest revelation (reports began circulating in 2024) and questioned about the nature of his relationship with Epstein. According to one person privy to the meeting, Wasserman assured his senior staff that “there's nothing else” that would come out involving his implication or association with the Epstein-Maxwell trials. Then, the emails in the latest Epstein files dropped, leaving his closest associates feeling betrayed, says the source. 


	The evolution of Wasserman as one of Hollywood's top agencies, with branches covering music, film, TV, sports, and brands, is itself a dramatic one. In 2021, Wasserman acquired the music-business clients of Paradigm, leaving its film, television, and literary agents behind. In bolstering its live-music touring division, which now included Coldplay and Ed Sheeran, Wasserman instantly became a major player. A year later, it added Paradigm's U.K. music clients to the roster (Roan was signed out of England), along with influential agencies AM Only, CODA and Windish.

	But the breakup of Paradigm left some scars. Many agents had been working together for many years, and entered into the Wasserman era with some sadness, if not trepidation. Wasserman “came in as a white knight to save them, and they succeeded,” says one industry insider. Still, artists are often fickle when it comes to their agencies, and it's not uncommon to jump from one shop to another. Billie Eilish was one such defector, moving to WME in 2024 (which had represented the singer in film and TV since 2023), citing a desire to have all of her projects at one agency. In exiting, she and brother Finneas said in a statement from their rep that they were “grateful to their former live booking agents at Wasserman.”

	“It was a Frankenstein company, made up of many different units and silos,” says the agency insider. Compared to WME and CAA, and even UTA in recent years, its weakness in film and TV has limited the agency's impact in Hollywood, despite having giants of music, like Dave Matthews Band and Phish, on its roster. As for what happens next, Wasserman's top music agents — including Marty Diamond, Sam Hunt, Jonathan Levine, Jackie Nalpant, and Lee Anderson — could break off to form a new agency; artists could see an opportunity to jump ship to a rival agency; Wasserman could step down, allowing for a name change and a fresh start; or the founder could sell the agency altogether. “It's all up in the air,” says the insider.

	Jon Stewart had a field day with the MAGA meltdown over Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show and the Turning Point USA counter-program on The Daily Show last night (Feb. 9).


	Stewart himself was full of raves for Bad Bunny's performance, calling it “joyful and infectious and …” — before cutting to a clip of right-wing commentator Benny Johnson declaring it “the single worst halftime show in NFL history.”


	Mustering fake sympathy, Stewart corrected himself: “I forgot, for a significant portion of Americans, everything that happens must uniformly be filtered through a particular MAGA-centric worldview. And judged on how well it conforms to that traditional vision, which doesn't include knowing where the biblioteca is.”


	Stewart then shared a montage of other commentators losing their minds over the lack of English during Bad Bunny's set. He ultimately chose, however, to let the ridiculousness speak for itself and spend a good chunk of the rest of his segment goofing on the overly tanned and extremely mad host Sid Rosenberg. 

	











	“Here's some English for you — who put Thanos over here in the air fryer,” Stewart quipped. “Did Fox decide they needed an actual Buffalo wing to comment on the game?”

	Stewart then mockingly praised TP USA for putting on an “All-American Halftime Show that celebrates this beautiful country in the King's English we all share” — then proceeded to play a clip of headliner Kid Rock lip-synching to his famously comprehensible “Bawitdaba.”


	“Thank you!” Stewart exclaimed. “Merriam and Webster couldn't have put it better themselves regarding the up-jumping of said boogie, insofar as the diggy-diggy-diggy, being da-bang-a-da-bang.”

	A federal judge ruled Monday that some of Lil Durk's rap lyrics will be off-limits as evidence at his upcoming murder-for-hire trial. However, the judge added that the rapper's request to bar all lyrics and music videos from the proceedings is still being weighed.


	Durk's defense lawyers want to exclude all lyrics from trial, arguing they're hyperbolic “poetry” that carry an “extraordinary risk” of being misunderstood by jurors. Prosecutors, meanwhile, hope to admit lyrics from 12 songs as they allege Durk “used his money for violence” as the alleged leader of a “gang” dubbed OTF. (Durk's Chicago-based rap collective and record label, Only the Family, is also known as OTF.) 


	After hearing arguments from both sides in a Los Angeles courtroom, U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald ruled that specific lyrics from the song “Hanging With Wolves” would be barred. In the track, Durk raps, “I'm the type to hop on a flight with a warrant, you gotta catch me.” Prosecutors claim the line bolsters their theory that Durk, whose legal name is Durk Banks, was attempting to flee the country at the time of his arrest. Banks disputes that claim and has pleaded not guilty.

	“Particular lyrics [sought] to bolster the government's argument that there was an intention to flee — which is traditionally viewed as consciousness of guilt — will be excluded because they really are just sheer propensity,” Fitzgerald said Monday, referring to generally inadmissible material offered to suggest someone acted in line with alleged character traits. “Lyrics attempting to show Mr. Banks' willingness to flee will be excluded from the trial.”

	











	Banks, 33, was indicted on charges alleging he hired a group of hit men to travel to Los Angeles and carry out an execution-style killing in broad daylight on Aug. 19, 2022. Prosecutors say the intended target was Tyquian Terrel Bowman, the rapper known as Quando Rondo, whom Banks allegedly believed was involved in the 2020 shooting death of his friend and protégé Dayvon Bennett, known as King Von, in Atlanta. Prosecutors claim the alleged assassins stalked Bennett in Los Angeles and ambushed him at a gas station near the Beverly Center shopping mall, firing at least 18 rounds from multiple guns, including a machine gun. Bowman's cousin, Saviay'a Robinson, was struck and killed as he traveled with Bowman.

	Banks was arrested in October 2024 near a Miami airport on the same day authorities detained his alleged co-conspirators. Prosecutors say he was preparing to board a private jet bound for Italy in an effort to flee. Banks' lawyers have said he planned to travel for “business and spiritual reasons” in the Middle East.


	Fitzgerald said he would rule soon on Banks's broader request to exclude all lyrics and music videos. Arguing for their admission on Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ian V. Yanniello said the material was necessary to illustrate the “core members of the alleged conspiracy,” contending that it showed certain individuals were part of a subgroup of OTF engaged in criminal activity.


	Among the videos prosecutors want to show the jury is a February 2022 video for the song “AHHH HA,” in which Banks raps: “Don't respond to shit with Von. I'm like, ‘Fuck it, you trippin', go get your gun.' They droppin' locations, I'm getting it done. Fuck tweetin', we slidin', the feds are comin.” When the judge asked why the video was needed in addition to the lyrics, Yanniello said the visuals provided necessary context.


	“The lyrics in isolation are potentially ambiguous at times,” he said. “The context of what is being displayed visually makes clear what the lyrics are about.”


	Defense lawyer Marissa Goldberg pushed back, telling the court she and her co-counsel, Drew Findling, regularly represent rap artists and that this was “by far the most amount of rap lyrics we've ever seen proffered” in a criminal case. In filings, the defense cited court decisions and academic studies finding that rap lyrics can be misunderstood and create undue prejudice.

	“This is art, this is music,” Goldberg argued Monday. “But there's no doubt it's prejudicial in criminal trials. And the government wants to use it in extraordinary abundance.” She accused prosecutors of “cherry-picking” inflammatory material while ignoring the video for Banks' Grammy-winning song “All My Life,” where “he's surrounded by children.”

	“They certainly didn't choose that one,” Goldberg said. “There's a narrative they want to portray, and it's propensity and violence.” She added that actors and musicians regularly deliver scripted lines that do not reflect their real lives. “We would never say, ‘Because you said it and commercialized it, it should be used as evidence against you.' We don't make those jumps,” she said. “[Banks] is a performer, somebody doing things because there's demand and there's an audience. It's part of the zeitgeist.”


	Banks' trial is scheduled to begin April 21, though scheduling issues involving co-defendants and their lawyers could delay the start again. (The trial was previously delayed in January.) As he was led away in custody on Monday, Banks acknowledged his large group of supporters in the gallery, including his father, Dontay Banks. He smiled broadly at his wife, India Royale, before he was led away.

	For 50 years, the Holy Grail of Elvis Presley footage — 10 professionally shot concerts from the early Seventies — sat deep in a Kansas salt mine, completely inaccessible to the public. To the hardcore Elvis-fan community, its existence was little more than myth. But when Baz Luhrmann inked a deal to direct the 2022 biopic Elvis, starring Austin Butler and Tom Hanks, he insisted that Warner Bros. excavate all 59 hours of film, which the studio owns, to see if it might spark ideas for his movie. 


	What Luhrmann saw left him gobsmacked. This wasn't just Elvis at his peak as a live performer, captured from multiple angles often by expert filmmakers, but also fly-on-the-wall backstage footage and candid interviews from the notoriously press-shy music icon. “We couldn't let this footage go back into the salt mines,” Luhrmann says by Zoom as he wanders the streets of Tokyo. “Right away, I knew we had to do something with it.”


	What he didn't want was a traditional documentary that told the story of Presley's touring years in chronological order with title cards and talking-head interviews. He instead envisioned something more daring, which he calls a “tone poem.” As Luhrmann explains, “It's as if Elvis comes to you in a dream and tells his story, and he sings it.”

	The result, EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert, which opens in IMAX Feb. 20 and theaters nationwide Feb. 27, is a feat of filmmaking. Despite its longtime storage in the salt mine, which helps to protect film from the damaging effects of moisture, making the footage screen-worthy presented enormous technological and financial hurdles. The journey started when Luhrmann and editor Jonathan Redmond began combing through boxes of film reels that were originally shot for the 1970 documentary Elvis: That's the Way It Is and the 1972 concert film Elvis on Tour. “When we got it into the cutting room at Warner's, there was this vinegar smell,” Luhrmann says. “That's the smell of film degenerating. And it was so smelly we knew it was on the brink of crumbling.”

	It looked spectacular once a very delicate digital transfer was complete, but much of the concert footage was silent. Fortunately, RCA had multi­track tapes of every show, and the filmmakers were able to pain­stakingly sync them up. Then, during the hunt for additional audio, they came across a previously undiscovered 45-minute interview with Presley, conducted by the Elvis on Tour directing team in 1972, with the camera off. “You can tell he's very tired and vulnerable,” says Luhrmann. “But he's talking, really unguarded, about his life.” 


	That gave them the idea to let Elvis narrate the film, using that interview along with select bits of recorded conversation from throughout his life. “It's always been about other people telling you their story of Elvis,” says Luhrmann. “Anyone who pumped gas into Elvis' car and looked him in the eye wrote a book about it. This is his side of the story.”


	In EPiC, that story begins with a transcendent segment of the medley “An American Trilogy” from 1972. Then the film ricochets through a collage of 1950s TV performances and early concerts captured by fans in the audience. Next is a glimpse of some of the B movies the King shot in the 1960s during a period of career decline, including one in which he sings to a guy in a dog costume. “Hollywood's image of me was wrong. I knew it, and I couldn't say anything about it,” we hear Presley say in a moment of unexpected candor. “It was nobody's fault except maybe my own, but I was attached to things I didn't fully believe in.”


EPiC bounces between shows in 1970 and 1972, highlighting stunning performances of songs like “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” “Suspicious Minds,” “In the Ghetto,” “Burning Love,” and “How Great Thou Art.” Redmond was initially worried about “jumping through time and space and aspect ratios and formats. It's Super 8 one shot. Then it's 35mm anamorphic the next shot, then it's 16mm 4:3.” But they went with their guts. “We didn't want a linear flow,” he says.

	In order to make the footage really pop, they handed it over to director Peter Jackson's team in New Zealand, the same crew responsible for the acclaimed 2021 documentary The Beatles: Get Back. “They set the gold standard for film restoration — cleaning it up, degrading it, removing all the dust,” says Redmond. “But not losing anything as well, because you can go too far with film restoration and it starts to look plastic. These people are masters at making film look like film, but better and cleaner. What they did was the icing on the cake.”

	











	Luhrmann and Redmond did have access to concerts shot after 1972, including Presley's 1977 concert special. But the footage is difficult to watch due to Presley's perilous physical state in the weeks before his death. “Elvis' body is corrupted in 1977,” notes Luhrmann, though he adds that the King's “spirit and voice actually soars.” The director ran a famous performance of “Unchained Melody” from this same period at the end of his 2022 biopic, and was reluctant to return to that well. “We didn't want to repeat ourselves,” he adds, “and we didn't want to show him at the definitive end.”


	The movie concludes by noting that Elvis performed more than 1,100 concerts between 1969 and 1977, sometimes playing three a day. “He flew so close to the sun,” says Luhrmann. “And then he's trapped, to quote the song [“Suspicious Minds”]. He's caught in a trap, and he can't get out. He doesn't quite know why, but the only thing that sustains him as he keeps going round and round and round on this circuit in America is that the only love he can get is across the footlights. He became addicted to performing.”

	Luhrmann is currently deep into preproduction on a Joan of Arc movie, but he's not quite ready to let go of Elvis. A 1972 concert at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton Roads, Virginia, was found in the vault that's never been seen in full. He's batting around the idea of maybe one day turning it into its own film. 


	What keeps him going is the knowledge that his biopic created a groundswell of interest in Elvis among young people who were only vaguely aware he existed beforehand. “Like all great icons, there comes a point when they just become wallpaper or a ­Halloween costume,” says Luhrmann. “But Elvis was a human being who was absolutely dirt poor. His parents could not read or write. And then overnight he becomes the most famous 20-year-old on the planet. Nothing like that had ever happened before. And so with this movie, we just wanted to get out of the way and let the audience experience him in the most intimate way possible.”

	Here's a rather essential fact about the guy some conservatives tried to cast as an enemy to American values well before his Super Bowl halftime show even began: As a kid, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, a.k.a. Bad Bunny, was literally a choir boy. He grew up to become one of the least problematic humans in the entire music industry, an introspective, humble guy whose biggest “scandal” involved tossing an intrusive fan's phone into the bushes.


	On the latest episode of Rolling Stone Music Now, Rolling Stone's Julyssa Lopez — who's been interviewing Bad Bunny for years — joins host Brian Hiatt to look back at Bad Bunny's career path, unpack his Super Bowl performance, and puzzle over the oddly intense controversy surrounding it.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The mere announcement that Bad Bunny would headline the halftime show was enough to ignite outrage from some MAGA quarters — a reaction Lopez says she never saw coming. “I thought, if anything, celebrating a halftime performance in Spanish as sort of a historical moment would be something to embrace and aspire to,” she says. To hear the entire podcast episode, listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or just press play above. 

	











	Especially after Bad Bunny took on ICE at the Grammys, conservatives seemed to expect some sort of anti-Trump extravaganza. What they got was something far more subtle, powerful, and joyful: a communal celebration of Puerto Rican identity as well as the unity of countries across the Americas, along with unabashed patriotism for the United States. A performance that was supposed to be somehow so transgressive that it merited an alternative Turning Point U.S.A. halftime show — starring purported moral exemplar Kid Rock — ended with red, white, and blue fireworks.  “If you love America, you have to love all of America,” Lopez says. “And Puerto Rico is part of America.”

	There certainly were political messages in the show, including the apparently troublesome suggestion that love is more powerful than hate. And there was real resonance in enlisting Ricky Martin to sing the anti-colonialist song “Lo Que Le Paso a Hawaii.”  ”The way Ricky had to get famous was to learn English and to cross over and to assimilate to the U.S. in a lot of ways,” Lopez points out. “It gives me chills to think about it, but Ricky now in his adulthood, singing in Spanish and singing about colonialism, I think was an especially powerful move on Bad Bunny's part.”

	And then there was Lady Gaga's appearance, which was solely about Bad Bunny's sheer Little Monster-dom, rather than any particular message. At the same time, says Lopez, to hear a song like ‘Die With a Smile' set to a salsa rhythm, was also really important — hearing what these songs that you might recognize sound like if they're put in the context of Puerto Rico, if they're put in the context of Latin music, and all the possibilities that are available.”

In the build-up to his next directorial venture, Disclosure Day, which once again deals with extraterrestrial beings, Steven Spielberg has shared his views on whether the concept of aliens is fact or myth. The visionary filmmaker, who is currently occupied with promoting his upcoming film, revealed that he has always been fascinated by what's out there and believes it for certain that humans aren't alone in this universe.

The multiple Academy Award-winner opened up about the much-discussed topic of aliens, establishing that their existence is a much more probable outcome.

In a recently released Disclosure Day featurette, Steven Spielberg started off by highlighting how unique his filmography is. He noted, “I've always been fascinated with things that cannot be explained. And I've made a lot of movies about things that can't be explained, from sharks to saucers.”

Spielberg then switched to the topic of aliens, which will also serve as the basis of his upcoming movie, Disclosure Day. “When I was just a little kid, I remember developing a real curiosity about the sky at night, and what's happening up there. And also, not the possibility, but the guarantee that there is life off this planet,” he said.

The Jaws director added, “People's questions about what is not only going on in our skies, but what is going on in our worlds, in our realities, has reached a critical mass of people's complete fascination with ‘Are we alone, or are we not alone?' And if someone knows we're not alone, why haven't we been told?”

Similar to humans' knowledge about aliens, not much is known regarding the plot of Steven Spielberg's forthcoming feature. Regardless, the movie features a star-studded cast, including Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, and Elizabeth Marvel, among others.

Disclosure Day is currently on track to hit theaters on June 12, 2026.

© 2026 Cybernews – Latest Cybersecurity and Tech News, Research & Analysis.

A batch of Soviet-era UFO documents, allegedly smuggled out in 1993, has been publicly released by acclaimed journalist George Knapp.

Knapp had smuggled the documents out of Russia and subsequently released them three decades later. 

Despite the Soviet Union publicly dismissing UFOs publicly, their stance appears to have been very different in private.

The 70-page English translation reveals several layers of UFO inquisitions, including covert investigations spanning from 1979 through the following decades. 

However, the underlying curiosity regarding UFOs actually began as early as the 1950s.

Beginning in 1953, the Soviets outwardly looked at UFOs as a concoction by “American imperialists.” But internally, curiosity and research was percolating over the years.

A couple of academics and enthusiasts worked in the shadows – engineer Yuri Formin throughout the 1950s and Moscow Aviation Institute academic Felix Ziegel after 1967. While Formin delivered closed UFO lectures to military personnel, Ziegel pushed for international recognition.

The report references analysis of over 700 reliable cases between 1978 and 1983, with military units tasked with observation, registration, and identification of Abnormal Atmosphere Phenomena (AAP). 

The document is mostly a military-scientific report, with instances of abnormal aerospace phenomena, including technical analyses including gravitational research and biological effects of the experiencers.

It is written in a largely technical tone, mainly assessing the threat of AAP, and critically – investigating whether the unique features of these craft could be reverse-engineered for Soviet military gain.

Buried within the dossier are three vivid accounts of various extraterrestrial incidents in the 70's and 80's. 

An overarching red light split into a sequence of green lights, which then converged and scaled up into the sky. Following a 90-minute lull, a prominent UFO loomed over the city, accompanied by a smaller ghost craft that zipped around before retreating upward.

Malishev was taken to their planet and thoroughly examined, with the aliens concluding “very strong nerves; mental faculties below the average.” The Russian investigators claimed he was of sound mind.

The following morning one of the girls and a teacher saw one of the pink-eyed beings sitting in a makeshift seat near the mound they camped at. When questioned many months later, all the children that witnessed the event had practically the same details, with no deviation.

This leak reveals a major secret Soviet program running in parallel to that of the US. Heavy academics like Yuri Formin and Felix Ziegel were the prominent figures in the engine room of extraterrestrial speculation, even if the Soviet Union flexed skeptical on the face of it.

UFOs were a serious, top-tier national concern for both superpowers, shrouded in secrecy. And, as one Redditor shared – the decades where this information occurred is not too far retrospective to warrant, that it's completely past its sell-by date.

Cher Álvarez as Lou in “Paranormal Activity” at American Conservatory Theater.

They've been dragged out of bed or from the side or a child's crib, their bodies yanked across the floor by an invisible force. They've issued nails-on-chalkboard screeches and bargained and pleaded with powers they didn't understand.

“Paranormal Activity”: Performances begin Thursday, Feb. 19. Through March 15. $25-$130, subject to change. ACT's Toni Rembe Theater, 415 Geary St., S.F. 415-749-2228. www.act-sf.org

The terror has always been presented as found footage, spliced together from closed-circuit security cameras or handheld ones. Now characters from the “Paranormal Activity” film franchise are entering a whole new realm: live theater.

Never miss a Delaware County story!

The one-bedroom Plank House in Marcus Hook is one of the oldest operating houses in Delaware County, and is said to be the home of the pirate Blackbeard.

“It dates back to the 1700s,” said Joshua Chjaires, founder of Phantom Detectives LLC. “At that time, Marcus Hook was a well-known shipping port. It has a lot of history of paranormal activity. People report seeing the spirit of Blackbeard's wife. They hear footsteps, crying, bangs.”

The paranormal investigative team based in Wilmington, Del. will visit the house and a graveyard out back, revealing their results at the Marcus Hook 17th Annual Pirate Festival on Saturday, Sept. 20, writes Kathleen E. Carey for the Daily Times.

Boothwyn native Melissa Ferrazzano is the medium on the team and has already sensed spirits days before the investigation.

Michael Manerchia ,of the Marcus Hook Preservation Society, won't  go into the house after dark after he and his wife experienced bedroom doors that opened and closed by themselves, in sync.

“You could walk in there in August, and it was 50 degrees. You could see your breath.”

A half a dozen paranormal groups have visited the Plank House, but nobody's lasted a full night, Manerchia said.

Read more about what the investigators will be doing in the Daily Times.

We may not have found any definitive proof of extraterrestrial life just yet, despite plenty of hope among scientists.

But if we were to ever come to an answer in the form of alien biology or technology, breaking the news to the general public could be much more difficult than one might think. As Time reports, the subject comes with an enormous amount of baggage, from preconceived notions of what alien life could look like from popular culture to fears over the implications of confirming we're not alone.

“The search for life in space isn't just a science question,” Portland State University Brianne Suldovsky told the magazine. “It's a moral question, it's a philosophical question, for some it's a religious question.”

Suldovsky compared communicating the unknowns and managing fear to lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. Except, when it comes to xenobiology, “you're talking about planetary protection.”

“Managing public fear is going to be incredibly challenging, however it is possible to communicate in a way that at least gives the public information about how afraid they should be and what they can do to protect themselves,” she said.

Though evidence of alien life remains elusive, it's certainly not for a lack of trying by researchers. Just over the last couple of years, we've launched numerous missions to probe distant and theoretically habitable worlds. Most recently, NASA launched its Pandora Space Telescope, which was specifically designed to study transiting exoplanets for the building blocks of life.

Yet conveying any tantalizing clues about life beyond Earth would be a challenge, as data from these kinds of missions would be limited to spikes of molecules in spectrograph readings, leaving it to communicators and other intermediaries to make sense of the findings.

Fortunately, NASA has already come up with a way to distinguish between subtle evidence and glowing neon signs that alien life does indeed exist. The agency's Confidence of Life Detection scale was designed to provide a “framework for evaluating potential evidence of life beyond Earth,” ranging from Level 1, a “detection of a signal known to result from a biological activity,” to Level 7, or “independent, follow-up observations of predicted biological behavior in the environment.”

Even with the existence of such a framework, the public continues to be bombarded with plenty of noise, particularly following the advent of AI and the ensuing flood of disinformation. Cutting through this noise to confidently convey the stakes involved and exactly how far we are along in confirming the existence of alien life could be mission critical.

In a 2024 white paper Suldovsky coauthored alongside a team of communications experts and scientists, researchers urged for “fostering inclusivity and collaborating with artists, educators, and communicators.”

“It is helpful to view astrobiology discoveries and communication as part of a broader landscape of public trust in science, education, and internal scientific challenges, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, especially with experts in risk and uncertainty communication,” they wrote. 

“The outcome of a future tentative discovery of life depends partly on these proactive efforts,” the researchers concluded.

Before playing Mary Poppins, starring in Oscar-winning Christopher Nolan films, and marrying John Krasinski, Emily Blunt appeared in an overlooked horror flick — one that came out a year after her breakthrough turn in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Sadly, the movie in question, ""Wind Chill"" didn't have anywhere near the impact of director David Frankel's beloved comedy drama right before that. But that's not to say it isn't worth a revisit, especially since it's streaming right now on Netflix.

Back in 2007, Blunt was riding a nice little post-""Devil Wears Prada"" wave. It would be a while before she risked her life for one of Denis Villeneuve's best movies in 2015's ""Sicario"" or starred alongside Tom Cruise in his best sci-fi movie, ""Edge of Tomorrow."" But her star was very much on the rise, and 2007 was busy for the young actor, who appeared in four films that year: ""The Jane Austen Book Club,"" ""Dan in Real Life,"" ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" and ""Wind Chill.""

The last of these movies saw Blunt portray a college student who shares a ride home for the holidays with a classmate. After being involved in a near-miss, however, the pair become stranded and encounter the ghosts of those who perished on thae snowy, deserted roadway. Is ""Wind Chill"" one of the best horror movies ever made? I think you already know the answer to that. Is it worth a watch anyway? Absolutely.

After ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (which will soon receive a sequel with ""The Devil Wears Prada 2""), Emily Blunt received widespread acclaim for her lead performance as the titular monarch in 2009's ""The Young Victoria."" But her output between her 2006 breakthrough and that celebrated period drama is sort of a lost era in the British actor's story. What's more, several of her projects from that time are decent, including the perpetually-overlooked ""Dan in Real Life,"" which briefly featured Blunt and starred Steve Carell as he, too, was becoming a major star in the wake of ""The Office.""

The similarly overlooked ""Wind Chill"" also belongs to this era. This supernatural horror film was directed by Steven Soderbergh's longtime producer Gregory Jacobs, who's also helmed 2004's ""Criminal"" and ""Magic Mike XXL"" and ""Blackway,"" both of which came out in 2015. His second go round in the director's chair, ""Wind Chill"" starred Blunt and Ashton Holmes as unnamed college students.

The two classmates share a ride home from their Pennsylvania campus for the winter break, which starts off well enough as the pair get to know one another. Soon, however, it becomes clear that Holmes' ""Guy"" knows more about Blunt's ""Girl"" than he initially let on, culminating with them being run off the road by another car and buried in snow on a remote stretch of road. Things start to take an even more terrifying turn when the couple are then approached by a cop who initially seems like their salvation, only to yank Blunt's character out of her car, forcing her co-rider to attack him. The girl thus finds herself completely alone and forced to grapple with the increasingly supernatural events that unfold.

""Wind Chill"" was Emily Blunt's first foray into horror, which makes it a great movie to watch if you loved her work in films like ""A Quiet Place Part II."" That's doubly true since Blunt is on her own for large stretches of the movie and handles the task of carrying the story impressively, much like she would later with the ""Quiet Place"" movies. This is partly what makes ""Wind Chill"" worth streaming on Netflix. It's an early example of the actor's talents, which would come to the forefront as her career progressed but were strikingly sharp even back in 2007.

Unfortunately, ""Wind Chill"" only received average reviews. The film bears a 44% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, with several critics dismissing it outright. That said, ""Wind Chill"" had its fans. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the movie, ""for all its flaws, is an often spooky and imaginative ghost story that contains a genuine creepiness."" The New York Times' Andy Webster similarly enjoyed the film, which he described as a ""moody, spooky tale, rendered with laudable economy."" The movie has also fared well enough with more contemporary viewers on Letterboxd, where there's no shortage of three and four-star ratings.

So, if you're a fan of Blunt's work — especially her performances in horror fare such as the aforementioned ""A Quiet Place"" films and the 2016 thriller ""The Girl on the Train"" — and have yet to watch ""Wind Chill,"" then you could do a heck of a lot worse than this perhaps unfairly-dismissed early 2000s horror offering. Again, the movie is currently streaming on Netflix.","{'href': 'https://www.slashfilm.com', 'title': 'SlashFilm'}","other"

Let's get this out of the way first: no one is saying aliens are lining up to beam Ohioans into the sky.

But according to a new study called the Alien Abduction Odds Index 2026, people in Ohio do report alien abduction–style experiences often enough that the state landed squarely in the middle of the national rankings. That's right. Ohio ranks 21st in the U.S. for alien abduction odds, which somehow feels exactly right for us.

The study, published by Canada Sports Betting, analyzed UFO and abduction-related reports across the U.S. and Canada between 2019 and 2024. Instead of predicting alien encounters, it looked at patterns. Where do people consistently report strange lights, missing time, or close encounters year after year?

And yes, Ohio made the list.

Despite the dramatic name, this index is less X-Files and more data spreadsheet.

Researchers pulled reports from the National UFO Reporting Center and the Canadian UFO Survey, then adjusted them based on population. That way, heavily populated states like California didn't automatically rise to the top just because more people live there.

The end result was an “implied probability” ranking that shows where abduction-style reports show up more often compared to other places. Ohio's implied probability came out to 1.13 percent, which the study translates to roughly one reported abduction-style experience for every 11,300 residents.

Important note: the study does not claim these experiences are real alien encounters. It tracks reports, not proof.

In other words, this is about where people say strange things happened, not whether they actually did.

If you're wondering where the real hotspots are, they're not where most people expect.

New Hampshire topped the list, followed by states like Idaho, Vermont, and Maine. These places report UFO sightings at much higher rates per capita, and a surprising number of those reports include claims of missing time or close encounters.

Ohio didn't crack the top 20, but researchers noted something interesting. Reports here are consistent. They show up across cities, suburbs, and rural areas rather than clustering in one specific region.

That consistency is what keeps Ohio on the radar.

As one analyst put it, when you map these reports out year after year, the same states keep appearing. Ohio is one of them.

If all of this feels oddly familiar, there's a reason.

Ohio has deep roots in UFO lore, largely thanks to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton. From 1947 to 1969, the U.S. Air Force ran Project Blue Book out of Wright-Patt, investigating thousands of UFO reports across the country.

According to declassified National Security Agency documents, Project Blue Book ultimately found no evidence that UFOs posed a national security threat or were linked to extraterrestrial life. Many sightings were chalked up to aircraft, weather phenomena, or misidentified objects.

Still, the fact that Ohio was at the center of the country's most famous UFO investigation helped cement its place in American UFO culture.

Even today, reports continue. The National UFO Reporting Center logged multiple Ohio sightings in January alone, including reports from Toledo, Hilliard, and Chillicothe. Most had plausible explanations, like lanterns or aircraft, but not all came with a clear answer.

One of the more interesting parts of the study isn't about aliens at all. It's about people.

Researchers looked at factors like sleep patterns, fatigue, and public awareness. The idea is that exhaustion, stress, and heightened curiosity can all influence how people perceive and report unusual experiences.

Add in social media, decades of UFO pop culture, and a general sense that “something weird is always happening,” and it's not hard to see why stories like these persist.

NASA even launched its own study of unidentified anomalous phenomena in 2022. Their conclusion so far? There isn't enough high-quality data to make definitive claims, and many sightings likely have ordinary explanations.

Which brings us back to Ohio.

Probably not.

But Ohio does sit at a crossroads of military history, aviation, rural darkness, and densely populated metro areas. It's a place where planes, satellites, drones, and weather phenomena cross paths constantly. It's also a place where people pay attention and talk about what they see.

That combination makes Ohio fertile ground for reports, stories, and speculation.

And honestly, that might be the most Ohio thing of all.

Whether you see this study as entertaining, unsettling, or just another weird statistic to file away, it adds one more chapter to the state's long relationship with the unexplained. If nothing else, it's a reminder that even in the Midwest, things can get a little strange.

Just maybe keep an eye on the sky.
You know. For research.

Could anyone have predicted the legs that the Air Jordan 4 RM has displayed at the outset? Perhaps reading between the lines in the original Nigel Sylvester attachment would've led you to the fact that this wasn't just any new model for the Swoosh, but still, it's worth acknowledging that the takedown model is now entering its third calendar year as a catalog mainstay.

Should the Air Jordan 4 itself stumble from its perch as the hottest thing going for the Jumpman, perhaps the runoff effect on the RestoMod silo would lead that to change. Yet for the time being, it's all systems go for both parent and child, the RM still offering a more cost-conscious way into the AJ4 moment. As warmer weather starts to peek over the horizon, the Air Jordan 4 RM splits the difference between the current season and the upcoming one with a women's “Psychic Blue.” An overall brightened palette speaks to the latter, but the chilly choice of light blue accents running through the midsole and containment cage brings frosty vibes to the fore.

Expect the Air Jordan 4 RM “Psychic Blue” to hit Nike.com and partnering retailers in short order; women's sizing and a $155 sticker price are confirmed. We'll keep our Jordan Release Dates 2026 hub and this page up to date with direct pick-up links once this pair does indeed touch down.

An article about AI combatting conspiracy theories, co-authored by Cornell psychology researchers Gordon Pennycook and David Rand with a collaborator, has won the 2026 Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The association's oldest award, the prize is given to the authors of an outstanding research article published in the journal Science.

“Durably Reducing Conspiracy Beliefs Through Dialogues With AI,” first published Sept. 13, 2024 in Science, shows that conversations with large language models can effectively reduce individuals' belief in conspiracy theories – and that these reductions last for at least two months. The finding offers new insights into the psychological mechanisms behind the phenomenon as well as potential tools to fight conspiracies' spread.

The award includes a $25,000 prize and will be presented during the AAAS Annual Meeting, held Feb. 12-14 in Phoenix.

“We are very honored to receive this prize and delighted that the committee saw the value of leveraging new technological innovations in generative AI to better understand our own psychology,” Pennycook said.

Pennycook, associate professor of psychology and Dorothy and Ariz Mehta Faculty Leadership Fellow in College of Arts and Sciences (A&S) and David Rand, professor in Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business and A&S, authored the study with Thomas Costello, lead author and assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

According to Pennycook, the AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize last went to a social science article in 1981, to a foundational paper by political scientist Robert Axelrod and evolutionary biologist William Hamilton, “The Evolution of Cooperation.”

In contemporary critical discourse on Islam, significant attention is often devoted to the violence associated with this religion—whether through the history of Arab-Islamic conquests, modern terrorist acts committed in the name of Allah, or Quranic verses calling for religious warfare and corporal punishments. For many critics of the foundational sacred texts of Islam, the physical violence endorsed in these scriptures appears to be the most obvious problem to demonstrate and denounce. 


Thus, for example, when Allah states, in verse 34 of surah 4 of the Quran, that husbands must strike disobedient wives, one should easily conclude that domestic violence is compatible with Islam. Likewise, when Allah states, in verse 2 of surah 24, that those who engage in sexual intercourse outside of marriage must be punished with one hundred lashes, it should be concluded that private sexual life is subject to surveillance and even sanction in Islam.

I am, of course, able to distinguish between the sacred texts of Islam and those who believe in them. A religion should not necessarily be held responsible for the behavior of its followers. However, everything Allah says in the Quran necessarily commits Islam, since the only official and supreme author of Islam, capable of defining what Islam is or is not, is Allah himself. This paradigm is the founding dogma of the Quran, which is claimed to be, from the first to the last verse, the word of a perfect God who neither lies nor errs, valid at all times and in all places until the Day of Judgment. It is therefore impossible, for example, to reform the criminalization of freedom of conscience in Islam, because, according to the Quran, Allah has declared that those who do not believe in the Quranic verses (surah 4, verse 56) or in Allah and His Prophet Muhammad (surah 48, verse 13), will be eternally tortured in Hell after death. 

This eternal promise, which will be fulfilled at the end of times, cannot logically be revoked by any human, temporal, or earthly decision preceding that end. Moreover, reforming Islam would amount to asking inherently weak, flawed, and sinful humans (surah 4, verse 28) to contradict and disavow Allah, the best of judges (surah 7, verse 87), who sent down a book whose verses are perfect (surah 11, verse 1); such a request is absurd from the perspective of this religion.

Most of the peaceful and Westernized Muslims I have encountered in my life rarely seem shaken in their faith by the most violent Quranic passages that call for hatred and punishment of innocent people condemned merely for their freedom or differences. The apparent casualness of peaceful believers in the face of their god's warlike words often has a psychological root: cognitive dissonance.

Faith in Islam rests, among other things, on the belief that the Quran is a perfect text revealed by a just God who fights injustice. Yet for a Muslim living in a modern Western society where nonviolence, freedom of conscience, and equality of rights are sacred values, the violence advocated by Allah in the Quran contradicts the ideal of peace, which is the most consensual political and social argument possible. To resolve this dissonance, the peaceful Muslim generally adopts the strategy of avoidance. And what better way to deny the cause or consequence of a problem than to deny its very existence—or worse, to present it as a benefit? 

In order to survive in the 21st century where fact-checking scrutinizes religious texts as thoroughly as political discourse, apologists of Islam have mastered the art of reinterpreting Quranic verses. These rhetorical sleights of hand—transforming every instance of the verbs “kill” or “fight” in Allah's speech into a plea for tolerance and dialogue—obviously comfort peaceful and Westernized Muslims in their idealistic—yet illusory—vision of Islam. Many Muslims who follow a “religion of peace, love, and tolerance” will tell themselves that “The unbelievers to be fought must have been violent people against whom Allah called for self-defense” or “The domestic violence encouraged by Allah must surely consist of using purely symbolic violence through oratorical eloquence to bring reason to an unreasonable wife.”

As an ex-Muslim who has devoted many years to studying the logic and meaning of Quranic verses, I argue that it is more effective to discuss faith with other Muslims by speaking of science rather than violence. Muslims today often dismiss criticisms of the violence in Allah's words as merely subjective, whereas science, facts, evidence, and even mathematics are seen as more objective.

The best apologists for Islam have certainly developed a whole arsenal of sophisms to relativize or justify the slightest violent word in the Quran, but the contradictions and scientific errors of an infallible god, supposed to know everything and never err, are harder to dispute. For this reason, in my book 100 Contradictions and Scientific Errors in the Quran (which is my best-known work, here in France), I have thoroughly identified and analyzed an encyclopedic list of the 100 greatest lexical, scientific, narrative, mathematical, dialectical, and historical contradictions found in the Quran. I present two of them here, starting with a Quranic narrative contradiction. Allah, in the Quran, sometimes recounts the same historical event in two different surahs, such as when He announces to Zachariah through His angels that the latter will have a son, named John. But in both of these surahs the human behind Allah's pen made the mistake of presenting the event with verbatim quotations, specifically first-person statements. 

So what did Zachariah reply when Allah sent him the announcement of John's birth? According to verse 40 of surah 3, Allah claims that Zachariah, surprised, responded: “My Lord, how will I have a boy when I have reached old age and my wife is barren?” Yet in verse 8 of surah 19, Allah claims that Zachariah at that same moment said: “My Lord, how will I have a boy when my wife is barren and I have reached extreme old age?” These two Quranic citations, between surahs 3 and 19, supposedly quoting the same statement made by Zachariah during a unique and precise event, should have been word-for-word identical. However, they invert the order of the two arguments relative to one another and feature a differing adjective—present in one but absent in the other. Each version of the historical and factual truth contradicts and invalidates the other, even though both are meant to be equally divine. The discrepancy between these verbatim quotes demonstrates that if the author of the Quran can contradict his own work, even his most fervent believers can do so as well.

Let us take another example of incoherence in the Quran, which leaves little room for subjectivity: mathematical errors. Several of Allah's Quranic instructions regarding the calculation of inheritance shares are simply impossible to apply, as they contradict one another. For instance, in verse 12 of surah 4, Allah affirms that if a person dies without leaving any parent or child, but has a brother or a sister, then each of them is to receive one sixth of the inheritance: “And if a man or woman dies leaving no father, no mother and no child, but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth.” 

Let us now consider the two only possible interpretations of this instruction, which contains a subtle ambiguity that is difficult to discern at a glance. First, let us assume that the word “or” in the phrase “a brother or a sister” implies there is only one heir—either a brother or a sister. This would mean, according to verse 12 of surah 4, that Allah grants “a sixth” of the inheritance to the sister of a deceased person with no parent or child. However, later in the same surah, in verse 176, Allah states that the sister of a deceased person without parent or child must receive “half” of the inheritance: “Say Allah gives you a ruling about one who dies leaving no father, no mother and no child: if someone dies and has no child but has a sister, she shall have half of what he leaves.” This creates a blatant contradiction: in the same inheritance scenario, a single sister receives either one sixth or half of the estate.

To resolve this contradiction, Muslims might then be tempted to adopt the second (and only other) possible interpretation of the word “or” in “[if he] has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth,” namely that Allah is referring to two individuals: one brother plus one sister. This would mean that the brother and sister are each to receive an equal share—namely one sixth. Yet, in verse 176 of surah 4, Allah explains that in a situation involving a deceased person, if there are brothers and sisters: “a male will have the share of two females.” 

There is no coherent logic underlying these contradictory instructions. How can Allah explain that a brother must receive the same share as a sister, and then that two brothers must receive the same as four sisters? Either the Prophet Muhammad became confused with the Quran that emerged from his fallible human imagination, or other humans—careless or deceitful—completed the Quran after him as they saw fit, despite the dogma of the Quran's inviolability which attributes its authorship to Allah alone.

Until the late twentieth century, intellectual criticism of Islam's sacred texts by ex-Muslims remained confined to discreet discussions, books of testimonies, or academic works that struggled to find a place in the public debate. But with the democratization of the internet, everything changed. Rational critique of the Quran, the hadiths, and the Prophet's biography has become vastly more accessible and widespread than at any time in history.

More and more critics of Islam—ex-Muslims or not, anonymous or not—now dare to speak publicly about everything that worries them in Islam: its intolerance toward any dissenting thought, its violence, its misogyny, its scientific absurdities. Yet whether in Islamic countries, Europe, or elsewhere, ex-Muslims who criticize Islam openly remain few and often must live in hiding. Whether they live in countries where apostasy is illegal or in Western countries where they risk social death or even physical violence, many ex-Muslims fear revealing their departure from Islam to their families. Some pretend to remain Muslim.

The “battle of ideas” challenging Islam remains, even today, as stormy in the media as it is perilous to one's personal safety. According to the sacred texts and legal tradition of Islam, leaving the religion and criticizing its foundations constitutes a religious crime whose legally prescribed punishment may extend up to death. This position derives directly from hadiths—the words and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad—classified as Sahih (authentic), such as Bukhari numbers 6878 and 6922, in which the Prophet Muhammad, defined by Allah (surah 33, verse 21) as a universal behavioral model for all Muslims, declared: “Whoever changes his religion, kill him!” These sacralized statements, criminalizing the loss of faith in Islam or the conversion of a Muslim to another religion, explain why even today, among the 42 Islamic countries (by constitution or by their predominantly Muslim population), not a single one recognizes or defends the right of a Muslim to leave Islam.

            Vice President JD Vance's X account posted and then deleted a recognition of the Armenian genocide after he paid his respects at a memorial in the country on Tuesday.
    


            The original post from the vice president's account — which said Vance and second lady Usha Vance attended a wreath-laying ceremony “to honor the victims of the 1915 Armenian genocide” — broke from Trump administration policy, which does not use the word “genocide” to refer to the systematic killing and deportation of Armenians in what is now Turkey.
    


            Except for former President Joe Biden, US presidents have avoided that term for fear of damaging ties with Turkey, a key regional ally, which is currently playing a mediating role between the Trump administration and Iran.
    


            An official with the vice president sought to blame the post on staff who are not part of the delegation traveling with Vance.
    


            The Armenian National Committee of America called the deletion “a denialist action consistent with President Trump's shameful retreat from honest American remembrance of a crime recognized by all 50 states, the US Congress, the White House, and more than a dozen of our NATO allies.”
    


            Vance — the first sitting US vice president or president to visit the country — told reporters the Armenians asked him to visit the site, calling the massacre “a very terrible thing that happened a little over 100 years ago.”
    


            A Vance spokesperson told CNN: “This is an account managed by staff that primarily exists to share photos and videos of the Vice President's activities. For the Vice President's views on the substance of the question, I refer you to the comments he made earlier on the tarmac in response to the pool's question.”
    


            Vance said he visited the site “out of a sign of respect, both for the victims, but also for the Armenian government.”
    


            “Obviously, I'm the first vice president to ever visit Armenia. They asked us to visit the site. Obviously, it's a very terrible thing that happened a little over 100 years ago, and something that was just very, very important to them culturally,” said Vance, who added he also plans to visit important sites in Azerbaijan.
    


            The White House's rapid response X account posted — but later deleted —Vance's comments on visiting the memorial. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            The official VP account later reposted a post from Vance press secretary Taylor Van Kirk that showed the second couple at the wreath-laying and included a photo of Vance's handwritten note in a guest book.
    


            “In solemn remembrance of the lives lost, we honor the resilience and enduring spirit of the Armenian people,” the vice president wrote.
    


            The number of Armenians killed has been a major point of contention. Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire. But most estimates — including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves — fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million.
    


            Whether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922.
    


            In 2021, Biden became the first US president to officially recognize the massacre as a genocide, with a statement marking its anniversary that said, “Each year on this day, we remember the lives of all those who died in the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring.” The statement was welcomed by Armenia but condemned by Turkey, which maintains the killings were part of war time and that there were losses on both sides.
    


            Last year, the Trump administration issued a statement on April 24 commemorating “Meds Yeghern,” an Armenian term, without translating it into English as genocide.
    


            “Beginning in 1915, one and a half million Armenians were exiled and marched to their deaths in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. On this Day of Remembrance, we again join the Great Armenian Community in America, and around the World, in mourning the many lives that were lost,” the statement said.
    


            During the first Trump administration, the White House asked Republican senators to block the unanimous consent request on a resolution recognizing the mass killings of Armenians from 1915 to 1923 as genocide, on the grounds that it could undercut negotiations with Turkey. The resolution passed the House and Senate in 2019.

Khanna, who co-sponsored the Epstein transparency act, named six people including Victoria's Secret tycoon Leslie Wexner on the House floor

US commerce secretary says he had lunch with Epstein on private island

Jeffrey Epstein plotted with lawyer to try to have woman deported

On the House floor today, congressman Ro Khanna named the six high-profile men that are included in the unredacted version of the documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein.

Khanna named, US businessman Leslie Wexner of Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch and Bath & Body Works fame; Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem; and Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov, and Nicola Caputo.

“If we found six men that they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those 3m files,” Khanna said. “Why are they protecting these rich and powerful men? People I call part of the ‘Epstein class'. Why are we in a country where there is no elite accountability for people who do the most heinous things?”

A reminder that this week, the California Democrat went to the Department of Justice with Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman who co-led the Epstein Files Transparency Act effort, to view the unredacted files. The justice department made their most recent release of documents available for members of Congress to view in-person. On Monday, Khanna and Massie the pair had to do “some digging” before finding the new names, they told reporters.

Back in Washington, Karoline Leavitt is speaking to reporters at the White House.

She kicked things off by noting the new images and video released by the FBI in the case of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, and urged those with any information to contact federal law enforcement.

Leavitt also noted that Trump will host Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters today, Minnesota governor Tim Walz said that he spoke recently to border czar Tom Homan and Susie Wiles, the president's chief of staff, and expects the immigration crackdown in the state to end in a matter of days.

“We're very much in a trust but verify mode,” Walz said. “We are talking days, not weeks and months of this occupation.”

Walz added he was wary of speaking candidly for fear of retaliation. “I'm very careful with dealing with this administration,” he said. “I'll let them make the announcements. We have been absolutely clear that they need to reduce these [federal immigration enforcement] numbers back to the pre surge level.”

The FBI released new images from security camera footage outside Nancy Guthrie's home on the morning of 1 February, the day the 84-year-old went missing.

The images and video show a figure wearing a ski mask, gloves and a backpack. Strapped to the person's waist is what appears to be a gun.

The latest imagery was recovered after the FBI, Pima county sheriff's department and “private sector partners” continued their search for pictures or footage that may have been “lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors – including the removal of recording devices”, according to FBI director Kash Patel. “The video was recovered from residual data located in backend systems,” he added.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, had lunch with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on the disgraced financier's private island, he said on Tuesday, as he faces mounting calls to resign from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

“I did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation” in 2012, Lutnick said in testimony on Tuesday before the Senate appropriations subcommittee.

“My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies,” said Lutnick. “I had another couple with – they were there as well, with their children.”

“And we had lunch on the island, that is true, for an hour,” he added.

Lutnick had previously claimed that he distanced himself from Epstein in 2005. But the latest tranche of files shows the commerce secretary discussing visiting the sex offender's island in 2012 – four years after Epstein was sentenced to 13 months in jail for procuring a minor for prostitution.

Today, Chuck Schumer held a press conference with a small group of Jeffrey Epstein's victims to announce a law that seeks to eliminate the statute of limitations for certain sexual offenses.

“The bill exists because people refuse to accept silence as the end of the story. It's that simple,” Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, said.

Schumer said the bill was named in honor of Virginia Giuffre, one of the most vocal Epstein survivors who died by suicide in April 2025.

“Justice should not expire, because for survivors healing does not run on a government clock,” he said. “For years, survivors of Epstein's abuse were ignored ... Even when the world finally listened, too many survivors were still told by the law, ‘It's too late, your justice has expired.'
 “Virginia's law changes that.”

Several of Giuffre's relatives were emotional as they spoke at the event in the US Capitol. Her brother, Sky Roberts, was asked about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the disgraced former British royal photographed with Giuffre and Epstein's fixer, Ghislaine Maxwell, in a now infamous image.

“He should show up in front of our Congress and answer questions,” Roberts said. Mountbatten-Windsor has been accused of “hiding” from a congressional request for testimony.

On the House floor today, congressman Ro Khanna named the six high-profile men that are included in the unredacted version of the documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein.

Khanna named, US businessman Leslie Wexner of Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch and Bath & Body Works fame; Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem; and Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov, and Nicola Caputo.

“If we found six men that they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those 3m files,” Khanna said. “Why are they protecting these rich and powerful men? People I call part of the ‘Epstein class'. Why are we in a country where there is no elite accountability for people who do the most heinous things?”

A reminder that this week, the California Democrat went to the Department of Justice with Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman who co-led the Epstein Files Transparency Act effort, to view the unredacted files. The justice department made their most recent release of documents available for members of Congress to view in-person. On Monday, Khanna and Massie the pair had to do “some digging” before finding the new names, they told reporters.

In a particularly heated exchange between LaMonica McIver and Todd Lyons. The Democratic congresswoman asked the acting ICE director if he was a “particularly religious man”. After Lyons said he was, McIver went further.

“How do you think judgment day will work for you with so much blood on your hands?” she asked Lyons, who refused to “entertain” the question.

She then said: “Do you think you're going to hell, Mr Lyons?”

The committee's Republican chair Andrew Garbarino quickly interjected and asked McIver to suspend her line of questioning. “While oversight is important, aggressively attacking those witnesses personally is inappropriate,” he said.

New York Democrat Dan Goldman asks what guidance ICE agents have been given about asking people on American streets to show proof of citizenship.

Todd Lyons says ICE “conducts targeted, intelligence-driven operations. We don't walk around the streets asking people about their American citizenship.”

Goldman asks if that means all the American citizens who have been randomly asked are lying.

Lyons concedes that if ICE are conducting an investigation they'll ask someone their nationality (which … isn't the same thing).

Goldman makes the point that that, by definition, isn't “targeted”, because “they're asking all sorts of American citizens, including off-duty law enforcement officers.”

Seth Magaziner then makes a broader point, which I think is worth posting in full.

There has been no accountability in your agency under the Trump administration – none.

Your agency has repeatedly been caught on tape using unnecessary violence against civilians and you can't even tell me if any of these agents have been investigated and disciplined.

You're supposed to be making people safer and instead your agents are being unnecessarily violent, and that is why the Trump administration has lost the trust of the American people on immigration.

Understand, it's not just the actions of the agents in the field; it's the lack of accountability from the top that has caused public trust to erode, and there need to be major reforms before we vote to give any of you any funding.

Your agencies need to act like other law enforcement agencies. Take off the masks, wear badge numbers, enforce discipline with real standards of conduct – but accountability starts at the top.

Kristi Noem is completely unfit and should be removed from office. And all of the operations we have just seen were overseen by commander Gregory Bovino who himself engaged in excessive use of force.

He even admitted that he lied to a federal judge when he claimed he had been hit by a rock when he threw a teargas canister at a crowd of civilians, but after the footage came out and that turned out to not be true, he admitted that he lied about it.

He asks what disciplinary action they are going to take against Bovino, to which Rodney Scott says he can't comment.

Asked if there was an investigation, Scott gives a vague answer about every allegation regarding use of force being investigated and reviewed.

Magaziner now highlights an incident in which a federal agent sprayed pepper spray directly into the face of an individual who had already been pinned to the ground by three other agents (here's the clip, via CNN).

Is this proper procedure for the use of pepper spray, he asks.

Scott says he can't comment on that because “you're only showing one piece and that subject is clearly not compliant – ”.

Magaziner interrupts to reiterate that this is not the intended use of pepper spray. Scott says the intended use is to de-escalate.

Magaziner says being pinned to the ground by three other agents would suggest the individual had been de-escalated.

He then asks if there has been any investigation into the agent that did this, to which Scott says there are many open investigations and he'll get back to him.

Magaziner turns to an incident from last year in which an Illinois man and his US citizen family – including his one-year-old daughter – were pepper-sprayed in their car by federal immigration agents during a shopping trip in a Chicago suburb.

Is it proper procedure to aim pepper spray into the window of a moving vehicle, he asks.

At first, Rodney Scott, commissioner of CBP, says he's not familiar with all the details on this and it's an ongoing investigation, before conceding, “we try to avoid that - no, it's not proper procedure.”

Scott begins to talk about intentional vs unintentional, before Magaziner says that “from the video, this was clearly intentional”.

Asked if any of the agents involved were ever investigated and disciplined, Scott says the investigation is ongoing.

Todd Lyons is asked by Rhode Island Democrat Seth Magaziner whether ICE has hired anyone who was charged with a crime related to the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol.

After a brief pause, Lyons says he doesn't have that information, “but I would say no.”

Magaziner asks if him to find out and please report back, to which Lyons agrees.

Asked if he would hire someone who had attacked police officers on January 6, even if they were “unfortunately” pardoned by the president, Lyons replies:

Sir, we take assault on law enforcement very serious and we have a good, strenuous vetting program.

In response to a line of questioning by California Democrat Lou Correa, Todd Lyons said that an American citizen “shouldn't feel the need” to carry a passport to prove their legal status in the country. This comes amid several instances of US citizens being profiled, searched and detained by federal immigration officers during the crackdown in Minnesota and across the country.

“The number of cases of Americans being detained, being taken in, some being held for five days …What do we do with those people in that situation? What do we tell them?” Correa said.

Lyons was resolute that he was unaware of any examples of Americans detained by ICE.

Correa pushed Lyons on whether immigration enforcement is surveilling citizens, particularly protesters. “I can assure you, there is no database that's tracking United States citizens,” Lyons replied.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

			Thomas Massie has become one of the harshest critics of the administration from within the Republican Party

During a speech in Louisville, Kentucky, in November 2019, Donald Trump searched the crowd for one of the state's congressmen who he had just seen on TV.

“He's so good. You can do television for me anytime you want,” Mr Trump said, peering off the stage. “Congressman Thomas Massie. Where's Thomas?”

The Kentucky representative, who endorsed Mr Trump's 2016 Make America Great Again campaign, was at one time mooted for a possible cabinet role during the president's term.

But recently, Mr Trump has heaped scorn on the man he once called a “great warrior”.

In a tirade on Truth Social in January, he described Mr Massie as a “lightweight,” “a totally ineffective LOSER,” and “the Worst “Republican” Congressman we have had in many years”.

The Libertarian and anti-interventionist Mr Massie has emerged as one of the harshest critics of the administration from within Mr Trump's own party.

Their feud began within just a matter of months of that speech in Louisville in 2019. Mr Massie forced Congress back to Washington in the midst of the pandemic over a vote on a $2tn (£1.6tn) coronavirus rescue package that he opposed. At the time, Mr Trump said he should be thrown out of the GOP, describing him as a “third rate Grandstander”.

Since the start of Mr Trump's second term, Mr Massie has challenged the president over his military intervention in Venezuela and his reluctance to release the Epstein files. “Wake up MAGA,” he posted to X after the Trump administration captured Nicolas Maduro in January. “This is not what we voted for.”

Facing a re-election battle in Kentucky against a candidate endorsed by Mr Trump, Mr Massie is showing no signs of backing off.

He has teamed up with fellow Libertarian, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, seemingly the only congressional Republican who is willing to help him out on the campaign. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial former Georgia representative who left Washington, DC, after Mr Trump branded her a “traitor”, will also be on the stoop for Mr Massie, he has said.

The fight is seen as a test of whether Mr Massie's sparring with the president will prove to be politically fatal.

Mr Massie has been criticised by administration officials for working with “radical Left Democrats,” particularly as he pushed for the release of the Epstein files.

Mr Massie worked in concert with Democratic Representative Ro Khanna to spearhead the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which ultimately led to the US department of justice (DoJ) publishing three million files last month. He was also one of only four House Republicans – along with Ms Greene, Nancy Mace and Lauren Boebert – who initially went against the president to force a vote on the release of the files in November.

Mr Trump, before his astonishing U-turn to wave the bill through, described those pushing for the release of the Epstein files as “troublemakers and radical Left lunatics”.

Lord Mandelson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Sir Keir Starmer – who is in the midst of his worst weeks in No 10 in his short premiership – all have Mr Massie to thank in part for the scandal that has erupted since then.

Mr Massie said that Lord Mandelson's ousting as British ambassador to the US is what accountability looks like.

He has recently called on a similar fate for Howard Lutnick, Mr Trump's commerce secretary, who was revealed in emails to have planned a visit to Epstein's island which he denies.

“He's got a lot to answer for, but really, he should make life easier on the president, frankly, and just resign,” Mr Massie told CNN.

The Commerce Department said in a statement: “Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing”.

Mr Massie is not finished yet.

His push for transparency over the Epstein files appears to be absolute. When the DoJ announced it was releasing three million files, Mr Massie questioned why it had not released the full six million.

He and Mr Khanna then pushed the DoJ to allow Congress to view the unredacted files. The DoJ allowed lawmakers to begin viewing the unredacted files on Monday.

“Which docs should I view?” Mr Massie asked on X at the weekend, requesting his followers like replies that highlight “docs you think are important”.

A gun-loving Republican from conservative Appalachia, the outspoken Mr Massie is no stranger to controversy. But he is far from the typical enemy of the Maga regime and embodies much of the movement.

In December 2015, he posted a photo with his family in front of a Christmas tree, in which each was holding a machine gun or military-style rifle.

“Merry Christmas! PS: Santa, please bring ammo,” he captioned it. When Kyle Rittenhouse shot three people during a protest in Wisconsin, killing two, Mr Massie said he had shown “incredible restraint”.

Others who have spoken out against Mr Trump in the past have faced dire consequences. Ms Greene left Congress, and Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Senator whom the president has branded a “loser”, has chosen to retire.

Liz Cheney, the former representative who supported the second impeachment of Mr Trump in 2021, lost her Wisconsin seat in 2022.

Mr Massie has forged his own brand of America First politics and the Kentucky race could be a bellwether for how Maga fares post-Trump. And Mr Trump's endorsement of Mr Massie's opponent Ed Gallrein, a farmer and veteran who Mr Massie has called “Woke Ed”, is a test of whether the president still has his grip on the party for now.

“I think that's one of the reasons they're attacking me and putting so much money into my race, is to keep the others in line,” Mr Massie told CNN recently. “So far, it's working.”

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — The FBI is not aware of ongoing communication between Savannah Guthrie's family and any suspected kidnappers more than a week after the “Today” show host's mom went missing, the agency said Monday.

The FBI has also not identified any suspects or persons of interest in the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, Connor Hagan, a spokesperson for the FBI, said in a statement. The agency is operating a 24-hour command post equipped with investigative teams and crisis management experts while asking for help from the public.

“Someone has that one piece of information that can help us bring Nancy home,” he said.

In a video released Monday, Savannah Guthrie said the family was “at an hour of desperation” but that they continue to believe her mother is out there and hearing everyone's prayers.

“She was taken and we don't know where, and we need your help,” Guthrie said in the video posted on Instagram, urging people nationwide to be on the lookout “no matter where you are, even if you're far from Tucson, if you see anything, if you hear anything.”

By Monday evening, a purported ransom deadline apparently set by her mom's abductors appeared to have passed.

The mysterious disappearance and search has riveted the country — from President Donald Trump, who spoke with Savannah Guthrie last week, to the online sleuths who've flooded social media with tips, theories and rumors. 




The FBI is asking for the public's help on digital billboards up in several major cities in Texas, California, Arizona and New Mexico. The FBI has offered a $50,000 reward for information.

Multiple news outlets received alleged ransom letters during the past week. At least one letter made monetary demands and set deadlines for receiving the money. The first deadline passed last Thursday and a second one was set for Monday evening.

Law enforcement officials declined to affirm that the letters were credible but said all tips were being investigated seriously. The Pima County Sheriff's Department said Monday that law enforcement tip lines have received thousands of calls.

Authorities say they have growing concerns about Nancy Guthrie's health because she needs daily medication. She is said to have a pacemaker and has dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff's dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.

In a video Saturday, Savannah Guthrie said the family was prepared to pay for her mother's return. “This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”

Authorities believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will from her home just outside Tucson. She was last seen there Jan. 31 and reported missing the next day after not attending church. DNA tests showed blood on Guthrie's front porch was a match to her, and her doorbell camera was disconnected in the early hours of Sunday morning, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said.

Speaking to reporters, Tucson resident Chuchi Ruiz, who stopped by Nancy Guthrie's house to bring flowers and offer support, says news of her disappearance has shaken the community.

Outside the home on Monday, neighbors strolled by on their morning jogs and walks, while a county sheriff's deputy remained stationed out front.

Law enforcement's work at Guthrie residences will continue Tuesday “as part of the ongoing investigative process, including the expansion of the search and follow-up on new leads,” the Pima County Sheriff's Department said in a statement Monday.

Detectives and agents carried out follow-up work in the neighborhood and other locations over the weekend as part of the investigation, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said Sunday. 

Investigators on Saturday were inside daughter Annie Guthrie's home, about 4 miles (6 kilometers) from Nancy Guthrie's house. On Sunday, an investigator was seen using a pole to search an underground tank behind Nancy Guthrie's home.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. military forces boarded a sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the ship from the Caribbean Sea as part of an oil quarantine meant to squeeze Venezuela, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday. 

Venezuela had faced U.S. sanctions on its oil and relied on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Following the U.S. raid to apprehend then-President Nicolás Maduro in early January, several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight.

Hegseth vowed to eventually capture all those ships, telling a group of shipyard workers in Maine on Monday that “the only guidance I gave to my military commanders is none of those are getting away.”

“I don't care if we got to go around the globe to get them; we're going to get them,” he added.

Later Monday, the U.S. military said it had carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

U.S. Southern Command said the strike killed two people, while one person survived. Southern Command said it had notified the U.S. Coast Guard to activate its search and rescue system for the survivor. A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames. 

Monday's attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug boats to 130 people.




The Trump administration has seized seven tankers as part of its broader efforts to take control of the South American country's oil. Unlike those previous actions, the Aquila II has not been formally seized and placed under U.S. control, a defense official said. 

Instead, the ship is being held while its ultimate fate is decided by the U.S., according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing decision-making.

The Aquila II is a Panamanian-flagged tanker under U.S. sanctions related to the shipment of illicit Russian oil. Owned by a company with a listed address in Hong Kong, ship tracking data shows it has spent much of the last year with its radio transponder turned off, a practice known as “running dark” commonly employed by smugglers to hide their location.

It was one of at least 16 tankers that fled the Venezuelan coast last month, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, who said his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document the ship's movements. According to data transmitted from the ship Monday, it is not currently laden with a cargo of crude oil.

The Pentagon's post on X said the military “conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction” on the ship. 

“The Aquila II was operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,” the Pentagon said. “It ran, and we followed.” 

A Navy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, would not say what forces were used in the operation but confirmed the destroyers USS Pinckney and USS John Finn as well as the mobile base ship USS Miguel Keith were operating in the Indian Ocean.

In videos the Pentagon posted to social media, uniformed forces can be seen boarding a Navy helicopter that takes off from a ship that matches the profile of the Miguel Keith. Video and photos of the tanker shot from inside a helicopter also show a Navy destroyer sailing alongside the ship. 

Since the U.S. ouster of Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid on Jan. 3, the Trump administration has set out to control the production, refining and global distribution of Venezuela's petroleum products. Officials in President Donald Trump's Republican administration have made it clear they see seizing the tankers as a way to generate cash as they seek to rebuild Venezuela's battered oil industry and restore its economy. 

Trump also has been trying to restrict the flow of oil to Cuba, which faces strict economic sanctions by the U.S. and relies heavily on oil shipments from allies like Mexico, Russia and Venezuela. 

Since the Venezuela operation, Trump has said that no more Venezuelan oil will go to Cuba and that the Cuban government is ready to fall. Trump also recently signed an executive order that would impose a tariff on any goods from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba, primarily pressuring Mexico because it has acted as an oil lifeline for Cuba.

Gov. Wes Moore, D-Md., joins The Sunday Briefing to discuss the response to the dangerous winter storm and his criticism of federal immigration enforcement operations following the deadly shooting in Minneapolis.

Maryland's Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, widely believed to have White House ambitions, is facing questions over the accuracy of a story about his family's background involving being forced to flee the state of South Carolina due to threats from the Ku Klux Klan. 

""I am literally the grandson of someone who was run out of this country by the Ku Klux Klan, right?"" Moore told Time magazine in 2023 in a conversation about how he ""reconciles Patriotism"" with the country's ""racist past.""

""Right? So the fact that I can be both this grandson of someone who was run outta this country by the Ku Klux Klan, and also be the first Black governor in the history of the state of Maryland.""

Moore has frequently referenced his grandfather, James Thomas, as the figure in this story, including during a 2020 appearance on the Yang Speaks podcast titled ""Wes Moore on how the KKK ran his family into exile,"" where he detailed how his grandfather was a minister in Winnsboro, South Carolina, who fled to Jamaica after being threatened by the klan.

However, a Washington Free Beacon report last week cast doubt on the specifics of that story.

The report claims that historical records from the Protestant Episcopal Church and contemporary newspaper reports indicate that Thomas's departure was not a secret, middle-of-the-night escape, but an orderly and public professional transfer after he was appointed to replace a deceased pastor in Jamaica.

Additionally, archival data and the diocese's own historical accounts suggest that the White community in Pineville, S.C., actually held Thomas's church in high regard for its medical services, with no mention of racial animus or Klan interference during his tenure.

Fox News Digital has not independently verified the claims in the report and Moore's office pushed back in a statement to Fox News.

""We're not going to litigate a family's century-old oral history with a partisan outlet,"" Moore spokesperson Ammar Moussa told Fox News Digital, in reference to the Washington Free Beacon report. ""The broader reality is not in dispute: intimidation and racial terror were pervasive in the Jim Crow South, and it rarely came with neat documentation. Even Bishop William Alexander Guerry — whom they cite to suggest there was no hostility — was later murdered amid intense backlash tied to his racial equality work. The Governor is focused on doing the job Marylanders elected him to do.""

The report on Moore's portrayal of his grandfather's life story added fuel to the fire of scrutiny the rumored 2028 White House hopeful has already faced for previous stories about his record, including questions about his military record and an Oxford University thesis, both reported on by the Washington Free Beacon and both brought up by users on social media in recent days. 

""Wes Moore is being talked about as one of the top contenders in the 2028 Democratic primary and the guy has already told more lies about his life than Elizabeth Warren,"" Greg Price, Trump White House rapid response manager for the first half of 2025, posted on X.

""Moore is reaching Biden levels of fabulism,"" National Review editor Ramesh Ponnuru posted on X.

""Hoo boy,"" Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume posted on X. ""Read this, and the post it is in response to.""

In September, Moore said he is ""not running for president"" in 2028 and is ""excited"" about serving a full term if he wins re-election in November, although many still believe he has presidential ambitions at some point in the future.

A Las Vegas flier is seen arguing with gate employees after learning her reservation did not allow multiple pets in one carrier, a confrontation captured on social media that has drawn millions of views.

A United Airlines passenger ended up in a different country after accidently boarding the wrong flight.

The passenger was headed from Los Angeles to Managua, Nicaragua, with a layover in Houston — but ended up in Tokyo, according to multiple reports.

A United Airlines spokesperson confirmed the incident to Fox News Digital.

AIRLINE PASSENGER ATTEMPTED TO OPEN PLANE DOOR IN MID-AIR, AUTHORITIES SAY

""We followed up with the airport to understand how this happened, reached out directly to the customer to apologize for his experience and offered travel credits and reimbursement,"" the spokesperson said.

""We always advise customers to monitor the signs at the gate and boarding announcements to make sure the aircraft they board is going to their intended destination,"" they added.

The passenger reportedly realized mid-flight that he or she was on the wrong flight — and asked the flight attendant why the trip to Houston was taking six hours, rather than just over three hours.

The person landed at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan — and stayed at a hotel for two nights while United sorted out a travel itinerary to the original destination.

The airline allegedly first offered a $300 travel credit as an apology — but later offered $1,000 in travel credits, the blog ""View from the Wing"" reported.

A Reddit user posted the mishap in the ""r/unitedairlines"" forum, sparking a debate about users.

Another person wrote, ""Not saying it happened here, but several airports have two or even three gates connected to the same area. Once you scan your ticket, you can get onto any of the planes.""

Rock singer Kid Rock voiced his displeasure with the choice of Bad Bunny as the performer for the Super Bowl 60 halftime show, viewing it as a “middle finger” to conservatives.

Rock led a rival halftime show, backed by Turning Point USA, following conservative backlash over the choice of Bad Bunny. In an appearance on Fox News, the Trump-supporting singer bashed the choice of Bunny, saying the performance was an insult to the MAGA movement.

After going over the most recent performances, painting it as a steady decline into politicization, he said the choice of the Puerto Rican star was a bridge too far.

“To me, it was kind of just like, another middle finger to conservatives, to the MAGA crowd, to my base, to everything,” he said.

Later in the interview, however, Rock was more charitable toward Bunny when asked about the performance's content, though he added that he “didn't understand any of it.”

“I mean, I saw there's a lot of dancers and a lot of big to-do stuff,” Rock said. “And you know, he said he wanted to have a dance party. Looked like he had one, you know, not my cup of tea. But I don't fault that kid for doing the Super Bowl, getting in front of a global audience. I fault the … NFL for putting them in that position. Poor kid.”

Rock previously performed in the 2004 Super Bowl alongside Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson.

“Nobody remembers I played the Super Bowl because that was when Janet Jackson showed her boob,” he joked. “Nobody remembers I was on that thing.”

TPUSA's “All-American Halftime Show” featured performances from Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Gabby Barrett, and Brice Lee. Both shows aired approximately around the same time.

TURNING POINT USA CELEBRATES ‘OVER 20 MILLION' VIEWERS FOR ITS ‘ALL-AMERICAN HALFTIME SHOW'

There are conflicting accounts of the total number of viewers, given that it was broadcast across several different platforms, but Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of TPUSA's The Charlie Kirk Show, said the total may have exceeded 20 million viewers.

Though an impressive viewership, it was dwarfed by Bunny's over 135 million viewers, the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show of all time.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The world is threatened by the president's self-absorption and incoherence.

Donald Trump has achieved an unlikely redemption: By pursuing a shambolic foreign policy, he has made the bygone days of “regime change” look restrained, strategic, and pragmatic by comparison.

Trump campaigned in 2024 saying he would begin “no new wars,” eschew “regime change” and “nation building,” and generally prioritize domestic policy over foreign affairs. No more Coalition Provisional Authority, as in Iraq. No more extended U.S. military deployments, as in Afghanistan.

But Trump has instead opted for global buccaneering: attacking Islamic terrorists in Nigeria, launching pinprick swipes at Yemen's Houthis, and seeking a massive, elusive trade deal with China. He has inserted himself as a would-be governing force into lands as diverse as Venezuela, the Gaza Strip, and Greenland. He has done so inconsistently and incoherently, unguided by theory or history, improvising at will, painting with real-estate salesmanship futures that bear little connection to reality and threaten potentially disastrous consequences for America if he fails.

This is much worse as a policy model than “regime change” ever was. At least regime change had some logic behind it: If reforming the behavior of a hostile regime is impossible, replace it with one more friendly and, hopefully, more democratic. Do so when the likely benefits outweigh the likely costs.

Trump's intervention in Venezuela doesn't come close to meeting this bar. Both the Biden and the Trump administrations recognized Edmundo González as Venezuela's legitimate president, the winner of the 2024 election that Nicolás Maduro stole. Removing the usurpers and replacing them with a legitimate, democratically elected government would have been a justifiable choice.

Read: The Venezuelan opposition's desperate gamble

But that's not what Trump did. He removed Maduro, yes, but he kept the rest of Maduro's gang, such as Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, in place. Meanwhile, he sidelined the opposition, leaving them without the necessary respect and power to stabilize and ultimately govern. One can certainly debate from case to case what part of any given “regime” must be eliminated, and what is simply the civil bureaucracy that should remain functional. In hindsight, America's de-Baathification program in Iraq overdid the change. In Venezuela, Trump barely scratched the surface. Additionally, he has posted on Truth Social an image of himself as the acting president of Venezuela and another that showed Venezuela as U.S. territory (and Canada and Greenland, too, for that matter).

None of this provides the stability that Venezuela needs to encourage foreign investment in its oil sector and produce revenues that could revive the economy and thereby facilitate a transition to democratic rule. Investors like to see, among other things, at least a rudimentary rule-of-law society, which doesn't exist under the present regime. Exxon's CEO, Darren Woods, who may know more about the oil business than Trump, declared the country “uninvestable.” Some Venezuelan oil previously blocked from export by the U.S. has now been sold, and the proceeds, which were deposited into a Qatari bank account, are now being transferred to Venezuela's banks. By authorizing the provision of funds to Delcy Rodríguez and her government, Trump's administration is strengthening Rodríguez's regime at the opposition's expense. How can that end well?

Trump has no answer. By contrast, in the Gaza Strip, he has an answer that would make 19th-century imperialists blush. Without any evidence that Hamas is prepared to allow the demilitarization of Gaza, Trump has formed, and plans to chair and essentially control, a “Board of Peace,” currently composed of approximately 20 governments. Most European countries have declined to join (with a few exceptions including Hungary, Belarus, and Bulgaria); Russia may be a member, or maybe not; China has been invited but is checking its dance card; Israel joined but is very unhappy; and Canada has been disinvited. The board is meant to oversee everything in Trump's faltering Middle East peace plan, following the release of Israeli hostages.

Trump appears to have near-total control over the board's decisions, which implies a desire to personally rule over Gaza, especially given that the board's “executive committee” includes his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his special envoy to the Middle East, the New York real-estate developer Steve Witkoff. Trump called for initial dues of $1 billion, which, if each new member chipped in, would amount to an impressive, unaccountable slush fund. Without, however, first achieving Hamas's disarmament and creating some sort of international peacekeeping force to provide security, there will never be a new eastern-Mediterranean Riviera. Nothing about these dreams bears any relationship to Gaza's current reality.

Trump seems to have even greater ambitions for the board, such as undertaking as yet unspecified good works in Ukraine and Venezuela. The board has the earmarks of a new British East India Company in the making.

And then there is Trump's Greenland adventure. First he threatened military force to seize Greenland and renew tariff wars against European allies. Then he swiftly reversed field, accepting a still-evolving plan hatched with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to forestall a disastrous split in the Atlantic alliance. Trump's script matched the nursery rhyme about the Duke of York's 10,000 men: “He marched them up to the top of the hill / And marched them down again.” As of now, Trump's ploy is stillborn. His play at regime change against a treaty ally caused deep distress in Europe and undoubtedly weakened NATO significantly. It also delighted the Kremlin, which goes to show how badly mistaken the entire episode was from the get-go.

Read: The fuck-around-and-find-out presidency

Iran seems to be one place where Trump is actively considering regime change. In a shift from his first-term views, Trump said expressly, “It's time to look for new leadership in Iran.” He justified this position, ironically, on neoconservative grounds—the brutal repression of Iran's people—and not on U.S. geostrategic interests in quashing Tehran's nuclear-weapons program and its support for international terrorism.

But, as usual, he didn't seem to know what he would be getting into. Based on his Venezuela approach, one might think Trump would consider eliminating the supreme leader and dealing instead with the Revolutionary Guard. But no, for whatever reason, Trump seemed to lean toward real regime change—which is, just coincidentally, the right answer—a complete U-turn from Venezuela. The only consistency is that, here again, Trump has left the opposition twisting in the wind. In January, he exhorted: “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING—TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! … HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!” So far, no help has come. Facing massacre by their rulers, protesters have stayed indoors and feel betrayed by Trump.

Around the world, and in America, wonderment at Trump's infinite variety of “policy” choices is giving way to the realization that Trump doesn't do “policy.” Or philosophy. Or grand strategy. He does Donald Trump. Among regular Republicans still holding to a Reaganite (or Reagan-Bush) national-security paradigm, vocal dissent—long overdue—is emerging. It needs to grow quickly before Trump's self-absorption causes even more damage. His incoherence on regime change is only one piece of evidence in the larger picture of his unfitness to be president.

Does anyone have a plan for what happens next?

In 1869, a group of Massachusetts reformers persuaded the state to try a simple idea: counting.

The Second Industrial Revolution was belching its way through New England, teaching mill and factory owners a lesson most M.B.A. students now learn in their first semester: that efficiency gains tend to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is usually somebody else. The new machines weren't just spinning cotton or shaping steel. They were operating at speeds that the human body—an elegant piece of engineering designed over millions of years for entirely different purposes—simply wasn't built to match. The owners knew this, just as they knew that there's a limit to how much misery people are willing to tolerate before they start setting fire to things.

Still, the machines pressed on.

So Massachusetts created the nation's first Bureau of Statistics of Labor, hoping that data might accomplish what conscience could not. By measuring work hours, conditions, wages, and what economists now call “negative externalities” but were then called “children's arms torn off,” policy makers figured they might be able to produce reasonably fair outcomes for everyone. Or, if you're a bit more cynical, a sustainable level of exploitation. A few years later, with federal troops shooting at striking railroad workers and wealthy citizens funding private armories—leading indicators that things in your society aren't going great—Congress decided that this idea might be worth trying at scale and created the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Measurement doesn't abolish injustice; it rarely even settles arguments. But the act of counting—of trying to see clearly, of committing the government to a shared set of facts—signals an intention to be fair, or at least to be caught trying. Over time, that intention matters. It's one way a republic earns the right to be believed in.

The BLS remains a small miracle of civilization. It sends out detailed surveys to about 60,000 households and 120,000 businesses and government agencies every month, supplemented by qualitative research it uses to check and occasionally correct its findings. It deserves at least some credit for the scoreboard. America: 250 years without violent class warfare. And you have to appreciate the entertainment value of its minutiae. The BLS is how we know that, in 2024, 44,119 people worked in mobile food services (a.k.a. food trucks), up 907 percent since 2000; that nonveterinary pet care (grooming, training) employed 190,984 people, up 513 percent; and that the United States had almost 100,000 massage therapists, with five times the national concentration in Napa, California.

From the February 2026 issue: Alexandra Petri tried to be the federal government. It did not go well.

These and thousands of other BLS statistics describe a society that has grown more prosperous, and a workforce endlessly adaptive to change. But like all statistical bodies, the BLS has its limits. It's excellent at revealing what has happened and only moderately useful at telling us what's about to. The data can't foresee recessions or pandemics—or the arrival of a technology that might do to the workforce what an asteroid did to the dinosaurs.

I am referring, of course, to artificial intelligence. After a rollout that could have been orchestrated by H. P. Lovecraft—“We are summoning the demon,” Elon Musk warned in a typical early pronouncement—the AI industry has pivoted from the language of nightmares to the stuff of comas. Driving innovation. Accelerating transformation. Reimagining workflows. It's the first time in history that humans have invented something genuinely miraculous and then rushed to dress it in a fleece vest.

There are gobs of money to be made selling enterprise software, but dulling the impact of AI is also a useful feint. This is a technology that can digest a hundred reports before you've finished your coffee, draft and analyze documents faster than teams of paralegals, compose music indistinguishable from the genius of a pop star or a Juilliard grad, code—really code, not just copy-paste from Stack Overflow—with the precision of a top engineer. Tasks that once required skill, judgment, and years of training are now being executed, relentlessly and indifferently, by software that learns as it goes.

AI is already so ubiquitous that any resourceful knowledge worker can delegate some of their job's drudgery to machines. Many companies—Microsoft and PricewaterhouseCoopers among them—have instructed their employees to increase productivity by doing just that. But anyone subcontracting tasks to AI is clever enough to imagine what might come next—a day when augmentation crosses into automation, and cognitive obsolescence compels them to seek work at a food truck, pet spa, or massage table. At least until the humanoid robots arrive.

Many economists insist that this will all be fine. Capitalism is resilient. The arrival of the ATM famously led to the employment of more bank tellers, just as the introduction of Excel swelled the ranks of accountants and Photoshop spiked demand for graphic designers. In each case, new tech automated old tasks, increased productivity, and created jobs with higher wages than anyone could have conceived of before. The BLS projects that employment will grow 3.1 percent over the next 10 years. That's down from 13 percent in the previous decade, but 5 million new jobs in a country with a stable population is hardly catastrophic.

And yet: There are things that economists struggle to measure. Americans tend to derive meaning and identity from what they do. Most don't want to do something else, even if they had any confidence—which they don't—that they could find something else to do. Seventy-one percent of respondents to an August Reuters/Ipsos poll said they're worried that artificial intelligence will “put too many people out of work permanently.”

This data point might be easier to dismiss if the modern mill and factory owners hadn't already declared that AI will put people out of work permanently.

In May 2025, Dario Amodei, the CEO of the AI company Anthropic, said that AI could drive unemployment up 10 to 20 percent in the next one to five years and “wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.” Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, estimated that it would eliminate “literally half of all white-collar workers” in a decade. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, revealed that “my little group chat with my tech-CEO friends” has a bet about the inevitable date when a billion-dollar company is staffed by just one person. (The business side of this magazine, like some other publishers, has a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) Other companies, including Meta, Amazon, UnitedHealth, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and UPS, which have recently announced layoffs, have framed them more euphemistically in sunny reports to investors about the rise of “automation” and “head count trending down.” Taken together, these statements are extraordinary: the owners of capital warning workers that the ice beneath them is about to crack—while continuing to stomp on it.

It's as if we're watching two versions of the same scene. In one, the ice holds, because it always has. In the other, a lot of people go under. The difference becomes clear only when the surface finally gives way—at which point the range of available options will have considerably narrowed.

AI is already transforming work, one delegated task at a time. If the transformation unfolds slowly enough and the economy adjusts quickly enough, the economists may be right: We'll be fine. Or better. But if AI instead triggers a rapid reorganization of work—compressing years of change into months, affecting roughly 40 percent of jobs worldwide, as the International Monetary Fund projects—the consequences will not stop at the economy. They will test political institutions that have already shown how brittle they can be.

The question, then, is whether we're approaching the kind of disruption that can be managed with statistics—or the kind that creates statistics no one can bear to count.

Austan Goolsbee is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Barack Obama. He's also one of the few economists you would not immediately regret bringing to a party. When I asked Goolsbee if any conclusive data indicated that AI had begun to eat into the labor market, he delivered an answer that was both obvious and unhelpful, smiling as he did it. The nonanswer was the point.

I've known Goolsbee long enough to enjoy these moments, when he makes fun of our shared uselessness. Economists are rarely equipped to give straight answers about the present. Journalists hate when the future won't reveal itself on deadline.

We spoke in September, shortly after the release of what's come to be known as “The Canaries Paper,” written by three academics from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. By crunching data from millions of monthly payroll records for workers in jobs with exposure to generative AI, the authors concluded that workers ages 22 to 25—the canaries—have seen about a 13 percent decline in employment since late 2022.

For several days, the paper was all anyone in the field wanted to talk about, and by talk about I mostly mean punch holes in. The report overemphasized the effect of ChatGPT. Youth employment is cyclical. The same period saw a sharp interest-rate spike—a far more likely source of turbulence. “Canaries” also contradicted a study released a few weeks earlier by the Economic Innovation Group, which argued that AI is unlikely to cause mass unemployment in the near term, even as it reshapes jobs and wages. That paper was knowingly titled “AI and Jobs: The Final Word (Until the Next One).”

This was the point Goolsbee wanted to emphasize: Economists are constrained by numbers. And numerically speaking, nothing indicates that AI has had an impact on people's jobs. “It's just too early,” he said.

A lack of certainty should not be mistaken for a lack of concern. The Fed's mandate is to promote maximum employment, so the corporate pronouncements about imminent job loss have Goolsbee's attention. But the numbers don't add up. It's possible that the labor market is softer than it looks, but that the softness is being absorbed within firms rather than showing up in the unemployment rate. If companies are sitting on more workers than they need, however—a phenomenon known as labor hoarding—you'd expect that to reveal itself as weak productivity growth. It's as predictable as a hangover: too many workers, not enough work, sagging productivity. “But it's been totally the opposite,” Goolsbee said. “Productivity growth has been really high. So I don't know how to reconcile that.”

Productivity is the cheat code for a more prosperous society. If each worker can produce more in the same hour—more goods, better services, faster results—then the total economic pie grows, even if the number of workers doesn't. It's the rare efficiency gain that expands the pie rather than merely redistributing slices.

America has been on a productivity tear for the past few years. It might be temporary, the result of a onetime boost, such as the COVID-era boom in new small businesses. But with the special joy of someone paid to complicate everything, Goolsbee pointed out that general-purpose technologies such as electricity and computing can create lasting productivity gains, the kind that make whole societies wealthier.

Whether AI is one of those technologies will only become clear over time. How long before we'll know? “Years,” Goolsbee said.

In the meantime, there's another complication. The immediate risk to employment may not be AI itself, but the way companies, seduced by its promise, overinvest before they understand what it can actually do. Goolsbee reached back to the internet bubble, when companies spent wildly on laying fiber cables and building capacity. “In 2001, when we found out that the growth rate of the internet is not going to be 25 percent a year, but merely 10 percent—which is still a pretty great growth rate—it meant we had way too much fiber, and there was a collapse of business investment,” Goolsbee said. “And a bunch of people were thrown out of work the old-fashioned way.”

A similar crash in AI investment, if it comes, would likely look familiar: painful, destabilizing, and accompanied by surges of CNBC rants and recriminations. But it would amount to a financial reset, not a technological reversal—the kind of outcome economists are especially good at recognizing, because it resembles a thing that's happened before.

This is the paradox of economics. To understand how fast the present is hurtling us into the future, you need a fixed point, and the fixed points are all in the past. It's like driving while looking only at the rearview mirror—plenty dangerous if the road stays straight, catastrophic if it doesn't.

David Autor and Daron Acemoglu are among the most accomplished rearview drivers. Both are at MIT, and both excel at understanding previous economic disruptions. Acemoglu, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2024, studies inequality; Autor focuses on labor. But both insist that the story of AI and its consequences will depend mostly on speed—not because they assume lost jobs will automatically be replaced, but because a slower rate of change leaves societies time to adapt, even if some of those jobs never come back.

Labor markets have a natural rate of adjustment. If, over the course of 30 years, 3 percent of employees in a profession retire or have their jobs eliminated annually, you'd barely notice. Yet a decade later, a third of the jobs in those professions would be gone. Elevator operators and tollbooth attendants went through this slow fade to obsolescence with no damage to the economy. “When it happens more rapidly,” Autor told me, “things become problematic.”

From the July/August 2015 issue: Derek Thompson on a world without work

Autor is most famous for his work on the China shock. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization; six years later, 13 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs—about 2 million—had disappeared. The China shock took a disproportionate toll on small-scale manufacturing—textiles, toys, furniture—concentrated primarily in the South. “Many of the workers in those places still haven't recovered,” Autor said, “and we're obviously living with the political consequences.”

But AI isn't a trade policy. It's software. Even if it hits some professions and places first—a lawyer in a large urban firm, say, may feel the impact years before a worker in a less digitized industry—the technology won't be constrained by geography. Eventually, everyone will be affected.

All of this sounds foreboding, until you remember the most important thing about software: People hate it, almost as much as they hate change.

This is what gives many economists confidence that the AI asteroid is still at least a decade away. “These tech CEOs want us to believe that the market for automation is preordained, and that it will all happen smoothly and profitably,” Acemoglu said. He then made a disdainful noise from his Nobel Prize–winning bullshit detector. “History tells us it's actually going to happen much slower.”

The argument goes like this: Before AI can transform a company, it has to access the company's data and be woven into existing systems—which sounds easy, provided you're not a chief technology officer. A trade secret of most Fortune 500 companies is that they still run many critical functions on lumbering, industrial-strength mainframe computers that almost never break down and therefore can never be replaced. Mainframes are like Christopher Walken: They've been going nonstop since the 1960s, they're fantastic at performing peculiar roles (processing payments, safeguarding data), and nobody alive really understands how they work.

Integrating legacy tech with modern AI means navigating hardware, vendors, contracts, ancient coding languages, and humans—every one of whom has a strong opinion about the “right” way to make changes. Months pass, then years; another company holiday party comes and goes; and the CEO still can't understand why the miracle of AI isn't solving all of their problems.

Every new general-purpose technology is, for a time, held hostage by the mess of what already exists. The first electric-power stations opened in the 1880s, and no one debated whether they were superior to steam engines. But factories had been built with steam engines in their basements, powering overhead shafts that ran the length of the buildings, with belts and pulleys carrying power to individual machines. To adopt electricity, factory owners didn't just need to buy motors—they needed to demolish and rebuild their entire operations. Some did. Most just waited for their infrastructure to wear out, which explains why the major economic gains from electrification didn't show up for 40 years.

None of this is reassuring enough for the economist Anton Korinek. He's “super worried,” he told me. He thinks that America will see major job losses—“a very noticeable labor-market effect”—as soon as this year.

“And then those economists you've been talking to, they're going to say, ‘I see that in the data!' ” Korinek paused. “Let's not joke about it, because it's too serious.”

Korinek is a professor and the faculty director of the Economics of Transformative AI Initiative at the University of Virginia. Last year, Time magazine put him on its list of the most influential people in AI. But he did not set out to become an economist. He grew up in an Austrian mountain village, writing machine code in 0s and 1s—the least glamorous form of programming, and the most unforgiving. It teaches you where instructions bottleneck, where systems jam, and what breaks first when pushed too hard.

He'd kept a close watch on developments in AI since the deep-learning breakthroughs of the early 2010s, even as his doctoral work focused on the prevention of financial crises. When he got his first demo of a large language model, in September 2022, it took “about five seconds” before he considered its consequences for the future of work, starting with his own.

We met for breakfast in Charlottesville in the fall. Korinek is youthful and slender, with delicate wire-frame glasses and a faintly red beard. My overall impression was of someone who'd rather be customizing Excel tabs than prophesizing doom. Still, here he was, saying the five words economists disdain the most: This time may be different.

The crux of Korinek's argument is simple: His colleagues aren't misreading the data—they're misreading the technology. “We can't quite conceptualize having very smart machines,” Korinek said. “Machines have always been dumb, and that's why we don't trust them and it's always taken time to roll them out. But if they're smarter than us, in many ways they can roll themselves out.”

This is already happening. Many of the least comprehensible ads during sporting events are for AI tools that promise to speed the integration of other AI tools into the workflows of large companies. Because many of these systems don't require massive new hardware or human-engineered system rewrites, the rollout time shrinks by as much as 50 percent.

This is where Korinek parts company with the rearview economists. If AI moves as fast as he expects, for many workers the damage will arrive before institutions can adapt—and each successful use will only intensify the pressure for more.

Consider consulting firms, which have always charged high fees for having junior associates do research and draft reports—fees clients tolerated because there was no alternative. But if one firm can use AI to deliver the same work faster and cheaper, its competitors face a stark choice: adopt the technology, or explain why they are still charging a premium for human hours. Once a firm plugs in and undercuts its rivals, the rest must either race to follow or be left behind. Competition doesn't just reward adoption; it makes delay indefensible.

Korinek concedes the two standard objections: The numbers don't show anything definitive yet, and new technologies have historically created more jobs than they've destroyed. But he thinks that his peers need to start driving with their eyes looking ahead. “Whenever I speak to people at the labs on the West Coast”—Korinek is an unpaid member of Anthropic's economic advisory council—“it does not strike me that they are trying to artificially hype what they're producing. I usually have the sense that they are just as terrified as I am. We should at least consider the possibility that what they are telling us may come true.”

Korinek is not sure that the technology itself can be steered by policy, but he wants more economists doing scenario planning so that policy makers aren't caught flat-footed—because mass job loss doesn't just mean unemployment; it means missed loan payments, cascading defaults, shrinking consumer demand, and the kind of self-reinforcing downturn that can transform a shock into a crisis, and a crisis into the decline of an empire.

After thE brief period in early 2025 when CEOs were openly volunteering “thought leadership” about AI and its impact on their workforces and profit margins, the pronouncements stopped, eerily, at roughly the same time. Anyone who has seen a shark fin break the water and then disappear knows this is not reassuring.

The simple explanation comes courtesy of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. America employs about 280,590 public-relations specialists, an increase of 69 percent over the past two decades. (They outnumber journalists almost 7 to 1.) It's not hard to imagine their expert syllogism: AI is unpopular. CEOs who talk about job cuts are even less popular. So maybe shut up about AI and jobs?

In October, the day after The New York Times revealed Amazon executives' plan to potentially automate more than 600,000 jobs by 2033, the PR chief at a large multinational firm told me, “We are so done speaking about this.” It was at least a small piece of history—the first time I'd been asked to grant anonymity to someone so they could explain, on the record, that they would no longer be speaking at all.

All of which is to say that the chief executives of Walmart, Amazon, Ford, and other Fortune 100 companies, as well as executives from rising AI-driven firms including Anthropic, Stripe, and Waymo—people who had been remarkably chatty about AI and jobs a few months earlier—declined or ignored multiple interview requests for this story. Even the Business Roundtable, an association of 200 CEOs from America's most powerful companies that exists to speak for its members on exactly these kinds of issues, told me that its CEO, former George W. Bush White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten, had nothing to say.

Of course, telling a reporter you won't speak on the record isn't the same as not speaking. The CEOs are talking to at least one person: Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a Microsoft board member. Hoffman is a technologist by pedigree and an optimist by temperament. He knows everyone in corporate America, and everyone knows he knows everyone, which makes him Silicon Valley's favorite mensch—a reasonable, neutral sounding board whom CEOs can go to when they want to think out loud. He told me that AI has sorted the CEOs into three groups.

The first are the dabblers: latecomers finally spending some quality time with their chief technology officers. The second rushed to declare themselves AI leaders out of vanity or a desire to have their traditional businesses taken more seriously by tech snobs. “They're like, Look at me! I'm important! I'm central here. But they're not actually doing anything yet,” Hoffman said. “They're just like, Put me at the AI table too.” The third group is different: executives who are quietly making transformational plans. “These are the ones who see it coming. And to their credit, I think a lot of them want to figure out how to help their whole workforce transition with this through education, reskilling, or training.”

But what all three groups share is a belief that investors—after years of hearing about AI's promise—have lost patience with dreaming. This year, they expect results. And the fastest way for a CEO to produce results is to cut head count. Layoffs, Hoffman said, are inevitable. “A lot of them have convinced themselves this only ends one way. Which I think is a failure of the imagination.”

Hoffman doesn't waste time urging CEOs not to make cuts; he knows they will. “What I tell them is that you need to be presenting paths and ideas for how to get benefits from AI that aren't just cutting costs. How do you get more revenue? How do you help your people transition to being more effective using AI?”

“It's a fever,” Gina Raimondo, the former governor of Rhode Island and commerce secretary under Joe Biden, told me, referring to the rush to cut jobs. “Every CEO and every board feels like they need to go faster. ‘We have 40,000 people doing customer service? Take it down to 10,000. AI can handle the rest.' If the whole thing is about moving fast with your eye strictly on efficiency, then an awful lot of people are going to get really hurt. And I don't think this country can handle that, given where we already are.”

Like Hoffman, Raimondo occupies an unusual niche: a Democrat who can walk into a boardroom without setting off the cultural metal detectors. She co-founded a venture-capital firm, and AI executives, who see her as pragmatic and fluent in tech, are willing to talk to her. “This is a technology that will make us more productive, healthier, more sustainable,” Raimondo said. “But only if we get very serious about managing the transition.”

Last summer, Raimondo made the trip to Sun Valley, Idaho, for the four-day Allen & Co. conference known as “summer camp for billionaires.” She asked people the same two questions: How are you using AI? And what happens to your workers when you do? A number of CEOs admitted that they felt trapped. Wall Street expects them to replace human labor with AI; if they don't do it, they'll be the ones out of a job. But if they all order mass job eliminations, they know the consequences will be enormous—for their workforces, for the country, and for their own humanity.

Raimondo's response was that “it's the responsibility of the country's most powerful CEOs to help figure this out.” She sees the possibility of “new public-private partnerships at scale. Imagine if we could get companies to take ownership over the retraining and redeployment of people they lay off.”

She knows how this sounds. “A lot of people say, ‘Oh, Gina, you're naive. Never going to happen.' Okay. But I'm telling you it's the end of America as we know it if we don't use this moment to do things differently.”

If executives' concern is as genuine as Raimondo thinks, then perhaps they can be moved to action. Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, is trying—and mostly failing—to do just that. CEOs and tech leaders are so focused on winning the AI race that “working people are an afterthought,” she told me.

Shuler's aware that this is a predictable take from a union leader, so she volunteered a concession: “Most working people, and especially union leaders, start out with a panic, right? Like, Wow, this is going to basically obliterate all jobs and everyone's going to be left without a safety net and we have to put a stop to it—which we know is not going to happen.” Instead of panicking, Shuler said, she talked with the leaders of the AFL-CIO's unions, representing about 15 million people, and pushed them to use the brief moment before AI is imposed on them to figure out what they want from the technology—and what they might be prepared to trade for that.

Michael Podhorzer: The paradox of the American labor movement

So far the olive branch has been grabbed by precisely one company. Microsoft has agreed to bring workers into conversations about developing AI and guardrails around it. Most remarkably, the deal includes a neutrality agreement that allows workers to freely form unions without retaliation—something that's never been done before in tech. “We think it's a model,” Shuler said. “We would love to see others acknowledge that working people are central to this debate and to our future.”

Squint and you might convince yourself that the Microsoft deal is indeed proof of concept. More likely, it's an anomaly. Because all the coaxing, reasonableness, and appeals to patriotism and shared humanity are battling a truth as old as wage labor: American capitalism rushes toward efficiency the way water flows downhill—inevitably, indifferently, and with predictable consequences for whoever happens to be standing at the bottom. And with AI, for the first time, capital has a tool that promises the kind of near-limitless productivity the factory and mill owners could never have imagined: maximum efficiency with a minimum number of employees to demand a share of the gains.

In that context, the silence of the CEOs takes on a different resonance. It could be a cold acknowledgment that the decisions have already been made—or a muffled plea for the government to save them from themselves.

And so to Washington.

You're probably aware that our politics are unbearable at the moment. And yet the only way to make them bearable—to recover the glimmer of promise at their core—is more politics. That's the joke at the heart of Washington: The very struggle that's hollowed the place out is also the only way it can be renewed.

If there were ever an issue capable of relieving the national migraine—something large enough and urgent enough—you might assume the future of American jobs would be it. “At least from my interactions here in the Senate, not many people are talking about it,” Gary Peters, the senior senator from Michigan, told me. “There's a general attitude among my colleagues”—Peters, a Democrat, singles out Republicans, though he says there's blame to go around—“like, We don't need to do anything. It's going to be fine. In fact, the government should just stay out of it. Let industry move forward and continue to innovate.”

It's hard to slow AI without abdicating America's tech supremacy to China—a point the tech lobby makes with religious fervor. It's hard to force AI labs to give advance notice of the consequences of their deployments when they often don't know themselves. You could regulate the use of job-displacing AI, but enforcement would require a regulatory apparatus that doesn't exist and technical expertise the government doesn't have.

That said, the government has a decades-old playbook on how to get workers through economic shocks. And Peters has been banging his head on his desk trying to get Congress to use it.

Since 1974, when the United States began opening its economy more aggressively to global trade, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program has helped more than 5 million people with retraining, wage insurance, and relocation grants, at a cost in recent years of roughly half a billion dollars annually. In 2018, Peters co-sponsored the TAA for Automation Act, which would have extended the same benefits to workers squeezed by AI and robotics. It died quietly, as many things in Congress do. In 2022, authorization for the TAA expired, and in a Congress allergic to trade votes and new spending, Peters's efforts to revive it have gone nowhere.

This is very stupid. The United States has about 700,000 unfilled factory and construction jobs. (Ironically, one of the few things slowing AI is a shortage of HVAC technicians qualified to install cooling systems in data centers.) Jim Farley, the Ford CEO who predicted that half of white-collar jobs could disappear in a decade, has been saying that the auto industry is short hundreds of thousands of technicians to work in dealerships—jobs that sit in a long-term sweet spot: technical enough to earn six figures, and dependent on precise manual dexterity that makes them hard to roboticize. But someone has to pay for the months of training the jobs require. “These are really good jobs,” Peters said. But “we spend a lot more money from the federal government for four-year higher-education institutions than we do for skilled-training programs.”

There's no shortage of ideas about what to do if AI hollows out large swaths of work: universal basic income, benefits that don't depend on employers, lifelong retraining, a shorter workweek. They tend to surface whenever technological anxiety spikes—and to recede just as reliably, undone by cost, politics, or the simple fact that they would require a level of coordination the United States has not managed in decades.

The 119th Congress is a ghost ship, steered by ennui and the desire to evade hard choices. And the AI industry is paying millions of dollars to make sure no one grabs the wheel. To cite just one example, a super PAC called Leading the Future—which has reportedly secured $50 million in commitments from the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and $50 million more from the OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and his wife, Anna—plans to “aggressively oppose” candidates from both parties who threaten the industry's priorities, which boil down to: Go fast. No, faster.

Shuler told me that the AFL-CIO will keep pressing national elected officials for a worker-focused AI agenda, but that “this game is not gonna be played at the federal level as much as it will be at the state level.” More than 1,000 AI bills are bubbling up in statehouses. Of course, the AI money will be there, too; Leading the Future has already announced plans to focus its efforts on New York, California, Illinois, and Ohio.

The executive branch has delegated almost all of its AI oversight to David Sacks—nominally a co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, but functionally a government LARPer who maintains his role as a venture capitalist and podcast host. Sacks, who is also the White House crypto czar, co-wrote the Trump administration's “America's AI Action Plan.” A New York Times investigation found that Sacks has at least 449 investments in companies with ties to artificial intelligence. The fox isn't just guarding the henhouse; he's livestreaming the feast.

AI is just a newborn. It may grow up to transform our lives in unimaginably good ways. But it has also introduced profound questions about safety, inequality, and the viability of a wage-labor system that, despite its flaws, spawned the most prosperous society in human history. And there's no sign—none—that our political system is equipped to deal with what's coming.

Which means the deepest challenge AI poses may not be to jobs at all.

“Gosh, the textbook ideal of democracy,” says Nick Clegg, “is the peaceful articulation and resolution of differences that otherwise might take a more disruptive or violent form. So you'd like to think that a strong democracy could digest these kinds of changes.”

Clegg is a former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the Liberal Democrats. When he lost his seat in Parliament after Brexit, he moved to California, where he spent seven years running global affairs at Facebook/Meta, becoming a kind of Tocqueville with vested options, before returning to London in 2025. Many governments “just don't have the levers” to deal with AI, Clegg told me.

He suspects that the societies best positioned to navigate the next few years are small homogenous ones like the Scandinavians, who are capable of having mature conversations—they'll put together “some commission led by some very wise former finance minister who will come up with a perfect blueprint which everybody consensually will then do, and they will remain in a hundred years the happiest societies”—or large authoritarian ones that refuse to have conversations at all. China, America's primary AI rival, has repeatedly demonstrated a capacity to impose rapid, society-wide change (the one-child policy, the forced relocation of more than 1 million people for the Three Gorges Dam) without consent or delay.

“If democratic governments drift into this period, which may require much more rapid change than they currently appear to be capable of delivering,” Clegg warned, “then democracy is not going to pass this test with flying colors.”

He then delivered, over Zoom, a fantastically British pep talk, combining Churchillian resolve with a faintly patronizing nod to America's centuries-long streak of pulling four-leaf clovers out of its ass. “You are extraordinarily dynamic,” he began. “It's remarkable the number of times people have written off America.”

If politics is to be part of the solution, Gary Peters will not be around to participate; he's retiring next year. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congress's most articulate Republican advocate (really) for safeguarding the workforce from AI, has already resigned. Gina Raimondo is being considered as a potential presidential contender for 2028, and she's a centrist with the chops to balance the reasons for speeding forward on AI with the need to do so warily. But the issue is unlikely to wait that long. “We're going into a world that seems to be getting more unstable with each and every day,” Peters said. “And that uncertainty creates anxiety, and anxiety leads to sometimes dramatic shifts in how people act and how they vote.”

Which brings us to Bernie Sanders, who has been wrestling with an AI-shaped future since it was still theoretical. “Are AI and robotics inherently evil or terrible? No,” Sanders told me in his familiar staccato. “We are already seeing positive developments in terms of health care, the manufacturing of drugs, diagnoses of diseases, etc. But here is the simple question: Who is going to benefit from this transformation?”

At the Davenport, Iowa, stop on his 2025 Fighting Oligarchy tour, audience members booed when he mentioned AI. And Sanders, the ultimate vibes politician, can feel decades of anger—over trade, inequality, affordability, systematic unfairness, government fealty to corporations—coalescing around AI.

In October, he issued a 95 theses–style report on AI and employment. It included all of the dire CEO and consulting-firm quotes about the looming job apocalypse and proposed a shorter workweek; worker protections; profit sharing; and an unspecified “robot tax on large corporations,” whose revenue would be used “to benefit workers harmed by AI.” It's a furious document, as though Sanders typed it with his fists.

At least one populist politician thinks Sanders didn't go far enough.

Steve Bannon's D.C. townhouse is so close to the Supreme Court that you can read JUSTICE THE GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY from the top step. He greeted me in his signature look: camouflage cargo pants, a black shirt, also a brown shirt, also a black button-down shirt. He hadn't shaved in days. It would not have surprised me if he suggested that we get hoagies, or form a militia.

From the July/August 2022 issue: Jennifer Senior on Steve Bannon, a lit bomb in the mouth of democracy

Bannon has, shall we say, some scoundrel-like tendencies. But he's not an AI tourist. In the early 2000s, while still a film producer, he tried to buy the rights to Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near, a sacred text of the AI movement that imagines the day when machines surpass human intelligence. Bannon thought it would make a good documentary. He hired an AI correspondent for his War Room podcast a few years ago, and he tracks every corporate-layoff announcement, searching for omens.

He's concerned about rogue AI creating viruses and seizing weapons—fears that are shared more soberly by national-security officials, biosecurity researchers, and some notable AI scientists—but he believes the American worker is in such imminent danger that he's prepared to toss away parts of his ideology. “I'm for the deconstruction of the administrative state, but I'm not an anarchist,” Bannon told me. “You do have to have a regulatory apparatus. If you don't have a regulatory apparatus for this, then fucking take the whole thing down, right? Because this is what the thing was built for.”

What Bannon wants goes beyond regulation. It's a callback to an old idea: that when the government deems a technology strategically vital, it should own part of it—much as it once did with railroads and, briefly, banks during the 2008 financial crisis. He pointed to what he called Donald Trump's “brilliant” decision to have the federal government take a 9.9 percent stake in Intel in August. But the stake in AI would need to be much greater, he believes—something commensurate with the scale of federal support flowing to AI companies.

“I don't know—50 percent as a starter,” Bannon said. “I realize the right's going to go nuts.” But the government needs to put people with good judgment on these companies' boards, he said. “And you have to drill down on this now, now, now.”

Instead, he warned, we have “the worst elements of our system—greed and avarice, coupled with people that just want to grasp raw power—all converging.”

I pointed out that the person overseeing this convergence is the same man Bannon helped get elected, and recently suggested should stick around for a third term.

“President Trump's a great business guy,” Bannon said. But he's getting “selective information” from Elon Musk, David Sacks, and others who Bannon thinks hopped aboard the Trump bandwagon only to maximize their profit and control of AI. “If you noticed, these guys are not jumping around when I say ‘Trump '28.' I don't get an ‘attaboy.' ” He said that “they've used Trump,” and that he sees a major schism coming within the Republican Party.

Bannon's politics don't naturally lend themselves to cross-party coalition building, but AI has scrambled even his sense of the boundaries. He and Glenn Beck signed a letter demanding a ban on the development of superintelligent AI, out of fear that systems smarter than humans cannot be reliably contained; they were joined by eminent academics and former Obama-administration officials—“lefties that would rather spit on the floor than say Steve Bannon is with them on anything.” And he's been sketching out a theory of the coalition needed to confront what's coming. “These ethicists and moral philosophers—you have to combine that together with, quite frankly, some street fighters.”

Horseshoe issues—where the far right and far left touch—are rare in American politics. They tend to surface when something highly technical (the gold standard in 1896, or the subprime crisis of 2008) alchemizes into something emotional (William Jennings Bryan's “cross of gold,” the Tea Party). That's populism. And the threat of pitchforks has occasionally made American capitalism more humane: The eight-hour workday, weekends, and the minimum wage all emerged from the space between reform and revolution.

No one understands or exploits that shaggy zone quite like Bannon. His anger about AI can sound reasonable in one breath and menacing in the next. We were discussing some of the men who run the most powerful AI labs when he said, “Let's just be blunt”: “We're in a situation where people on the spectrum that are not, quite frankly, total adults—you can see by their behavior that they're not—are making decisions for the species. Not for the country. For the species. Once we hit this inflection point, there's no coming back. That's why it's got to be stopped, and we may have to take extreme measures.”

The trouble with pitchforks is that once you encourage everyone to grab them, there's no end to the damage that might be done. And unlike in earlier eras, we're now a society defined by two objects: phones that let everyone see exactly how much better other people have it, and guns should they decide to do something about it.

America would be better off if its elites could act responsibly without being terrified. If CEOs remembered that citizens are a kind of shareholder, too. If economists tried to model the future before it arrives in their rearview mirror. If politicians chose their constituents' jobs over their own. None of this requires revolution. It requires everyone to do the jobs they already have, just better.

There's an easy place for all of them to start—a bar so low, it amounts to a basic cognitive exam for the republic.

Erika McEntarfer was the commissioner of labor statistics until August, when Trump fired her after the release of a weak jobs report. McEntarfer has seen no evidence of political interference at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but “independence is not the only threat facing economic data,” she told me. “Inadequate funding and staffing are also a danger.”

Most of the economic papers trying to figure out the impact of AI on labor demand use the BLS's Current Population Survey. “It's the best available source,” McEntarfer said. “But the sample is pretty small. It's only 60,000 households and hasn't increased for 20 years. Response rates have declined.” An obvious first step toward figuring out what's going on in our economy would be to expand the survey's sample size and add a supplement on AI usage at work. That would involve some extra economists and a few million dollars—a tiny investment. But the BLS budget has been shrinking for decades.

The United States created the BLS because it believed the first duty of a democracy was to know what was happening to its people. If we've misplaced that belief—if we can't bring ourselves to measure reality; if we can't be bothered to count—then good luck with the machines.

Prepare for stocks to rocket higher then suffer a crushing decline, the boss of a ""Black Swan"" fund says.

""I've been looking for a blow-off in equities for over three years now — followed by the worst crash since 1929,"" Mark Spitznagel, the founder and chief investor of Universa Investments, told Business Insider in a recent email.

""That blow-off is still in process,"" Spitznagel said. ""Probably will culminate in the months ahead.""

Universa specializes in ""tail-risk hedging"" or protecting investors' portfolios from rare, extreme, and unpredictable events. ""The Black Swan"" author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who previously ran a hedge fund with Spitznagel, is the firm's scientific advisor.

Spitznagel has been bullish since 2022, but expects stocks to eventually march off a cliff. Immense buzz around AI, interest-rate cuts, and historic levels of government spending have propelled stocks higher with little interruption.

The Universa chief told Business Insider he's a ""big believer in AI,"" but ""asset bubbles have a hype that is independent of the underlying idea.""

Hype has also fueled gold's record rally, he said, before adding that the yellow metal will likely be an ""important asset in the years ahead.""

Spitznagel issued a similar outlook in a letter to Universa investors in January.

""I remain a believer in gold's long-term thesis, but I expect it to fall — precipitously — alongside other risk assets when the turn comes,"" he wrote. ""Like crypto, it is an upside play here.""

Spitznagel anticipated a ""Goldilocks zone"" for investors in the year ahead, comprising ""falling inflation and rates, a slowing economy but not too slow, and sentiment flipping toward euphoria"" before a ""final blow-off in equities.""

He also warned the ""greatest bubble in human history"" was approaching its conclusion as ""the Goldilocks market peaks and Papa Bear arrives for the historic bust that is logically to follow.""

Spitznagel isn't alone in diagnosing a market bubble and predicting a painful crash. Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" fame and GMO's Jeremy Grantham have both been sounding the alarm for years now.

On the other hand, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have told Business Insider they're not worried as AI is supercharging growth and productivity.

House Republican leaders are in danger of an embarrassing loss on a procedural vote Tuesday because fellow GOP lawmakers are balking at voting to block challenges to President Donald Trump's tariffs through the summer. A potential GOP rebellion on the vote highlights divisions among House Republicans, a dynamic that could make it even harder for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to advance his and Trump's agenda through a narrowly divided Congress. Dissatisfied factions within the House GOP have revolted several times this Congress, forcing the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and supporting a failed Democratic effort to extend Obamacare subsidies.

Johnson cannot afford to lose more than one Republican, assuming all members are present and Democrats are united against the measure being voted on that would set the rules for debating a bill to boost domestic production of critical minerals. At least two Republicans said they plan to vote against Johnson.

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a perennial thorn in the side of GOP leadership, has vowed to vote ""no."" Others have similarly signaled their opposition, as frustration over Trump's tariffs and leadership's maneuvering percolates within the Republican ranks.

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., told CNBC on Tuesday he objects to ""this idea that everyone needs to stick together to bring a particular bill on the floor"" because it makes the House ""less of a democratic body."" 

The vote was originally slated for early afternoon, but House Republicans rescheduled it for Tuesday night.

Johnson on Tuesday said he expects the measure to pass and said the rationale for the vote this week is ""to allow the Supreme Court to rule on the pending case."" The Supreme Court is considering a legal challenge to Trump's tariffs with a ruling pending following oral arguments last November.

""That process has been playing out. I think it's logical to allow that to continue. The president's trade policies have been a great benefit to the country,"" Johnson said at a news conference Tuesday morning.

The House Rules Committee on Monday approved language that would block any House votes disapproving of Trump's tariffs through July 31. House Democrats had already planned to force a vote on tariffs this week.

""It is no secret that in private many Republican members of Congress have concerns with President Trump's tariff policies. Now some are even voicing their concerns in public,"" the House Rules Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Jim McGovern, of Massachusetts, said at Monday's hearing.

""They were just about to have the chance to vote this week to end them. So what's this all about? The White House is scared. They know that the Republican House finally, after months of blocking itself from doing what the Senate has already done, is poised to vote to end these unpopular, unwise, downright dumb tariffs,"" McGovern continued.

The Senate has on multiple occasions voted to strike down tariffs issued by Trump, while the House has blocked votes on tariff-related resolutions. The latest prohibition on tariff votes expired at the end of January.

For Tuesday's vote, some other Republicans expressed their discomfort with tariffs, but did not commit to opposing the measure up for a vote.

""The Supreme Court is going to be deciding this issue by June. So there is an argument to be made to maintain the status quo until then,"" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., told CNBC on Tuesday. ""I believe in free trade. And tariffs are a big mistake. But given that the Supreme Court's about to weigh in, maybe we ought to just keep our powder dry and see what they say.""

Kalshi saw more than $1 billion in trading volume on Super Bowl Sunday, reaching a daily record high, according to CEO Tarek Mansour.

That volume was up 2,700% year-over-year, according to the company. The platform allows users to buy event contracts for outcomes in politics, pop culture, financial markets and sports.

""It was an incredible weekend,"" Mansour told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. ""Kalshi was the biggest brand of the Super Bowl this year, without running a Super Bowl ad, and the way we achieved that is the product.""

Mansour said the trading volume for halftime performer Bad Bunny's opening song exceeded $100 million, while bets on who would perform with Bad Bunny surpassed $45 million. 

The platform's Super Bowl contracts were not without bumps, though. Co-founder Luana Lopes Lara posted on social media during the game that some users' deposits were delayed due to high traffic.

""Your money is safe and on the way, it will just take longer to land,"" she wrote. 

Kalshi has recently come under fire along with other prediction markets as skepticism around the industry builds, with concerns of insider trading. Last week, before the Super Bowl, the platform announced additional efforts to expand its surveillance and enforcement efforts to identify and remove accounts participating in insider trading. 

""The insider trading risk is very real for the stock market as well,"" Mansour said on Tuesday.

""As a regulated financial market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we have the same rules as the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, and we have the same mechanism of enforcement,"" he added.

Over the past year, Mansour said the platform has run 200 investigations and frozen the relevant accounts, with some of those referred to law enforcement for prosecution.

Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship that includes a minority investment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Crypto Market Today: What's Next for Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Prices?","https://www.tradingview.com/news/coinpedia:585a7e9dc094b:0-crypto-market-today-what-s-next-for-ethereum-solana-and-xrp-prices/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:46:01 GMT","

After the recent crypto market correction, analysts are monitoring altcoins to determine whether prices are forming a bottom or preparing for another decline. Technical analysis by Gareth Soloway shows that Ethereum ETHUSD, Solana SOLUSD, and XRP may see short-term recovery attempts, but broader trends remain uncertain.

Ethereum: Short-term bounce possible

Ethereum recently experienced a sharp sell-off, breaking below an important support level before stabilizing. According to technical analysis, the former support area has now turned into resistance, a common market behavior following panic-driven declines.

Analysts note that Ethereum is currently showing a short-term bullish structure that could support a limited rebound, with upside likely capped around the $2,500–$2,600 region unless stronger buying momentum emerges. 

However, the broader trend remains fragile, and maintaining support around the $1,500–$1,600 range is seen as crucial for longer-term stability. A sustained move below that zone could signal a deeper corrective phase.

Solana: Potential recovery toward $120

Solana has also been trading within a short-term bullish formation inside a broader downtrend. Technical patterns indicate the possibility of a rebound from the $80 range toward roughly $115–$120, representing a meaningful recovery if market sentiment improves.

At the same time, analysts warn that failure to hold current support levels could trigger another leg lower. If Solana breaks below key pivot areas near recent lows, the next major support zone could appear around $50, making current price levels important for determining the next trend direction.

XRP: Support breakdown 

XRP's technical structure appears more fragile compared with other large-cap altcoins after the token fell below a long-standing support level formed during the previous bull cycle. That breakdown has transformed the former support zone into heavy resistance, now estimated around $1.60–$1.70.

While a short-term bounce toward that region is possible, XRP must reclaim and hold above the resistance band to improve its longer-term outlook. On the downside, relatively limited support exists until the $0.95–$1.00 area, raising the risk of sharper volatility if selling pressure intensifies.

Mixed outlook for altcoins

Overall, the technical outlook across major altcoins shows a similar pattern: short-term bullish signals indicating possible relief rallies, combined with broader bearish structures that have not yet been fully reversed. Sustained recoveries will likely depend on whether the wider crypto market stabilizes and whether key resistance zones are successfully reclaimed in the coming weeks.

LayerZero seems set to roll out its Zero blockchain, according to screenshots from a now-deleted YouTube video circulated by crypto community members on X.

The ZRO governance token experienced sharp swings amid speculation. According to CoinGecko data, ZRO fell more than 15% to $1.7 following rumors about the new network.

The token gained 13% yesterday after the project teased an announcement on social media. The team has yet to respond to the circulating rumors.

The network launch would mark a major expansion for the interoperability project, which connects more than 150 blockchain networks.

LayerZero's infrastructure relies on decentralized verification networks and lightweight node technology to facilitate trustless communication between chains without depending on conventional bridge architectures.

The protocol has attracted backing from prominent venture firms, including a16z and Sequoia, positioning it among the more well-funded projects in the cross-chain infrastructure space.

ZRO debuted in June 2024 as a fixed-supply token of one billion units, serving governance and staking functions within the ecosystem.

A former FBI official told Fox News Digital that Monday evening's Instagram plea by Savannah Guthrie reveals that authorities might believe the chances of finding her mother Nancy alive are dwindling.

As the search for Nancy Guthrie stretches into a second week, her alleged captors are reportedly seeking a $6 million Bitcoin ransom, illustrating how cryptocurrency has reshaped the business of extortion.

Guthrie, 84, the mother of NBC News anchor Savannah Guthrie, was abducted from her home in Arizona, with investigators later confirming only limited details about a ransom demand.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates without a central authority like a bank or government, allowing people to send money directly to one another over a network of computers.

""Criminals increasingly request cryptocurrency in ransom and extortion cases because it is fast, global and does not rely on traditional banking rails that can delay or block payments,"" explained Ari Redbord, global head of policy at TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence and crypto-forensics firm.

""Cases like the alleged crypto ransom demand in the Nancy Guthrie case highlight how this dynamic is playing out in the real world,"" added Redbord, a former federal prosecutor and senior U.S. Treasury official.

It remains unclear whether payment of the $6 million would secure the 84-year-old's release. What's more, despite repeated public pleas from the Guthrie family, neither proof of life nor direct contact with her has been provided.

Still, Redbord cautions that the same technology that makes cryptocurrency attractive to criminals can also expose them. 

""The moment a wallet address appears, investigators have something actionable. Funds can be tracked in real time, associations identified and networks mapped in ways that are impossible with bulk cash or informal value transfer systems,"" Redbord said.

He added that cryptocurrency has fundamentally altered the economics of ransom and extortion — often in ways perpetrators fail to fully appreciate.

""Crypto has changed the economics and incentives behind ransom and extortion by increasing speed and reach, but it has also given law enforcement and national security teams unprecedented visibility,"" he added.

The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance. If you have any information concerning this case, contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI, or submit a tip online.

Archblock listed its principal place of business as a suite on San Francisco's Sutter Street in a Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, bankruptcy filing.

The San Francisco cryptocurrency startup Archblock just filed for bankruptcy, throwing millions of dollars into question and continuing a slog of legal woes. 

Archblock has been plagued with legal trouble over the past few years, facing fraud allegations from the Securities and Exchange Commission and in a civil lawsuit from another crypto company. On Friday, Archblock and its subsidiaries filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which lets a company reorganize its debts.

The company's filing makes its financials look dire: It estimates that its assets are worth between $1 million to $10 million, against liabilities between $100 million to $500 million. But one subsidiary, TrustToken, claims in its own filing to have $100 million to $500 million in assets against just $10 million to $50 million in debt. The other subsidiaries tack on millions more for each column — it's as yet unclear how the overall company will aim to reorganize in this bankruptcy process.

Neither Archblock nor the company's bankruptcy lawyer responded to SFGATE's requests for comment on Monday in time for publication.

Many of Archblock's debts are listed as “unknown” in its bankruptcy filing. But the document says the company owes a $1.3 million tax bill to the Internal Revenue Service, and another $179,000 to the state of Delaware, where it's incorporated. Archblock also listed a “potential” $8.5 million debt to Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm that Sam Bankman-Fried co-founded and that famously spiraled into bankruptcy alongside FTX in late 2022.

Archblock was best known for running TrueUSD, a cryptocurrency with a value pegged to that of the U.S. dollar. “Stablecoins,” as these are called, are a popular variety in the gigantic world of crypto trading.

But the SEC alleged that when Archblock's subsidiaries sold investment contracts for TrueUSD, the companies perpetrated fraud and put millions of customer dollars at risk. The agency wrote that Archblock's subsidiaries “falsely marketed the investment opportunity as safe and trustworthy,” but, “in fact a substantial portion of the assets purportedly backing TUSD had been invested in a speculative and risky offshore investment fund to earn additional returns for the defendants.”

The companies didn't deny or admit the allegations in a 2024 settlement deal with the SEC, but agreed to more than $327,000 in total civil penalties.

Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency trading platform that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2022, blasted Archblock with similar allegations in an October lawsuit. The company wrote that Archblock and its subsidiaries “refused” to return almost $13 million of Celsius' money. “When Defendants gambled those deposits on speculative investments and risky partners, it was Celsius — and its thousands of customers — who lost,” the complaint said. 

Archblock and its subsidiaries denied allegations of wrongdoing. For now, the litigation is on pause, an automatic repercussion of the new bankruptcy case, a Monday filing said.

""The concept of time has troubled philosophers and physicists for thousands of years, and the advent of quantum mechanics has not simplified the problem,"" says Professor Hugo Dil, a physicist at EPFL. ""The central problem is the general role of time in quantum mechanics, and especially the timescale associated with a quantum transition.""

At the smallest scales, physical processes unfold at astonishing speeds. Events such as tunneling or an electron shifting to a new energy state after absorbing light can happen in just a few tens of attoseconds (10-18 seconds). That interval is so brief that even light would not travel across the width of a small virus during that time.

Why Measuring Quantum Time Is So Difficult

Tracking such tiny slices of time has proven extremely challenging. Any external timing device risks interfering with the fragile quantum process being studied and changing its behavior. ""Although the 2023 Nobel prize in physics shows we can access such short times, the use of such an external time scale risks to induce artifacts,"" Dil says. ""This challenge can be resolved by using quantum interference methods, based on the link between accumulated phase and time.""

A New Way to Measure Time Without a Clock

Dil and his team have now developed a method that avoids external clocks altogether. When electrons absorb a photon and are emitted from a material, they carry information encoded in their spin. That spin changes depending on how the quantum transition unfolds. By carefully analyzing these changes, the researchers were able to determine how long the transition lasts.

As first author of the study Fei Guo explains, ""These experiments do not require an external reference, or clock, and yield the time scale required for the wavefunction of the electron to evolve from an initial to a final state at a higher energy upon photon absorption.""

How Quantum Interference Reveals Duration

When light excites an electron, the process does not follow a single path. Multiple quantum pathways are possible at the same time, and they interfere with one another. This interference leaves a clear signature in the spin of the emitted electron. By examining how this spin pattern changes as the electron's energy varies, the team could calculate how long the transition took.

To carry out these measurements, the researchers used a method known as ""spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy"" (SARPES). In this technique, intense synchrotron light strikes a material, boosting its electrons to higher energy and forcing them to escape the material's structure. Scientists then measure the energy, direction, and spin of the emitted electrons.

How Atomic Structure Affects Quantum Timing

The team tested materials with very different atomic arrangements. Some were fully three dimensional, such as ordinary copper. Others, including titanium diselenide (TiSe₂) and titanium ditelluride (TiTe₂), are made of weakly connected layers that behave more like flat sheets. Copper telluride (CuTe) has an even simpler, chain-like atomic structure. These contrasts made the materials ideal for studying how geometry influences timing.

The results revealed a consistent pattern. The simpler and more reduced the atomic structure of a material, the longer the quantum transition lasted. In three dimensional copper, the transition was extremely fast, taking about 26 attoseconds.

In the layered materials TiSe₂ and TiTe₂, the same process slowed to between 140 and 175 attoseconds. In CuTe, with its chain-like structure, the transition exceeded 200 attoseconds. These findings show that the atomic scale shape of a material strongly affects how quickly a quantum event unfolds, with lower symmetry structures leading to longer transition times.

What This Means for Understanding Quantum Time

""Besides yielding fundamental information for understanding what determines the time delay in photoemission, our experimental results provide further insight into what factors influence time on the quantum level, to what extent quantum transitions can be considered instantaneous, and might pave the way to finally understand the role of time in quantum mechanics,"" Dil explains.

Beyond deepening our understanding of time in quantum physics, the work offers a new tool for studying how electrons behave in complex materials. Knowing how long a quantum transition lasts could help scientists design materials with tailored quantum properties and support future technologies that depend on precise control of quantum states.

The evolution of herbivory is one of the most important ecological events in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates and impacted the ecosystems they inhabited. Herbivory independently developed in a number of tetrapod clades during the Late Carboniferous and Permian, eventually leading to the establishment of the basic structure of modern terrestrial ecosystems. Here we describe a Late Carboniferous pantylid ‘microsaur', Tyrannoroter heberti gen. et sp. nov., with expansive occluding palatal and coronoid dental batteries. The shape of the teeth, as revealed by high-resolution micro-computed tomography data, indicates wear from both shearing and grinding motions consistent with herbivory. New data from historical pantylid fossils show that similar adaptations can be traced back as far as the Bashkirian (~318 million years ago), indicating that terrestrial herbivory was already widespread within this group, and originated rapidly following the terrestrialization of tetrapods. The placement of recumbirostran ‘microsaurs' on the amniote stem suggests that terrestrial herbivory is not an amniote innovation, although the phylogenetic position of ‘microsaurian' tetrapods remains uncertain. Under any phylogenetic scenario, the data presented here reveal that pantylids acquired adaptations to herbivory independently, probably via durophagous omnivory, feeding on insects, shelled animals and tough plant material.

​If you thought 2025 couldn't get any crazier, the streaming world had one more surprise up its sleeve before the year ended. 

Netflix, already the largest streaming platform with over 325 million subscribers, took a bold step by acquiring Warner Bros.' film and television studios, as well as HBO, HBO Max, and other assets. The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.

​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood as we know it. 

We're here to break down exactly what's happening with the Netflix-WBD deal, including the latest developments, what's at stake, and what could come next. 

​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed it was exploring a potential sale after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.

For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by declining cable viewership and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.

​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with Paramount initially viewed as the frontrunner. 

But ultimately, WBD's board determined that Netflix's offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount's bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix's offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets. 

Additionally, Netflix recently amended its agreement to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion. 

Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.' assets.

​Paramount persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD for several months. Still, the board repeatedly rejected its offers, citing concerns about Paramount's heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount's offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.

In January, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by announcing it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Netflix backs out.

The company continues to assert that its offer is far superior.

Given the unprecedented scale and market impact of the deal, regulatory scrutiny is intense and remains a significant obstacle to closing the transaction. Earlier this week, it was reported that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.

In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  voiced their concerns to the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.

Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.

​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. The Writers Guild of America has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds. 

Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told. There are also widespread concerns about potential job losses and lower wages. 

For creators and theaters, uncertainty remains around release windows. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has stated that all films planned for theatrical release through Warner Bros. will continue as scheduled. However, he also hinted that, over time, release windows may be shortened, with movies coming to streaming platforms sooner than before.

​What does all this mean if you're a Netflix or HBO Max subscriber? 

Netflix executives have reassured viewers that HBO's operations will remain largely unchanged in the near term. At this stage, the company says it's too early to make any definitive announcements about potential bundles or app integration.

Regarding pricing, Sarandos has stated that no immediate changes will occur during the regulatory approval period. However, subscribers should be aware that Netflix has historically raised subscription prices regularly, so price increases are possible once the acquisition is finalized. Netflix tends to hike its rates every year or two.

The Netflix-WBD deal is not yet final.

A WBD stockholder vote is expected around April, with the deal anticipated to close 12 to 18 months after that vote. However, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome. 

Stay tuned…

Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has raised the largest-ever seed round for a dev tool startup, according to its lead backer, Felicis. The startup, Entire, has raised $60 million at a $300 million valuation.

Entire offers an open source tool to help developers better manage code written by AI agents.

Entire's tech has three components. One is a Git-compatible database to unify the AI-produced code. Git is a distributed version control system popular with enterprises and used by open source sites like GitHub and GitLab.

Another component is what it calls “a universal semantic reasoning layer” intended to allow multiple AI agents to work together. The final piece is an AI-native user interface designed with agent-to-human collaboration in mind.

The first product Entire is releasing is an open source tool it calls Checkpoints that automatically pairs every bit of software the agent submits for use in a software project with the context that created it, including prompts and transcripts. The idea is to allow the human developer to review, search, and perhaps even learn from why the AI did what it did.

Entire hopes to help developers better deal with the large volumes of software created by AI coding agents. Popular open source projects are particularly overwhelmed these days with suggested code contributions that may or may not be AI slop — meaning poorly designed and possibly unusable code.

Dohmke explains in the press release: “We are living through an agent boom, and now massive volumes of code are being generated faster than any human could reasonably understand. The truth is, our manual system of software production — from issues, to git repositories, to pull requests, to deployment — was never designed for the era of AI in the first place.” 

Dohmke was CEO of Microsoft's GitHub for four years, leaving in August 2025 to found a startup, he said in a post on X at the time. During his time there, he oversaw the rise of the popular coding agent GitHub Copilot.

Other investors in the seed round include Madrona, M12, Basis Set, Harry Stebbings, Jerry Yang, and Datadog founder and CEO Olivier Pomel.

Modern enterprises generate enormous amounts of security data, but legacy tools like Splunk still require companies to store all of it in one place before they can detect threats — a slow and costly process that's increasingly breaking down in cloud environments where volumes are exploding and data lives everywhere. 

AI cybersecurity startup Vega Security wants to flip that approach by running security where the data already lives, implementing in cloud services, data lakes, and existing storage systems. And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

Led by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega's valuation to $700 million, and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef up its go-to-market team, and expand globally.

Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.  

“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Sandler told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”

Like so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military's cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, which Intel acquired for $650 million in 2022. After a year at Intel, Sandler decided to “do it big time in the cybersecurity world.”

That pedigree is partly what attracted the attention of Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel. But it was also Vega's ambitious approach to security management in a market that is already dominated by one player: Splunk.

Brasoveanu told TechCrunch that legacy SIEM companies like Splunk, which Cisco acquired in 2024 for $28 billion, have been criticized in recent years because their solutions are difficult to scale. They fail at processing the insane rise of data volumes driven by AI. 

“Splunk and every contender since has always centralized the data, but by doing that you essentially hold the customer hostage,” Brasoveanu said. 

However, sometimes it's easier to hate the status quo than do the work of making a switch to a better alternative, a quandary any startup attempting to breach enterprise budgets understands. That's why Sandler says Vega's “North Star” was to not only build a solution that is more cost effective and better at threat detection, but “to make it no drama, as simple as possible for the biggest, most complex enterprises in the world to adopt it within minutes.”

Vega's approach seems to be working. The 100-person startup has already signed multimillion-dollar contracts with banks, healthcare companies, and Fortune 500 firms, including cloud-heavy companies like Instacart.

“The only reason they would do that with a two-year-old startup is because the problem is so painful and other solutions on the market require an unrealistic expectation that the enterprise change the way they operate or do two years of data migrations,” Sandler said. “Vega enables them to just plug and play and achieve immediate detection response value.”

YouTube is rolling out a new AI-powered playlist-generation feature that allows Premium users on iOS and Android to use text prompts to create playlists. 

Users can go to the Library tab, tap the “New” button, and select the “AI playlist” option to get started. They can then use text or voice to enter the prompt of their choice, such as “raging death metal,” “sad post rock,” “progressive house mix for a chill party,” “indie pop,” or “90s classic hits,” to build a playlist.

YouTube has been toying around with using AI to create playlists for a while. In July 2024, the company was testing a feature to let people create custom radio stations using prompts in the U.S.

Other rival streaming services like Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer have also rolled out AI-powered playlist or radio creation features.

YouTube has been trying to make its Premium plan more attractive to users. Earlier this week, the company started restricting free users from viewing song lyrics on the YouTube Music app. The company told TechCrunch that the restriction was an experiment it was running “with a small percentage of ad-supported users” and that song lyrics are available to the vast majority of free users.

Google has seen an uptick in its subscription business, and YouTube is a key part of that division. Earlier this month, the company said it now has 325 million paying users across Google One and YouTube Premium.

The fake goods crisis cuts two ways. Luxury brands lose more than $30 billion a year to counterfeits, while buyers in the booming $210 billion second-hand market have no reliable way to verify that what they're purchasing is genuine. Veritas wants to solve both problems with a solution that combines custom hardware and software.

The startup claims that it has developed a “hack-proof” chip that can't be bypassed by devices like Flipper Zero, a widely available hacking tool that can be used to tamper with wireless systems. These chips are linked with digital certificates to verify the authenticity of the products.

Vertitas founder Luci Holland has experienced life as both a technologist and an artist. She has worked in different artistic mediums, including mixed media painting and metal sculpture. She has also worked at Tesla as a technical product manager and has held several business development, community growth, and product management roles at tech companies and venture funds.

Holland noted that traditionally, luxury goods makers use various symbols or physical marks to authenticate their products. However, with the growing demand for these goods, counterfeiters have learned to create convincing copies of these marks along with high-quality fake certificates. These goods are often called “superfakes.”

Holland mentioned that she spoke with maisons — established luxury fashion houses — that said that some of their locations had to stop authenticating goods because fakes were becoming too convincing to reliably detect. She said that drawing on her experience in both the tech and art worlds, she wanted to solve the problem.

“For me, as someone who has a background in being a designer and then also has experience in tech, I saw this problem and thought about the different ways we could solve it. I think what's truly innovative is we've used and combined elements from both hardware and software to create this solution that helps protect brands in this way to convey the information,” she said.

“When I think of counterfeiting and I think of the most iconic and legacy brands,” she added, “a lot of these brands have been around for over 100, 150 years. These brands deserve the most advanced protection to protect these designs.”

Veritas worked with different designers to create a chip that is minimally disruptive to the product creation process. The chip is the size of a small gem and can easily be inserted even after a product is made without compromising its integrity. The chip incorporates NFC, or Near Field Communication — the same short-range wireless technology used in contactless payments. This means you can tap your smartphone on the item to verify its authenticity.

Holland said that for security purposes, the startup developed a custom coil and a bridge structure. If someone attempts to tamper with the product, the chip goes dormant and hides the codes related to the product. On the software side, the product information is linked to the Veritas back end, which monitors scanning behavior to prevent fraud. The company also creates a blockchain-based digital clone of the product for possible digital art gallery shows or metaverse activities.

The company didn't reveal who it is working with, but said that brands can use its software suite to get information about all the chipped products, add team members to manage items and add product information along with the product story — details that can also be used to connect with their community. The startup said that some partners use this to engage customers through exclusive invitations or early access to new products.

While the counterfeiting market is big, Holland thinks the market still needs education around why it needs robust tech solutions.

“It is shocking to see that some of the shelf solutions, like NFC chips that brands are using, are actually so vulnerable and could easily be bypassed. This is the one thing most people don't know, and we want to educate the ecosystem to adopt safer solutions,” Holland said.

Veritas said that it raised $1.75 million in pre-seed funding led by Seven Seven Six, along with Doordash co-founder Stanley Tang, skincare brand Reys' co-founder Gloria Zhu, and former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine. The company plans to use the funding to expand its two-person team.

Seven Seven Six's Alexis Ohanian said that he was impressed by the combination of design taste and technology expertise of Holland. He thinks that brands know that fake goods are a problem and are constantly looking for robust solutions. 

“It's absolutely an arms race [against fake goods makers], but we're used to fighting those and consistently winning in tech — and luxury brands need all the help they can get,” Ohanian said.

Even on modern hardware there's still a lot of architectural differences to reconcile at the API level.

While I agree with your general point, RHEL stands out way, way more to me.  Ubuntu 22.04 and RHEL 9 were both released in 2022.

This is why I try to encourage new Linux users away from Ubuntu: it's a laggard with, often important, functionality. It is now an enterprise OS (where durability is more important than functionality), it's not really suitable for a power user (like someone who would use Zed).

You really want enterprise standards support for your graphics API.Bleeding edge ...is not nice in graphics. Especially the more complex the systems get, so do the edge cases.I mean in general. If you are writing a high end game engine don't listen to me, you know better.

Arch is a wonderful daily driver distro for folks who can deal with even a small amount of configuration.Excellent software availability through AUR, excellent update times (pretty much immediate).The only downside is there's not a ton of direct commercial software packaged for it by default (ex - most companies they care give a .deb or a .rpm) but that's easily made up for by the rest of AUR.It's not even particularly hard to install anymore - run `archinstall` https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall make some choices, get a decent distro.Throw in that steam support is pretty great... and it's generally one of the best distros available right now for general use by even a moderate user.Also fine as a daily driver for kids/spouses as long as there's someone in the house to run pacman every now and then, or help install new stuff.

However it looks like it's simpler to change your shaders (if you can) to use the new GLSL/SPIR-V functionality (or Slang) and don't specify the root signature at all (it's complex and verbose).Descriptor heaps really reduce the amount of setup code needed, with pipeline layouts gone you can drop like third of the code needed to get started.Similar in magnitude to dynamic rendering.

The current OpenGL-like sediment-layer-model (e.g. never remove old stuff) is extremely confusing when not following Vulkan development very closely since 2016, since there's often 5 ways to do the same thing, 3 of which are deprecated - but finding out whether a feature is deprecated is its own sidequest.What I actually wrestled with most was getting the outer frame-loop right without validation layer errors. I feel like this should be the next thing which the ""Eye of Khronos"" should focus on.All official tutorial/example code I've tried doesn't run without swapchain-sync-related validation errors on one or another configuration. Even this 'best practices' example code which demonstrates how to do the frame-loop scaffolding correctly produces valiation layer errors, so it's also quite useless:https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/swapchain_semaphore_reu...What's worse: different hardware/driver combos produce different validation layer errors (even in the swapchain-code which really shouldn't have different implementations across GPU vendors - e.g. shouldn't Khronos provide common reference code for those GPU-independent parts of drivers?). I wonder if there is actually any Vulkan code out there which is completely validation-layer-clean across all possible configs (I seriously doubt it).Also the VK_[EXT/KHR]_swapchain_maintenance1 extension which is supposed to fix all those little warts has such a low coverage that it's not worth supporting (but it should really be part of the core API by now - the extension is from 2019).Anyway... baby steps into the right direction, only a shame that it took a decade ;)

This idea creates a serious chicken-egg-problem.Two or three popular engine code bases sitting on top of Vulkan isn't enough 'critical mass' to get robust and high performance Vulkan drivers. When there's so little diversity in the code hammering on the Vulkan API it's unlikely that all the little bugs and performance problems lurking in the drivers will be triggered and fixed, especially when most Unity or Unreal game projects will simply select the D3D11 or D3D12 backend since their main target platform on PC is Windows.Similar problem to when GLQuake was the only popular OpenGL game, as soon as your own code used the GL API in a slightly different way than Quake did all kinds of things broke since those GL drivers only properly implemented and tested the GL subset used by GLQuake, and with the specific function call patterns of GLQuake.From what I've seen so far, the MESA Vulkan drivers on Linux seem to be in much better shape than the average Windows Vulkan driver. The only explanation I have for this is that there are hardly any Windows games running on top of Vulkan (instead they use D3D11 or D3D12), while running those same D3D11/D3D12 games on Linux via Proton always goes through the Vulkan driver. So on Linux there may be more 'evolutionary pressure' to get high quality Vulkan drivers indirectly via D3D11/D3D12 games that run via Proton.

BDA, dynamic rendering and shader objects almost make Vulkan bearable. What's still sorely missing is a single-line device malloc, a default queue that can be used without ever touching the queue family API, and an entirely descriptor-free code path. The latter would involve making the NV bindless extension the standard which simply gives you handles to textures, without making you manage descriptor buffers/sets/heaps. Maybe also put an easy-path for synchronization on that list and making the explicit API optional.Until then I'll keep enjoying OpenGL 4.6, which already had BDA with c-style pointer syntax in glsl shaders since 2010 (NV_shader_buffer_load), and which allows hassle-free buffer allocation and descriptor-set-free bindless textures.

The main thing that's not possible at all on top of Vulkan is his signals API, which I would enjoy seeing - it could be done if timeline semaphores could be waited on/signalled inside a command buffer, rather than just on submission boundaries.

It's also disappointing that OpenGL 4.6, released in 2017, is a decade ahead of WebGPU.

reply

Web graphics have never and will never be cutting edge, they can't as they have to sit on top of browsers that have to already have those features available to it. It can only ever build on top of something lower level. That's not inherently bad, not everything needs cutting edge, but ""it's outdated"" is also just inherently going to be always true.

reply

Also, some things could have easily be done different and then be implemented as efficient as a particular backend allows. Like pipelines. Just don't do pipelines at all. A web graphics API does not need them, WebGL worked perfectly fine without them. The WebGPU backends can use them if necessary, or not use them if more modern systems don't require them anymore. But now we're locked-in to a needlessly cumbersome and outdated way of doing things in WebGPU.Similarly, WebGPU could have done without that static binding mess. Just do something like commandBuffer.draw(shader, vertexBuffer, indexBuffer, texture, ...) and automatically connect the call with the shader arguments, like CUDA does. The backend can then create all that binding nonsense if necessary, or not if a newer backend does not need it anymore.

Except it didn't. In the GL programming model it's trivial to accidentially leak the wrong granular render state into the next draw call, unless you always reconfigure all states anyway (and in that case PSOs are strictly better, they just include too much state).The basic idea of immutable state group objects is a good one, Vulkan 1.0 and D3D12 just went too far (while the state group granularity of D3D11 and Metal is just about right).> Similarly, WebGPU could have done without that static binding mess.This I agree with, pre-baked BindGroup objects were just a terrible idea right from the start, and AFAIK they are not even strictly necessary when targeting Vulkan 1.0.

reply

This is where I think Vulkan and WebGPU are chasing the wrong goal: To make draw calls faster. What's even faster, however, is making fewer draw calls and that's something graphics devs can easily do when you provide them with tools like multi-draw. Preferably multi-draw that allows multiple different buffers. Doing so will naturally reduce costly state changes with little effort.

I'm not certain of the conclusion - I think a lot depends on amortization schedules - if data centers are fully booked right now, then we don't need very long amortization schedules at the reported 60+% margin on inference to see this capex fully paid off.My prior is that we are seeing something like 1/10,000th or so of the reasonable inference demand the world has fulfilled. There's a note in the analysis that might back this - it says that we are seeing one of the only times ever where hardware prices are rising over time. Combined with spot prices at lambda labs (still quite high I'd say), it doesn't look like we're seeing a drop in inference demand.Under those circumstances, the first phases of this bet, cross-industry, look like they will pay off. If that's true, as an investment strategy, I'd just buy the basket - oAI, Anthropic, GOOG, META, SpaceX, MSFT, probably even Oracle, and wait.

For countries that can't build their own frontier models, the next best thing is going to be running them in local datacenters; MSFT has long standing operational bases everywhere in the world, it's arguably one of their differentiators compared to GOOG/META.

My prior is that we are seeing something like 1/10,000th or so of the reasonable inference demand the world has fulfilled. There's a note in the analysis that might back this - it says that we are seeing one of the only times ever where hardware prices are rising over time.

Perhaps all of these data centers won't be needed. At least not by some of the current AI companies that won't keep up. If that happens to OpenAI, that would be quite a shock to the financial system (and GDP).Microsoft's changes to windows have alienated some of their userbase. Copilot is poor compared to it's rivals. There's a reason they are down 20%. Linux adoption use is accelerating (still too low!).And don't forget AI on device. When it becomes ""good enough"" for most tasks, data centre use will reduce.With the talk of Nvidia backtracking and saying they won't invest 100 billion in OpenAI, Oracle in a poor financial position with the loan's for it's upcoming data centres becoming more expensive and dubious (they could fail to pay them)- the picture isn't as positive as you make it out to be. Which makes me think that you have an ulterior motive.

Here's the thing - we could list technical challenges / problems all day. And still, I use way more inference than a year ago. I'd use even more, a lot more, if it were faster (latency terms). I want to buy it, the providers want to sell it to me. So, your statement ""hallucinations cripple them for .. professional uses"" is just incorrect. The correct statement is ""despite hallucinations, professional use is skyrocketing."" Openclaw has like 150,000 GitHub stars in the last month. People are using inference at all levels of society.I propose to you that if in fact we get some sort of AGI that is 10,000x more compute efficient than transformer architectures, then datacenter investment losses will no longer matter in a material way to almost anyone in the world. So, you might be right, but you've already got that 'trade' or 'return' banked -- cheap ubiquitous AGI as you propose might happen will provide broad benefits. In those terms you're sort of doubling up on your short by not getting some upside exposure to the long.Re: MSFT, yep, it's a contrarian position. That said, I'm interested in informed short perspective on MSFT - do you think that the loss of windows licensing revenues would offset the benefit of being the world's ""safe"" local AI datacenter provider? And, are you sure that there is even a reduction in windows licensing? Satya's comments in a recent interview made it sound like they see agentic usage multiplying windows licenses -- basically when you spin up a web agent, it will lease a windows license to run the browser -- and parallel agents = multiple simultaneous leases - so they are seeing more and more revenue shift to azure in this world, away from direct license for desktops. To me, it feels like this will could be an incredible new era of platform lock-in for them - the azure stack is the only way to safely run gpt5 in a nationally protected datacenter - and oh, by the way, once you're signed up, one contract gets you a full MS software license.

A $1T investment needs to produce on the order of $100B in yearly earnings to be a good investment.Global GDP is about $100T.So one way for things to work out for the AI companies would be if AI raises GDP by 1% and the AI companies capture 10% of the created value.

That would mean earnings of ~ $1.1T would be required on that investment annually, so maybe on $2T of revenue, capturing 2% of the global GDP - so I'd estimate that GDP would need to go up more like 5-10% to justify this.[1] https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gf2t!,f_auto,q_auto:...

Right now much of the direct monetization occurs via OpenAI and Anthropic, who together have around $30B in annualized revenue. They are burning cash like crazy, though admittedly have potentially sustainable unit economics (gross margins around 40-60% before revenue share).However, they need to spend a huge chunk of revenue on training. OpenAI spent something like $9b on training against around $13-14b in rev in 2025 (different from annualized rev) according to The Information. Anthropic's mix is supposed to be similar. Also implies a lot (maybe majority) of their compute spend is training.If scaling laws falter, what happens to training spending? What happens to competitive degree of differentiation given Chinese open source models are a few months behind frontier? Then what happens to margins? It is very fragile.

For call-me pricing to work, you have to ensure that any sort of public sticker price is not a suitable alternative.    You can not have a sticker price, make the sticker price so high essentially nobody will buy it or by finding a feature like oauth that makes the public version infeasible for businesses.And then you also have to maintain enough of a monopoly / oligarchy to sustain that level of pricing.I don't think either of those two conditions will apply in the future.AI providers now have a sticker price that provides basically all functionality, almost completely eliminating the opportunity for extremely high-margin b2b.   They've decided a small slice of a large pie is bigger than large piece of a smaller pie.   I suspect that's true and will continue to be true in the future.An oligarchy is difficult to sustain with more than 3 global players.   Right now we seem to have 3 frontier models for coding that can and will charge more than commodity prices.    However there are open source non-frontier models that you can use for inference costs only and even if those don't keep up it seems likely there will be enough non-frontier models available that their pricing will also be at the commodity level.    Those cheaper models will provide significant downward pressure on frontier pricing.

We have not seen iterative AI use for example.The use case, where you tell the model ""Solve this task. Then solve it again. Keep the better solution, then solve it again. On and on. Tomorrow, show me the best solution."".And also not the ""Run a company on your own"" use case.Those might make people and companies use models full-time. The price of that will be way different from current subscription prices. The TCO of a single instance of a SOTA model is on the order of $100k per year.

1. Models become commodities and immensely cheaper to operate for inference as a result of some future innovation. This would presumably be very bad for the handful of companies who have invested that $1T and want to recoup that, but great for those of us who love cheap inference.2. #1 doesn't happen and the model providers start begin to feel empowered to pass the true cost of training + inference down to the model consumer. We start paying thousands of dollars per month for model usage and the price gate blocks out most people from reaping the benefits of bleeding-edge AI, instead being locked into cheaper models that are just there to extract cash by selling them things.Personally I'm leaning toward #1. Future models near as good as the absolute best will get far cheaper to train, and new techniques and specialized inference chips will make them much cheaper to use. It isn't hard for me to imagine another Deepseek moment in the not-so-distant future. Perhaps Anthropic is thinking the same thing given the rumors that they are rumored to be pushing toward an IPO as early as this year.

The use of the counterfactual seems to suggest that income distribution has no relationship with growth in total income, and total income would have been exactly the same regardless of income distribution. I see no reason to assume that to be the case.

Do you think I'm talking about my own, personal income?I'm talking about median personal income in the United States, because the figures I found for household income only go back to 1985

Looks like Sam Altman and Jony Ive will have to wait until next year to kill AirPods, or the iPhone, or revolutionize the pen, or whatever it is they're actually doing with their AI-centric hardware venture.

According to a report from Wired, court filings indicate that Sam Altman and Jony Ive have hit yet another snag in their nascent journey into AI gadgets with a newly formed company, io. The first snag is that, well, they may not really be able to call the company “io” at all. Per Wired:

“Peter Welinder, OpenAI's vice president and general manager, said in the filing that OpenAI had reviewed its product-naming strategy and decided not to use the name ‘io'…in connection with the naming, advertising, marketing, or sale of any artificial intelligence-enabled hardware products.”

“Decided” is an interesting choice of words here, given that the company was actually sued and issued a court order in June over a trademark claim regarding the use of that name. What OpenAI “decided” exactly is unclear, but from the outside, it looks like the decision was not theirs. It's also unclear what name they'll go with now, but maybe they could try “Pear,” or “Grape,” or some other one-word fruit, since last I checked, “Apple” was already taken. Wouldn't want to repeat that mistake twice.

That's snag number one. Snag number two is that the company now has a new timeline for the release of its first piece of hardware, and it's a bit further out than we had anticipated. According to Wired, Sam Altman and Jony Ive's now nameless company will not start shipping its first gadget until February of 2027. The Information and Axios have reported that OpenAI could unveil its devices as soon as this year. As a result, the projected unveiling of the device by the second half of this year is now uncertain, though the company might still have something to show by then.

I say “might” because it's really hard to tell just how far along any of this stuff is. Reports last year of difficulties getting devices to do basic stuff aren't instilling much confidence. According to a report from the Financial Times, Sam Altman and Jony Ive are struggling to actually muster the computing power to enable their computer(s) to, um, compute. On top of that, they're struggling to get their voice assistant (which apparently is supposed to be listening all the time) to function in a way that makes the device usable. One problem in particular has reportedly been getting the voice assistant to listen when you want it to and shut up when appropriate.

Listen, I get it; figuring anything new out is going to come with its own unique set of challenges, and some of those challenges aren't going to be easily solvable overnight. The problem is that when you take a simple fact like that and place it in the context of AI gadgets, it becomes very easy to cast doubt on the whole idea. AI gadgets have had a rough go; just ask Humane and its fallen AI Pin or Rabbit and the increasingly irrelevant R1.

The problem isn't even that those devices didn't take off; it's that they seemingly didn't do half of what was promised. Maybe OpenAI can solve critical flaws with AI gadgets, but maybe the problem is that there are too many issues to solve. Could be that AI just isn't smart enough yet, and neither are the voice assistants powered by it. Or maybe our general vice grip on phones as the end-all, be-all form factor is too strong for a device like Altman and Ive's to pry open. No matter which way you spin it, the company formerly known as io has a lot to solve, and the problems just seem to keep piling up.

xAI, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, just lost yet another cofounder.

Tony Wu announced on X today that he has resigned from the company, becoming the latest founding member to depart the AI startup since its launch in 2023.

“This company – and the family we became – will stay with me forever. I will deeply miss the people, the warrooms, and all those battles we have fought together,” wrote Wu in a post. “It's time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what's possible.”

He added that he was grateful to Musk for “believing in the mission” and “the ride of a lifetime.”

xAI was founded in 2023 by Musk and 11 other cofounders, many of whom previously worked at companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. That same year, the company released Grok as an alternative to popular chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude.

Before founding xAI, Musk repeatedly complained that mainstream chatbots were too woke.

“The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly,” Musk wrote in a 2022 post on X.

In contrast, Grok was designed to be “useful to people of all backgrounds and political views.”

However, in the years since xAI was founded, the company has experienced its share of ups and downs. The AI company merged with Musk's social media platform X early last year. And just this month, xAI merged with another one of Musk's companies, this time SpaceX. This merger comes as SpaceX is reportedly set to go public and launch an initial public offering this year.

Meanwhile, Grok and X have faced mounting regulatory scrutiny in Europe. Paris prosecutors' cybercrime unit, along with Europol and French national police, raided X's offices last week as part of an investigation that began in January 2025. The probe initially focused on suspected manipulation of X's recommendation algorithm and the extraction of unauthorized data. It has since widened to examine other possible violations, including complicity in the spread of pornographic images involving minors, the use of sexual deepfakes that infringe on people's rights, and the circulation of Holocaust denial content.

The city prosecutor's office also announced that it has issued summonses to Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino for a hearing scheduled for April.

X is also facing scrutiny from authorities in the U.K., the European Union, and California over similar concerns.

Wu is not the first cofounder to leave. Kyle Kosic, Igor Babuschkin, and Christian Szegedy all departed over the past two years. And Greg Yang posted on X last month that he would step back from the company to focus on his health after being diagnosed with Lyme disease.

Meanwhile, xAI is looking to hire. In a push to get the word out, one of the AI company's engineers, Ethan He, did his best to make it sound like a mundane company where a “small focused team” moves quickly to execute ambitious goals. “No politics,” He emphasized.

Thanks to X3D CPUs like the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, AMD's partners are still pushing out new high-end motherboards, like Asus' latest flagship ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial, which is on our test bench today. This icy white E-ATX motherboard is the pinnacle of Asus' technology on the X870E platform. In typical flagship fashion, the board is covered in heatsinks, magnetic shrouds, and even includes a large 5-inch LCD. You can tell just by looking at it that this board is both impressive and expensive. At $1,199.99, it is costly and right up there with other recently released flagships like the MSI X870E Godlike X and Gigabyte's X870E Aorus Xtreme X3D AI TOP, both well over $1,000.

I'm not sure where to start regarding features, as there are so many to cover. There's a whopping seven M.2 sockets between the included Hyper M.2 and DIMM.2 add-in-cards, with three capable of running the full PCIe 5.0 x4 bandwidth (the fourth 5.0 x2). It's also the only desktop-class board with two 10 GbE ports. On top of that, the Glacial has an incredibly robust 28-phase VRM, a high-end audio solution with integrated DAC/AMP, and loads of other perks, including EZ PC DIY and AI features (for overclocking, cooling, and performance) that aim to pull you in. On top of all the hardware, it looks good too, though some of the bottom shrouds need to be removed to install a graphics card in the top PCIe slot, taking away from the aesthetic.

The ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial performed well across our test suite. Productivity results were in line with other AM5 boards, occasionally surpassing or falling short of the average. While gaming benchmarks like 3DMark were slower, performance in actual games was good, with most differences only notable in synthetic tests. Overall, the board delivers solid performance, looks good, and is fully featured.Below, we'll examine the Glacial's performance and other features to determine whether it deserves a spot on our list of the best motherboards.

Inside the retail packaging, the massive amount of accessories includes the Hyper M.2 and DIMM.2 cards, and even a small fan to cool your memory. The number is too large to put in a paragraph, so we've listed all that box includes, and a picture of the unique items, below.

The Crosshair X870E Glacial certainly looks the part of a flagship motherboard. The informative (and adjustable) 5-inch LCD is a focal point, as is the raised chrome ROG symbol on the magnetic shroud covering the PCIe slots and two M.2 sockets. Below is another magnetic cover that hides all the connectivity at the bottom. It looks fantastic in white — a very clean look.

That said, to install a PCIe card, you'll need to remove that awesome-looking shroud in the middle (or use a riser card in the bottom slot and expose the headers across the bottom). That gives way to another heatsink below for the two integrated M.2 sockets, but it's clearly not the showpiece. I understand it's typically not visible, but if you use a vertically mounted GPU, the less-attractive M.2 heatsink plate is visible. On the surface, it just seems wasteful (read: increase on the BOM) when they can incorporate that into one heatsink and still show it off. Perhaps there's some engineering magic we're unaware of.

 




Looking at the top half of the board, starting on the left, gives us a better view of the 5-inch LCD. You can display things like pre-loaded ROG animations, hardware information, or your own customized image. The screen is also adjustable (preventing the rear fan from covering any portion of the screen). Under that is a large heatpipe-connected VRM heatsink to cool the highly-capable power delivery below. Above that, and hidden beneath the top magnetically connected shroud, are two 8-pin EPS connectors (one required) to power the processor.

Moving right past the socket and before the DRAM slots is the new Asus Q-connector. The proprietary 11-pin connector transfers power and control signals (think pump, ARGB, fans, and, on some models, the display) directly through the motherboard, eliminating the need for traditional, visible, individual cables that detract from a clean aesthetic. At the time of this writing, only the CES 2026-announced ROG Strix LC and SLC IV 360 AIOs work with the connector. It's a useful feature if you plan to use compatible Asus AIOs. Otherwise, the gold contacts stick out from the white aesthetic (why not put a white rubber cover on it, Asus?).

Next, the four DRAM slots to the right have locking mechanisms on both sides. It's a tight fit for the bottom locks (requires something skinny to poke them), or remove another magnetic piece next to PCIe latch that says Glacial on it to get better access. Or, use a single locking mechanism at the top. Asus lists support for DDR5-8600 for 9000 series desktop processors and even higher (DDR5-9200) for APUs, though unless you're benching for Hwbot, I can't see anyone using an APU on a $1,200 motherboard. Still, that's plenty fast and way past AMD's sweetspot.

To the right of the RAM slots is Asus' DIMM.2 slot for additional M.2 drives. The DIMM.2 add-in-card holds two modules, up to 110mm. One runs at PCIe 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps), and the other at 4.0 x2 (32 Gbps). This is a great way to add easily swappable M.2 storage. Asus also includes the Hyper M.2 card, which you install in a PCIe slot. The Hyper M.2 offers two more PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps) M.2 sockets, bringing the total to four (if you force M.2_2 to x4 speeds). If your build needs a lot of fast M.2, the Glacial is where it's at.

Above the DRAM slots (still under the shroud) are the first three (of eight) standard 4-pin fan headers. Per usual, each supports PWM and DC-controlled devices. Power output varies from 1A/12W on most headers (CPU, Rad, Chassis, AIO, and EF fans), while the two pump headers allow 3A/36W. The Asus BIOS or Armory Crate software controls these attached devices.

To the right of that are the ProbeIt measurement points that let you measure your system's current voltage and oc settings. You can measure Vcore, Vmem, VSOC, and eight other voltages. This is primarily useful for the extreme overclocker, but it's always worth verifying against software, as that can be off. Next to that are four Q-LEDs and the Q-Code LED that helps with troubleshooting POST issues.

Looking down the right edge, we see another shroud with two buttons on top (Start and Flexkey), and beneath those are multiple 90-degree headers. This includes the first 3-pin ARGB header, two additional 4-pin fan headers (W_Pump and CHA_FAN2), the 24-pin ATX power connector, and two front-panel USB 3.2 Type-C connectors (both 20 Gbps).

 




Power delivery on the X870E Glacial is one of the most capable we've seen. With a total of 28 phases (24 for Vcore), you're not going to find one more potent. Power heads from the 8-pin EPS connectors and onto the Digi+ EPU voltage regulator. From there, it moves to the Infineon PMC41420 110A MOSFETs. The 2,640 Amps available will handle any CPU you throw at it, whether you're using ambient or extreme cooling methods, even a Ryzen 9 9950X or the recently released Ryzen 9 9850X3D.

At the bottom of the board, hidden under the shrouds, are the audio, PCIe slots, and M.2 sockets. Starting on the left, Asus uses the flagship-class Supreme FX audio solution (read: Realtek ALC4082 codec) along with an ESS Q9219 DAC. This is the best native audio combination you can get, and what you'd expect from a high-end board.

Next are the two PCIe slots hidden beneath magnetically attached shrouds. I don't see the point of this decorative shroud, as you have to remove it to use either PCIe slot (and who's going to use the iGPU only on a board like this?). You can use the bottom slot with negligible losses from the primary slot (it is PCIe 5.0 x8), but there you're exposing the headers across the bottom.

Both of these reinforced slots connect through the CPU, offering PCIe 5.0 bandwidth. The top slot is for primary graphics and runs at x16 speeds (breaking down to x8/X8, x8/x4/x4, or x4/x4/x4/x4 modes), while the bottom slot is limited to x8. Note that this applies to 7000 and 9000 series desktop processors; APUs are different (see the specifications on Asus' website for details). Asus moved away from its controversial PCIe latching mechanism. The company adopted a mechanical lever system on the Glacial that's easy to use and won't risk scratching the connector on your expensive graphics card.

Under the shrouds and heatsinks are three M.2 sockets. The top M.2 socket, M.2_1, under the large 3D VC M.2 heatsink (with Q-Release) runs PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps) and supports up to 110mm modules. The second socket, M.2_2, also connects to the CPU and runs PCIe 5.0 x2 by default as it shares lanes with the USB4 ports. It can run at x4 by forcing it in the BIOS, but this disables the USB4 ports altogether. The third native socket, M.2_3, connects to the chipset and runs at PCIe 4.0 x4. Asus made connecting M.2 drives easy with the M.2 Q-Latch or M.2 Q-Slide functionality. No screws!

The two PROM21 chips for the chipset are under their own really cool-looking heatsinks, which are under the M.2 heatsink, and under that fancy shroud that covers the PCIe slots (yes, that sentence is intentional and correct). While that's fine, what I found odd was that the heatsinks had a protective plastic on them that you need to remove. It's not like they're ever visible and need protection, so why even bother putting them on? There's a chance the board will live its life with plastic on the heatsink, as it's plausible that users forgo M.2_2/3 under the heatsink and use DIMM.2 or the Hyper M.2 AICs instead. I don't think it's a big deal, but it was a curious choice to put plastic on something buried that doesn't need protection.

Moving to the right edge, we see more horizontal connectivity. The first thing we see is the 8-pin PCIe connector for supplemental power to the motherboard (and to enable 60W USB-C charging). There are two 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) connectors, a system fan header, and the front panel header.We've also included many images of the active IC's for the board. The Glacial uses multiple ASMedia (USB), Infineon (VRMs), and Realtek (Audio, USB).

Along the bottom are several headers under the magnetic cover, ranging from all four SATA ports to BCLK adjustment buttons for overclocking, with a lot in between. If you're keen on using the shroud and the SATA ports, be sure to use 90-degree connectors so they fit underneath without excessive cable bends. The rest of the connectors are all thin wires that bend and should fit naturally. A complete list of connectivity is listed below (from L to R):

 




The rear IO on the X870E Glacial is packed with connectivity, including 14 USB ports. On the left are two buttons: one to clear the CMOS (backlit with a green LED) and the other for BIOS Flashback functionality. The first two Type-C ports (vertical) run at 10 Gbps; the next two are 40 Gbps USB4 ports; and on the right are two more 10 Gbps Type-C ports. The eight red Type-A ports are all 10 Gbps. In the middle of all those USB ports are the two Realtek 10 GbE ports. On the right are the Wi-Fi 7 quick-connect antenna and the audio stack, with two 3.5mm jacks (mic in, line out), both backlit with LEDs (red and green, respectively).

Randy  Dotinga

SAN DIEGO — Researchers identified patients who tested positive for the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) 9 years after they were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), challenging the idea that MS always follows EBV.

The findings come in an analysis of nearly 100,000 patients with positive EBV tests in the Canadian province of Ontario from 2007 to 2002.

Of 300 people diagnosed with MS, 74 tested positive for EBV after their MS diagnosis. Previous research suggests EBV infection almost always precedes the development of MS. Although the number of cases was small, researchers said the total was larger than they expected.

“We required our cases to have at least three MS diagnostic codes so we cannot explain away these cases as being an isolated demyelinating attack or clinically isolated syndrome. Our findings suggest that cases of MS onset preceding EBV need to be further explored in other cohorts,” lead investigators Dalia Rotstein, MD, MPH, associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto and MS specialist at Barlo MS Clinic at St. Michael's Hospital Toronto, both in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were presented on February 6 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2026.

Previous research has offered strong evidence that EBV infection increases the risk for MS, with some studies showing more than to 99% of patients with MS have been infected with the virus.

One often cited landmark study from 2022 showed a 32-fold increased risk for MS following EBV seroconversion in US military personnel. Only one person out of 801 was EBV negative in samples taken a median of 1 year before MS onset.

Those findings and others seem to suggest that EBV infection is a prerequisite for MS.

However, that study had a number of key limitations that Rotstein said limited the odds of detecting cases of MS diagnosis predating EBV from the outset.

“The US military population is predominantly male and White, and they captured people only from the age of military recruitment onward, which is older than the typical age for EBV seroconversion,” Rotstein noted.

“We were curious about what we would find when we looked for cases of MS onset before primary EBV infection in the general population,” she said.

To explore that question, researchers identified 95,980 patients who tested positive for EBV using the Ontario Laboratories Information System database, which captures more than 80% of laboratory tests performed in Ontario. Of those, 300 had MS.

Among those with MS, 74 patients (75.7% female) had a positive EBV test after MS diagnosis.

In this group, the mean age at MS onset was 33.3 years, but the mean age of a positive EBV test was 42.5 years. The mean time from MS onset to a positive EBV test was 9.1 years.

“We don't know yet exactly what is going on with apparent cases of MS that occur before EBV,” Rotstein said.

Possible explanations include that some patients were misdiagnosed with MS, EBV tests were false positives, or that patients had a latent EBV infection that reactivated after MS diagnosis.

“Given the number of cases, we have to entertain the probability of a third hypothesis: There is some etiologic diversity underlying what we define clinically as MS,” Rostein said.

“For example, other research has suggested an association between the HHV-6A [human betaherpesvirus] virus and the development of MS. And like EBV, HHV-6A viral load seems to rise in advance of neurofilament light-chain changes,” Rotstein added.

The unusually late age of EBV infection in the MS cohort also gave researchers pause. The median age of a positive EBV test among those with MS was twice that of all 95,980 individuals in the cohort who also tested positive for the virus (42.5 years vs 21.5 years, respectively).

“This is older than the typical age for EBV, even when we consider the symptomatic cases of EBV infection which get tested, which typically occur in the late teenage years. However, we know that about 5% of the general adult population has never contracted EBV, and it is possible for EBV infection to transpire at older ages,” Rotstein said.

When presenting the findings at ACTRIMS Forum, Rotstein noted several study limitations, including a lack of blood samples to test EBV status before MS onset, a lack of EBV testing after MS onset, and a lack of other information about MS cases prior to EBV testing.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Michael Levy, MD, PhD, associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, both in Boston, who didn't take part in the study, highlighted other limitations as well.

For example, EBV testing has a false positive rate of up to 10%, he said.

“Out of the 300 (0.31%) tested who met the algorithm for MS, if 10% could be false positive, that's 30 people, which represents almost half of the cases that were detected after a visit for demyelinating disease,” Levy said.

He also questioned the “highly unusual” age at testing for EBV infection.

“That's a very strange time to get infected with EBV and immediately prompted my skepticism. A more detailed examination of these cases is warranted to explain this finding,” he said. “Why were people tested for heterophiles antibodies or VCA IgM [viral capsid antigen immunoglobulin M] at this time in the patient's journey? There are other causes of these antibodies to be positive including lymphomas and other infections.”

Joseph Sabatino, MD, PhD, assistant professor at the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California San Francisco, also questioned the findings, especially the high age of patients in the cohort compared to when EBV is typically diagnosed.

Still, Sabatino said research into the link between EBV and MS is important.

“The big question here is: What does EBV do that allows MS to occur in only a very small fraction of people? It seems clear that MS can only develop in individuals with the ‘right' combination of genetic and environmental risk factors,” said Sabatino, who was not part of the study.

“If EBV is a fuse for MS, then we really need to understand the components of the bomb that it's setting off. By understanding that, we may come to find that there may be other triggers that could lead to MS independent of EBV,” Sabatino said.

The study was funded by the MS Canada and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Rotstein disclosed having relationships with the MS Canada, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Canada's Drug Agency, the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of Unity Health Toronto, Peter and Susan Gordon, Guthy-Jackson Research Foundation, the University of Toronto Division of Neurology, Amgen, and Alexion. She reported receiving speaker or consultant fees from Alexion, Amgen, Biogen, EMD Serono, Novartis, Roche, and Sanofi Aventis. Levy reported having no disclosures. Sabatino reported having relationships with Novartis, Roche/Genentech, IgM, TG, and Sift.

Sexual dysfunction affects a substantial proportion of the population, with an estimated 40%-45% of adults experiencing a sexual disorder at some point in their lives. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of psychosexual interventions, access to care remains limited due to stigma, shame, fear of judgment, and practical barriers that contribute to the inadequate management of sexual dysfunction.

Immersive digital technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and metaverse-based environments, have drawn increasing attention to sexology. These tools are being explored as ways to improve access to psychological and educational interventions while enabling therapeutic exposure to conditions such as sex-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anorgasmia, sexual aversion, erectile dysfunction (ED), and premature ejaculation (PE). Early clinical studies suggest that these technologies may improve sexual symptoms and associated psychological distress. However, most available evidence is based on small samples and noncontrolled designs, highlighting the need for larger randomized controlled trials (RCTs) before these approaches can be broadly implemented in routine care settings.

VR is an immersive technology that simulates a three-dimensional environment using specialized electronic devices, such as headsets and controllers. This creates a sense of presence and allows users to experience and interact with virtual worlds and simulated scenarios. This distinguishes it from the metaverse, which consists of shared virtual spaces accessed remotely, where users interact via avatars in socially interactive settings.

These technologies allow interventions to be provided at home in secure and discreet environments. This may be particularly valuable for individuals who are reluctant to attend in-person consultations because of embarrassment, stigma, or logistical constraints related to sexual health.

In addition, immersive environments make it possible to recreate situations that are difficult to access using conventional therapy, especially when mental imagery is limited. Therefore, real-time exposure to realistic scenarios can function as flexible and modifiable therapeutic exposure.

VR interventions in sexual therapy rely exclusively on psychological methods. They primarily targeted sex-related PTSD, ED, PE, anorgasmia, and sexual aversion.

The treatment protocols were heterogeneous. Some involve brief sessions lasting only a few minutes, while others consist of structured programs comprising 12-15 1-hour sessions over several months. The scenarios were tailored to the age, clinical presentation, and therapeutic goals of the participants.

Most interventions are based on graduated exposure or desensitization models derived from cognitive-behavioral therapy. Others have drawn on psychodynamic frameworks that integrate multimedia support and virtual experiences.

Most published studies assessing VR- or metaverse-based interventions in sexology have used pre-post designs without control groups.

Several studies have examined VR exposure in individuals with PTSD related to sexual traumas. A nonrandomized controlled study of women undergoing systematic desensitization in a virtual environment simulating sexual assault reported reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms, with no statistically significant difference compared with participants who were non-victims of sexual assault exposed to a virtual scenario.

In a pre-post study of veterans (n = 15), a VR exposure protocol with repeated immersive exposure sessions was associated with significant reductions in PTSD and depressive symptoms from baseline, with improvements maintained at the 3-month follow-up and medium-to-large effect sizes. Another uncontrolled study using a comparable protocol similarly reported sustained symptom reduction at 3 months.

For sexual aversion, a proof-of-concept study involving 15 adults used graduated exposure to VR. Symptoms decreased over 6 months, although transient increases in anxiety and disgust were observed during the treatment sessions.

An uncontrolled pre-post study of 160 men with erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation found that a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy integrating audiovisual stimulation delivered via a helmet-mounted display was associated with symptom improvement or resolution in approximately half of the participants after 12 sessions over 25 weeks, with no statistical analysis.

An RCT conducted in a metaverse environment among women with female orgasmic disorder found recovery in all participants in the intervention group after 12 sessions, with improvements in sexual function and satisfaction maintained at 3 months of follow-up, unlike in the minimally supported control group (n = 31).

Several conceptual limitations were identified. Current interventions often do not sufficiently emphasize patient autonomy and treatment ownership. Partners are frequently excluded from treatment, despite the relational dimensions of many sexual disorders. Important variables such as body image, sexual self-esteem, and sexual communication have also been inconsistently addressed.

Although metaverse-based solutions may partially reduce financial barriers, costs remain high.

Overall, while immersive technologies show promise for improving access to care and therapeutic exposure in sexology, the existing evidence remains limited. Larger RCTs are needed to clarify their efficacy, optimize protocols, and define their appropriate clinical roles.

Subdural hematoma with mild symptoms progressed significantly less often when treated with middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization compared with observation alone, new results from the second phase of the EMBOLISE trial showed.

In the prospective, multicenter randomized EMBOLISE trial, embolization of the MMA using the liquid embolic agent Onyx (Medtronic) reduced the composite primary endpoint of surgical drainage or clinical deterioration by 50% compared with conservative management in patients with mildly symptomatic subdural hematoma who were not candidates for surgery.

Onyx is a liquid embolic agent that is injected into an artery to occlude blood flow. In subdural hematoma, it is used to block the MMA, stopping the chronic oozing of blood into the subdural space.

The technique has demonstrated benefit in surgically treated subdural hematoma, and the current results show that it is also effective in nonsurgical patients.

“We are very excited to see a twofold reduction in the primary clinical endpoint in patients treated with embolization vs those managed conservatively,” said study investigator, Jared Knopman, MD, neurosurgeon and interventional neuroradiologist at Weill Cornell Medical College, New York City.

Knopman presented the latest results from the EMBOLISE trial on February 5 at International Stroke Conference (ISC) 2026.

Conducted at 60 US centers, the trial evaluated the role of MMA embolization with Onyx in the management of chronic subdural hematomas.

Reported in 2024 the first part of trial showed a positive effect of Onyx in a surgical cohort of patients and led to FDA approval of Onyx for MMA embolization as an adjunct to surgical therapy.

The results from the second part of the trial, known as EMBOLISE-2 and presented at ISC 2026, focused on a more mildly symptomatic patient cohort who were not considered candidates for surgery.

“EMBOLISE-2 represents the first and only trial to date specifically powered to study this more mildly symptomatic patient population,” Knopman noted.

The trial included 200 patients with subdural hematoma with a thickness < 15 mm and < 5 mm of midline shift. The vast majority of patients had mild symptoms, predominantly headaches and gait instability.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either observation or treatment with upfront MMA embolization with Onyx.

The two groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. The average subdural hematoma size was about 12 mm, with 2 mm of midline shift in each group.

There was a 27% loss to follow-up in the trial, which Knopman said was exacerbated by the COVID epidemic.

However, he noted that similar figures for loss to follow-up have been seen in other studies of nonsurgical patients with subdural hematoma.

“We are dealing with patients that are only mildly symptomatic and less likely to come back for follow-up,” he said.

He also pointed out that the primary endpoint in the trial was a composite and if any one of those endpoints was lacking, it would count as a loss to follow-up.

Primary results showed that the primary composite endpoint of either need for surgical drainage or poor clinical outcome or clinical deterioration at 90 days was halved in the group that underwent MMA embolization with Onyx (11.9%) vs 23% in the observation group (relative risk, 0.51; P = .04).

Poor clinical outcome was defined as a Markwalder score 2-4, motor strength score 0-3, or Glasgow Coma score 3-12; and clinical deterioration was defined as 1 or more point worsening in the Markwalder, motor strength, or Glasgow Coma score at 90 days.

The number needed to treat to prevent one primary endpoint adverse outcome was nine.

“This has vast implications for a disease state which affects an ever-growing number of our patient population and is growing in terms of deterioration of neurologic function,” Knopman said.

The number of patients experiencing deterioration of neurologic function did not meet noninferiority at 90 day (19.5% Onyx vs 9.7% control). However, noninferiority was met at 180 days (17% vs 15.2%).

Knopman said the finding was not surprising, noting that interventional studies often show higher early risk compared with conservative management, particularly when adverse events occur.

“What we did find surprising, though, is that the conservatively managed group did not have a benign course and that they paid the price down the line for consistently having that hematoma burden.”

“The takeaway here is that these patients are starting out with smaller subdural hematomas and may take a longer to manifest symptoms, but over time, they end up doing so.”

Hematoma volume was also reduced in the Onyx treated group at 50.3 ml vs 86.2 ml at 90 days and 43.8 ml vs 80.0 ml at 180 days.

“This again shows that those managed conservatively sustain a larger ongoing hematoma burden,” Knopman noted.

Adverse events included a higher rate of stroke in the Onyx group (6%) compared with no strokes in the control group.

Knopman said that while the imbalance was “concerning,” further review showed that none of the strokes were directly attributable to the treatment. Three of the six strokes occurred in patients who had been taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy that was withheld for the procedure.

Two others were related to catheterization of the internal carotid artery — one resulting in a dissection and the other in a shower of emboli. The remaining stroke was thought to be related to the patient's underlying medical condition, with a very high Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score indicating multiple comorbidities.

“The fact that five out of six of these strokes could be highly mitigated or prevented really taught us a couple of things about the procedure. One is that antithrombotic medication should not be stopped for secondary stroke prevention in this patient population, and the actual procedure itself should be kept simple, in the sense that you don't want to perform potentially unnecessary catheterizations,” he said.

Neurologic death occurred in 4% of patients in the Onyx group compared with 1% in the control group, but Knopman said the deaths were not attributable to Onyx itself. Instead, they were strongly associated with CCI scores and the interruption of antithrombotic therapies.

Knopman described the medical management aspect of the study as particularly interesting, noting that there is no evidence to support stopping antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy in nonsurgical patients. He said this was not surprising given that subdural hematoma progression is largely driven by inflammatory membrane leakage rather than acute re-bleeding.

“I'm probably preaching to the choir at a conference like ISC to stress the importance of secondary stroke prevention for our patients. But I think the neurosurgical community, which is a little bit more reflexive in stopping these agents, can learn something from what we're finding with respect to this,” he said.

Knopman said that adhering to several key procedural principles — avoiding catheterization of the internal carotid artery in patients with difficult aortic arch anatomy, maintaining a lower threshold for aborting the procedure, and not discontinuing medications needed for secondary stroke prevention — could help reduce risk.

“We think that we can mitigate the risks and maximize the robust clinical effects that embolization has on primary endpoint reduction even in this mildly symptomatic patient population,” he said.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Bijoy Menon, MD, vice-chair of the ISC and a professor of neurology at the University of Calgary in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, said the study showed promise for MMA embolization with Onyx in patients with subdural hematoma who have milder symptoms and are not considered candidates for surgery.

“The results suggest that this technique could potentially help prevent surgery and neurological deterioration in the future.”

Menon said he chose the word “potentially” deliberately, noting that the study was relatively small and had some loss to follow-up. It is important, he said, to understand who these patients lost to follow-up were.

He said that larger studies with complete follow-up are needed to better inform treatment decisions in this patient population.

Medtronic sponsored the trial. Knopman reported being a consultant to Medtronic Neurovascular.

Sleep disorders are underdiagnosed and fewer are even treated. This means that your patients could be spending night after night with poor sleep.

Obesity and sleep loss are two separate but often interconnected health concerns, each with its own set of risks.

“It is well known that obesity increases the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure, but obesity can also lead to structural changes in the body that make breathing more difficult and therefore contribute to sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea,” explained Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, MD, medical director of sleep medicine at Millennium Physician Group in Fort Myers, Florida. “In fact, even a 10% weight gain can increase [sleep apnea] risk by up to sixfold.”

In addition, she noted how the relationship is bidirectional: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) “can impair sleep quality, affect metabolism and hormone levels, making it harder to maintain or lose weight.” Sleep loss may also interfere with the body's natural hunger and satiety signals.

One potential explanation for patients' prolonged sleep deprivation and chronic poor sleep could be, of course, by sleep apnea. In contrast to topics like diet, physical activity, or blood pressure, there are limited campaigns around identifying symptoms of sleep disorders.

To raise awareness, the US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's Healthy People 2030 has set a goal to increase the proportion of adults with sleep apnea symptoms who get assessed by a healthcare provider. As a primary care doctor, you can help by encouraging your patients to “self-screen” by charting and monitoring their sleep quality.

In an ideal world, a review of sleep health would be part of a patient's regular annual physical, said Michael Perlis, PhD, associate professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry, and director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

“For decades it has been argued that primary care is the single best place to screen for, if not diagnose and treat, sleep disorders. Part of this is due to the ubiquity of sleep disorders in primary care,” Perlis said. “It is estimated that [more than] 50% of primary care patients have sleep disorders complaints.”

Even though there's a prevalence of sleeping disorders, discussing sleep disorders with patients can be overlooked and unaddressed and “this scenario is further compounded by patients' disinclination to talk about their sleep health,” he said.

Insomnia and sleep-related concerns are a very common primary care complaint, said Joseph R. Teel, MD, professor of clinical family medicine and community health at the Perelman School of Medicine, and chief of regional primary care at the Penn Medicine Medical Group in Philadelphia. “I believe the real deficit is in case identification when people don't mention anything. Most people are not being screened,” Teel said.

According to Perlis, patients may be hesitant for several reasons, including:

The net result is that most primary care providers (PCPs) don't raise questions about sleep health, and most patients don't tell PCPs, said Perlis.

“Because of this, sleep disorders are woefully underdiagnosed, and fewer still are treated. This not only means people are living with poor sleep health, but they are also at increased risk for the psychiatric and medical health disorders that arise from, or are complicated by, persistent poor sleep,” he said.

One way to resolve this situation is to encourage patients to conduct self-assessments.

“In the past, this was not easily done as most patient-friendly screeners were specific to particular disorders. These days, comprehensive self-screening is only a click or QR code away. It is available at no cost, it was created by (and is maintained by) a small group of clinician-scientists, and the initiative is supported by unrestricted funds from industry sponsors,” Perlis said.

The screener itself, accessible online at sleephealthscreen.com, only takes 3-5 minutes.

“The results are clear, and the information is the individual's to use as they see fit. If the respondent chooses to, they can send PDFs of their completed survey and a report to themselves or to their healthcare provider,” he said.

While there are benefits for patients to use tools or technology to self-screen their sleep health, it's vital that diagnosis for a sleep disorder comes from an accredited sleep specialist, said Anita V. Shelgikar, MD, sleep medicine specialist and clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

It's important that doctors ask the patient about their sleep habits, she said.

“By creating an open dialogue, PCPs open the door for patients to understand sleep as a vital aspect of their physical and mental health and that concerns can be addressed by a medical provider,” said Shelgikar.

Shelgikar provided mechanisms and directives to suggest to patients to participate in monitoring sleep patterns and challenges: 

Keep a sleep diary. Encourage patients to log bedtime, wake time, sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings, total sleep time, naps, and subjective sleep quality for 1-2 weeks prior to their appointment.

“Sleep diaries reveal patterns that distinguish between insomnia subtypes, circadian rhythm disorders, and insufficient sleep syndrome while providing objective behavioral data for calculating sleep efficiency,” she said. This longitudinal data establishes baseline metrics essential for differential diagnosis and guides cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia protocols, particularly sleep restriction therapy titration, said Shelgikar.

Check in with a bed partner. Encourage patients to have their bed partner systematically document witnessed apneas, snoring characteristics, gasping episodes, periodic limb movements, and unusual nocturnal behaviors over at least 1 week.

“History from bed partners provides critical observational data for conditions patients cannot self-report, significantly increasing diagnostic sensitivity for obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, and REM [rapid eye movement] behavior disorder,” she explained. Witnessed apneas combined with daytime sleepiness create high pretest probability for OSA, helping justify to insurers the need for polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing and guiding appropriate diagnostic pathways.

Evaluate how diet affects sleep quality and quantity. Have patients track how often and when they drink caffeine, as well as alcohol intake, evening meal composition and timing, and any foods that triggers reflux. “Correlating dietary patterns with sleep diary data helps distinguish primary sleep disorders from lifestyle-related disturbances, and persistent insomnia despite optimal sleep hygiene strengthens the case for formal diagnostic evaluation,” she said.

Evaluate how exercise affects sleep quality and quantity. Ask patients to log exercise timing, duration, intensity, and type for 1-2 weeks alongside their sleep diary, and to note the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality. “Regular moderate-intensity exercise improves sleep consolidation and increases slow-wave sleep, though vigorous exercise within 2-3 hours of bedtime can delay sleep onset due to elevated core temperature and sympathetic activation,” Shelgikar said. “Documenting the exercise-sleep relationship identifies whether inadequate physical activity or poor exercise timing contributes to sleep complaints and informs prescriptive exercise programs that may reduce need for hypnotic medications.”

Perlis and Shelgikar reported having no disclosures.

Heart failure (HF) is increasingly recognized as a systemic syndrome in which chronic low‑grade inflammation contributes to adverse remodeling, neurohormonal activation, and multiorgan dysfunction. Inflammatory biomarkers can correlate with disease severity and prognosis as well.

Systemic low‑grade inflammation in chronic HF involves activation of both innate and adaptive immune pathways. This promotes cardiomyocyte injury, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis, which in turn drive progressive ventricular dysfunction and adverse outcomes. Circulating cytokines such as IL‑6 and TNF‑alpha, as well as inflammasome activation (eg, NLRP3), contribute to this maladaptive remodeling and are associated with worse prognosis across the ejection‑fraction spectrum.

Inflammation is present in both acute and chronic HF, with acute episodes often superimposed on a background of chronic inflammatory activation. HF‑related inflammation affects other organ systems as well, contributing to congestion, cachexia, and multiorgan dysfunction. Multiple cohorts show independent associations between inflammatory biomarkers and HF incidence and outcomes, even after adjusting for comorbidities and overt infection.

Learn more about HF.

Contemporary ESC and AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guidelines have acknowledged the prognostic value of systemic inflammatory activation but do not recommend routine measurement of hsCRP or IL‑6 for HF management. Recent reviews emphasize that although hsCRP and IL‑6 are consistently associated with HF incidence and adverse outcomes, evidence is insufficient to incorporate them into guideline-directed algorithms for diagnosis or therapeutic decision‑making.

However, no major HF guideline currently endorses routine hsCRP/IL‑6 testing for risk stratification in all patients. Recommendations are not phenotype‑restricted in this way, and routine inflammatory biomarker measurement is not endorsed for either HFpEF or HFrEF. SGLT2 inhibitor use in HF is usually guideline‑directed based on HF phenotype and clinical status, not IL‑6 levels.

Learn more about HF guidelines.

Experimental and translational studies suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) can reduce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulate downstream inflammatory pathways, providing a mechanistic link between these agents and improvements in remodeling and outcomes in HF. These anti‑inflammatory effects appear additive to hemodynamic and metabolic benefits and might help explain observed reductions in HF hospitalization across ejection‑fraction phenotypes.​

Data implicate broader effects on inflammasome activity by SGLT2 inhibitors rather than a selective, isolated impact on TNF-alpha. SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated pleiotropic effects, including metabolic, renal, and inflammatory modulation that extend beyond diuresis. Elevated IL‑6 is associated with adverse outcomes; current evidence does not support IL‑6 elevation as a beneficial mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.

Learn more about HF treatment and management.

Contemporary studies highlight that HFpEF frequently arises in the context of systemic inflammatory comorbidities that promote endothelial dysfunction, microvascular inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis, leading to increased stiffness and HF symptoms despite preserved EF. This inflammatory‑metabolic phenotype has become central to modern concepts of HFpEF pathophysiology and is reflected in emerging phenogroup‑based approaches to management.​

Inflammatory activation is present across HF phenotypes, though mechanisms and comorbidity profiles differ; elevated systemic inflammatory markers such as hsCRP have been observed similarly across these subgroups, and comorbidity burden correlates with inflammation regardless of EF phenotype. HFmrEF shares features of both HFrEF and HFpEF, and inflammatory biomarkers are also elevated and prognostically relevant in this group. Inflammation contributes to adverse remodeling in both ischemic and nonischemic HF, including cardiomyopathies and valvular heart disease.

Learn more about HF clinical presentation.

Trials of cytokine‑targeted therapies, including IL‑1 and IL‑6 pathway inhibition, have shown signals of benefit on HF outcomes in selected populations with high inflammatory risk. However, results are heterogeneous, HF‑specific data remain limited, and no agent in this class is currently recommended for routine treatment of chronic HF in major US or European guidelines. Ongoing studies are attempting to better define patient subsets and biomarkers that may identify those most likely to benefit from inflammation‑targeted interventions.

Broad TNF‑alpha inhibition in HFrEF failed to improve outcomes and in some cases was associated with potential harm. While infection risk remains a consideration with immunomodulatory agents targeting IL‑1 and IL‑6 pathways, recent expert reviews emphasize that clinical trial results have been mixed, not uniformly harmful, and do not support a blanket contraindication of these therapies in all patients with HF; instead, patient selection, timing, and phenotype matter when considering inflammation‑targeted approaches. Neither ESC nor AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guidelines currently recommend IL‑6 receptor blockade for HFpEF.

Osteoarthritis often goes undetected until cartilage damage is advanced, limiting treatment options. A new study shows that molecular changes in subchondral bone occur earlier and can signal disease progression before cartilage loss. Using spatial mass spectrometry imaging and synovial fluid proteomics, researchers identified bone-derived protein signatures beneath intact cartilage that were also detectable in joint fluid. These findings point to promising, less invasive biomarkers for earlier diagnosis and improved monitoring of osteoarthritis progression.

Osteoarthritis (OA) affects more than 500 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of pain, disability, and reduced quality of life. Yet by the time OA is diagnosed clinically, often through pain symptoms and radiographic cartilage loss, the disease has already progressed significantly. This delay limits opportunities for early intervention, as cartilage damage is largely irreversible. Scientists have long suspected that changes beneath the cartilage, particularly in the underlying subchondral bone, may occur earlier in disease development, but the molecular nature of these changes has remained poorly understood.In this new study, researchers set out to determine whether molecular remodeling in bone could provide earlier and more reliable signals of OA progression. Using a combination of spatial matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) and synovial fluid proteomics, the team examined human knee joint tissues from patients with end-stage OA and compared them with non-OA controls. This approach allowed the researchers to visualize the precise location of hundreds of proteins directly within bone and cartilage, rather than averaging signals across whole tissues. Their findings were made available online on January 26, 2026, in Volume 14 of the journal Bone Research.The research was led by Professor Birgit Schilling, Managing Director of the Proteomics and Metabolomics Core at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, with contributions from Dr. Charles A. Schurman, postdoctoral research scientist, and Dr. Joanna Bons, staff scientist at the institute.By enzymatically targeting extracellular matrix proteins and mapping them at high spatial resolution, the researchers were able to clearly distinguish cartilage from bone based on their molecular fingerprints. Importantly, they observed that subchondral bone beneath damaged cartilage showed strong upregulation of specific collagen fragments and post-translational modifications associated with tissue stiffening and remodeling. Surprisingly, similar molecular signatures were also detected in areas of bone underlying cartilage that still appeared structurally intact, suggesting that disease-related bone changes begin earlier than previously recognized.""Our goal was to move beyond what we can see on X-ray or MRI scans and ask what the tissue is telling us at the molecular level,"" said Prof. Birgit Schilling. ""What stood out was that the bone carried a very clear disease signal, even in regions where cartilage loss was not yet obvious. This suggests that subchondral bone could serve as an early indicator of osteoarthritis progression.""The study also revealed that many of the bone-derived protein fragments identified by imaging were detectable in synovial fluid, the lubricating fluid of the joint. This finding is particularly significant because synovial fluid can be accessed with minimally invasive procedures. In contrast, several traditional cartilage-associated markers were reduced in OA joint fluid, highlighting bone remodeling - not cartilage breakdown - as a more promising source of early diagnostic biomarkers.""These results open the door to developing fluid-based tests that reflect what is happening deep within the joint,"" explained Dr. Schurman. ""If we can track bone-specific molecular changes over time, it may become possible to identify patients at risk earlier and monitor how they respond to therapy.""Beyond diagnostics, the findings have broader implications for understanding OA as a whole-joint disease rather than a condition driven solely by cartilage wear. The molecular signatures identified in subchondral bone point to altered cellular activity, including changes in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes, which may influence cartilage health through mechanical and biochemical signaling. By integrating spatial imaging with proteomics and future animal model studies, the researchers aim to clarify how these processes interact during disease initiation and progression.The motivation for the work stemmed from a long-standing gap between clinical symptoms and molecular understanding of OA. Current treatments largely focus on symptom management, and joint replacement remains the only definitive solution for advanced disease. By identifying early molecular events in bone, this research provides a foundation for developing targeted interventions that could slow or prevent OA progression before irreversible damage occurs.Overall, the study demonstrates that advanced spatial proteomics can reveal hidden disease biology within human joints. By shifting attention to the molecular landscape of subchondral bone, the researchers offer a new perspective on osteoarthritis - one that may ultimately lead to earlier diagnosis, better monitoring, and more effective, personalized therapies.

In a new study published in Cell, scientists in the Bork Group at EMBL Heidelberg reveal that microbes living in similar habitats are more alike than those simply inhabiting the same geographical region. By analyzing tens of thousands of metagenomes, the team found that while most microbes adapt to a specific ecosystem, a rarer subset known as 'generalists' can thrive across very different habitats.

Known for being ecologically tolerant, generalists are capable of moving from habitat to habitat, interacting with and transferring their genes to other microbes, creating what the team describe as an interconnected, planet-wide network of microbiomes.

Up until now, most large-scale microbiome studies have been on a specific ecosystem basis, due to the technical and logistical constraints that a global analysis poses. The recent development of databases like SPIRE (Searchable, Planetary-scale mIcrobiome REsource) by scientists at EMBL and their international partners has made planet-wide studies more feasible.

As a publicly available database, SPIRE integrates, processes, and annotates microbial data from diverse habitats all over the world. Using 85,604 metagenomic samples from the SPIRE database, EMBL researchers were able to pinpoint 40 distinct microbial habitat types.

Rather than presuming which environmental drivers shape the microbiome structure, we let the microbes tell us themselves. We quantified the similarity of each microbiome to all others in the dataset and identified 40 clusters of compositionally similar microbiomes, each comprising hundreds to thousands of samples from multiple independent studies. Using curated contextual metadata from our Metalog database, we then determined what the microbiomes within a cluster have in common, such as host age or ocean temperature.""

 Daniel Podlesny, Research Scientist at EMBL and co-first author on the paper

Depending on how they adapt to their environment, scientists broadly classify microbes as either specialists or generalists. As the name implies, specialists can only cope with specific environmental conditions, whereas generalists are capable of thriving in a wide range of habitats. 

As generalists move across ecosystems, they laterally transfer their genes to other microbes that they come in contact with, in a process known as horizontal gene transfer. Through this exchange of genetic information, generalists create 'bridges' between geographically distant habitats – and therefore microbiomes – that would otherwise not exist. 

""Even disparate habitats, with fundamentally different physiochemical conditions, are connected by generalist species,"" said Jonas Schiller, Predoctoral Fellow in the Bork Group and co-first author on the study. 

Certain human-driven activities, including sewage disposal and anthropogenic climate change, accelerate the dispersal of generalists by creating new and faster routes for microbes to move between. Further compounding this issue is a surge in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which leads to generalists evolving antimicrobial resistance genes.

According to the World Health Organisation, antimicrobial resistance is one of the top ten global public health threats, claiming more lives every year than malaria and HIV/AIDS combined. Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria and other microorganisms evolve resistance to drugs, leading to historically treatable infections, like pneumonia, becoming harder, or sometimes impossible, to cure. 

""Our findings show that such microbes play an important role in linking human, animal, and environmental health – also known as One Health – emphasising the need to view planetary health beyond a purely human-centred perspective,"" said Chan Yeong Kim, Postdoctoral Fellow in the Bork Group and co-first author on the study. 

Though the concept itself is fairly new, the idea behind One Health dates back to the nineteenth century when Rudolf Virchow, a German physician and physiologist, coined the term 'zoonosis,' to describe how infectious diseases can jump from animals to humans. 

Today, One Health is embraced by the Quadripartite organisations, a group consisting of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). 

By revealing that generalists can transfer their genes to other microbes as they move between environments as different as wastewater and the human gut, the team demonstrates just how much human health depends on the health of animals and the planet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Choroid plexus enlargement in Long COVID signals cognitive risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260210/Choroid-plexus-enlargement-in-Long-COVID-signals-cognitive-risk.aspx","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:02:00 GMT","

The increased size of, and lesser blood supply to, a key brain structure in patients with Long COVID tracks with known blood markers of Alzheimer's disease and greater levels of dementia, a new study finds. 

Led by NYU Langone Health researchers, the study concerns the choroid plexus (CP), a network of blood vessels lined by cells that produce cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and forms a protective barrier between the fluid and the bloodstream. The CP regulates immune system responses (inflammation) and waste clearance in the brain. Past studies show that the COVID-19 virus can damage the cells lining CP blood vessels.

Published online Feb. 10 in Alzheimer's & Dementia, the new work found that patients reporting Long COVID had a 10% larger CP than those who had fully recovered from an initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Further, CP size increases tracked with blood levels of proteins that increase as Alzheimer's disease worsens, such as pTau217, and with blood levels of others that rise in response to brain injury, like glial fibrillary acidic protein. 

The research team also found that patients with larger CPs performed an average of 2% worse on a standard 30-point screening test, the Mini-Mental State Exam, which records changes in memory and attention.

Our work suggests that long-term immune reactions caused in some cases after an initial COVID infection may come with swelling that damages a critical brain barrier in the choroid plexus. Physical, molecular, and clinical evidence suggests that a larger CP may be an early warning sign of future Alzheimer's-like cognitive decline.""

Yulin Ge, MD, senior study author, professor, Department of Radiology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine

Long COVID is a condition in which symptoms of infection with the pandemic virus last for months or even years after the initial infection. About 780 million people worldwide have been infected so far, with some of those experiencing long-term fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, loss of smell or taste, depression, and many other symptoms. 

For the study, the research team recruited 179 participants, including 86 patients with neurological symptoms of Long COVID, 67 people who had fully recovered from COVID-19 without lasting symptoms, and 26 individuals who had never had COVID-19.

Each participant received advanced MRI scans of their brains, which enabled the team to find patterns amid the brain scans, blood tests, and cognitive exams of the three patient groups. 

The tests revealed that structural changes seen in the CP blood vessels of Long COVID patients both expanded CP volume and reduced flow through its blood vessels. While the mechanisms behind this are not yet confirmed, the team's theory is that the changes reflect inflammation-driven CP ""vascular remodeling,"" in which layers of cells lining blood vessels thicken in response to long-term activation by immune cells and signals. Such inflammation comes with surrounding stromal fibrosis, the buildup of scarlike tissue that further hinders blood flow. 
Impaired blood perfusion in the CP may reduce CSF production, lead to waste buildup, and compromise the integrity of the blood-CSF barrier, the study authors say.

""Our next step is to follow these patients over time to see if the brain changes we identified can predict who will develop long-term cognitive issues,"" said senior study author Thomas Wisniewski, MD, the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman Professor in the Department of Neurology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. ""A larger, long-term study will be needed to clarify whether these CP alterations are a cause or a consequence of the neurological symptoms, which promises to better focus treatment design efforts,"" added Wisniewski, director of the Center for Cognitive Neurology at NYU Langone Health. 

Along with Ge, study authors from the Department of Radiology are first author Huize Pang, Li Jiang, Chenyang Li, and Zhe Sun. In addition to Wisniewski, authors from the Department of Neurology were Jennifer Frontera, Allal Boutajangout, Ludovic Debure, Mobeena Ghuman, Alok Vedvyas, and Arjun Masurkar.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT defender Noahkai Banks: 'No thought' of Germany switch despite contact","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/usmnt/2026/02/10/noahkai-banks-usmnt-germany-switch/88606637007/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:31:00 GMT","

Noahkai Banks has said he's received contact from the German federation, but the Augsburg center back has no thought of switching from the United States for now.

Banks has become a regular starter this season for Augsburg, despite only recently turning 19. The 6-foot-4 defender is considered one of the best American center-back prospects in many years and has earned one U.S. men's national team call-up.

The defender was born in Hawaii to an American father and German-Spanish mother. After moving to Washington, D.C., Banks relocated to Germany with his mother when he was ""4 or 5 (years old),"" he told reporters during a roundtable on Tuesday, Feb. 10. He has frequently visited the U.S. to keep up with his father and other relatives.

Banks has only represented the U.S. on the international stage, playing for the youth national team at various levels before receiving his first senior call up last fall.

""I was always very happy with the U.S. because I got invited at the U-17 level, and I had a lot of friends back there, so I was always very happy to get into camp, to get to see my friends,"" he said.

""Then I played at the U-17 World Cup which was incredible, one of the best experiences in my life. And then also at the U-19 and U-20 level, I was always just very happy to get into camp to see my friends again, because we were like a big class of friends.

""It was not like, 'I'm going to the national team to play football,' it was like, 'I'm meeting my friends and playing football with them.' So it was great.""

That connection to the U.S. has continued on to the senior level, where Banks has an outside shot to make the World Cup roster despite still being uncapped.

After he made his first appearance in a USMNT camp in September, Banks said he's been in touch with national team staff regularly — though not necessarily head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is known to not contact many players outside of international windows.

If he is to make a late charge toward a World Cup spot, Banks will likely need to earn a call-up for March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal — the team's last two games before Pochettino names his World Cup squad.

Even with a chance to appear at a World Cup on home soil, Banks insisted that he's not thinking about the tournament right now — or even the March window.

""I think it's not the right moment to think about the World Cup, because we have a lot of games left here, and we want to win those games because we have goals for the season,"" he said.

""A lot of players say it, but I really mean it: I really just focus on the games we have here. And then let's see what happens in the summer.""

Banks also said his mind is only on the USMNT for now, though he wouldn't fully rule out a future switch to Germany.

""I have been in touch with Germany before to be honest,"" he said. ""But as I said, I was always very happy with the U.S. You can't tell what happens in the future but at the moment, there's not a thought of switching or something like this, because I'm happy with U.S.""

He added: ""But yeah, I can't tell what's in the future.""","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Road to World Cup 2026: McKennie Hits Standout Mark Amid Stellar Form","https://www.si.com/soccer/road-to-world-cup-2026-mckennie-hits-standout-mark-2-9-26","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 10:12:15 GMT","

Not many other Serie A players can compare to U.S. men's national team star Weston McKennie right now.  

The Juventus midfielder has simply been that good in the last four months and continued to show it with a goal in Sunday's 2–2 draw against Lazio. McKennie has now became the Serie A midfielder with the most goals in all competitions since Oct. 30, the day Luciano Spalletti took over as manager from Igor Tudor.

To say the shift in managerial outlook has been a lifeline for the 27-year-old would be an understatement.

Suddenly, McKennie has gone from a player on an expiring contract that the Bianconeri did not seem interested in renewing to one of their most essential pieces in a dramatic turnaround. Against Lazio, his goal sparked a comeback to secure a valuable point, even though the Turin-based side were by far the better team, outshooting their opponents 34–9. 

Juventus fought back from a 2–0 deficit after Pedro and Gustav Isaksen scored on the bookends of halftime. McKennie's goal came in the 59th minute, as he headed home a cross from Andrea Cambiaso in a fervent spell of attacking pressure. 

WESTON MCKENNIE IS SCORCHING FOR JUVENTUS! pic.twitter.com/wBPHm0xQ0S

That marker turned the tide, leading to Pierre Kalulu's equalizer in second-half stoppage time. 

Outside of the goal, McKennie had five shots and completed 28 of his 33 attempted passes as he helped Juventus maintain fourth place in Serie A, holding a three-point buffer on the final Champions League spot, ahead of Roma.  

For McKennie, the focus remains on keeping form. In just over a month, he will likely return to the USMNT fold under manager Mauricio Pochettino and his newfound versatility and confidence could be key in friendlies against Belgium and Portugal, leading into the World Cup this summer. 

As much as the core of the 2026 World Cup squad has likely been determined, there remains the possibility of bringing an athlete as a training player to the camps in March or June. 

While Gianluca Busio may not be exceptionally young at 23, his potential with the USMNT is still an enigma. Last week he found the back of the net for the fifth time in 2025–26 with Venezia, as they look to make the jump back to Serie A from the second tier after last season's relegation. 

This week, he was once again omnipresent, creating three chances through the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 win over Frosinone, who sit second in the table. With that win, Venezia are on a five-game wining streak and have a four-point buffer at the top of the table, all with Busio playing a significant role. 

Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, a dual-national prospect has caught some headlines. 

Rokas Pukštas, who has played for U.S. youth teams, scored his fifth goal of the season for Croatian giants Hajduk Split, lifting them to a 2–0 win over NK Slaven Belupo and keeping them within five points of league-leading Dinamo Zagreb. 

A product of the Sporting Kansas City academy, Pukštas has not been capped by either Lithuania or the U.S., but has been getting consistent minutes in a solid league and could be a name to watch for the future. The 21-year-old is also under the guidance of former Barcelona star Ivan Rakitić, who is now the club's technical director after playing alongside Pukštas in 2024–25. 

Pochettino may have effectively closed the door on new faces to his team for this summer's World Cup, but both Busio and Pukštas could be names when the quadrennial shifts to 2030, potentially even as extra bodies this summer to kickstart that process.

Porto and Spain striker Samu Aghehowa is set to miss the 2026 World Cup after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.

Aghehowa, 21, was replaced at half time during Monday's Primeira Liga fixture against Sporting CP and assessments have revealed an ACL injury to his right knee.

Recovery time for an injury of such nature is typically anything from five months to in excess of a year. The striker is set to miss the remainder of the 2025-26 season, with Porto leading the Primeira Liga by four points and also qualifying for the knockout stages of the Europa League.

He is also expected to miss the 2026 World Cup, which begins on June 11. Spain have been drawn alongside Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay in Group H at the tournament. Aghehowa has made four appearances for Spain's senior team since his debut in November 2024.

Aghehowa has scored 20 goals in 32 appearances for Porto this season. He joined the club from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2024 following the collapse of a proposed move to Chelsea. Newcastle United also considered a move for him in the summer of 2025.

Real Sociedad's Mikel Oyarzabal was predominantly selected as Spain's starting striker throughout their 2025 Nations League campaign and World Cup qualifiers. Aghehowa started October's World Cup qualifying win over Bulgaria. Other options for Luis de la Fuente include Alvaro Morata, Borja Iglesias and Jorge de Frutos

World Cup

Iceland. Tunisia. Uzbekistan. And now, the Republic of Ireland.

With the World Cup just over four months away, we now know the opponents for the final matches before the most important tournament in Canadian men's soccer history.

On Tuesday, Canada Soccer announced a send-off in Montreal against an Ireland side that is in UEFA's qualifying playoffs in March and may or may not be staying in North America after the June 5 friendly.

The surface stats on the opponents aren't going to wow anyone. March opponents Iceland and Tunisia are currently ranked 74th and 47th in the world by FIFA, respectively. Uzbekistan is 52nd, while Ireland is 59th to round out the pre-World Cup foes for 29th-ranked Canada.

As of now, only two of those friendlies (Tunisia, Uzbekistan) are against teams that have qualified for the World Cup, though that could grow to three.

And so there may be some disappointment about Canada's scheduling, especially considering the team was in talks with top international sides and when seeing that its peer, rival and neighbor to the south, the United States will play Belgium, Portugal, Senegal and Germany before the World Cup. Coupled with the fact that Canada head coach Jesse Marsch's stated goal for Canada is to win its group, it's possible to see Canada as entering the World Cup without the maximum level of preparation.

But any such disappointment must be qualified with some important context.

It's believed Canada Soccer had multiple offers from top European sides, including Germany, to travel to Europe for a March friendly. The federation's top priority when booking the final four matches before the World Cup was playing on Canadian soil, though. The organization was resolute: playing in front of home fans was the best way to drum up interest before the biggest tournament in the program's history. The U.S. is playing its final four friendlies at home, too. (In fact, the U.S. hasn't left the country to play since Mauricio Pochettino's third game in charge, a November 2024 Nations League match in Jamaica, and the team hasn't played outside of a Concacaf nation since the 2022 World Cup.)

Canada also has to deal with more climate restrictions than the U.S., which limited the possibilities, particularly for the March window.

For instance, it would have been a lot easier to convince top European teams to travel to Canada for friendlies had there been no concerns over the oft-testy mid-March weather in Toronto. It's no surprise the U.S. is playing its March friendlies near its new national training center in Atlanta, where cold temperatures are not a concern. Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium is also enclosed and temperature controlled.

Yes, playing in Vancouver for Canada, where temperatures can be controlled, is an option. But the state of BC Place's turf and the added flight distance for European-based players could be seen as strikes against the city as a host for pre-World Cup friendlies.

Toronto, the site of Canada's World Cup opener, is the most viable option for Canada. It is Canada's unofficial home base and provides familiar surroundings for the team to prepare. But the weather limited which teams were interested in making the trip, and Canada Soccer was unwilling to move on the desire to play at home. And so the organization brokered involvement with Haiti's national team to round out the March international window. Haiti, which will play in just its second men's World Cup, will also play Tunisia and Iceland in Toronto.

That brings us to the June window.

It's believed Canada Soccer was willing to pay what could have amounted to a 10-digit appearance fee for the likes of Argentina. Cost was not an issue the way it might have been for past iterations of the organization. Canada contacted many of the world's top sides about possible friendlies.

Canada simply ran into new hurdles. This experience was a reminder for Canada Soccer that simply wanting to book an opponent is not a cut-and-dry experience.

Canada will start its World Cup on the second day of the tournament with the third match overall. The early World Cup start date cuts both ways. FIFA has mandated that Canada must report to Toronto for World Cup preparations on June 7. Because of a start date that is earlier than nearly every World Cup team, Canada also had to schedule friendlies earlier in the June window. Canada's June 5 friendly against Ireland is one day ahead of the U.S.'s June 6 friendly against Germany. It's believed that Canada ran into questions from top European sides about the early date, as playing earlier in the window would force teams to spend more time than desired outside of their own country before the World Cup. That was a genuine roadblock Canada encountered, and one that led to negotiations with top teams ending without a deal.

The Uzbekistan federation likely saw the proposed appearance fee and the chance to play in North America for the first time since 2023 as an opportunity worth taking.

And ultimately, Ireland saw the June 5 date as agreeable. If the Irish qualify for the World Cup, they will play on the first day of the tournament in the second match, against South Korea in Mexico. Thus, arriving in North America earlier than their European peers was not a concern.

Of course, Ireland might not qualify. It'll have to get through the Czech Republic and then either Denmark or North Macedonia next month to book an extended North American stay.

Nevertheless, inside Canada Soccer, there is little concern that the match against Ireland will not be competitive, even if Ireland does not end up qualifying for the World Cup.

There is always risk involved in booking international friendlies. While some in Canada will look at the U.S. slate and wonder what could have been, there is also the very real possibility that Pochettino's side falls flat against those top-tier opponents, which could sink national pride and interest at a crucial time. (Conversely, victories in such games could serve as a galvanizing force.)

Results can go any number of ways, but Canada Soccer has at the very least mitigated risk before the World Cup. Confidence among a group stung by a disappointing 2022 showing in Qatar must be high before June 12. So, too, must the opportunities to find the back of the net. A lack of goals through 2025 is seen as the biggest needs-improvement area in order to spark a decent World Cup run. Booking friendlies against teams Canada should, on paper, defeat at home is one way to raise the group's internal belief.

Also important to remember: within just over two years of the start of the World Cup, Canada's core will have played two competitive games against Argentina – then ranked first in the world by FIFA – as well as two friendlies against France and the Netherlands, two top UEFA teams and World Cup contenders.

In the final two windows before the 2022 World Cup, Canada traveled to Austria, Slovakia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The preparation did not ultimately serve as a launchpad, as John Herdman's side finished 31st of the 32 World Cup teams. We'll soon find out whether Canada Soccer's focus on playing in front of home crowds pays off with nationwide interest in the World Cup and, most importantly, improved results from four years ago.

Boston and state leaders are set to preview what the FIFA World Cup will look like for fans across the region during a press conference Tuesday afternoon in downtown Boston.

The event comes as preparations continue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with Greater Boston named one of the tournament's U.S. host regions. Officials are expected to discuss fan experience planning, logistics, and regional coordination as the city gears up to welcome hundreds of thousands of visitors.

The press conference will feature remarks from Maura Healey, Kim Driscoll, Michelle Wu, Aaron Michlewitz, Martha Sheridan, and Mike Loynd, who leads the Boston Host Committee for the FIFA World Cup 2026, commonly known as Boston 26.

Gillette Stadium is scheduled to host seven matches during the tournament in June and July 2026, including group-stage matches, a Round of 32 game, a quarterfinal, and a third-place playoff. Boston will serve as the central hub for fan events, transportation, and hospitality activities tied to the matches.

Four months stand between us and the first match of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Many, and we mean many, of us still do not yet have tickets to any matches. That's because there's a really good chance you were one of the hundreds of thousands, and maybe even millions, who have received bad news in your email inbox over the past few days. 

“Thank you for applying for FIFA World Cup 2026 ticket(s) during the Random Selection Draw,” the email from FIFA began. “Unfortunately, your application was not successful, and no tickets have been allocated for purchase. Please be assured that you will not be charged and that no payments will be processed.”

 

We're not surprised by this, of course. FIFA recently announced that more than 500 million ticket requests were submitted during the random selection draw, which ran for 33 days in December and January. On top of that, it's not a stretch to think that a lopsided amount of those requests went toward matches at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. 

Not only will North Texas host nine World Cup matches, more than any other North American host city, but global soccer powers England and Argentina are among the national teams that are scheduled to play in Jerryworld. Although all-time great Lionel Messi has yet to confirm he will take part in this year's tournament, you can bet untold scores of people opted to take their chances and request tickets to one of the two matches the defending World Cup champions will play in Arlington. 

To say that nabbing World Cup tickets has been a convoluted affair is to put it mildly. This isn't the first year that FIFA has used a lottery system for tickets, but the global soccer governing body has reported “unprecedented demand” for 2026 World Cup tickets, which means that getting tickets directly through FIFA before they hit the secondary markets was always going to be tough sledding. 

Many readers may feel we're burying the lede here, however. Headlines and complaints regarding ticket prices have arguably been the most prominent World Cup storyline thus far, aside from perhaps the draw and schedule announcements. When we took our shot in the random selection draw, tickets ranged from around $200 to over $700 for the AT&T Stadium group stage matches. 

In response to complaints about pricing from around the world, FIFA did allocate a limited number of $60 tickets to every match, although those tickets will be allocated to and distributed by national federations like CONCACAF (North America, the Caribbean) and UEFA (Europe), instead of being sold to the public at large. 

If you're one of the many who have just accepted that you'll go without spending any money on the next couple of summer vacations and Christmases, that random draw email had some rays of hope under the bad news. There will still be ways to get verified World Cup tickets directly from FIFA. 

Fans can get in on the “last-minute sales phase” for tickets by registering now. According to FIFA, this phase will begin in April and, unlike recent phases, will be first-come, first-served, although tickets available in this phase are likely to be extremely limited. 

If lotteries, phases, waiting and hoping are all too much for you, there is a way to get World Cup tickets in your hands right now. Secondary market ticket-selling websites like SeatGeek now offer many options, including tickets to the June 17 England vs. Croatia match at AT&T Stadium starting around $950. But buyer beware: although your money may be guaranteed by the seller or your credit card company, counterfeit World Cup tickets have a long, troublesome history. 

FIFA, as one might guess, has its own resale marketplace for verified tickets. Having the security of not only possessing tickets now but knowing they're the real deal will cost you, however. For that same June 17 match, the cheapest ticket available through FIFA's resale/exchange market is $1,045 before fees.

If securing tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup is on your radar, you already know the odds aren't exactly in your favor. However, a new Visa offer could quietly improve them.

Demand is massive, matches span 3 countries, and most fans expect to endure a long wait when trying to buy them during online sales. However, Visa is soon opening a limited early ticket access window, giving eligible cardholders a potentially easier path to lock down seats in U.S. host cities before general sales ramp up.

Here's how it works and how you can increase your chances of buying these coveted tickets.

Advertisement

From Thursday, February 12, through Tuesday, February 24, eligible Visa cardholders can purchase tickets before general public sales, available while supplies last. This isn't a lottery or request phase. Tickets are sold first-come, first-served, meaning timing matters. On February 12, the sale will start at noon ET.

We came across this opportunity directly through our Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card accounts, where the ticket access website is currently live in this dedicated portal. You can visit FIFA's website for more details.

Not every match or host city is included in this allotment, so availability will vary. While this Visa sale helps sidestep the standard public sales process, tickets still must be purchased with a credit card. That means you can't redeem points or miles to secure World Cup tickets, though you can book other parts of your World Cup experience with points to save money.

The opportunity comes through Visa's long-standing partnership with FIFA, which frequently includes reserved ticket allocations and payment exclusivity tied to major tournaments.

Whether you score tickets through this Visa access window or manage to grab seats another way, it pays to think about the trip logistics early. If you're planning to travel around the U.S. or traverse the 3 host countries, consider booking refundable flights and hotels in advance. Host cities are expected to see sky-high price hikes as ticket holders start locking in their match dates.

Major sporting events always come with wild ticket pricing and serious competition, but the 2026 FIFA World Cup 26 is in a league of its own — arguably the toughest tournament in the world to secure seats for. This early access window offers eligible Visa cardholders a more direct route, but it's still far from a guarantee. Inventory is limited, and once tickets are sold, third-party ticketing platforms will see prices rise.

For fans already mapping out a 2026 soccer trip, this may be one of the clearest opportunities to secure tickets before the full global rush kicks in.

Liverpool fans never fully appreciated Luis Diaz. Indeed, most of them seemed to welcome the Colombian's departure to Bayern Munich last summer, believing that his sale was necessary to accommodate £116 million ($158m) signing Florian Wirtz, with Cody Gakpo still on hand to fill the first-choice role on the left flank. 

Arne Slot also asserted that it was the right decision as Liverpool sought to build on their 2024-25 Premier League title success. Wirtz was one of seven new players through the door in a record-breaking transfer splurge, and Diaz was seen as expendable. 

""I'm going to miss his song a lot, a lot, a lot as well because it was maybe one of the best songs our fans have for a player,"" Slot said after confirmation of Diaz's exit. ""And of course all that he contributed to us winning the league. But this is also who we are as a club. We are making big signings, we have done that over the past few years. But this club also needs to recoup funds to get these transfers that we already did over the line.""

Slot massively underplayed Diaz's role; he was Liverpool's most important player in the finishing stretch after being shifted into a false nine role. Bayern snapped up a world-class operator at the peak of his powers for just £65.5m ($89m), and knew full well what a huge coup it was.

""Luis Diaz is a player with international experience, enormous quality, terrific skills and great reliability who will help our team immediately,"" Bayern's director of sport, Max Eberl, said on the club's official website. ""We're delighted we've been able to bring him to FC Bayern. Transfers like this work when every cog in the machine fits together. Our fans can look forward to watching an exceptional player.""

That is the billing Diaz truly deserved, and he's more than lived up to it in his first seven months at Allianz Arena. Meanwhile, Liverpool have regressed from champions of England to Europa League qualification contenders, and Gakpo has been the biggest weak link in the final third. Shafting Diaz has already come back to haunt the Reds, who should never have served him up as a sacrificial lamb.

It's important to note that Diaz did push for a move, but only after contract extension talks broke down. Clearly, Liverpool did not make him feel as valued as they should have, because there was no good footballing reason for him to leave.

Slot had put the Reds back on top in England, and they only exited the Champions League after a round-of-16 penalty shootout defeat to eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain. There was talk of a new dynasty at Anfield, which didn't feel far-fetched, and Diaz should have been given untouchable status.

He registered 25 goal involvements in 50 appearances across all competitions, and although that was two fewer than Gakpo managed, seven of them came in Liverpool's final 11 Premier League matches. They may not have got over the line had Diaz not emerged as such an inspirational force.

Whether he was rotating with Gakpo on the left or playing through the middle, the Colombia international consistently delivered the goods, and even outshone top scorer Mohamed Salah, who appeared to run out of steam in the final weeks of the season.

Diaz had also played a key role in an FA Cup win and back-to-back Carabao Cup successes in the Jurgen Klopp era, becoming one of the most electrifying players in English football. It was baffling that all of that seemed to be forgotten when Liverpool honed in on Wirtz as their priority summer target.

Even more unforgivable was the fact that Gakpo was instantly put ahead of Diaz in the squad pecking order after Wirtz's arrival. Don't be fooled by the statistics from Slot's debut year at the Anfield helm; the Dutchman's game does not measure up to Diaz's.

While Diaz was essential to Liverpool's pressing game and wreaked havoc with his unpredictable dribbling and incisive passing, Gakpo is a one-dimensional forward who goes missing too often. The former PSV man doesn't boast the same turn of pace as Diaz or physical strength, and is far too reliant on his right foot, which makes it easy for defenders to force him into unfavourable positions.

Gakpo was never going to outrun those flaws in the long run, despite his impressive precision finishing and technical quality. Indeed, although he opened the current campaign with four goals and three assists in his first 13 outings, Gakpo's penchant for flitting in and out of matches was clearly hampering Liverpool's fluidity.

Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand observed as much, saying on his podcast in October: ""I think Diaz leaving, I don't know if that's good business. I think he's a top player, Diaz. Being allowed to leave the club, have they replaced him with anything better? Is Gakpo better? I would say no, no chance. They're not functioning, they're not playing as well.""

Fast-forward to the present day, and those problems are persisting for Liverpool. A 2-1 home defeat to Manchester City on Sunday left Slot's men languishing in sixth in the table, a whopping 17 points behind leaders Arsenal and four adrift of the Champions League qualifying spots.

Gakpo only recorded a measly 30 touches in his 85 minutes on the pitch at Anfield, failing to muster a shot on target while giving up possession eight times. In short, he was the definition of ineffective, continuing a worrying theme, and some Liverpool officials may be regretting the decision to tie the Netherlands international down to a new five-year deal in August.

You know exactly what is going to happen whenever Gakpo gets on the ball; he will cut inside and find himself crowded out, halting any momentum Liverpool may have had. He lacks the imagination and explosiveness that made Diaz such a unique asset.

At this point, Slot would be better off giving 17-year-old Rio Ngumoha a run of games instead of persisting with Gakpo. He's shrinking in the face of adversity, and Liverpool cannot afford to carry any passengers as they bid to salvage what has so far been a disastrous campaign.

In stark contrast, Diaz is thriving in his new Munich surroundings. The former Porto ace has racked up a combined 32 goals and assists in his first 30 appearances for Bayern, with five of those coming against Hoffenheim at the weekend.

Diaz won the two penalties that Harry Kane dispatched and scored a hat-trick himself as Bayern ran out 5-1 winners against the Bundesliga's third-placed side. It was as close to a perfect display as anything we've seen in Europe's top-five leagues this term, and his third goal was particularly brilliant, with Diaz bursting away from his marker on the edge of the box before placing the ball into the far corner with unerring accuracy.

""Fantastic player, really happy to be playing with him,"" Kane said to ESPN when quizzed on Diaz after the game, having built up an instant rapport with the Colombian. ""He was a threat the whole game, he can get it into wide positions and cause defenders trouble one-v-one, he can come inside, he can go down the line, and he gets into the dangerous areas. I said that when he first arrived, he gets into the six-yard box, he gets into those tap-in areas that get you those important goals, and you saw that again today.""

Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen added to the club's media channel: ""We really are enjoying Luis Diaz, he's a real whirlwind."" That was a fitting description for Diaz, whose dynamism has taken Vincent Kompany's team to another level.

Bayern are well on course to retain the Bundesliga, sitting six points clear of Borussia Dortmund at the summit, and proved their Champions League credentials by handily beating Chelsea and PSG in the league phase, with Diaz bagging a brace against the latter. They are also through to the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal, with a clean sweep of silverware on the cards if their frontline continues to function so marvellously.

Diaz, Kane and Michael Olise have all the makings of a history-making trio that could one day rank alongside Barcelona's famed 'MSN' and Real Madrid's 'BBC'. Kane gets most of the headlines as Bayern's main source of goals, but Diaz and Olise have earned comparisons to a legendary duo that drove the club's success between 2010 and 2020.

Eberl said to Sky Sports Germany last month: ""When I see Michael's position and moves, he resembles Arjen Robben. He's kind of the new Robben we've got. Delicate, elegant. And with Lucho on the other side, we've got that Franck Ribery type, the creative chaos-maker. Our wing partnership is extraordinary.""

In his own words, Diaz had a ""special connection"" with Salah at Liverpool, and it appears he has replicated it with Olise. Their inverted wing play has been a joy to watch, Olise providing the control to complement Diaz's knack for causing mayhem, and their end product is already rivalling that of the so-called 'Robbery' pairing.

The similarities between Ribery and Diaz are particularly startling, though. Ribery was also a maverick who could open up games in the blink of an eye, and his fighting qualities off the ball set an example for the rest of the team. He blended breath-taking skill with ferocious determination, and Diaz is cut from the same cloth. At his peak, Ribery was unstoppable and extremely unfortunate not to win the Ballon d'Or; perhaps Diaz can go on to accomplish what the Frenchman could not.

How Slot must wish he still had Diaz to call upon now. He's a match-winner who relishes closing people down just as much as bursting through on goal, and Gakpo never should have been put on a higher pedestal. 

Liverpool are paying a steep price for their horrible mistake. Another prime example of how their attack has faltered came in their 2-1 defeat at Chelsea earlier in the season, which left Gary Neville ""really disappointed"" in his Sky Sports commentary seat. ""The midfield players and the forwards were absolutely useless,"" said the former England and United defender. ""They were giving the ball away like you wouldn't believe. Gakpo, Salah, the wastage.""

Ex-Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge then pinpointed the main issue in the Sky Sports studio: ""Luis Diaz is a massive miss for me. When you look at Liverpool last year and how they used to press, I think arguably he was the one who would set the press in the front three. For me, Luis Diaz, how tenacious he is on the ball and how hungry he is to get it back for his team - he brought something to Liverpool that they are now missing.

""He would sacrifice himself defensively. That's what they've got to figure out now - who in that attack is going to give themselves up a little bit. In a front three there always has to be one guy who goes, ‘I'm not stats hungry.' I'm not sure the manager knows what he's going to do.""

Slot still hasn't found a way to make up for the loss of Diaz, who embodied the unshakable team spirit within the dressing room in his final year at Anfield. Liverpool will have to set their sights on a proper replacement for him to get that back in 2026-27, because Gakpo simply isn't up to the task.

Lionel Messi had to “score all the time” at Barcelona or he “wasn't happy”, a former team-mate of the Argentine GOAT has revealed. World Cup winner Samuel Umtiti worked with the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner at Camp Nou and got to witness up close the relentless drive that carries the very best in the business to the top of the global game.

Umtiti moved to Camp Nou in 2016 and remained in Catalunya through to the end of Messi's spell on Barca's books in 2021. He saw the all-time great find the target on at least 30 occasions across five successive seasons - with the 50-goal barrier being broken in a couple of campaigns.

Messi helped Barcelona to La Liga and Copa del Rey triumphs during that era, with the most decorated player in history always striving for perfection. He is a humble character, which helps team-mates to feel comfortable in his presence, and sets individual standards that others aspire to emulate.

Former France international Umtiti has told The Elevate House of Messi's mindset: “As a person, he is top. You realise that even if you have won everything, it is useless to believe you are superior.

“There is only one, it's Leo. At all levels. He alone is capable of winning a game, and very few can do that. If we won 4-0 and he didn't score, he wasn't happy. In his head, it was clear: he had to score all the time. That's the sign of the big ones.”

Umtiti, who won the World Cup in 2018 while on Barcelona's books, added on what makes magical Messi special: “[He] is a killer in front of the goal. He knew exactly when to accelerate and when to slow down the game. He is always looking left and right, checking everyone's positioning. He always has a time advantage. There is no recipe to defend Leo, he is unpredictable.”

While working with fearsome forwards at Camp Nou, including Luis Suarez and Neymar, Umtiti also got to play alongside legendary defenders. 

He said of another Barca great, Gerard Pique: “[He is] one of the best defenders I have played with. He was not the hardest working, because athletically he was ready, but he had an incredible reading of the game. If we were winning three or 4-0 and he always wanted to go up to score his goal!”

Barcelona have remained at the top of domestic, continental and global games as focus is forever locked on sporting achievement, with the club doing their best to ensure that any distractions are avoided.

On that approach, Umtiti said: “In Barca, the player only deals with football. Everything else is managed, and that allows you to concentrate. There was no going to the hotel the day before. You arrived at the stadium two hours early. They make you responsible, they treat you like a professional.”

The Blaugrana are also famed for producing home-grown superstars. The fabled La Masia academy system has seen the likes of Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Lamine Yamal roll off the production line.

All of those who are drafted into the first-team, be that through the youth system or acquired in the transfer market, are made aware of the need to remain grounded. Umtiti believes that humility helps to deliver positive results.

He said of how life at Barca differs to that at clubs in other countries: “In France, when you sign your first contracts, some already believe a lot. Not at Barca. People were simple, they came to training in the clothes of their sponsors. That keeps you on your feet on the ground.”

Barcelona have already savoured Spanish Super Cup success this season. They are also into the Copa del Rey semi-finals, the last 16 of the Champions League and hold a one-point lead at the top of the Liga table. Messi, who is now on the books of MLS Cup winners Inter Miami, is among those watching on from afar as the Blaugrana seek to build on the foundations that he once put in place.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Paul Scholes has admitted that he would ""love"" Manchester United to sign ""pissed off"" Tottenham star Cristian Romero. The Red Devils legend believes Romero has ""checked out"" at Spurs amid their dismal run of results under Thomas Frank, and wants his old club to capitalise on the uncertainty surrounding the Argentine World Cup winner's future.

Romero has made 152 appearances for Tottenham since joining the club from Atalanta in 2021, scoring six goals and helping the club to a Europa League title. The 27-year-old recently signed a contract extension through to the end of the 2028-29 season, too, but strongly hinted he has become unhappy with how the club is being run after Spurs' 2-2 draw with Manchester City on February 1, in which he had to come off at half-time.

In an explosive post on Instagram, Romero wrote: ""Great effort from all my team-mates yesterday, they were incredible. I wanted to be available to help them even though I wasn't feeling well, especially since we only had 11 players available – unbelievable but true and disgraceful. We'll keep showing up and taking responsibility to turn this around, working hard and staying together. All that's left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us, the fans.""

Despite his outburst, Frank kept Romero in his starting XI for Spurs' trip to Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon. The Argentina international only lasted 29 minutes, though, as he was sent off for a reckless challenge on United midfielder Casemiro.

That was the fourth red card of his Tottenham career, more than any other player in the Premier League since his arrival in English football, and Spurs went on to lose 2-0. Frank did, however, leap to his defence after the game.

""For me, I think he is a leader. He is a young leader and he's learning every day,"" the Spurs boss told reporters. ""I've said I used the example when I was 30 years old. I thought I was on top of the world, but I was no way near the level I am today in terms of leadership and understanding things.  

""And then when you have a player that's playing with so much passion and aggression, things like that can happen. That's not to say he shouldn't learn from it, of course he needs learn from it, going forward.""

Scholes is also a big fan of Romero, and feels he would be an ideal addition to the ranks at United, despite his disciplinary record. The former Red Devils and England star said on the latest episode of The Good, The Bad and The Footballpodcast: ""Do you know what? I love him. I love watching him play football.

""He's pissed off at Spurs, isn't he? He doesn't want to be there. He's having a go at the crowd, he's having a go at the board, I think his head has checked out a little bit.

""But I would love him at Manchester United. I just love his character.""

Romero will sit out Spurs' next four Premier League matches through suspension due to ""serious foul play"". Frank's side host Newcastle next on Tuesday night, before a huge north London derby clash with Arsenal and fixtures against Fulham and Crystal Palace.

Tottenham are also awaiting the draw for the Champions League round of 16 in March, which Romero will be clear to play in. It remains to be seen, though, whether Spurs can climb out of the Premier League's bottom half without their captain, or indeed if he decides to stick around beyond the end of the season.

Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid have also been linked with Romero, who may seek a new challenge after playing in another World Cup with Argentina this summer.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Have to be friendly with voters'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/barcelona-raphinha-fumes-unfair-ballon-d-or-fifa-best-snubs/blt31756035f6ce32da","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:02:11 GMT","

Barcelona superstar Raphinha has taken aim at the “unfair” Ballon d'Or and FIFA Best snubs that he endured in 2025. The Brazil international starred for the Blaugrana last year as they landed the Liga title. He posted more than 60 goal involvements over the course of the campaign, but still missed out on the most prestigious of individual honours at glittering award ceremonies.

Raphinha found the target on 34 occasions last season, as a huge personal best was posted in that department, and became a talismanic presence for Catalan giants. He was billed as a potential Golden Ball winner at one stage, but ultimately missed out on that prize to Champions League-winning Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembele.

Voting there saw Raphinha slip to fifth - behind Dembele, Lamine Yamal, Vitinha and Mohamed Salah - with a top-three finish also proving elusive in The Best poll.

His exploits have been recognised in Spain with the Toresky Award for the Best Athlete of the Year, and Raphinha has told Cadena SER: “The truth is that recognition for your work is very special; in the end, well, knowing that you've given your best and receiving an award for it is very rewarding. For me, the most important thing is team awards, which is why I came to the club, but if I told you that individual awards weren't important, I'd be lying.”

He added when asked if his exploits in 2025-26 had been unfairly overlooked by many: “I don't owe anything to anyone. I know the season I had, and I know it was very unfair; in the end, it's something we can't control. I have no control over anything off the field. Ultimately, you have to be friendly with the people who vote. I'm someone who will deliver results on the field, and whatever happens, I'm satisfied with the season I've had.”

Raphinha joined Barca from Leeds United in 2022. He has faced questions of his future at times, with transfer talk being generated at Camp Nou, but the 29-year-old is delighted to have proved his worth in the most demanding of surroundings.

He said of representing the Blaugrana: “Honestly, I think that, beyond the team, living in this city was a dream. We really love the beach and being in a city with wonderful weather. Everyone has welcomed us so warmly from day one. We already liked it before, and it's become even more special because of the affection of the people.”

Barcelona are in the hunt for more major silverware this season, having already landed the Spanish Super Cup. They remain in Champions League and Copa del Rey competition, while holding a one-point lead over Clasico rivals Real Madrid at the top of the Liga table.

On having old adversaries breathing down their neck, Raphinha said as he looks to become a three-time title winner in Spain: “Honestly, I don't pay attention to any of the other teams. I think we have to do our job, and if we do it well, we don't care about the others.”

Raphinha has suffered fitness setbacks this season, but still has 13 goals to his name. He is competing with the likes of Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford for minutes, while teenage wonderkid Yamal stars on the opposite flank.

Yamal is expected to land a Ballon d'Or at some stage, given the potential in his game, and Raphinha said when asked if he has teased an 18-year-old colleague about winning the Toresky Award: “Nah, nah. In the end, Lamine also deserves the awards he's won and the ones he hasn't, which I also think many have been very unfair to him. He's a kid, who has many football dreams ahead of him, and I'm sure he'll win all the individual awards he has ahead of him.”

Barcelona will take in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final clash with Atletico Madrid on Thursday. They will remain out on the road for a meeting with Girona on Monday, as Hansi Flick's side attempt to cement their standing at the Liga summit.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies has elaborated on why they chose Isack Hadjar to partner Max Verstappen for the 2026 season.

Laurent Mekies is adamant that Isack Hadjar's potential is ""mega"", with the Red Bull Team Principal heaping praise on the youngster's “maximum intensity” approach to his pre-season training.

It was announced ahead of last season's finale that Hadjar would partner four-time World Champion Max Verstappen at the senior Red Bull team for 2026, replacing Yuki Tsunoda who has stepped back into a reserve driver role. At sister team Racing Bulls – where Hadjar originally caught the eye – lone rookie Arvid Lindblad will join forces with Liam Lawson.

The second seat at the team has presented a unique challenge since Verstappen became their lead driver, with both Lawson and Tsunoda struggling to match his performances in 2025 in their time alongside him as team mate.

Prior to last year, the likes of Sergio Perez, Alex Albon and Pierre Gasly also failed to live up to the Dutchman's performance levels in the second Red Bull car.

However, the Milton Keynes-based squad are hopeful that Hadjar will be able to deliver, especially with the major change in regulations for 2026 that will see an overhaul in the power units and aerodynamics of the car.

Asked how the team will protect Hadjar from the scrutiny of performing alongside Verstappen at the recent Autosport Business Exchange, Mekies said: ""We are not hiding behind the fact that we need to do a better job with that second car, and that includes the second part of last year.

""Yes, we made some progress with Yuki, but not at the level that we felt we should have reached, so we are aware that we need to do a better job there. There is no easy solution. It's a complex equation that we approach as such. Now, I think Isack comes with incredible raw speed.

“We think the level at which he started last year, his starting speed was outstanding – at the level of the very best. But then we equally believe that the big guys, the champions – not only do they have an incredible starting point, but they progress.

“It's not only progressing with maturity or with your dialogues with the engineers, they actually go faster. We have seen that with Isack last year at Racing Bulls, so we are convinced that the potential is mega.”

After a rough start saw him crash on the formation lap at the Australian Grand Prix, the Frenchman quickly found his rhythm, achieving a podium at Zandvoort and becoming a regular in Q3.

That momentum could prove to be crucial this season as all 22 drivers must adapt to the new cars as fast as possible – something which Mekies is confident Hadjar's pre-season routines will help with.

""I guess in some respects, the fact that everything's changed in 2026, he's also been given a reset about how you go about extracting as much as you can from the car,” the Team Principal said.

""He has been taking it from day one with maximum intensity. He has moved to London. He's on the sim as we speak and is there quite a few days each week.

“He's fully aware of the challenge. He has his feet on the ground. He's a very humble guy, and we are going to support him 360 [degrees] to make sure that he can express his talent in that car.""

Cast your vote for the livery that has caught your eye the most.

McLaren and Aston Martin have become the final teams to unveil their shiny new liveries for the upcoming 2026 season, rounding out the grid of 22 striking challengers.

From the customary scarlet and papaya shades of Ferrari and McLaren, to the heritage glossy blue Red Bull, and the dual black and white Cadillac, the pops of colour throughout the field set the scene for another captivating season.

The liveries aren't the only designs that have changed for 2026, as the regulations have undergone a major shake up. Cars will be narrower and more nimble, with amended power units and unfamiliar features like the Boost Button and Overtake Mode.

But after the run of dazzling launches, it's the look of the cars that we're interested in for this poll. Before pre-season testing at the Bahrain International Circuit kicks off later this week, you can cast your vote on which livery catches your eye the most.

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll have shared their excitement around the launch of Aston Martin's new F1 car, the AMR26.

Fernando Alonso has described getting hold of an Adrian Newey-designed F1 car for the first time in his career as a “very proud moment”, with the Honda-powered Aston Martin AMR26 being officially presented to the world.

Alonso, team mate Lance Stroll and Newey headed to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia on Monday for a special livery launch presentation live from Ithra (the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture), marking the start of Aston Martin's 2026 campaign.

After an initial run-out at the Barcelona Shakedown, where he smiled that the legendary F1 designer “is always teaching us something”, two-time World Champion Alonso took a moment to reflect on what it means to team up with Newey.

“A very proud moment, for sure,” said Alonso, with Newey's cars winning 14 Drivers' and 12 Teams' titles over the years. “I've been racing against Adrian for the whole of my career, and now, finally, I can drive one of his cars.

“I think [it's] a huge challenge this year with the new set of regulations, and being a works team, having [power unit partner] Honda in our side, and [fuel partner] Aramco, with the challenge that the sustainable fuels have been for the 2026 regulations.

“So yeah, I'm very proud to be part of this family and this organisation, and I'm looking forward to succeeding together.”

With that aforementioned Honda partnership, and a new state-of-the-art headquarters at Silverstone, the Spaniard added: “I feel this is a very important moment for the team. It's the very first time we are a works team, and we have all the new pieces coming together.

“I think it's going to be [a] very interesting [year], because it's a season that… I mean, it always matters where you start in Australia, but I feel the second part of the season is going to be even more important than the first half, if you understand your weakness in the car, if you identify early enough that you can work on those [issues].

“I think that's why the Bahrain test and the first couple of races will dictate a little bit the path for the rest of the season, so we are very, very focused on development of the car. I think, as a driver, it gives you the feeling that you will play an important part through the season.”

Sitting alongside Alonso at the event, Stroll shared similar enthusiasm over what lies ahead – the Canadian having been part of the Aston Martin project since the manufacturer returned to F1 as a factory team in 2021.

Asked what excites him most, Stroll said: “All of it. I mean, just everything coming together. The new set of regulations, the collaboration with Honda, and yeah, driving an Adrian Newey-designed car is pretty exciting, for sure!

“When I think back to the team we were in 2021, and when you see everything that's happened in Silverstone today, the transformation is incredible.

“The ambition we have as a team, we want to win… We want to fight for race wins and championships in the future. I think it's just very exciting and motivating for everyone to be a part of that.”

Alonso and Stroll will be back behind the wheel of the AMR26 in Bahrain later this week, when the first of two official pre-season tests gets under way at the Sakhir venue.

The company also hit 290 million paid subscribers in its fourth quarter.

Business Writer


Spotify reached 290 million paid subscribers in its fourth quarter, up 10 percent year over year. 


	Overall, monthly active users hit 751 million, an increase of 38 million, marking the highest number of net adds in Spotify's history. Both users' numbers were above Spotify's guidance. The company attributed the growth in monthly active users to a successful Wrapped campaign, as well as enhancements to the free tier on mobile.




	Total revenue reached  €4.5 billion, in line with Spotify's guidance, while operating income reached  €701 million, above expectations. Shares were up 10 percent in pre-market trading Tuesday.

	Ad-supported revenue declined 4 percent year over year. Music advertising saw growth in impressions sold, but this was offset by softness in pricing. Podcasting growth grew sponsorships, but this was “partially offset by optimization of our podcasting inventory.” 




			Related Video		







	The company now reports more than 530,000 video podcasts, as it continues its big push toward video. Spotify also features more than 500,000 audiobooks in English language markets.


	Spotify expects 759 million total monthly active users in the first quarter, up eight million from the fourth quarter, and 293 million paid subscribers, up 3 million. These numbers include some expected churn from the price increases that began in February 2026, with individual plans rising $1 per month and family plans rising $2 monthly. Executives say these price increases will “outpace” net content cost in 2026.

	











	Total revenue is expected to remain around €4.5 billion, while operating income will fall to €660 million due to €10 million in social charges.


	As of Jan. 1, Spotify founder Daniel Ek has stepped down as CEO to become Executive Chairman. Gustav Söderström, former chief product & technology officer and Alex Norström, former chief business officer, are now co-CEOs. 


	Their remarks Tuesday largely focused on the company's big push into AI, with Söderström pointing to the existing use of interactive DJ on the platform, which takes voice requests from users. He suggested more interactive experiences are to come.


	“All of this teases the next evolution of Spotify, delivering the world's most intelligent agentic media platform, one that you can literally talk to, that fully understands each individual listener and puts them in the driver's seat. It's about moving from a passive experience to an interactive one,” Söderström said.


	When it comes to the use of AI in music creation, Spotify executives said they couldn't dictate how music is created, but have begun to label when songs are made using AI on the platform. Additionally, executives have been pushing to allow artists to use AI to create covers or remixes using their existing catalog.


	“In music, artists haven't had a real way to monetize existing catalog through AI, because the absence of a rights framework has kept AI mostly focused on the first category, net new creation. We want to work with the industry to fix that,” Söderström said. 

	











	In response to a question about the amount of AI-generated work on the platform and how Spotify view that, Söderström said the company had been investing in tools to curb “spammy tracks.” 


	“There have always been people trying to abuse Spotify, because it's a big economy, using spammy tracks. AI is a tool that could help accelerate that, but because it's been a problem for a long time, we've been investing more than anyone else in the industry to curb this problem,” he said. 


	As he reflected on his tenure, Ek also pointed to a future for Spotify beyond just an audio platform. 


	“Our capabilities now extend far beyond music today. What we built is a technology platform for audio and increasingly for all the ways creators connect with audiences and this identity will matter even more going forward, the next wave of technology shifts, AI, new interfaces, wearables, new ways of interacting with content these will reshape how people discover and experience audio and media,” Ek said. 


“We closed out what we dubbed as the Year of Accelerated Execution with another solid quarter, delivering a strong finish to 2025,” Norström said in the press release. “In Q4, we met or exceeded guidance across all key metrics. We marked our highest quarter ever for MAU net additions. It's incredible to think that we now serve over three quarters of a billion people around the world.…We're framing 2026 as the Year of Raising Ambition. We were founded to solve what felt like the impossible, and ambition has been the driving force behind our success from our earliest days. And ambition will be a guiding principle of our next chapter.”

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Ariela Barer (The Last of Us, See You When I See You) has joined the cast of A24‘s Deep Cuts, in a recasting of Odessa A'zion.


Deep Cuts, from writer and director Sean Durkin (Iron Claw, The Nest) and based on the debut novel by Holly Brickley, is a love story set in the 2000s about two music-obsessed twentysomethings (to be played by Cailee Spaeny and Drew Starkey) navigating the messy realities of ambition, belonging, and adulthood over the course of an era-defining decade.


	Barer will play the role of Zoe Gutierrez, who is described in the novel as being half Mexican and half Jewish. The actress is both Mexican American and Jewish.

	A'zion, who is Jewish, was originally cast as Zoe and was unaware that the character was written as a Jewish Latina, she revealed via social media on January 29. After reading a barrage of messages she was sent on Instagram explaining she was miscast, A'zion agreed to graciously bow out. Additionally, more than 100 Latino artists in Hollywood also signed an open letter asking for more authenticity in casting.


	Previously, there was also a recasting of the original leads, Saoirse Ronan and Austin Butler, due to scheduling conflicts, with Spaeny and Starkey taking over the roles. Production is gearing up to begin imminently.


	Durkin will serve as the film's writer and director. Eli Bush, Ronald Bronstein and Josh Safdie will produce through their Central Pictures banner. Durkin will also produce along with Anthony Katagas, Jordan Tappis and A24. Brickley will serve as an executive producer. Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, and producer Blake Mills will create original music. 

	











	We understand that Barer's work on HBO's The Last of Us, the hit video game adaptation series she joined in Season 2 as Mel, will not be affected by her participation in Deep Cuts. 


	Additionally, Barer is coming off a whirlwind of promotions for her latest film, See You When I See You, a dramedy written by Adam Cayton-Holland and directed/produced by Jay Duplass. The feature had Sundance abuzz with great reviews following its premiere on January 27. She also recently wrote, produced and starred in Neon's How to Blow Up a Pipeline.


	Her TV credits include series regular roles in the ABC series Rebel, playing Ziggie, and as Gertrude Yorkes in Marvel's Runaways. She has also appeared in Netflix's One Day at a Time and Atypical, Fox's New Girl, Peacock's Saved By The Bell, ABC's Grey's Anatomy, and Nickelodeon's Yo Gabba Gabba! Barer is repped by OPE Partners, Paradigm, and Felker Toczek Suddleson.


On Monday, Deadline revealed exclusively that A'zion had been cast in Cody Fern's as-yet-untitled directorial debut alongside Naomi Watts, Dianne Wiest, and Sarah Paulson.

Congrats to Ariela. She's a wonderful actress and deserving. That said, this demand for authenticity in casting seems to apply to just about all minorities except large Jewish roles. Take a look: Helen Mirren as Golda Meir, Rachel Brosnahan and Tony Shalhoub in Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Al Pacino as Shylock, Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, even Brendan Frasier in School Ties. All wonderful and talented actors but clearly not Jewish and playing Jewish leads. If we're going to be authentic for Latinos, Asians and other minorities then the same criterion needs to apply to ethnically Jewish actors as well. Otherwise, it's a double standard.

The Latino community called this out. Who is stopping the Jewish community from speaking out against it? Certainly not Ariela. Shitting in her announcement about other issues with casting is ridiculous. This is a wonderful opportunity for her and Odessa deserves so much credit for stepping back. This is a happy ending. Hope you're inspired to speak up next time there is inaccurate casting in your community. I totally support you on that front.

Caught her film at Sundance, this will be an incredible opportunity for Ariela. She has the chops. Looking forward to seeing this one.

Wow, that was easy! lol. She was literally right in front of you. Congrats Ariela!

Honestly it's shocking to me that there hasn't been a single killer hippo movie before. That scene in “Congo” was incredible. Can't wait for this. Hope it's actually good – like “crawl” – and sells well.

Clearly they're building to the sequel Hungry Hungry and of course the trilogy capper Hungry Hungry Hippo.

EXCLUSIVE: Nate Parker and David Oyelowo‘s long-delayed thriller Newborn is finally getting a domestic release with an exclusive partner.


	The movie, which is written, directed and produced by Parker and produced by and stars Oyelowo, is being lined up for an April 10th theatrical bow exclusively with AMC Theatres. Oyelowo and Parker are teaming with the chain on the launch via their joint production and distribution label Mansa Studios. 


	The dystopian psychological-thriller follows “Chris Newborn (Oyelowo) who after serving seven years in solitary confinement seeks to rebuild his life and reconnect with his family only to find that freedom has become a terrifying psychological battleground”.

	Below is a first look image at Newborn:




			Watch on Deadline		







	Originally known as Solitary, the film that is now Newborn went into production in 2020 but became an unreleased mystery.  However, as we revealed over Christmas, a distribution deal became real in recent months. The film also had to contend with the COVID period, and an increasingly challenged space for indie film distribution.


	Then AMC got on board with a vote of distribution confidence 


	“Newborn is the kind of bold, provocative, and original storytelling that comes alive on the big screen,” commented Nikkole Denson-Randolph, Chief Content Officer, AMC Theatres today to Deadline. “We're proud to be the exclusive exhibitor supporting a release model that prioritizes theatrical.”

	











	Oyelowo said today: “When it came to our distribution goals, AMC truly understood the empowering direct-to-consumer nature of the partnership we were seeking for our film while embracing the non-algorithmic yet immersive experience we wanted the audience to have.” Director Parker added: “It was essential to us that audiences experience this emotionally charged, edge-of-your-seat thriller together—on the biggest possible stage, and AMC provides both scale and a dedicated audience.”


	According to the duo, their Mansa has raised $12M in seed funding led by MaC Venture Capital, with participation from WndrCo, Galaxy Investment Partners, Base Ventures, Rainmaker Films, Black Capital VC, K Period Media, and Robert F. Smith.


	Olivia Washington (Breaking), Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan) and Jimmie Fails (The Last Black Man in San Francisco) also star in the film. Producers are Aaron L. Gilbert and Christina Lee Storm, alongside Parker, and Oyelowo through his Yoruba Saxon banner.


	The latest effort from Sundance acclaimed helmer and CAA-repped Parker follows his Venice title American Skin and TV drama Baselines releases As his career ascended in 2016, Birth Of A Nation director Parker faced old accusations of a sexual assault from 1999. Charges that he denied and was acquitted of decades before.


	Golden Globe, Emmy and BAFTA nominee Oyelowo, who is also represented by CAA, is known for movies including Ava DuVernay's Selma and Lee Daniels' The Butler. He also was the lead in the Taylor Sheridan and Paramount+ western limited series Lawmen: Bass Reeves.

This direct to theater bypassing distributors thing is becoming increasingly normal and highly successful. From documentaries to “iron lung” and now “newborn” and “wildwood.” I think this could be how the theater industry survives. Ironically. Bypassing the middleman.

Looks super interesting. Can't wait to see this.

Good for them for charting their own path with AMC. I am sure more filmmakers will be doing this. Film looks interesting.

Flying on planes with boys.

Drew Barrymore admitted to being a “mile-high club” member during a playful interview with Kaley Cuoco on her eponymous talk show Monday.

The topic came up when the “Flight Attendant” alum was asked during an on-air ping-pong match whether she'd ever hooked up with someone during a plane ride.

Advertisement

“No, I have not,” Cuoco, 40, insisted. “100 percent no.”

Advertisement

Barrymore, however, nodded at the question while smiling — which led the “Big Bang Theory” alum to label her a “wild child.”

The “Drew Barrymore Show” host, 50, revealed the past hookup took place on an American Airlines flight, claiming it wasn't a “difficult maneuver” and “worked well.”

Cuoco quipped, “Good seating? It kinda morphs to your … I could see that.”

Barrymore then clarified that “he was in the bathroom” before covering her face with her paddle and asking, “Did I say that out loud?”

The Golden Globe winner did not go into further detail on the experience.

She did, notably, open up to Christina Aguilera in a March 2024 interview about why she “can't recommend it more.”

At the time, Barrymore gushed, “It's not the same. If you're curious, like, ‘Why are people doing it?' I'm telling you, elevation, it feels different. … Sorry, FAA! I was like, ‘Whoa!'”

Aguilera, for her part, copped to getting intimate in the skies “multiple” times.

“You have to,” the singer, 45, told viewers. “We spend a lot of time on planes. We've got to figure it out.”

The Grammy winner said the same on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in 2023 while pulling back the curtain on her love life.

While Barrymore has yet to appear on the raunchy podcast, she often gets real about intimacy on her show — even defending her “boring” sex life in 2022 because she's “done everything.”

The “Santa Clarita Diet” alum confessed later that same year to spending “years” celibate without issue.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Nancy Guthrie's purported kidnappers haven't contacted Savannah's family since ransom deadline: FBI","https://pagesix.com/2026/02/10/celebrity-news/nancy-guthrie-kidnappers-havent-contacted-savannahs-family-since-ransom-deadline-fbi/","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:11:00 GMT","

Nancy Guthrie's purported kidnappers have not contacted daughter Savannah and the rest of her family since the $6 million ransom deadline passed, according to the FBI.

A ransom note sent to TMZ and two local Arizona TV stations, KOLD and KGUN, demanded that $6 million be dumped into a bitcoin account by Monday at 5 p.m. MT (7 p.m. ET), with no proof that Nancy, 84, is alive.

Savannah, 54, and her loved ones seemingly did not pay the ransom before the latest deadline.

“[The FBI] is not aware of any continued communication between the Guthrie family and suspected kidnappers, nor have we identified a suspect or person of interest in this case at this time,” an FBI spokesperson said in a statement to The Post after the deadline on Monday.

“We are currently operating a 24-hour command post that includes crisis management experts, analytic support, and investigative teams. But we still need the public's help,” the statement added.

“Someone has that one piece of information that can help us bring Nancy home,” the spokesperson concluded.

TMZ founder Harvey Levin told CNN on Monday that Guthrie's alleged captors made threats in the ransom note.

“I'll read you one line from the ransom note we received,” Levin, 75, shared. “And they say, ‘It is in the best interest of everyone to have this completed as soon as possible.'

Nancy was last seen Jan. 31 when she was dropped off at her Tucson, Ariz., home following a family dinner with daughter Annie and son-in-law Tommaso Cioni.

She was reported missing the following day when she did not show up for church.

A trail of blood was seen outside of her Arizona residence. 

After the police began their search for Nancy, her purported kidnappers sent out a ransom note with an initial deadline of Thursday, Feb. 5 at 5 p.m. MT.

Two days later, Savannah and her siblings, brother Camron and sister Annie, made a video where they offered to pay the ransom.

“We received your message and we understand,” Savannah said in the Instagram upload. “We beg you now to return our mother to us, so that we can celebrate with her.”

“This is the only way we will have peace,” the “Today” anchor continued. “This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”

Ahead of the latest ransom deadline on Monday, Savannah appeared solo in another Instagram video and desperately asked the public to help them find Nancy. 

“We believe our mom is still out there. We need your help. Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home — trying to find her,” she said. 

“She was taken, and we don't know where, and we need your help,” the mother of two added.

Savannah has not been on “Today” since her mother went missing.

The multiverse can be a black hole. While the concept of infinite parallel realities has been a staple of speculative fiction for a long time, in recent years, pop culture has frequently leaned on this idea for fan service. What if one version of your favorite character met a different one? What if a fateful death could be averted? What if familiar events could be remixed, with old stories repackaged in the guise of something new? It's a setup that seems limitlessly vast, but often ends up curbing any traces of originality while flattening everything on screen with the suggestion that this is just one version in a limitless assortment of similar, slightly different permutations. It very much fits a corporate vision of “storytelling” where well-established intellectual property can be slightly altered without fundamentally changing or challenging anything.

Through its opening chapters, Romeo Is A Dead Man, the latest from SUDA51 and Grasshopper Manufacture, is quite self-aware about how much of a drag the multiverse can be. As a result, instead of being diminished by its space-time warping premise, it fully leans into absurdity, contradicting its own logic and throwing out any sense of continuity as it escalates to hilarious extremes; at its best, it understands that the ideal answer to this kind of cosmic convolutedness is to make us laugh.

This tongue-in-cheek vibe is very present in the game's mile-a-minute introduction. Romeo Stargazer is a conspiracy theorist and sheriff's deputy in the small Pennsylvanian town of Deadford. His life is normal until one day, while on patrol, he is suddenly mauled by a pale monster that rips his arm and half his face off, leaving him for dead. Luckily, his grandfather (who has more than a slight resemblance to Doc Brown) suddenly appears on a time-traveling motorcycle and injects him with some strange substance that saves his life; after a trippy bit of hand-drawn animation, he's transformed. He isn't just Romeo anymore; he's Deadman, a henshin hero-looking crime fighter.

While that all makes some amount of sense, this intro quickly begins to fold in on itself. The previously mentioned events were all a dream, but also not? A “Previously On” comic book recap tells us that Romeo is in love with Juliet (subtlety is for cowards, as SUDA51 has long believed), a mysterious woman who is also a harbinger of doom; after her appearance, reality was destroyed, leaving shards of specific times and places scattered throughout the cosmos. Also, Romeo's grandpa, Professor Benjamin, died off-screen and is now a talking decal on the back of Romeo's jacket. Our protagonist joins the FBI Space-Time Police to find his (sort of) girlfriend, hunting down her variants and other time criminals while trying to reunite with the “real” Juliet he knew before Deadford was scattered across four-dimensional space.

It's a lot, man. The first 15 minutes play out at such an unhinged pace that it feels like a deliberate parody of confusing interdimensional storytelling. To get across this reality-hopping vibe, the game switches mediums and modes with abandon: The introduction goes from live-action diorama footage, to an in-game cutscene, to a 2D animated sequence, to a series of comic book illustrations. The Game Over screen is an all-timer stop-motion nightmare that may or may not be a reference to a face-melting moment from Raiders of the Lost Ark. When you return to base, the Space-Time Police's mothership, the aesthetic switches to pixel art that's completely different from the main game's 3D visuals. Among other things, this base is home to an unusual leveling mechanic where you navigate a little creature through a maze to grab permanent upgrades; what if skill trees were replaced with retro arcade simulacrums?

Everything's here, and it's all swirling in an orchestrated chaos punctuated by optional dialogue with your crew, at least one of whom has absolutely no narrative impact outside of talking about Manchester United players (sorry, Liverpool fans). The nonsense logic isn't just a one-off gag but is fundamental to a weirdly cohesive presentation that embraces pulp curiosities and fine art alike—there are references to Edward Hopper and Shakespeare, alongside professional wrestling finishers and The Clash.

﻿

While the act of playing the game isn't quite as strange, it's defined by a baseline competence that is elevated by a general sense of eccentric style—those who've played GrassHopper and SUDA51's other games, especially No More Heroes, will feel quite at home here. In his search for Juliet and other space-time criminals, Romeo travels to fragments of reality from across the decades: at one point, he's in the '70s, investigating a sunny cult, while at another, he's in a shuttered asylum that leads to a horror game sequence. Getting through these areas will also involve crossing into “subspace,” an abstracted world of digital cubes that conveys the game's generally disorienting vibe. Adding to this otherworldiness is an anonymous man on a floating TV set who waxes poetic about North American cryptids and other half-discernible topics, talking to you dozens of times as you cross the border between the real world and this digital one. Admittedly, some of this oddness is eventually blunted repetition—you'll be going through subspace a lot—but the process of working through these areas largely holds up until the closing hours.

Along the way, Romeo has to battle “Rotters” (which are basically zombies but with a much more convoluted backstory). These fights start very simple: You can do a light or heavy attack with your melee weapon, aim and shoot your guns, or do an invincible dodge move to get around incoming attacks. There's also Bloody Summer, a damaging, psychedelic strike that builds up after slicing and dicing enemies at close range.

The process of battling these not-zombies isn't quite as complicated or fluid as a spectacle fighter like Bayonetta, and not as heavy and deliberate as FromSoftware's strain of action game, but somewhere in-between, instead relying on the theatricality of gore explosions and liberally applied slo-mo to give your strikes a sense of fatal weight. You'll also be relying on your guns a lot compared to other games in this style, and instead of using a pair of pistols to keep a combo going like in Devil May Cry, you'll be targeting glowing weak points for massive damage (most likely using the rocket launcher, which is the clear standout). In practice, this is more of a shooter/action game hybrid than you might expect, a twist that largely works out until this small stable of Rotters becomes a bit too familiar. The bosses fare much better, though, and on top of their gross-out looks, they make for tightly designed showdowns that offer room for very different strategies; in a smart move, there's an optional boss challenge mode that lets you relive these battles and earn some in-game currency if you can clear them in a set time.

Fitting with the game's general vibe, there's also at least one idiosyncratic inclusion when it comes to these fights: the Bastards. These guys are creepy humanoid creatures that you can cultivate and bring into battle, beginning as piddly pea shooters before eventually becoming harbingers of destruction. Yes, this is basically a Pokémon minigame. The presentation here is appropriately strange; you literally pull these dudes out of the soil, and if you dismiss them after running out of space, they'll send you sad letters in the mail. You can also fuse them together to power up existing Bastards and create new variants, which is a bit disturbing considering they're apparently capable of written speech.

Reminiscent of something like Yakuza 8's Sujimons, it's dangerously easy to fall face-first into this minigame, obsessively returning to your ship mid-mission so you can tend your garden of nasty, rotting monsters. There's a reward for having this kind of green thumb, because you can eventually craft a lineup of Bastards that positively trivialize even the hardest boss challenges; these guys are fun, bizarre, and at least partially make up for the increasing tedium of the latter levels.

But while the Bastards fully bloom, the same can't be said for what is initially the game's biggest hook, its weirdo narrative. After evocatively channeling sensory overload, the final stretch attempts to tie together its fragmented cosmos into an overly tidy picture, a move that diminishes what came before. Frankly, it will probably feel even worse for many longstanding Grasshopper fans who've been trained to expect some kind of eleventh-hour rug pull. Here, it never comes. Romeo Is A Dead Man lives and dies by its eccentricity, delivering multiversal strangeness and zombie Pokémon before losing steam as it approaches a conclusion it doesn't know what to do with. Given its galaxy of possibilities, it's rather disappointing that its climax is so terrestrial.



Romeo Is A Dead Man was developed and published by Grasshopper Manufacture. Our review is based on the PlayStation 5 version. It is also available for PC and the Xbox Series X/S.

Ever since Sean Baker‘s historic night at the Academy Awards in 2025 — when he won Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Picture for “Anora” — cinephiles have been waiting to see what he would direct next. Now we have our answer, as Baker now takes a new short film to Berlin.

Written and directed by Baker and produced by the London fashion house Self-Portrait, “Sandiwara” stars Michelle Yeoh in a slice of life in the Malaysian city of Penang. Notably, Penang is also the original home of Self-Portrait founder Han Chong.

 










An official synopsis described the project as “a bold, immersive celebration of womanhood, cultural identity, culinary heritage and the spirit of independent cinema.” Press materials also noted that “named after the Malay word meaning “drama, theatrical performance or play,” the title captures the essence and spirit of the film which is an exploration of Malaysian culture through the lens of food, music and womanhood.”

While Baker has yet to announce his first post-“Anora” feature film, he has stayed quite busy in the year since his Oscars sweep. In addition to working on “Sandiwara,” he co-wrote and edited Taiwan's official Oscar submission “Left-Handed Girl,” which was directed by his longtime collaborator Shih-Ching Tsou. 

Baker has also made it clear that when he is ready to make another feature, it will be on a scale similar to his previous works. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in 2025, the director explained that he is not interested in giving up his independence to make a larger movie. 

“It's not going to happen,” he said when asked about the prospect of making a franchise blockbuster. “I'm intentionally going to stay in the same wheelhouse and with the approximate same budget. I think that I enjoy working in this space of 100 percent independent.” 

Yeoh, who recently concluded a two-film arc playing Madame Morrible in “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good,” will next be seen in Amazon's “Blade Runner 2099” limited series.

[Editor's note: This interview contains spoilers for “Zootopia 2.”]

When people think of impressively animated film sequences, what immediately comes to mind are large-scale moments: big, explosive action scenes or crowd shots with hundreds of characters. The latest Disney animated feature, “Zootopia 2” has a lot of both, as Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) and Judy Hopps' (Ginnifer Goodwin) big sequel adventure sees them encounter plenty of villains and explore brand new areas of the titular mammal metropolis never seen before, including one setpiece with around 50,000 unique animals.

 










But for directors Jared Bush and Bryan Howard, one of the most challenging technical moments in the entire film isn't the flashiest or loudest — it's the pivotal scene in the film where Nick and Judy, having struggled to communicate as a crime-fighting duo, finally have a heart-to-heart where they can truly admit how important they are to one another.

“Sometimes it's the smallest things that are the hardest,” Bush said in an interview with IndieWire. “We have this scene where Nick and Judy finally come back together towards the end of the movie. That subtle acting is really hard; it takes people at the very top of their craft to be able to put that tiny bit of subtext, just moving a corner of an eye a pixel. Those choices are so detail-oriented. Almost more than anything, those things are incredibly hard.”

Bush and Howard joined IndieWire in-studio for an interview to discuss “Zootopia 2,” recently nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar. The two discussed making the sequel to the original 2016 hit, figuring out where to take the characters and world in the new movie, and bringing the scene between Nick and Judy to life.

 










Howard agreed with Bush that the climactic conversation between the two served as one of the biggest challenges for production, saying they spent weeks getting the character animation down perfectly. Talking about the process of directing the sequence, Howard discussed how the scene, more or less, was there from the beginning in the script, but went through many different iterations as new plot points were developed and dropped from the movie.

Addressing whether or not the scene should be read as romantic, Howard said they wanted to keep it open to interpretation, but said the scene landed in friendship — or more specifically, “soulmate” — territory.

“Over the years, we've fallen on one side of the fence or the other in terms of what their relationship is or where it's going,” Howard said. “That speech between them is so private, and intimate, and personal, to have that kind of conversation with another human being in your life? Super rare. That almost never happens. Seeing these two characters together, there's something wonderful about the fact that it isn't romantic, and our instinct has been to preserve that specialness. That sparkle and that chemistry, in other films, is so easily ruined by going too far or going where you think it's going to be.”   

“Zootopia 2” is now playing in theaters. Watch the complete video interview with Bush and Howard above.

				“The current state of rock & roll music is hardcore,” says Justice Tripp of Angel Du$t.			








							By 

	Brenna Ehrlich




E
verything about Justice Tripp is authentic — aside from his golden front teeth. Still, he came by those honestly. “I've had my nose broken seven times and my front teeth both knocked out seven times,” says the Baltimore musician, who has been slowly fixing his body after a lifetime of moshing (and a stint of powerlifting). “I would say so much of my musical identity is in spite of fakeness [or] phoning it in.”


Angel Du$t, the hardcore band that he fronts, are dropping their sixth studio album, Cold 2 the Touch, on Feb. 13 — a tight, loud, rampage of a record that harks back to the band's harder days without abandoning any of the eccentricities that make Angel Du$t sound distinctly them. “The epitome of art is authenticity,” Tripp says. “And that's the goal for this record: not adhere to expectations. It wasn't intentional to make it sound like all these eras of our life, but that's what you get.”


	Angel Du$t was born out of the same primordial stew as their Grammy-winning friends Turnstile. Tripp was the singer in another hardcore band, Trapped Under Ice, where Turnstile singer Brandon Yates played drums; he formed his current project in 2013, initially with Turnstile drummer Daniel Fang. Since then, Tripp has been the only constant in the lineup, which now features guitarists Steve Marino and Jim Caroll, bassist Zechariah Ghostribe, and drummer Nick Lewis. Since jump, though, Tripp hasn't been afraid to push the boundaries of what hardcore could sound like.

	“Angel Du$t, to me, is the first modern band that truly implemented melody into hardcore, and it was at a moment where it was definitely not in vogue to do so,” says Ian Shelton of Militarie Gun, another friend and frequent collaborator. “They're the band that is actually taking the criticism to push the genre of punk music, of hardcore, whatever you want to call it, into different, scarier places creatively — because it's from a place of authenticity, of experimentation, of exploring what seems interesting to Justice.”

	What's interesting to Justice this time around, then, is rock & roll, or at least the energy that it represents. “The current state of rock & roll music is hardcore,” he says. “You go to the hardcore show and you're getting the most stripped-down, raw, organic version of rock & roll music. And for me, I'd like to keep that as pure as possible.”


	That's immediately apparent in album opener “Pain Is a Must,” a teeth-kicker featuring vocals by Terror's Scott Vogel. “It's about suffering for what you love to do. That's what my life has been,” says Tripp, who gave up a steady job doing HVAC and plumbing because he'd be miserable if faced with a life of fixing leaks at 4 a.m. “I've given myself to music, and it ended up working out, and I'm very grateful. But there was never an expectation of it working out. The only expectation was, ‘I'm going to give myself entirely this; I'm going to suffer.'”


	The album, produced by fellow musician Brian McTernan, features a suite of guest stars in addition to Vogel: Wes Eisold of American Nightmare and Cold Cave, Restraining Order's Patrick Cozens, recent Sex Pistols vocalist Frank Carter, and Taylor Young of Twitching Tongues and Deadbody.


	“Music's at this really cool point where collaboration is such a thing,” says Tripp. “Everybody on the record is someone I hugely admire. There's no, ‘We're gonna get this person because they have the most followers on the internet.' I've seen that angle working in music. But the value is exclusively great artists who have already given this band so much. So it makes sense to have them.”

	Tripp is allergic to that mindset — inorganically integrating artists or sounds into his world for the clicks. “I have been involved with records where people say, ‘Hey, look, this is what we're doing. We're imitating this thing.' But I guess I'm way past the point of my life of wanting to rehash or relive something that somebody else did,” he says. “I've had bands come to me and say, ‘Hey, we really like Angel Du$t and that's what we're trying to do.' It's like, ‘Don't do that.'”


	Sure, Tripp has his own influences, but he's less about aping than inspiration. “Prince is probably the most influential thing on everything I do musically,” he says. “Nobody's ever gonna listen to what I do and say, ‘Oh, man, this guy loves Prince.' I don't want to imitate Prince. I want to take something from his energy and make it my own thing.” It makes sense, then, that he was voted “Most Likely to Trip Across Stage” in high school. Much like the Purple One, it could be argued, Tripp is all about “being performative in life.”

	











	The title track, the pit-worthy “Cold 2 the Touch,” continues in that vein. “It's about the lifelessness I see in the music industry,” Tripp says. “I literally hate bad art. It makes me sick. And I'm not a music snob. You can make terrible music if it's genuine.” For example, he loves to bait music snobs by asking if they like Sublime. “You'll get people that are immediately like, ‘No, I hate that.' And it's because it doesn't match their identity,” he says. “Immediately, when you have that response, I know who you are. You're a person who created a character, and you have to go express that to everybody and make sure everybody knows your character doesn't align with Sublime.” (Note: He does like Sublime.)


	Patrick Kindlon of Drug Church and Self Defense Family is similarly averse to posturing, and he  admires this band's dedication to their own vibe. “Everybody in music who already doesn't like you is waiting for you to make a record that validates their opinion of you to everybody else,” he says. “And Angel Du$t doesn't do that, because even if you don't like one record as much as the previous one, it never feels like an embarrassing effort. They don't bite off more than they can chew. They just chew different food for an album. And I think that that's pretty remarkable.”

	That's evident on the woozy “Jesus Head,” a blast of early-aughts-tinged space rock that sees Tripp accepting himself, even the broken bits. “I pretty much failed at everything in my life,” he says. “I'm just riddled with injuries. I'm terrible at socializing with people. On paper, I'm a failure at everything except music, and music is my saving grace. I know I do things that aren't healthy, and I have habits where I'm not always the most pleasant person. But it's what I got. So, I'm embracing that again.”


	And never is that more clear than in the new single “I'm the Outside,” which isn't about being an outsider so much as being the outside — the refuge for the weird kids. “I'm on the outside of the mentality of letting society get to me and beat me up,” Tripp says. “But I can put energy out there, and I can create space for people to feel welcome.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Donald Trump all set to lay bare bombshell UFO 'truths' in major speech","https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-set-reveal-ufo-36694699","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 09:01:00 GMT","

Fresh claims suggest President Donald Trump may be preparing a bombshell speech that would reveal decades of alleged UFO evidence to the public.

The revelations come from Mark Christopher Lee, a British writer, director, producer and self-proclaimed ufologist, who claims he received the information from ""an advisor to the Trump administration"" stating that Trump has been granted permission by fellow world leaders to make a formal UFO announcement.

""An advisor to the Trump administration told me the president has been given authority by the other major world leaders to make this announcement,"" Lee revealed in an interview with the Daily Mail.

According to Lee, the address would expose the reality behind decades of evidence concerning unexplained aerial phenomena, materials from purported crash sites, and military witness accounts that he maintains cannot be matched to any existing human technology.

In 2024, a report disclosed 21 unexplained UFO encounters

""He will confirm that forensic analysis of recovered off-world vehicles and non-human biologics has established their extraterrestrial origin,"" Lee claimed, describing the potential address as ""the first official acknowledgment of this reality by any world leader."", reports the Mirror US.

The speech was initially scheduled for the United Nations General Assembly in September, Lee revealed, but has reportedly been rescheduled to mark the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident on July 8.

""New intelligence developments have made it a matter of urgency,"" Lee stated. ""I do feel that President Trump likes to act spontaneously and may not want to wait until July 8. He might also suspect that Russia or China could jump the gun.""

Lee suggests the planned address would formally acknowledge several notorious UFO encounters that have already been confirmed by the U.S. military and examined in congressional hearings.

These would include the November 2004 USS Nimitz incident, the 2015 USS Theodore Roosevelt GoFast and Gimbal encounters, and the 1947 Roswell affair.

The 2004 Nimitz incident has gained particular attention following testimony under oath from ex-Navy fighter pilot David Fravor, who told Congress in 2023 that he was diverted during a training mission off San Diego's coast to investigate an unidentified object picked up on radar by U.S. Navy vessels.

He described witnessing a white, 40-foot-long craft lacking any visible wings or propulsion mechanism, resembling ""like a Tic Tac.""

He detailed how the object's movements matched his own, before accelerating away at incredible velocity and materialising moments later approximately 60 miles distant at a classified meeting point.

Likewise, in 2015, separate encounters featuring unidentified craft were documented by aviators and radar technicians aboard the USS Roosevelt.

Dubbed GoFast and Gimbal, these incidents were filmed using infrared targeting equipment and only made public by the Pentagon years afterwards.

Lee attributed the intel to a source he characterised as ""a successful business person acting as an advisor to Trump administration officials"", who was purportedly also engaged in scrutinising historical UFO data in preparation for the proposed revelation.

""He will underscore that he is the first president to authorise full disclosure because the American people deserve transparency,"" Lee said, noting the address would also reference geopolitical stability and cross-party congressional endeavours as factors enabling disclosure.

If I were a gambling man, I'd bet on me winning the lottery before being abducted by Aliens from outer space. But according to a new survey, the odds of the opposite happening are much greater, especially here in Washington state.

I believe. The way I figure, there are too many wonders on this earth to not have other planets sharing their own amounts of amazing things and creatures. Have they visited Earth? That is the big question, and since I asked it, I'll answer it for myself… I do.

So you know where I stand, I also believe in Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and ghosts. The Earth is not flat, birds are real (although I've seen many neat drones that look like birds), and Epstein didn't kill himself.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Under questioning from Democrats Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that he had met with Jeffrey Epstein twice after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a child, reversing Lutnick's previous claim that he had cut ties with the late financier after 2005.

Lutnick again downplayed his relationship with the disgraced financier who was once his neighbor in New York City as he was questioned by Democrats during a subcommittee hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He described their contact as a handful of emails and a pair of meetings that were years apart.

“I did not have any relationship with him. I barely had anything to do with him,” Lutnick told lawmakers.

But Lutnick is facing growing scrutiny, including calls for his resignation, from lawmakers after the release of case files on Epstein contradicted Lutnick's claims on a podcast last year that he had decided to “never be in the room” with Epstein again after a 2005 tour of Epstein's home that disturbed Lutnick and his wife.

The commerce secretary told senators Tuesday that he and his family actually had lunch with Epstein on his private island in 2012 and he had another hour-long engagement at Epstein's home in 2011. Lutnick, a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, is the highest-profile U.S. official to face bipartisan calls for his resignation amid revelations of his ties to Epstein. His acknowledgement comes as lawmakers are grasping for what accountability looks like amid the revelations contained in what's known as the Epstein files.




In countries like the United Kingdom, the Epstein files have triggered resignations and the stripping of royal privileges, but so far, U.S. officials have not met the same level of retribution.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the Democrat who questioned Lutnick, told him, “There's not an indication that you yourself engaged in any wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein. It's the fact that you believe that you misled the country and the Congress based on your earlier statements.”

Van Hollen, D-Md., stopped short of calling for Lutnick's resignation on Monday, but requested documentation from Lutnick on any of his ties to Epstein.

“It's absolutely essential that he provide Congress with those documents, given the misrepresentations he's made, and then we'll go from there,” he said.

Lutnick during the Senate hearing said he would give that request some thought, adding, “I have nothing to hide.”

However, several Senate Republicans were also questioning Lutnick's relationship with Epstein. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said the visit to Epstein's private island “would raise questions.” And Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters, “It's something I'm concerned with.”

Tillis stayed away from calling for Lutnick to leave his post, but added that “he would do himself a service by just laying exactly what and what did not happen over the course of what seems to be an interesting relationship that included business entanglements.”

Meanwhile, House members who initiated the legislative effort to force the release of the files are calling for Lutnick to resign. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky called for that over the weekend after emails were released that alluded to the meetings between Lutnick and Epstein.

Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, joined Massie in pressuring Lutnick out of office on Monday.

“Based on the evidence, he should be out of the Cabinet,” Khanna said.

He added, “It's not about any particular person. In this country, we have to make a decision. Are we going to allow the rich and powerful people who are friends and (had) no problem doing business and showing up with a pedophile who is raping underage girls, are we just going to allow them to skate?”

Progressive candidate Analilia Mejia leads in the NJ Democratic primary, advocating to abolish ICE and other far-left policies. Kayleigh McEnany discusses the rise of socialist candidates in the Democratic Party.

A progressive candidate backed by champions of the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pulled off a major upset victory over the more mainstream frontrunner in a Democratic congressional primary for a blue-leaning seat in New Jersey.

Analilia Mejia, a progressive organizer, edged out former Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski in the battle for their party's nomination in New Jersey's 11th Congressional District.

On Tuesday, Malinowski announced on X that he had conceded the race.

Mejia and Malinowski were the leaders among a field of 11 Democratic candidates in last Thursday's primary to fill the seat left vacant when now-Gov. Mikie Sherrill stepped down after winning November's gubernatorial election in the Garden State. 

The results in the primary showdown were closely watched by the political world as an early testing ground in the debate between progressives versus the more mainstream elements of the Democratic Party.

The victory by Mejia, who worked as national political director on Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, is the latest boost for the left against the establishment since now-New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, sent shock waves across the nation with his Democratic primary victory in June 2025.

""She stands for a progressive populist economic agenda,"" progressive leader Rep. Ro Khanna of California, emphasized last week in a social media post. ""She is the future!"" 

Mejia, speaking to supporters on primary night, highlighted that ""we have to rebuild our party, we have to rebuild what is happening in our nation. We have to reclaim our democracy. We know that our economy is rigged to suit the billionaires.""

‘ABOLISH ICE'—WHERE SANDERS AND AOC-BACKED MEJIA STANDS ON THE ISSUES 

Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state in former President Barack Obama's administration who later represented a neighboring congressional district in northern New Jersey from 2018 to 2022 before losing re-election, was considered the favorite in the race heading into primary day.

But Malinowski was the target of a slew of attack ads put out by a group affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which opposed Malinowski because he said he supports conditions on aid to Israel.

The AIPAC-aligned super PAC United Democracy Project dished out more than $2.3 million to take aim at Malinowski, even though AIPAC had supported him in his past congressional elections.

But the strategy backfired, because Mejia is much tougher on Israel than Malinowski.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) jumped the gun on primary night, congratulating Malinowski in an email release.

""Tonight, Democrat Tom Malinowski clinched victory in the New Jersey District 11 special election Democratic primary,"" the DNC's release read.

Later in the evening, after taking a slight lead in the vote count over Malinowski, Meija put out a social media post showing the famous photo of President Harry Truman, during his 1948 election victory, holding up a newspaper with the erroneous banner headline: ""Dewey Defeats Truman.""

Mejia was boosted by the support on the left. Sanders headlined a virtual rally for her on the eve of the primary.

And besides Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, Mejia also was endorsed by a large list of other progressive leaders, including Khanna, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Pramilla Jayapal of Washington state, the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

TOP 5 GAME-CHANGERS FROM THE 2025 CAMPAIGN TRAIL

The Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), a leading group on the left, said in a statement, ""Analilia Mejia's momentous showing proves that voters, when given a choice, want Democrats with an inspiring vision who will boldly challenge powerful interests on behalf of working families.""

PCCC co-founder Adam Green, a New Jersey native who knocked doors for Mejia and spoke at a rally with her and Sanders on primary eve, added that voters ""made clear they want Democrats who will shake up a broken political and economic system – not just be anti-Trump.""

While Mejia was the clear choice of the left flank of the party's base, the rest of the field appeared to divide the more moderate and center-left vote.

Mejia will face off with Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway, the only Republican to file for the special election, which will be held on April 16.

Hathaway will be considered the underdog in the race, in the suburban northern New Jersey district.

Sherrill won re-election for the seat in 2024 by 15 points, the same margin by which she carried the district in November's gubernatorial showdown.

But then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by just eight points in the 2024 presidential election, giving the GOP some hopes of possibly flipping the seat.

""Radical Democrat Analilia Mejia wants to defund the police, raise your taxes, and turn New Jersey into a socialist hellscape. Republican Joe Hathaway is committed to making New Jersey safer and more affordable for working families,"" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Spokeswoman Maureen O'Toole argued in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The primary in New Jersey was held as Republicans cling to a razor-thin 218-214 majority in the House of Representatives.

But the GOP may land a reinforcement in the House before the open seat in New Jersey is filled.

JOHNSON WARNS HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO ‘STAY HEALTHY' AS GOP MAJORITY SHRINKS TO THE EDGE

That's because a special election is scheduled on March 10 in Georgia's solidly red 14th Congressional District, in the race to succeed former GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The MAGA firebrand and one-time top Trump House ally in early January stepped away from Congress a year before her term ended.

A whopping 22 candidates, including 17 Republicans, are running in the Georgia showdown.

According to Georgia state law, all the candidates will run on the same ballot. If no contender tops 50% of the vote, a runoff election between the top two finishers will take place on April 7.

WHO TRUJMP IS BACKING IN RACE TO REPLACE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE

Trump last week endorsed Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit District Attorney Clay Fuller, a Republican, in the race.

Greene won re-election in 2024 to the seat by nearly 30 points, and Trump carried the district, which is located in northwest Georgia, by 37 points.

The Smithsonian Institution, the world's largest museum, education, and research complex with 21 museums, libraries, and even a zoo, is betraying its principal stakeholder: the public.

The people elected President Donald Trump to be the chief executive of the country. His administration has repeatedly asked Secretary Lonnie Bunch III, the Smithsonian's leader, to furnish a number of materials in order to execute an audit to ensure the Smithsonian is not pushing a woke agenda, thereby degrading America's national identity, and to guarantee that the Smithsonian will play its part in this year's celebration of the semiquincentennial of America's founding.

So far, Bunch has given Trump bupkis, if not the middle finger.

The responses are always evasive: You're asking for too much, we cannot meet the deadline, the Smithsonian will conduct its own audit — all of which essentially say, “we're in charge and not the executive branch.” Thus far, very little has been handed over to the administration.

There are many aspects to this question. One, of course, is who runs the Smithsonian. That question can be easily dispatched.

The public forks over $1 billion to the Smithsonian every year, comprising almost two-thirds of its revenues. The institution labels nine of its 21 museums as “national,” and it continues to say that it is devoted to “shaping the future by preserving heritage.”

Not without reason do several members of Congress sit on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, Bunch's governing authority, which is presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice and the vice president.

It is fatuous, then, to believe that this institution should escape public scrutiny. New York's Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art are private museums that can do whatever they want. Not so the Smithsonian. The board runs the Smithsonian, and it is susceptible to political pressure, which is to say, what the people want.

Which takes us to the real heart of the problem here: whether art should be responsive to politics. Defenders of Bunch on the Left say no, Trump and other politicians should keep their grubby and philistine fingers off museums.

“Culture wars: Trump's takeover of arts is straight from the dictator playbook,” ran a headline in the Guardian, a British publication, a year ago. The Authors Guild also fretted. “The Trump administration is undoing 250 years of freedom of expression in the arts and humanities, freedom from government using the arts for propaganda,” it said.

That is also fatuous on multiple levels. Art has always been political, as leftists intent on regime change, from philosopher Antonio Gramsci to former President Barack Obama, have always understood.

Just tour the great museums of Europe, and you will see magnificent renderings of monarchs by court painters who were masters — whether Titian for the Spanish Habsburgs, van Dyke for the Stuarts in England, or Charles Le Brun for French King Louis XIV.

The revolutionaries who toppled kings and sought to change everything also had their court painters. Robespierre, Napoleon, and later revolutionaries had their David and Delacroix, whose renderings can be seen at the Louvre. Che Guevara had his Korda, the result of which can be seen on dirty T-shirts worn by Brooklyn Bolsheviks.

The Left's pretensions of artistic purity are thereby entirely hypocritical. That argument conveniently conceals the fact that it is the Left that politicized art, as it politicizes all aspects of the culture.

The Smithsonian Institution was just one important battlement to seize in the Long March Through the Institutions, the strategy by cultural Marxists to seize the heights of the culture since the end of the 1960s.

This capture by the Left of the museums, the schools, the universities, the centers for the performing arts, the publishing houses, the media, the libraries, and even the sports leagues — Bad Bunny's vulgar Super Bowl halftime show being but one example — was rapid, but very, very recent.

That museums needed to be “decolonized” — that is, turned anti-American and anti-West — is an idea that seems to go back to, oh, 2012, when Amy Lonetree, a scholar from the Winnebago Tribe of the Upper Midwest, published Decolonizing Museums: Representing Native America in National and Tribal Museums. These ideas gained traction among a certain set of museum workers.

One of them is Bunch himself, the founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened its doors in 2016, and the head of the entire Smithsonian since May 2019.

As head of both institutions, Bunch has embraced movements that seek to topple America's status quo no less than Robespierre and Napoleon upturned all of Europe, notably the 1619 Project and Black Lives Matter.

Again, this leftist assault on public culture and heritage was as rapid as it was sweeping, but it's important to remember that it began very recently. It really accelerated after BLM's riots in 2020. Conservatives, and Trump, believe that this terrain is thus primed for reconquest. This is not like reversing the New Deal. Moreover, much depends on regaining this territory that was just lost. Indeed, the continuity of the American experiment hangs on retaking this ground.

We're coming up on a year since the administration posted its first action ordering the Smithsonian to stop tarnishing U.S. history and the people's experience, an executive order called Restoring Truth and Sanity to History, signed by Trump on March 27, 2025. And still the Smithsonian and Bunch refuse to budge.

The executive order was clear: “Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology. This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”

The executive order required Vice President JD Vance; the assistant to the president for domestic policy, Vince Haley; and the then-special assistant to the president and senior associate staff secretary, Lindsey Halligan, to undertake to “remove improper ideology from such properties, and shall recommend to the President any additional actions necessary to fully effectuate such policies.”

Bunch's response to the executive order came in a letter to staff days later, reaffirming his belief that the Smithsonian is independent and it has control over content, programming, and the educational material that play such a prominent role in K-12 schools.

The institution, Bunch added, was accountable to the public, but not through the executive branch.

“We will continue to employ our internal review processes, which keep us accountable to the public,” Bunch wrote. “When we err, we adjust, pivot, and learn as needed. As always, our work will be shaped by the best scholarship, free of partisanship, to help the American public better understand our nation's history, challenges, and triumphs.”

The Smithsonian, he added, would “remain committed to telling the multifaceted stories of this country's extraordinary heritage.” Translation: The approach would continue to be diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The next round in the protracted skirmish came in an Aug. 12, 2025, letter to Bunch by Haley; Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget; and Halligan, which upped the ante. 

The administration, the letter reads, would be helping to implement the executive order by conducting a “comprehensive internal review of selected Smithsonian museums and exhibitions” to “ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”

The authors asked the Smithsonian to send the White House plans on how it planned to help celebrate the 250th anniversary of America's birth; digital files and wall didactics for all current exhibitions; an index of traveling and upcoming exhibitions; curatorial and staff manuals used in internal governance; an index of permanent collections; educational materials, including teacher guides; description of official museum websites; a list of external partners; copies of grant applications; and responses to surveys and evaluations of visitors experience.

Only the following eight museums would be included in this initial audit: the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.

“As we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation's founding, it is more important than ever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story,” the letter reads.

The museums were given 75 days to furnish the material, and within 120 days, “museums should begin implementing content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.”

And, once again, the response of the Smithsonian was nearly crickets.

NASA DELAYS ARTEMIS II

This takes us to December 2025, less than two months ago, when Haley and Vought reminded Bunch in a letter that while he had sent over some material, “that submission fell far short of what was requested, and the overwhelming majority of requested items remain outstanding.” Yet another deadline came and went a month ago on Friday, and Bunch, again, has yielded very little.

This is a standoff you may not hear much about, but much depends on its outcome.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Alphabet's debt sale keeps getting bigger.

The company is close to finalizing a global bond issuance in excess of $30 billion, according to two people familiar with the deal, an increase from the $20 billion it raised on Monday.

On Tuesday morning, Alphabet went to the European market to raise roughly $11 billion in sterling and Swiss francs, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details are private. Bloomberg reported earlier that Alphabet raised almost $32 billion.  

Investors are showing heightened demand for high-quality paper from tech heavyweights that are leading the charge in artificial intelligence, one source said. 

In its earnings report last week, Alphabet said it expects to shell out up to $185 billion in capital expenditures this year, more than double its 2025 capex. The group of hyperscalers, which also includes Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, are projected to collectively spend close to $700 billion in 2026. With tech companies pouring money into high-priced chips, large facilities and networking technology, analysts expect free cash flow to plummet this year.

Oracle was the first large tech company to test the debt market in 2026, with its $25 billion dollar offering last week. Meta is preparing a large debt offering in first part of this year, as it looks to accelerate its data center push across the U.S., the sources said. 

Alphabet held a $25 billion bond sale in November. Its long-term debt quadrupled in 2025 to $46.5 billion. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on last week's earnings call that as the company considers its total investment, ""we want to make sure we do it in a fiscally responsible way, and that we invest appropriately, but we do it in a way that maintains a very healthy financial position for the organization.""

Alphabet didn't respond to a request for comment.

Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio warns that CBDCs will eliminate financial privacy and enable governments to tax, seize funds and cut off political opponents.

 Cointelegraph in your social feed 

American billionaire and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has warned that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are coming, offering benefits but also potentially allowing governments to exert more control over people's finances.

“I think it will be done,” said Dalio on CBDCs in a wide-ranging interview on the Tucker Carlson Show on Monday, which also included topics on the US debt crisis, gold prices, and even a potential civil war. 

Raymond Dalio is a billionaire hedge fund manager who has been co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates since 1985, after founding the firm in 1975. 

During the interview, Dalio said CBDCs could be appealing due to the ease of transactions, likening them to money market funds in terms of functionality, but he also cautioned about their downsides.

He said there will be a debate, but CBDCs “probably won't” offer interest, so they will not be “an effective vehicle to hold because you'll have the depreciation [of the dollar].”

Dalio also cautioned that all CBDC transactions will be known to the government, which is good for controlling illegal activity, but also provides a great deal of control in other areas. 

A programmable digital currency will enable the government to tax directly, “they can take your money,” and establish foreign exchange controls, he said. 

That will be an “increasing issue,” particularly for international holders of that currency, as the government can seize funds from nationals of sanctioned countries. 

Dalio also said that you could be “shut off” from a CBDC if you were “politically disfavored.”

An American CBDC is unlikely to be deployed in the near future, as US President Donald Trump has been vocally opposed to them. 

Soon after taking office in January 2025, Trump signed an executive order prohibiting “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a US CBDC. 

According to the Atlantic Council's CBDC tracker, only three countries have officially launched a CBDC: Nigeria, Jamaica, and The Bahamas. 

Another 49 countries are testing CBDCs, including China, Russia, India and Brazil. Twenty nations have a CBDC in development, and 36 are still researching central bank digital currencies.

India's central bank reportedly proposed an initiative in January linking BRICS CBDCs to facilitate cross-border trade and tourism payments.

Intravenous loberamisal, a novel dual-target neuroprotectant, improved functional outcome in patients with ischemic stroke, results of a phase 3 study showed.

In addition, an exploratory element of the study showed the highly selective small-molecule agent also reduced poststroke depression and anxiety.

“Loberamisal was associated with a 13% absolute increase in the proportion of patients achieving excellent functional outcomes at 90 days, with a favorable safety profile,” study investigator Shuya Li, MD, director of the Clinical Trial Center, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China, toldMedscape Medical News.

She said the findings bolster confidence in the novel agent's efficacy and justify further neuroprotectant studies in patients with stoke.

The findings were presented on February 6, 2026, at International Stroke Conference (ISC) 2026.

Reperfusion therapy is a key therapeutic approach for acute ischemic stroke. However, not all patients with stroke are eligible for the therapy due to the strict eligibility criteria including a narrow therapeutic time window.

In addition, about 30% of patients who do receive reperfusion therapy fail to achieve an excellent functional outcome.

To improve outcomes, the investigators are developing neuroprotective therapies that could help address a significant unmet medical need in China, where approximately 3.94 million new stroke cases occur each year and ischemic stroke accounts for 72% of cases.

Stroke researchers have been investigating postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) inhibitors that disrupt the NMDAR/PSD-95/nNOS complex. These agents have shown promise in mitigating ischemic brain injury and exerting neuroprotective effects, particularly when administered within 3 hours of symptom onset.

While other groups are exploring PSD-95 inhibition in stroke, Li's group is focusing on loberamisal, a first-in-class agent that not only inhibits PSD-95 but also enhances alpha2-gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor activity.

Preclinical studies showed that loberamisal reduced neuronal excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation while also exerting antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.

A recent phase 2 study published in Stroke and Vascular Neurology showed that compared with placebo, loberamisal administered once daily for 10 days at doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg had a comparable safety profile and demonstrated signals of efficacy. The 40 mg dose was associated with the most favorable outcomes.

The current study enrolled 997 adults with ischemic stroke across 32 centers. The median age was approximately 63 years, the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 8, and the median time from symptom onset to treatment initiation was 25 hours. Participants were ineligible for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).

Participants were assigned within 48 hours of suspected stroke onset to receive either placebo or 40 mg of intravenous loberamisal. The drug was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion once daily for 10 consecutive days.

Investigators and participants were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary efficacy outcome was an excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-1 at 90 days.

Study results showed that 69.7% of patients in the loberamisal group achieved the primary outcome compared with 56.3% of those in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12-1.36; risk difference, 13.28).

Secondary analyses supported the primary findings. A sliding dichotomy analysis of the mRS at 90 days showed results consistent with the primary outcome (adjusted RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.42).

The overall distribution of mRS scores at 90 days favored loberamisal. However, there were no significant between-group differences in NIHSS score changes at 10 or 30 days or in 90-day Barthel Index scores.

An exploratory outcome assessed poststroke depression and anxiety using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), respectively. Depression affects an estimated 30% of patients with stroke and anxiety approximately 25%, and both are strongly associated with poorer functional recovery after stroke.

Results showed significant reductions in the risk for severe depression (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.94 for MADRS ≥ 22 at 90 days) and anxiety (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.99 for HAM-A ≥ 21 at 90 days) in the loberamisal group compared with placebo.

Overall safety profiles were comparable between groups, with lower rates of serious adverse events (8.6% vs 10.7%) and all-cause mortality (1.2% vs 2.0%) in the treatment group.

Li said her team is considering a larger follow-up study in broader patient populations, potentially including those who have undergone EVT.

In the current trial, a relatively small proportion of patients received intravenous thrombolysis (approximately 17%), and patients undergoing EVT were excluded. In addition, the study population was limited to patients in China.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, ISC Chair Lauren Sansing, MD, professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, described the excellent functional outcomes as encouraging and noted that the findings represent “one of the first big wins in the neuroprotection space.”

Sansing emphasized that a 48-hour treatment window could make loberamisal accessible to a much broader patient population, noting that a large proportion of patients with stroke globally present within the first 2 days.

She noted that although the trial was large, it was conducted exclusively at centers in China and emphasized that additional data from more geographically diverse populations will be important before broader clinical adoption.

ISC Vice Chair Bijoy Menon, MD, a neurologist in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, also commented on the findings. He noted that the trial was not designed to enroll patients in the hyperacute phase of stroke, but rather those who were not candidates for thrombectomy or thrombolysis.

Menon, who has been involved in research on the PSD-95 inhibitor nerinetide, said the results are significant, describing the study as the first large trial to demonstrate a positive signal in the neuroprotection and neurorecovery space.

This study was funded by NeuroDawn Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Li, Menon, and Sansing reported having no relevant disclosures.

Republic of Ireland have arranged two friendlies for the upcoming May/June international window, with fixtures confirmed against Qatar at the Aviva Stadium and an away trip to face FIFA World Cup 2026 co-hosts Canada in Montreal.

Heimir Hallgrímsson's side will first welcome Qatar to Dublin on Thursday, 28 May, with kick-off at 7.45pm.

The team will then travel to Montreal for a fixture against Canada at Stade Saputo on Saturday, 6 June, with the kick-off at 12.30am (7.30pm Friday local time).

Both Qatar and Canada are set to compete at the FIFA World Cup 2026 and the games will serve as crucial preparation for Ireland, should the team successfully navigate the UEFA play-offs in March.

Ireland face Czech Republic on 26 March in Prague in a play-off semi-final. The winner of the tie will face Denmark or North Macedonia in a final at their home venue.

The clash with Qatar will be the third meeting between the two nations.

A Callum Robinson hat-trick secured a 4-0 victory for Ireland in their last encounter at the Aviva Stadium in October 2021, which followed a 1-1 draw in Debrecen, Hungary, earlier that year.

The trip to Montreal will mark Ireland's first-ever international fixture in Canada. The sides have met only once before, in an international friendly at Lansdowne Road in November 2003, where goals from Damien Duff and a Robbie Keane brace secured a 3-0 win for the home side.

Ireland head coach Heimir Hallgrimsson said: ""We're delighted to have secured two excellent opponents for the summer window. Our entire focus is on the play-offs in March, but it is essential to have a clear and challenging plan for what comes next, and facing two teams who will be at the World Cup provides us with exactly the level of preparation we will need.

""The home game against Qatar at the Aviva will be a great occasion for our supporters, and the trip to Montreal to face a World Cup co-host will be a fantastic and valuable experience for the squad. These fixtures give us a clear and demanding focus for the summer.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Home favourite Etcheverry makes fast start in Buenos Aires","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/buenos-aires-2026-monday-report","Tue, 10 Feb 2026 03:10:30 GMT","

Tomas Martin Etcheverry made a winning start on his return to the IEB+ Argentina Open on Monday. 

The Argentine, competing in the main draw in Buenos Aires for the fifth consecutive time, earned a 6-3, 6-4 win over Italian qualifier Andrea Pellegrino. 

""It was an incredible match. Playing here in Buenos Aires in front of my people is super special,"" he said. ""I have a different energy when I play here and I'm super happy to get the first victory. I am looking forward for a long week here.

In his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting against Pellegrino, Etcheverry produced a dominant serving display. He fired seven aces and won 85 per cent (29/34) of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, sailing to victory in one hour and 38 minutes. 

The two-time quarter-finalist will next face Laslo Djere or fellow Argentine Roman Andres Burruchaga.

In other action on the opening day of the tournament, 2025 semi-finalist Pedro Martinez cruised past Argentine qualifier Lautaro Midon 6-4, 6-1, earning his 50th tour-level clay-court win. The Spaniard saved 80 per cent (4/5) of the break points he faced.

Watch Highlights from Martinez vs. Midon: 

Hugo Dellien set a second-round clash with top seed Francisco Cerundolo after defeating Damir Dzumhur 6-4, 6-1. The victory marked Dellien's first tour-level win since defeating Thiago Seyboth Wild at the Masters 1000 event in Rome last May.

In the final match of the day, Vit Kopriva held his nerve to outlast Buenos Aires native Alex Barrena 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, who was making his ATP Tour debut.

Top seed Iga Swiatek began her Doha campaign with a 6-0, 6-3 win over Indonesian wild card Janice Tjen to move into the third round. Swiatek also extended her streak to 32 straight opening match-wins at WTA 1000 events.

Top-seeded Iga Swiatek scored a comfortable straight-sets win over Indonesian wild card Janice Tjen to reach the third round of the Qatar TotalEnergies Open in Doha on Tuesday.

Playing her first match since a quarterfinal loss to eventual champion Elena Rybakina at the Australian Open, Swiatek dominated the opening set, dropping just eight points in a 6-0 win.

The second set was more competitive as Tjen displayed the form that has seen her rise from outside the top 400 at the start of the 2025 season to her current ranking of No. 46 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. After the players traded early breaks, Swiatek broke in the eighth game and held to close out a 6-0, 6-3 victory in 1 hour, 9 minutes.

Here are some notable stats around Swiatek's latest win:

23: Swiatek improved to 23 career match-wins combined in Doha and Dubai. Only former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki has more (25) since the WTA 1000 format was introduced in 2009.

31: Swiatek has won 31 consecutive WTA-level matches against players ranked outside the top 20. Her last loss to a player outside the top 20 came in Rome last May, when she fell to Danielle Collins in the round of 32.

32: Swiatek extended her streak of consecutive opening-match wins at WTA 1000 events to 32. Her last opening-match loss at a WTA 1000 came in Cincinnati in 2021 against Ons Jabeur.

36: Swiatek recorded her 36th 6-0 set at WTA 1000 events, the most by any player since the format's introduction in 2009. When asked if she ever thought about giving away a game to her opponents when it comes to such situations, Swiatek responded, ""I think when I was younger, I felt that way, but later on, you just want to win it. It's sports. It doesn't make sense to stop or to play 80%. I'm there to perform my best, so I felt always that you wouldn't be respectful towards the opponent if give them something, because we're here to play our best. I always try to just focus on myself and that's it.""

72: Swiatek is now 72-0 in opening matches across her last 72 WTA events played, including the United Cup and WTA Finals. Her last opening match loss at a WTA event came against Maria Sakkari at the 2021 WTA Finals in Guadalajara.

""It's always nice to start a tournament in a solid way and I'm ready for every match,"" Swiatek said when asked about this streak by the media in Doha. ""I think that's the reason for that. I don't take anything for granted, so even first rounds or second rounds, I treat them as super important matches and as a challenge. So I'm ready for it from the beginning.""

Swiatek will next face former top-10 player Daria Kasatkina in the Round of 16. The Australian scored a 6-4, 6-0 win over 16h seed Elise Mertens of Belgium earlier in the day.

Swiatek leads the head-to-head 6-1 over Kasatkina and has won their last six meetings without dropping a set. But she is not taking the match lightly.

""Honestly I try not to think about head-to-head because every match is a different story,"" Swiatek said. ""She can come to the match feeling that she has nothing to lose. There are different ways the match can go, and I wouldn't say that focusing on the last results gives a lot. I'd rather stay ready for the challenge and not really think about the previous ones.""

Editor-At-Large


EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros. Pictures is reuniting frequent collaborators Mike Flanagan and Stephen King on a new adaptation of The Mist, based on the acclaimed 1980 novella.


	Flanagan will direct and write the screenplay. He will produce through Red Room alongside Tyler Thompson and Spyglass' Gary Barber and Chris Stone. Alexandra Magistro will also executive produce for Red Room. 


	In The Mist, a small town in Maine is consumed by a thick mysterious fog from which creatures emerge to attack the townsfolk. A group of survivors hole up in a local grocery store. As often happens with King's fiction, anarchy and societal reordering brings out the best in some, and the absolute worst in others, sparking mob mentality and empowering unhinged extremists who become as dangerous as the horrors outside.  The novella originated in the King short story collection Skeleton Crew, and it was previously turned into a 2007 film and a 2017 TV series.

	











	Flanagan has kept busy with King's works, directing Gerald's Game, The Shining sequel Doctor Sleep, Life of Chuck. He has been engaged in a new adaptation of King's first published novel, Carrie, as a miniseries for Amazon Prime.

	WME and VanderKloot Law reps Flanagan and King is repped by Rand Holston and Gang Tyre.

There's no win there. Once the first promos or trailers come out, everyone will watch the original that's still new enough to give them what they need, and spoil the ending. So what's the point?

What is the appeal of Flanagan?

Honestly this is a pointless remake. I really like Flanagan but this really isn't necessary

What's the point?

There are tons of Stephen King stories, why focus on one who had a pretty good adaptation? Do a new adapation of one of the stories that completely missed the mark instead.

Surveillance photos and videos of a suspect in the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's mom, Nancy Guthrie, have been released by law enforcement.

The visuals were unveiled to the public on Tuesday after the FBI revealed that Nancy's alleged kidnappers have not contacted Savannah and her family since the $6 million ransom deadline passed Monday at 5 p.m. MT/7 p.m. ET.

In the snaps, an unknown, masked individual could be seen outside of Nancy's door at her Arizona home, fully clothed and wearing gloves.

“Over the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie‘s home that may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors, including the removal of recording devices,” read a statement released to the press on Tuesday.

“The video was recovered from residual data located in backend systems. Working with our partners — as of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance.”

The statement continued, “Anyone with information, please contact 1-800-CALL-FBI, 520-351-4900, 88-CRIME or visit tips.fbi.gov. We do not have any further information to share at this time.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Donald Trump “encourages any American across the country with any knowledge of this suspect to please call the FBI.”

Page Six spoke with longtime private investigator Andy Kay, who told us the surveillance videos came from Nest.

“The cameras will record to the servers as long as they have internet,” he explained.

As soon as the new images and videos went public on Tuesday, Savannah took to Instagram to share the info with her more than 1.7 million followers.

“We believe she is still alive. Bring her home,” she captioned one of her posts, with a second caption reading, “Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.”

Savannah, 54, and her relatives were instructed to place $6 million into a bitcoin account on Monday without being given any proof that Nancy, 84, was still alive.

However, they did not pay the ransom before the deadline expired and have not heard from the alleged kidnappers since.

TMZ reported that the ransom note also included chilling threats and demands.

“It is in the best interest of everyone to have this completed as soon as possible,” the letter read in part, per the outlet.

Nancy was last seen on Jan. 31, when she was dropped off at her Tucson, Ariz., home following a family dinner.

When she did not show up for church the following morning, she was reported missing. 

Page Six previously reported that authorities found a trail of blood that belonged to the elder outside her home last week. The investigation remains ongoing.
