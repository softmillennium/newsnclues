                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top seed Iga Swiatek began her Doha campaign with a 6-0, 6-3 win over Indonesian wild card Janice Tjen to move into the third round. Swiatek also extended her streak to 32 straight opening match-wins at WTA 1000 events. Top-seeded Iga Swiatek scored a comfortable straight-sets win over Indonesian wild card Janice Tjen to reach the third round of the Qatar TotalEnergies Open in Doha on Tuesday. Playing her first match since a quarterfinal loss to eventual champion Elena Rybakina at the Australian Open, Swiatek dominated the opening set, dropping just eight points in a 6-0 win. After the players traded early breaks, Swiatek broke in the eighth game and held to close out a 6-0, 6-3 victory in 1 hour, 9 minutes. Here are some notable stats around Swiatek's latest win: 23: Swiatek improved to 23 career match-wins combined in Doha and Dubai. 1 Caroline Wozniacki has more (25) since the WTA 1000 format was introduced in 2009. 31: Swiatek has won 31 consecutive WTA-level matches against players ranked outside the top 20. Her last loss to a player outside the top 20 came in Rome last May, when she fell to Danielle Collins in the round of 32. 32: Swiatek extended her streak of consecutive opening-match wins at WTA 1000 events to 32. When asked if she ever thought about giving away a game to her opponents when it comes to such situations, Swiatek responded, "I think when I was younger, I felt that way, but later on, you just want to win it. I'm there to perform my best, so I felt always that you wouldn't be respectful towards the opponent if give them something, because we're here to play our best. I always try to just focus on myself and that's it." "It's always nice to start a tournament in a solid way and I'm ready for every match," Swiatek said when asked about this streak by the media in Doha. I don't take anything for granted, so even first rounds or second rounds, I treat them as super important matches and as a challenge. Swiatek will next face former top-10 player Daria Kasatkina in the Round of 16. Swiatek leads the head-to-head 6-1 over Kasatkina and has won their last six meetings without dropping a set. "Honestly I try not to think about head-to-head because every match is a different story," Swiatek said. There are different ways the match can go, and I wouldn't say that focusing on the last results gives a lot. Top seed Iga Swiatek began her Doha campaign with a 6-0, 6-3 win over Indonesian wild card Janice Tjen to move into the third round. Swiatek also extended her streak to 32 straight opening match-wins at WTA 1000 events.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tournament will offer a total financial package of $2.5m funded by sponsor Credit One Bank, consisting of a record $2.3m going toward players' on-site prize money in addition to $200k being contributed towards WTA player benefit programs. Charleston's landmark decision means it is the first standalone WTA 500 event to proactively offer equal prize, in line with what is required for an ATP 500 level event. The announcement marks a historic milestone as the WTA continues on its pathway toward prize money equality, with all tournaments at this level projected to offer equal prize money by 2033. Venus Williams, a pivotal figure throughout her career for equal prize money and 2004 Charleston champion, commented: “This is a huge moment for the legacy of our sport which sends a powerful message to the players, fans and the future of tennis. It shows real progress and a belief in the value of women's sport." It reflects a shared belief that women athletes deserve equal recognition, investment and opportunity, and we're proud to see a tournament with such history take this important step forward.” Ben Navarro, Tournament Owner of the Credit One Charleston Open, added: “Women's tennis is delivering at a very high level right now, from the quality of competition to the engagement from fans, and this investment reflects that. The $200k figure will be contributed to the Women's Tennis Benefit Association (WTBA) which offers key services to WTA players including a pension plan, health insurance and subsidized college tuition and online degrees through the University of Florida and Indiana University East.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lucky loser Elisabetta Cocciaretto scored her third career Top 10 win and advanced to the last 16 of a WTA 1000 event for the first time with a straight-sets upset of Coco Gauff at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open -- and revealed afterwards that her friendship with Sofia Goggia, the women's downhill bronze medallist at the Winter Olympics this week, has been an inspiration to her. Lucky loser Elisabetta Cocciaretto scored her third Top 10 win -- and first outside a Grand Slam -- with a 6-4, 6-2 upset of No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the Qatar TotalEnergies Open second round. But despite posting one of the best results of her career, Cocciaretto admitted in her on-court interview that her attention isn't wholly on the tennis this week. After all, the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games are currently being held in her home country. "Well, I think this week is a little bit different for us in Italy," she said. Afterwards, Cocciaretto explained that she'd been glued to the downhill skiing races all week. Ahead of her first-round match against Elsa Jacquemot, she'd been cheering on her friend Sofia Goggia, who took the bronze medal in Sunday's women's event. Cocciaretto and Goggia had met through their mutual clothing sponsor, Emporio Armani. "Now we are in contact," she said. She gives me a lot of advice." Cocciaretto has never skied herself -- her parents forbade it as too dangerous when she was younger -- but her coach Fausto Scolari hails from the Alpine town of Sondrio, and he's taught her to appreciate the sport. Indeed, Cocciaretto calls downhill skiers her "idols". "I love how they approach the sport," she said. So I tried to not put that limit on myself, and go there and have maybe a mentality of a champion." With her game style of holding her baseline and taking the ball as early as possible, Cocciaretto signalled her aggressive intent throughout an opening set in which she fired 10 winners to Gauff's four. 57 made her move at 2-2, standing inside the baseline on return and reeling off a series of superb groundstrokes to break. Keeping her lead wasn't straightforward, but Cocciaretto came up with resilient tennis in the clutch. Gauff pegged her back to 3-3, but Cocciaretto broke again courtesy of the best point of the match -- a 33-stroke lungbuster in which both players ran each other ragged, before Cocciaretto was able to finally bust through the Gauff defenses with a backhand. She then saved a break point in each of her next service games, and converted her fourth set point with one of her most reliable weapons -- the crosscourt backhand. There was less tension in the second set. Cocciaretto broke immediately with another crosscourt backhand winner and cruised to the finishing line as Gauff's unforced error tally rose to 39. "I tried to be a little bit more passive, but playing with more shape, and she was just taking the ball early and crushing the ball. I think I need to figure out how to play against players like her who hit super flat and take everything pretty much early. Cocciaretto surging in 2026: Cocciaretto's previous Top 10 wins had come over Petra Kvitova at Roland Garros 2023 and Jessica Pegula at Wimbledon 2025, but she had not won a set from Gauff in three previous professional meetings. However, she did have a junior win over the American to draw on, having defeated her 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 at the Australian Open in 2018. She still remembers every detail of it, too -- from her fellow Italians joking about her unlucky draw to the game plan she used to win. The result continues Cocciaretto's stellar season so far -- one in which she has used the qualifying rounds as a springboard to success. This week, she fell in the final round of qualifying to Varvara Gracheva, but entered the main draw as a lucky loser following McCartney Kessler's withdrawal. The 25-year-old will next face another American, Ann Li, with a maiden WTA 1000 quarterfinal at stake for both players.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sebastian Korda earned his 150th tour-level win and a measure of revenge with a crisp opening performance Monday night at the Nexo Dallas Open. The victory continued Korda's recent success on home soil after his run to the final at an ATP Challenger Tour event in San Diego one week ago. Korda lost just one point on first serve against Zheng, according to Infosys ATP Stats, winning 29 of 30 points behind his first delivery. Korda's victory drew the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series level at 1-1 after Zheng picked up his first tour-level win last month in their Melbourne meeting.

Eighth seed Frances Tiafoe also advanced Monday with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 result against Terence Atmane. Now a perfect 4-0 in Dallas, Tiafoe is seeking the biggest title of his career this week after reaching previous ATP 500 finals in Vienna (2021) and Tokyo (2022). "It was kind of nice to get through that. Probably a year ago, last season, I'd lose a lot of those types of matches," said Tiafoe, who was competing for the first time since the Australian Open. Brandon Nakashima also advanced with a 6-3, 6-4 win against Mattia Bellucci, but third seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina prevented an American sweep on the day with his 6-4, 7-6(1) result against qualifier Zachary Svajda. 14 in the PIF ATP Rankings is seeking his first ATP Tour title and his second indoor final after reaching the Basel title match last October.
