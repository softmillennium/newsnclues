                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the recent crypto market correction, analysts are monitoring altcoins to determine whether prices are forming a bottom or preparing for another decline. Technical analysis by Gareth Soloway shows that Ethereum ETHUSD, Solana SOLUSD, and XRP may see short-term recovery attempts, but broader trends remain uncertain. Ethereum recently experienced a sharp sell-off, breaking below an important support level before stabilizing. According to technical analysis, the former support area has now turned into resistance, a common market behavior following panic-driven declines. Analysts note that Ethereum is currently showing a short-term bullish structure that could support a limited rebound, with upside likely capped around the $2,500–$2,600 region unless stronger buying momentum emerges. At the same time, analysts warn that failure to hold current support levels could trigger another leg lower. If Solana breaks below key pivot areas near recent lows, the next major support zone could appear around $50, making current price levels important for determining the next trend direction. XRP's technical structure appears more fragile compared with other large-cap altcoins after the token fell below a long-standing support level formed during the previous bull cycle. That breakdown has transformed the former support zone into heavy resistance, now estimated around $1.60–$1.70. While a short-term bounce toward that region is possible, XRP must reclaim and hold above the resistance band to improve its longer-term outlook. Overall, the technical outlook across major altcoins shows a similar pattern: short-term bullish signals indicating possible relief rallies, combined with broader bearish structures that have not yet been fully reversed. Sustained recoveries will likely depend on whether the wider crypto market stabilizes and whether key resistance zones are successfully reclaimed in the coming weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement released Tuesday, Blockchain.com said the registration enables it to serve both retail and institutional clients under UK oversight. The company was founded in the UK in 2011 and has operated globally for more than a decade, but FCA registration had remained a key requirement for deeper activity in its home market. While FCA registration allows Blockchain.com to operate as a crypto asset business, it does not amount to full authorization under the UK's forthcoming permanent crypto regime. The government is still developing that framework, with implementation expected in 2027. For now, registered firms are permitted to conduct certain activities while meeting strict financial crime controls, but they remain outside a comprehensive prudential regime covering capital, governance, and consumer protections. That distinction matters for companies planning long-term expansion in the UK, particularly those serving institutional clients. The firm said it is continuing work toward securing full authorization once the UK's permanent framework comes into force. Until then, crypto companies must operate within a transitional environment where access is allowed, but future requirements remain subject to policy development. The FCA has taken a cautious approach to crypto registration, approving only a limited number of firms since the regime was introduced. Many applicants have withdrawn or failed to meet the regulator's standards, citing difficulties around governance, controls, and risk management. Against that backdrop, Blockchain.com's registration places it among a smaller group of firms that have cleared the FCA's checks. The government has repeatedly said it wants the UK to remain competitive as a financial center while avoiding a repeat of past failures seen in offshore crypto markets. That balance has produced a slower approval process, but one that aims to favor firms with established operations and compliance capabilities. Blockchain.com founder and CEO Peter Smith framed the registration as part of a broader engagement with UK regulators and policymakers. “We are committed to working hand-in-hand with the FCA and UK policymakers as they shape the permanent regulatory framework, ensuring the UK remains a global leader in financial innovation,” Smith said. That tone is consistent with how larger crypto firms have approached regulation in major markets, where ongoing dialogue often matters as much as initial approval. Blockchain.com said it currently operates across more than 70 jurisdictions worldwide. Many funds, banks, and corporate users require counterparties to hold local approvals, even when services are delivered on a cross-border basis. With the UK's full regime still years away, firms like Blockchain.com must operate within interim rules while preparing for tighter supervision later in the decade. The FCA approval does not settle those questions, but it places Blockchain.com inside the regulatory system at a time when access, rather than scale alone, is becoming the primary constraint for crypto firms operating in developed markets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interactive Brokers now offers nano Bitcoin futures via Coinbase Derivatives, providing smaller, lower-risk, and perpetual-style contracts to broaden regulated crypto access for its clients. Interactive Brokers is expanding its crypto derivatives lineup through a new offering of nano Bitcoin contracts listed by Coinbase Derivatives, giving eligible clients another regulated way to gain exposure to digital assets. Trading will be available around the clock, aligning with the always-on nature of crypto markets, with exceptions for scheduled exchange maintenance on Fridays from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. The smaller sizing allows traders to take more precise positions and manage risk with lower capital requirements compared with standard futures contracts. Interactive Brokers Chief Executive Officer Milan Galik said demand has grown for perpetual-style crypto futures because they provide long-dated exposure and added flexibility. “By offering nano-sized Bitcoin and Ether futures on a regulated exchange, we are expanding access to these products with smaller contract sizes and lower margin requirements,” Galik said in a company press release. The combination of perpetual-style design and nano sizing is intended to make these contracts more accessible for a wider range of market participants. The launch reflects Interactive Brokers' push to integrate digital asset exposure into its multi-asset trading platform, which offers access to more than 170 markets worldwide. Clients can trade traditional securities alongside crypto-related instruments through a single account. Coinbase Institutional also highlighted the partnership as part of its effort to broaden access to regulated crypto derivatives in the United States. Interactive Brokers noted that eligibility to trade crypto-related products depends on jurisdiction, reflecting differing regulatory requirements across regions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ETH has attempted to stabilize near key support levels, but further upside depends on sustained backing from investors and broader market conditions. On-chain data suggests a notable shift in investor behavior. The exchange net position change indicator, which tracks capital flows into and out of exchanges, has turned negative for Ethereum. This signals that more ETH is leaving exchanges than entering them, a pattern typically associated with accumulation rather than distribution. Lower prices often encourage this behavior as investors position for potential rebounds. This shift in stance reflects improving confidence, even as the price has yet to fully reflect rising demand. Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya's Daily Crypto Newsletter here. Rising CMF values indicate declining outflows and improving capital flow dynamics across Ethereum markets. Maintaining this level often acts as a trigger for renewed participation, encouraging investors to deploy capital as downside risk appears more contained. Ethereum is trading near $2,018 at the time of writing, signaling that demand remains present beneath current prices. The challenge lies in translating that demand into sustained upward movement. Beyond that, the psychological target of $2,500 comes into focus. Reaching $2,500 may not prove difficult from a structural standpoint. Cost basis distribution data shows relatively light accumulation around this zone, suggesting limited overhead supply. As a result, ETH could move through this range with less resistance once momentum builds. Before that scenario plays out, Ethereum must clear intermediate hurdles. Failure to sustain current support, however, would undermine the bullish setup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kraken sacked its chief financial officer, Stephanie Lemmerman, just as the crypto exchange prepares to publicly list in the U.S. in the early part of this year, according to two people familiar with the matter. Lemmerman joined Kraken from Dapper Labs in November 2024 and was the exchange's CFO for one year and four months. She now has a strategic advisory role at Kraken, one of the people said. Robert Moore, formerly VP of business expansion, has basically taken over her job, the person said. An updated leadership page on the website of Kraken's parent company, Payward Inc., lists Moore as deputy CFO. Lemmerman does not appear. Clearly it matters that Kraken has removed its CFO after lodging a confidential filing with U.S. regulators in November. That came just days after Kraken raised $800 million at a $20 billion valuation, including $200 million from Citadel Securities. Other people who have been promoted to senior roles include Curtis Ting, who was made chief operating officer in December, and Kamo Asatryan was made chief data officer in January. A second person familiar with the changes said finance at Kraken is changing to become more of a product than a back-office function.</p>

A former FBI official told Fox News Digital that Monday evening's Instagram plea by Savannah Guthrie reveals that authorities might believe the chances of finding her mother Nancy alive are dwindling. As the search for Nancy Guthrie stretches into a second week, her alleged captors are reportedly seeking a $6 million Bitcoin ransom, illustrating how cryptocurrency has reshaped the business of extortion. Guthrie, 84, the mother of NBC News anchor Savannah Guthrie, was abducted from her home in Arizona, with investigators later confirming only limited details about a ransom demand. "Criminals increasingly request cryptocurrency in ransom and extortion cases because it is fast, global and does not rely on traditional banking rails that can delay or block payments," explained Ari Redbord, global head of policy at TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence and crypto-forensics firm. "Cases like the alleged crypto ransom demand in the Nancy Guthrie case highlight how this dynamic is playing out in the real world," added Redbord, a former federal prosecutor and senior U.S. Treasury official. FBI agents canvass homes near Nancy Guthrie's home in Tucson, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026. What's more, despite repeated public pleas from the Guthrie family, neither proof of life nor direct contact with her has been provided. Still, Redbord cautions that the same technology that makes cryptocurrency attractive to criminals can also expose them. "The moment a wallet address appears, investigators have something actionable. Funds can be tracked in real time, associations identified and networks mapped in ways that are impossible with bulk cash or informal value transfer systems," Redbord said. Bitcoin has become a routine tool of extortion—fast to move, global in reach and difficult to claw back once paid. He added that cryptocurrency has fundamentally altered the economics of ransom and extortion — often in ways perpetrators fail to fully appreciate. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance. If you have any information concerning this case, contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI, or submit a tip online. Amanda covers the intersection of business and politics for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today the European Parliament held a vote on the European Central Bank's (ECB's) annual report. While votes on central bank digital currencies might be expected to divide along party lines, with left leaning supportive and right leaning against, today the centrist and right leaning parties were split on the topic. The center right EPP party to which he belongs is the largest in parliament and was completely split, although more of his party's MEPs voted in favor of the digital euro than against. Even the far right Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN) party had more votes in favor than against. A key argument that the ECB has been making is the need for payment sovereignty, with today's retail payments dominated by Visa and Mastercard. The Rapporteur has argued that retail payments should be left to the private sector, with the European Payments Initiative (EPI) making progress in rolling out a European digital wallet, wero. Instead he proposed that the ECB should stick to an offline digital euro. Today's amendment and vote was specific about supporting both an online and offline digital euro.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio believes that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) will become a reality, despite major concerns about government control over the personal finances of ordinary people. While this transparency could help combat illegal activities, authorities would gain unprecedented power over citizens' financial lives. Programmable digital money would also enable direct government taxation, allowing officials to withdraw funds from people's accounts. Dalio went further, stating that people who fall out of political favour could be entirely excluded from the financial system. Dalio believes that CBDCs have low investment potential as these currencies will not likely offer interest payments, making them a poor choice for wealth storage. Interest in CBDCs and their practical use cases continues to grow, but actual global deployment remains limited. However, 49 countries, including China, India, Russia and Brazil, are conducting pilot tests. India's central bank recently proposed linking BRICS CBDCs for cross-border trade and tourism transactions. Elsewhere, 20 countries have CBDCs in development, and another 36 nations continue researching the technology. In the US, President Donald Trump has expressed opposition to these currencies and signed an executive order after assuming office that prevents the issuance, circulation and use of a US CBDC. While this rule offers relief for privacy advocates, Dalio warns that CBDCs will eventually spread globally, as growing support for digital money could influence American policy in the future. While governments see multiple benefits to introducing CBDCs, ordinary people remain concerned about surveillance and the potential abuse of power. He believes the world is close to teetering into capital war territory, where money is weaponised through trade embargoes, limited access to capital markets, or the use of debt ownership as leverage. That means not in, but it means we are quite close to [capital war], and it would be very easy to go over the brink into a capital war, because there are mutual fears,' he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is once again pushing toward a major psychological level, with BTC eyeing $75,000 as market momentum slowly rebuilds. At the same time, attention is turning to cheap altcoins that are still in early development stages. While Bitcoin sets the pace, some analysts are building a high growth case for a low priced altcoin, focusing on fundamentals, adoption progress, and realistic upside potential. This contrast between BTC's steady climb and emerging altcoin opportunities is shaping investor strategies for the next market phase. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading near $70,000, maintaining a massive market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. After a period of sharp volatility in late January, the asset has found strong support and is once again testing the upper ranges of its current cycle. The primary resistance zones for Bitcoin are currently set at $72,000 and $74,650. These levels have historically seen heavy selling pressure from institutional holders taking profits. If Bitcoin fails to clear the $72,000 mark convincingly, analysts warn of a potential "double top" scenario. For many retail investors, this modest upside is less attractive than the high-growth potential of emerging altcoins. While Bitcoin continues to face strong resistance levels, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a new option in decentralized lending. The protocol is non custodial, meaning users keep full control of their funds while interacting with on chain finance in a transparent way. Mutuum Finance is designed around a dual market structure. This setup aims to improve efficiency and flexibility compared with older lending platforms. This working version includes essential features like liquidity pools, debt-tracking systems, and yield-bearing receipts known as mtTokens. By delivering a functional product before its mainnet debut, Mutuum Finance has proven that it is focused on technical execution. This transparency is a major reason why the project has already attracted over 19,000 holders and raised more than $20.4 million in funding. The growth of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reflected in its rapidly selling distribution phases. This gamified approach has encouraged continuous participation from both retail and larger "whale" investors. Mutuum Finance has also simplified the entry process by supporting MUTM payments via direct card purchases. This asset will allow users to unlock liquidity from their holdings without forced sales. Additionally, the protocol holds a high 90/100 score from CertiK and maintains an active $50,000 bug bounty program. This commitment to safety is exactly why analysts believe MUTM is building a strong case for a breakout year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This innovative fintech enterprise is going full steam ahead in the world of blockchain technology. When asked what they see as the most innovative industries, investors probably won't pick financial services. Its monster growth proves how well it's resonating with customers. If history repeats, shareholders may enjoy supercharged returns. Just in the final six months of 2025, SoFi made some big moves that indicate management's heightened focus on blockchain technology. In August, SoFi announced an exciting partnership with Lightspark to offer a new capability. SoFi Pay customers can send fast and cheap cross-border payments to more than 30 countries within the app. With SoFi Crypto, the business launched crypto trading in November, allowing its members to buy, sell, and hold certain digital assets. In December, SoFi introduced its fully reserved stablecoin, called SoFiUSD, leaning into one of the hottest trends in the digital asset industry. This initiative "will enable SoFi to serve as a stablecoin infrastructure provider for banks, fintechs, and enterprise platforms," according to the press release. "Blockchain is a technology super cycle that will fundamentally change finance, not just in payments, but across every area of money," Chief Executive Officer Anthony Noto said. Critics can argue that SoFi is getting distracted by an unproven technology. Skeptics might say that the company should focus on core revenue generators. But investors have to let the leadership team do what it thinks is best. After all, SoFi has been impressively successful up to this point. There is clearly upside for investors if things work out. The crypto market is currently in a downturn. However, the trailing five-year gain of 104% is still notable. Assuming the crypto market continues its long-term ascent and is much more valuable in five or 10 years, it puts SoFi in a wonderful position to drive durable growth. Should the digital asset ecosystem continue to grow, it will fuel confidence that the industry is here to stay, supporting the belief that blockchain technology has real use within financial services. With more adoption of SoFi's related endeavors, the financials could get a boost, providing a tailwind to the stock price. Neil Patel has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service launched on-site inspections and may open a formal investigation if legal violations are found. Internal ledger processes enabled trades to execute despite limited actual holdings, exposing structural weaknesses in centralised exchange controls. South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service said it was looking into the incident and had initiated on-site inspections, with a formal investigation to be initiated if legal violations are found. Trades are initiated by updating the internal records first, while on-chain settlement comes later. This makes trading fast, but it opens the door to big mistakes if internal book-keeping does not match an exchange's actual holdings. “The so-called ghost Bitcoin incident clearly revealed that, beyond a mere input error, there are structural weaknesses in internal controls and ledger management systems of cryptocurrency exchanges,” Kim Jiho, a spokesperson for the ruling Democratic Party, said on Saturday. Bithumb said it is taking corrective measures to tighten oversight of transfers, including a multilevel approval process for distributing awards. “We will supplement previously missing processes to ensure that approvals are carried out in two or more stages, thereby preventing incidents,” the company said. “This has identified a task that must be strongly reinforced in the second legislature phase of virtual assets.” Bithumb is South Korea's second-largest exchange by trading volume, according to CoinGecko. The incident occurred during a particularly volatile week in cryptocurrency that saw Bitcoin fall to nearly $60,000, less than half its October peak above $126,000, before rebounding to roughly $70,000 by Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NFT ecosystem has evolved far beyond its early single-chain roots. What began as a largely Ethereum-centric movement has transformed into a diverse, multi-chain landscape where creators, collectors, and developers operate across multiple blockchains simultaneously. As transaction costs, scalability demands, and user expectations continue to shift, multi-chain NFT marketplace development has emerged as a strategic necessity rather than a technical luxury. Platforms that fail to adapt risk fragmenting liquidity, alienating creators, and losing relevance in an increasingly interconnected Web3 economy. This article explores the core benefits, practical use cases, and strategic considerations involved in building a multi-chain NFT marketplace, offering insights grounded in real-world implementations and market behavior. In the early days of NFTs, Ethereum's dominance made single-chain marketplaces viable. Liquidity was concentrated, standards were consistent, and most users were willing to tolerate high gas fees in exchange for network trust and composability. However, as NFT adoption expanded, Ethereum's limitations—particularly scalability and transaction costs—became more apparent. This led to the rapid rise of alternative blockchains such as Solana, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Flow. Each ecosystem brought distinct advantages: Solana offered high throughput and near-zero fees, Polygon delivered Ethereum compatibility with lower costs, and Flow focused on consumer-friendly experiences for mainstream brands. The result was a fragmented NFT market, with liquidity and communities spread across multiple chains. This approach reflects a broader Web3 trend toward interoperability and abstraction of underlying infrastructure. By supporting multiple blockchains, a marketplace can tap into distinct user bases, creator communities, and liquidity pools that would otherwise remain siloed. Users can choose blockchains that align with their transaction frequency and budget. Multi-chain platforms empower users with choice, reducing friction and increasing engagement. From a strategic perspective, multi-chain marketplaces are also more future-proof. Blockchain ecosystems evolve rapidly, and dominance can shift over time. In single-chain NFT platforms, liquidity is inherently limited to the activity on that chain. Multi-chain marketplaces, by contrast, can aggregate liquidity across ecosystems, increasing trading volume and improving price discovery. Blur and OpenSea's cross-chain expansions illustrate how liquidity aggregation strengthens network effects. When buyers know they can access a wider range of assets and sellers know they can reach a broader audience, both sides are incentivized to remain active on the platform. Over time, this creates a reinforcing cycle that strengthens market dominance. However, liquidity aggregation is not merely a UX feature it requires careful backend design. Cross-chain indexing, real-time metadata synchronization, and consistent royalty enforcement are all critical components that determine whether liquidity feels unified or fragmented from a user's perspective. One of the most prominent use cases for multi-chain NFT marketplaces is creator diversification. Artists, game studios, and brands increasingly operate across multiple ecosystems to reach different audiences. A multi-chain marketplace enables such strategies without forcing creators to manage multiple platforms. Another major use case is cross-chain NFT trading and portfolio management. Global brands entering Web3 often prioritize scalability, regulatory clarity, and user accessibility over ideological chain loyalty. Supporting multiple blockchains allows marketplaces to tailor infrastructure to specific campaign needs, whether it's a mass-market NFT drop or a limited-edition premium release. Building a multi-chain NFT marketplace introduces architectural complexity that goes far beyond adding wallet connectors. Most successful platforms adopt a modular architecture, separating chain-specific logic from core marketplace functions. Smart contracts handle on-chain operations, while off-chain services manage indexing, search, analytics, and user profiles. This separation allows teams to integrate new blockchains without disrupting the entire system. Bridges and messaging protocols play a crucial role, particularly for cross-chain asset transfers. However, bridges are also among the most exploited components in Web3, accounting for a significant share of blockchain-related hacks. As a result, many marketplaces limit direct cross-chain transfers and instead focus on unified listings and discovery, reducing security exposure while still delivering multi-chain value. Different blockchains may have varying levels of decentralization, validator structures, and compliance implications. From a compliance standpoint, marketplaces must consider how KYC, AML, and content moderation policies apply across chains. A unified policy framework helps maintain consistency, but implementation often requires chain-specific adaptations. Platforms that proactively address these challenges tend to build stronger relationships with payment providers and institutional partners. Some platforms introduce token-based governance to coordinate decisions across ecosystems, while others retain centralized oversight for faster execution. The right approach depends on scale, audience, and long-term vision. Supporting too many blockchains without sufficient user demand can dilute focus, increase maintenance costs, and complicate UX. Successful platforms prioritize chains based on user activity, ecosystem health, and strategic alignment. They also invest heavily in abstraction—hiding complexity from users while maintaining transparency and trust. Wallet-less onboarding, gas fee abstraction, and clear transaction previews are increasingly becoming differentiators rather than optional enhancements. Multi-chain marketplaces must foster cross-ecosystem communities rather than treating each chain as an isolated silo. Unified branding, shared incentives, and consistent communication help create a cohesive identity that transcends individual blockchains. The platforms that succeed are those that understand why interoperability matters, where it delivers the most value, and how to implement it without compromising security or user experience. By enabling seamless access across multiple blockchains, businesses can unlock broader liquidity, empower creators with greater flexibility, and deliver superior user experiences while remaining adaptable to future technological shifts. However, success depends on thoughtful chain selection, robust security architecture, regulatory awareness, and a strong focus on user-centric design rather than sheer technical expansion. A well-planned NFT Marketplace Development Solution that embraces interoperability while managing complexity positions platforms to not only compete in today's fragmented NFT landscape but to lead the next phase of digital asset innovation. In 2026, tokens are further beyond speculation, enabling secure, peer-to-peer transfer, decentralized governance, and economic ownership of the real world. Economic activity is increasingly automated and programmatically managed using decentralized technologies. Token Development will constitute a substantial building block to the development of new digital economies, enabling secure and efficient economic transactions in the next generation of digital economies.

Despite record transactions last year, most users prefer alternatives – while Beijing likely to maintain gradual expansion, analysts say

The slow uptake underscores that China still has a long way to go to realise its ambitions. Despite government and public sector incentives, such as issuing consumption coupons and tax rebates through the system, users have shown little motivation to embrace the digital currency.

Chloe Cui, an employee at a state-owned bank, is paid a portion of her salary in digital yuan – another initiative to expand domestic use. But every month, she transfers the money straight to her regular bank account. “I've never used [it] for payments. I only use it when receiving money,” she said.

The upgraded digital yuan would also incorporate more emerging technologies than the traditional monetary system, boosting digitisation across issuance, circulation and payment – a move analysts see as Beijing's answer to stablecoins.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vitalik Buterin is calling for a different path in artificial intelligence—one that rejects a blind “race to AGI” and instead relies on Ethereum-style decentralization, verification, and privacy as guardrails for the AI era. Instead of raw acceleration, AI development should focus on systems that “foster human freedom and empowerment” and ensure “the world does not blow up,” Buterin wrote, echoing his defensive-acceleration, or d/acc, framework. Joni Pirovich, founder and CEO of Crystal aOS, told Decrypt, “Ethereum becoming the default settlement layer for AI-to-AI interactions is realistic. Buterin claims his alternative centers on safer, more verifiable infrastructure rather than larger models, outlining a practical roadmap in which Ethereum plays a central, though not exclusive, role. That includes local LLM tooling, zero-knowledge payments that let users call AI APIs without linking identity across requests, stronger cryptographic privacy, and client-side verification of AI services and attestations. “Using Ethereum as an economic layer for AI-to-AI interaction is also directionally correct, but it will live mostly on rollups and app-specific L2s,” Midhun Krishna M, co-founder and CEO of LLM cost tracker TknOps.io, told Decrypt. Decentralized agent economies need programmable deposits, usage-based payments, and on-chain dispute resolution, Krishna said, adding that AI-augmented governance will require “identity, reputation, and stake-weighted accountability, not just better interfaces.” Another quadrant positions Ethereum as an economic layer for AI activity, supporting API payments, bot-to-bot hiring, security deposits, on-chain dispute resolution, and AI reputation standards, such as proposed ERC-based models, aimed at enabling decentralized agent coordination rather than in-house platform control. A third focus revives the cypherpunk “don't trust, verify” vision through local LLM assistants that can propose transactions, audit smart contracts, interpret formal verification proofs, and interact with apps without relying on centralized interfaces. A fourth targets upgraded prediction markets, quadratic voting, and governance systems. The comments echo a split that surfaced last year between Buterin and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who said his company was confident it knew how to build AGI and that AI agents could soon “join the workforce,” while Buterin promoted crypto-based safety rails and coordinated control mechanisms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bithumb has apologised for staff error that sent customers 620,000 bitcoins instead of 620,000 Korean won, equivalent to a few hundred US dollars The mistake occurred on 6 February, when an employee entered prize amounts in bitcoin rather than Korean won during a “random box” promotional event. Lee Chan-jin, governor of South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), called it “catastrophic” for those who sold the bitcoin they received. Bitcoin prices have risen since Friday, meaning any customers required to return cryptocurrency could face losses. Lee added that the incident exposed “structural problems” in how exchanges operate internal ledger systems. Separately, legal experts are divided on whether recipients who sold what they received could face criminal prosecution, given a 2021 supreme court ruling that cryptocurrency does not constitute “property” under Korean criminal law. Bithumb said it corrected 99.7% of the erroneous credits by reversing internal ledger entries and issued an apology. It is reportedly seeking to avoid civil lawsuits, where courts could, under civil law, order the return of the original asset rather than its cash equivalent. Bithumb said in its apology: “Bithumb takes this incident very seriously and will do its utmost to prevent recurrence by redesigning the entire asset payment process and enhancing the internal control system. “We want to make it clear that this incident is unrelated to any external hacking or security breach, and does not pose any issues with system security or customer asset management.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some analysts believed that “extreme fear” and upside liquidity may help Bitcoin hold above its yearly-low at $60,000, but others warned that weak market conditions and bearish futures volume may push prices even lower. More than $5.5 billion in short liquidations above current prices may fuel a rebound. Weak price trends and rising derivatives selling may still drag Bitcoin below $60,000. MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe said Bitcoin is flashing sentiment readings that have previously marked market bottoms. According to Van De Poppe, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index had dropped to 5 over the weekend (final recorded reading is 7), its lowest reading in history, while the daily relative strength index (RSI) for BTC has fallen to 15, signaling deeply oversold conditions. Van de Poppe said such conditions may allow BTC to recover and avoid an immediate retest of the $60,000 level. Bitcoin's liquidation heatmap shows over $5.45 billion in cumulative short liquidations positioned if the price moves roughly $10,000 higher, compared with $2.4 billion in liquidations on a retest of $60,000. This imbalance suggests that an upward move may trigger forced shorts covering, leading to a BTC rally.

CryptoQuant's Price Z-Score is also negative at -1.6, indicating BTC is trading below its statistical mean, a sign of selling pressure and trend exhaustion. Such conditions have preceded extended base-building rather than immediate rebounds. Crypto analyst Darkfost highlighted a growing selling dominance in the derivatives markets. Monthly net taker volume has turned sharply negative at -$272 million on Sunday, while Binance's taker buy-sell ratio has slipped below 1, signaling a strong selling pressure. For the current cycle, that level sits near $57,000, with deeper downside scenarios extending toward $42,000 if history repeats.
