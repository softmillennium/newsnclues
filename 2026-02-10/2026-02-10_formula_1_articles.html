                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026 Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success Whether you want to plan a full-throttle day out or something a little more low-key, Valentine's Day is the perfect excuse to celebrate your shared love of Formula 1 with your friends or significant other. Now, this doesn't have to mean candlelit dinners and soppy playlists – especially if Formula 1 plays a big part in your relationship! Whether you bonded over cancelling Sunday plans for race day, have heated strategy debates or even argue about your favourite circuits, there are plenty of ways to put a little (or large!) Start off with a Grand Prix-inspired menu – whether it be an Italian night for Monza or Imola, tacos and margaritas for Mexico, or an Australian-inspired spread to mark the pending season opener in Melbourne. and suddenly dinner transports you straight to the circuit. Thankfully, sometimes the best date night doesn't even need a reservation. Grab some popcorn, dim the lights and settle in for a movie night. Front-row seats and full control of the rewind button – what more could you want? If you're feeling crafty and after a Valentine's date idea that's low-pressure but still super meaningful, making F1-inspired beaded bracelets is always a winner. Settle in with some snacks, and pick your favourite drivers' names or numbers, team colours, or even some iconic meme quotes to adorn your accessory! If you or your partner fancies yourselves a budding engineer, why not fuel that passion by spending the evening crafting your favourite teams' F1 car... in LEGO of course! Every team is represented, and sets range from quick builds to something a little more time consuming – so there's something to suit every skill level. Put some music on, pour a drink, and see which of you has the patience and precision of a race engineer! If you're both missing F1 (and let's face it, who isn't? ), the F1 Arcade makes for a really fun Valentine's date. With F1 Arcades in London, Birmingham, Boston, Atlanta, Washington, Philadelphia, Denver and Las Vegas it is the perfect way to get a mid-winter motorsport fix. Jump into the simulators, have a laugh comparing lap times, then slow things down a little with good food, cocktails and music once the racing's done. If you are a competitive couple, then how better to celebrate Valentines Day than going up against each other on track? If you're the kind of couple who loves a romantic getaway, then we reckon this one could be hard to beat. A table at Ristorante Cavallino in Maranello sits right next to Ferrari's base, and that alone gives the evening a sense of occasion, not just for the Tifosi, but any motorsport fan. Jet off to Italy, soak up the country's deep-rooted love for motorsport and turn the dinner into one stop on a longer adventure. With Florence, Venice and Bologna all within reach, it's easy to imagine this becoming the start of a memorable Italian road trip! Though slightly unconventional, an F1-themed wedding doesn't get more on-brand than saying “I do” at the Las Vegas Grand Prix over race weekend! While some decide to get married on impulse during the weekend itself, others plan the whole trip around their wedding, making it a perfect Valentine's Day idea to start plotting together. And who knows... maybe a rogue F1 driver will even pop up to officiate your ceremony (we're looking at you Valtteri Bottas!) Picking a Grand Prix that you are both itching to attend and imagining yourselves trackside gets the excitement levels rising after a few months without racing.</p>
