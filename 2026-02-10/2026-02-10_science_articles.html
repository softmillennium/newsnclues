The more than €30-million Choose France for Science initiative, launched last April, is just one of a slew of European initiatives that aim to bring in research talent disaffected by changes elsewhere. These include the European Union's Choose Europe initiative, which is currently supported by nearly €900 million (US$1.1 billion) in research funding. Previously at the University of California, Berkeley, Tao has now taken up his grant at the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies (Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques or IHES) in Paris. Astrophysicist Kartik Sheth, who was associate chief scientist at NASA until he was fired by the agency during mass layoffs last year, has also been funded by the initiative. He will take up a three-year position at Aix-Marseille University in France. Under Trump's second presidency, US researchers have experienced grant cuts, the dismantling of science-funding agencies and increased federal control over universities. US foreign aid and awards to international collaborators have also been terminated. When announcing the call last year, Élisabeth Borne, then French minister for higher education and research, said that France would offer a “refuge” to researchers as “science and research face unprecedented threats worldwide”. Yet a few dozen vacating scientists are unlikely to make a large dent at US academic institutions, which altogether have more than 1.5 million faculty members, she says. France and other countries hoping to lure US scientists face an uphill battle: funders such as the NIH, with their multibillion-dollar budgets, are irreplaceable, Milgram adds. Tens of thousands of scientists, rather than dozens, would need to relocate for it to have a big long-term impact on US science, she says. LINK: US grant applicants surge at prestigious European research agency LINK: US grant applicants surge at prestigious European research agency But it did reveal that almost half of the awardees are headed to higher-education institutions in and around Paris. Meanwhile, Tao says he decided to move to France because the IHES is “a world-leading institute of mathematics” and he will be surrounded in Paris by a strong maths community.

Nature Ecology & Evolution volume 10, pages 193–202 (2026)Cite this article The evolution of herbivory is one of the most important ecological events in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates and impacted the ecosystems they inhabited. Herbivory independently developed in a number of tetrapod clades during the Late Carboniferous and Permian, eventually leading to the establishment of the basic structure of modern terrestrial ecosystems. Here we describe a Late Carboniferous pantylid ‘microsaur', Tyrannoroter heberti gen. et sp. nov., with expansive occluding palatal and coronoid dental batteries. The shape of the teeth, as revealed by high-resolution micro-computed tomography data, indicates wear from both shearing and grinding motions consistent with herbivory. New data from historical pantylid fossils show that similar adaptations can be traced back as far as the Bashkirian (~318 million years ago), indicating that terrestrial herbivory was already widespread within this group, and originated rapidly following the terrestrialization of tetrapods. The placement of recumbirostran ‘microsaurs' on the amniote stem suggests that terrestrial herbivory is not an amniote innovation, although the phylogenetic position of ‘microsaurian' tetrapods remains uncertain. Under any phylogenetic scenario, the data presented here reveal that pantylids acquired adaptations to herbivory independently, probably via durophagous omnivory, feeding on insects, shelled animals and tough plant material.

Scientists don't need to be superstar public performers like Taylor Swift, but they can learn from show business.Credit: Carlos Alvarez/Getty for TAS Rights Management I research and teach immunology at Imperial College London and have also dabbled in public engagement as a popular-science author, so a chunk of my job focuses on public speaking. But the question is, what can researchers learn from performers to improve science talks? Conference talks are a key feature of scientific careers. The extent to which a person's ability to engage audiences is taken into account when selecting speakers is debatable — people are chosen for having ‘an interesting story', which isn't necessarily the same as the ability to tell an interesting story. Talks don't just raise an individual's profile; they can be a platform to highlight a team that also contributed to the work. A great talk will advertise your laboratory, department or institution. Scientific bedlam at the world's weirdest and wildest research conference Scientific bedlam at the world's weirdest and wildest research conference Beyond self-publicity, the point of science talks is to inform, educate and inspire others. In a research ecosystem that increasingly churns out overwhelming numbers of papers, scientific presentations are an important method of highlighting your work to a wider audience. And often, they can help you to engage with a broader circle than your own. Moreover, a good talk can advertise stories to journal editors, who might be more open to a paper that is based on a talk than to one that lands in their inbox without context. On a selfish level, if you're an in-demand speaker, you are more likely to be invited to better conferences in nicer places. International travel, and the chance to meet other scientists and hear their research, is one of the great perks of a career in science. All of these benefits can be magnified if you knock the talk out of the park, and just as easily negated if you grind your way through your slides in a dull, monotone voice. So, are there some lessons that can be learnt from performance artists? My colleague Robin Shattock, a vaccine researcher at Imperial College London, listens to ‘pump up' music — such as ‘The Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor — before public speaking. One way to lose the audience before you've even begun is by fiddling with cables onstage. Check your set-up in advance and make sure that the IT works — fumbling around with HDMI cables and looking for an adaptor for your laptop is unlikely to endear you to the crowd. Sometimes we have the ‘advantage' of being introduced as a speaker. Actor and former stand-up comedian Ben Willbond told me that “the audience needs to know they are in a safe pair of hands. If you watch a nervous, novice stand-up, they almost always lose the audience members, who can sense the speaker is not comfortable. How to know whether a conference is right for you How to know whether a conference is right for you Come out and see how much better everything gets”. Movement and hand gestures can be important for this. I'm a fairly mobile speaker and have been known to knock things off lecterns, followed by the odd expletive. Tone of voice is also important — try to vary it. If you are excited about everything, then it's hard for people to re-engage with the talk if they lose the thread. For example, when listening to sports on the radio, I tune back in when the pitch changes because something noteworthy might have happened. In a perfect world, a talk would be written from scratch, with the narrative chosen first and then the slides created next. This is comparable to a band's set list: switching between crowd-pleasers and new songs. A long string of data-heavy slides might lose the audience, so throw in images, jokes, asides and remarks to keep people attentive.

In 2024, Chinese biotechnology firms developed more than 1,250 new drugs, surpassing the European Union and approaching the US total of roughly 1,440 (see ‘A growing force in biomedical innovation'). Now, it is responsible for about one-fifth of such trials1 (see ‘Top contributors to commercial clinical trials'). And in the past few years, it has achieved several therapeutic milestones. As China's biotech industry gathers pace, however, so does geopolitical scrutiny. Last December, the US Biosecure Act was signed into law in response to concerns about national security. Such increased outside scrutiny, stemming from ongoing concerns about how genetic and clinical information is handled in China, has been prompting Chinese government officials, state-affiliated think tanks and industry stakeholders to advocate for building a closed ‘secure' biotech ecosystem in China. It would blunt China's momentum, restrict people's access to life-saving medications in nations around the world and stall innovation globally. Biomedical progress depends on shared knowledge, diverse patient cohorts and the development of regulations that aligns with global standards. Several domestic shifts have been driving China's biotech boom. China's contract-development and manufacturing organizations and genomics-service providers are continuing to underpin global pipelines for drug development — even amid increased US legislative scrutiny. Thanks to China's manufacturing efficiency, lower regulatory hurdles and ability to recruit large numbers of participants in clinical trials, these organizations can provide services more quickly and cheaply than equivalent ones elsewhere can. In addition, to better align the country's biotech and pharma sectors with global standards, the Chinese government launched a slew of regulatory reforms for medical products in 2015. These reforms have helped to make China an attractive option for pharma companies wanting to conduct early-stage clinical trials — particularly for drug development in oncology and immunology, and for trials needing participants from only one country. Although it is not without problems, China's National Reimbursement Drug List is another factor that has helped to keep the costs of the drugs developed and produced in China relatively low. Under the China Initiative, implemented by the US government in 2018, thousands of researchers and academics affiliated with China, but working in the United States, faced new restrictions and scrutiny — intended to safeguard US laboratories and businesses from espionage. Anyone receiving funds from China or involved in partnerships with institutions from China, for example, had to declare this to the US government. Many of these people have seeded Chinese biotech start-ups. Some Chinese government officials and industry stakeholders are arguing that, given all these developments, China could compensate for any tools, materials and knowledge lost as a result of the country cutting biotech and pharma ties with the United States or other countries. A State Council directive (a high-level administrative order) issued by the Chinese government in September 2025, for example, instructs government procurement offices, which manage the buying of goods and other services for government organizations, to prioritize domestic products. The electronics sector faced a similar challenge in 2022, when US export controls reduced China's access to materials, such as lithography tools, needed to make cutting-edge semiconductor chips. And China's response was to pour billions of US dollars into a workaround — chiplet technology. The Chinese government also supported developers of artificial intelligence in finding ways to work around computing limits, leading to home-grown successes such as the AI start-up Zhipu in Beijing. Several Chinese companies chasing the same leads amid a hypercompetitive corporate culture continues to result in inefficiencies and diminishing returns. A 2024 review showed, for example, that nearly 40% of registered clinical trials for cell therapies (which involve transferring cells into a person to treat or prevent disease) conducted in China between 2021 and 2023 focused on known molecular targets3. But, in part because of their long history of commanding science, the United States and the EU still lead when it comes to representation in high-impact journals and the discovery of genuinely new mechanisms. Besides all these challenges, a lack of international trust continues to be a problem, and tensions are sustained in part by events in China. In 2024, for instance, US intelligence officials reported that Chinese biotech firms had transferred intellectual property of US clients to Chinese authorities without the clients' consent (see go.nature.com/4twedie). AstraZeneca was not involved in any stage of the study design, data collection, analysis, manuscript drafting or the decision to publish.Non-financial competing interests: Jing Qian provides strategic advisory services to AstraZeneca's leadership.

Soft and conducting organic materials are ideal candidates for stretchable bioelectronics and wearable devices. Despite recent advances, our understanding of conducting polymer nanostructures and how they arise remains incomplete, given the limited high-resolution studies and molecular-level descriptions of these systems. Here, we employ cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to investigate the evolution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) morphology in solution and the resulting solid state structure in the presence of ionic and molecular additives. Our results reveal the formation of heterostructural elongated fibers consisting of PEDOT:PSS micelles in solution. Cryo-EM further reveals that additives increase the number of fibrils, in addition to inducing the formation of crystalline domains. We observe that fibril and crystalline phases in solutions act as a template for the growth of these nanostructures in the solid state. Furthermore, exploiting cryo-EM reveals the role of solid-liquid interactions in PEDOT:PSS through the imaging of PEDOT:PSS nanostructures after the hydration of thin films. Hydration leads to the swelling of heterostructural fibers while reducing the crystalline domain size. Such behavior explains the mechanical robustness of PEDOT:PSS thin films processed with various additives as well as the high electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS in applications such as organic electorchemical transistors.

Manipulating the selectivity-determining step in the hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing intermediates is critical to achieving high ammonia selectivity in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Here, we propose a molecular interface engineering strategy that functionalized with thiol-anchored aromatic ligands to regulate the interfacial binding affinity and activation of key nitrogen-containing intermediates on silver nanocube surfaces. By systematically varying the electronic properties of the substituents, we identify 4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde as the most effective ligand, increasing the ammonia Faradaic efficiency from 50.8% to 98.9% and achieving a yield rate of 14,366.1 μg h–1 cmgeo–2 at –0.63 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ electrochemical characterizations combined with theoretical simulations further reveal that 4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde modification promotes the activation of weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules and accelerates the hydrogenation of *HNO intermediates. This targeted modulation of interfacial binding affinity offers an effective strategy for selectivity control in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. The enhanced performance is further validated in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyser, underscoring the practical viability of this molecular design strategy for selective nitrate conversion.
