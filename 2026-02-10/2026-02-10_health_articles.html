                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Case Western Reserve University researchers have made a significant breakthrough in understanding Barrett's esophagus, a precancerous condition that dramatically increases the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, one of the fastest-spreading and deadliest forms of cancer. In a new study, they've discovered how inherited genetic abnormalities increase the chance of developing Barrett's esophagus by weakening the esophageal lining, making it more susceptible to harm caused by stomach bile acid. This condition affects about 5% of the population nationally-especially those with chronic heartburn, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The findings, published in Nature Communications, combined family studies, laboratory experiments and genetically engineered mouse models to identify and understand how genetic defects contribute to disease development. The team sequenced and analyzed genetic material of 684 people from 302 families where multiple members developed Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer. We found that this gene acts like a quality control system for the esophageal lining. When researchers genetically engineered mice with human-equivalent VSIG10L mutations, they found that the esophageal lining became disrupted structurally and molecularly, according to Guda, also a member of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Digestive Health Research Institute. These genetically engineered mice also represent the first animal model for Barrett's esophagus based directly on human genetic predisposition to the disease, Guda said. With VSIG10L shown to be a key gene in maintaining esophageal health, family members can now be screened for genetic variants to identify those at a high-risk of developing Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer. Case Western Reserve has been a global leader in research on gastrointestinal oncology, with a long-standing history of clinically impactful discoveries on the genetic causes of colorectal and gastroesophageal cancers. The university was also the first to identify a genetic predisposition to Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. If left untreated, these cancers can spread to other parts of the body. "Knowledge gained from studying such familial aspects of disease will enable us to rapidly translate these findings into the clinic," Guda said. "We can now conduct early screenings and develop preventative strategies before the disease develops, ultimately restoring patients' quality of life and curtailing cancer deaths. In addition to enabling a deeper understanding on the molecular basis of Barrett's esophagus, our findings have important implications in other tissue and disease contexts where VSIG10L is relevant". VSIG10L is a major determinant of esophageal homeostasis and inherited predisposition to Barrett's esophagus.

The study, published Feb. 6 in JAMA Health Forum, provides one of the most detailed examinations to date of PBM competition within states. Based on a federal antitrust index, the authors find: The spending package passed by Congress earlier this week includes new restrictions on industry practices, and states have been increasing regulation of PBMs in recent years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By analyzing tens of thousands of metagenomes, the team found that while most microbes adapt to a specific ecosystem, a rarer subset known as 'generalists' can thrive across very different habitats. Known for being ecologically tolerant, generalists are capable of moving from habitat to habitat, interacting with and transferring their genes to other microbes, creating what the team describe as an interconnected, planet-wide network of microbiomes. Up until now, most large-scale microbiome studies have been on a specific ecosystem basis, due to the technical and logistical constraints that a global analysis poses. The recent development of databases like SPIRE (Searchable, Planetary-scale mIcrobiome REsource) by scientists at EMBL and their international partners has made planet-wide studies more feasible. As a publicly available database, SPIRE integrates, processes, and annotates microbial data from diverse habitats all over the world. Using 85,604 metagenomic samples from the SPIRE database, EMBL researchers were able to pinpoint 40 distinct microbial habitat types. Using curated contextual metadata from our Metalog database, we then determined what the microbiomes within a cluster have in common, such as host age or ocean temperature." Daniel Podlesny, Research Scientist at EMBL and co-first author on the paper Depending on how they adapt to their environment, scientists broadly classify microbes as either specialists or generalists. As the name implies, specialists can only cope with specific environmental conditions, whereas generalists are capable of thriving in a wide range of habitats. As generalists move across ecosystems, they laterally transfer their genes to other microbes that they come in contact with, in a process known as horizontal gene transfer. Through this exchange of genetic information, generalists create 'bridges' between geographically distant habitats – and therefore microbiomes – that would otherwise not exist. "Even disparate habitats, with fundamentally different physiochemical conditions, are connected by generalist species," said Jonas Schiller, Predoctoral Fellow in the Bork Group and co-first author on the study. Certain human-driven activities, including sewage disposal and anthropogenic climate change, accelerate the dispersal of generalists by creating new and faster routes for microbes to move between. Further compounding this issue is a surge in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which leads to generalists evolving antimicrobial resistance genes. According to the World Health Organisation, antimicrobial resistance is one of the top ten global public health threats, claiming more lives every year than malaria and HIV/AIDS combined. "Our findings show that such microbes play an important role in linking human, animal, and environmental health – also known as One Health – emphasising the need to view planetary health beyond a purely human-centred perspective," said Chan Yeong Kim, Postdoctoral Fellow in the Bork Group and co-first author on the study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across Europe, clinicians and researchers are increasingly asking whether targeted dietary interventions might help patients whose depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric disorders have not responded to conventional care. This question sits at the heart of nutritional psychiatry, a field that examines how diet, nutrients, and the gut-brain axis influence mood, cognition, and behavior. While some clinicians are building specialized services around nutritional psychiatry, others caution against overselling diet as a stand-alone solution. The result is a field in rapid evolution, marked by promise, skepticism, and an unresolved question about how nutrition should ultimately be integrated into routine psychiatric care. Psychiatrist Sabrina Garcia, MD, PhD, heads one of Europe's first outpatient clinics dedicated to nutritional psychiatry and psychosomatics at the Medical University of Graz in Graz, Austria. For Garcia, the connection between nutrition and mental health is inseparable from the brain-gut axis — an area she believes is still underappreciated in psychiatric training. “During my training in psychiatry, I learned a largely symptom-oriented model,” she told Medscape News Europe. When her department began discussing new clinical priorities 2 years ago, Garcia proposed creating a nutritional psychiatry clinic. The clinic primarily receives patients referred by psychiatrists after multiple treatments have failed. “These are patients who have tried several antidepressants and even electroconvulsive therapy,” Garcia said. Patients undergo blood tests to identify nutrient deficiencies and receive behavioral therapy alongside standard psychiatric care. Medication is prescribed when necessary, but Garcia emphasizes identifying underlying metabolic or nutritional contributors rather than managing symptoms alone. Patients typically remain in care for about a year, the period she says is needed to support sustained behavioral change. “When patients come to see us, they usually have been nutrient deficient for a long time,” she said. Internationally, the scientific case for nutritional psychiatry has been shaped in large part by research led by Felice Jacka, PhD, professor of nutritional psychiatry and founder of the Food & Mood Centre at Deakin University in Australia. Jacka has been involved in multiple studies examining the relationship between diet quality and mental health outcomes. In 2017, she led a randomized controlled trial designed to directly test whether improving diet could improve mental health. The study found that dietary improvements were associated with a substantial reduction in depressive symptoms. “Food remains a low-risk, accessible, and modifiable driver of mental health,” Jacka told Medscape News Europe. “With one third of patients experiencing treatment resistance, dietary approaches offer additional, scalable tools.” Ted Dinan, PhD, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University College Cork in Cork, Ireland, said nutritional psychiatry is particularly relevant for mood disorders but should not be viewed as a replacement for established therapies. Dinan is skeptical of dedicated nutritional psychiatry clinics, warning that they may foster unrealistic expectations. He added that nutrition has so far had limited impact on everyday psychiatric practice, except in managing weight gain associated with antipsychotic use. Ulrike Gisch, PhD, professor of nutritional psychology at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Giessen, Germany, agrees that the field must continue to develop, but she stresses the importance of a bidirectional perspective. “Many psychiatric disorders are associated with impaired daily functioning,” she told Medscape News Europe. “This can lead to changes in shopping, cooking, and eating routines. For example, severe anxiety may cause patients to avoid leaving their homes, significantly limiting food availability.” In her own psychotherapeutic practice, Gisch routinely advises primary care physicians to check for deficiencies such as iron or vitamin D, or for thyroid dysfunction, in patients with depressive symptoms. Nutrition, she said, is a modifiable factor that deserves greater attention across medical, psychotherapeutic, and dietetic settings. Back in Graz, Garcia sees this broader integration as essential to the field's future. She hopes nutritional psychiatry will become part of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education across Europe. “This is what we want to address in the coming years. We aim to become better doctors for our patients every day.” Sophie Cousins, MIPH, is a global health journalist who has reported from more than 20 countries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI tools promise faster, cheaper manuscript editing for global researchers, but new evidence shows they may introduce hidden risks that could reshape equity in scientific publishing. Study: Does ChatGPT enhance equity for global health publications? Copyediting by ChatGPT compared to Grammarly and a human editor. A recent PLOS ONE study, based on a small, preliminary case comparison, evaluated the copyediting quality of U-M GPT, Grammarly, and a human editor on two draft research papers. ChatGPT made three times as many corrections as a human editor but was less precise, raising questions about whether artificial intelligence (AI) can truly enhance equity in academic publishing and under what conditions it may help or hinder researchers. English dominates academic publishing, yet most researchers worldwide speak it as a second language. Non-native English speakers spend up to 51% more time writing papers than native speakers, yet still face rejection due to grammar issues. Professional editing could help, but it is prohibitively expensive. Often, professional editing services can cost nearly half an early-career researcher's annual salary in countries like Colombia. This could be why researchers from non-English-speaking countries remain severely underrepresented in the academic literature and why language has been described as a structural source of power imbalance in global science. AI tools have been perceived to bridge this disparity. Although basic grammar checkers, including Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and Grammarly, have been available for years, large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer new possibilities for more sophisticated editing support. However, it is imperative to assess the efficacy and accuracy of these models, as well as the new barriers they may introduce, including technical skill requirements and ethical concerns. Early research yielded mixed results: one study found that ChatGPT provided helpful grammar corrections for non-native English writers, while another contradicted this, with some authors reporting that AI edits sometimes “over-polish” writing without improving clarity. It compared corrections made by U-M GPT, a secure, University of Michigan-hosted generative AI tool, with those made by Grammarly and a human copyeditor on draft manuscripts written by Ugandan sexual and reproductive health researchers. Two Ugandan researchers provided written approval for the use of their draft manuscripts on reproductive health. Both papers were later published in peer-reviewed journals. The key copyediting goal was to help Ugandan researchers get accepted for peer review. The authors evaluated the introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of both papers, as well as selected tables. In total, only eight paragraphs and two tables were analyzed, and a single comprehensive prompt was used to test real-world feasibility. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify potential limitations of this approach. The free web-based version of Grammarly was used, which does not sell user data and restricts access to uploaded text to users only. Texts were submitted to U-M GPT one paragraph or table at a time, and the corrections generated were analyzed. They noted that U-M GPT sometimes removed key information, such as references, which they tracked separately because these deletions posed risks to meaning and accuracy. The authors also acknowledged that classification of edits was performed by an internal research team, which may have unintentionally introduced bias in the assessment of edit quality. In contrast, U-M GPT generated corrections nearly instantaneously. However, creating a track changes document for each paper with U-M GPT required approximately 30 minutes. Grammarly also generated corrections within seconds, prompting users to accept or reject changes one at a time, a process that took approximately 5 minutes. Only the human copyeditor could correct both text and tables. For instance, Grammarly corrected only spelling and grammar, while U-M GPT flagged errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, spacing, and capitalization. In contrast, the human editor corrected grammar, punctuation, spacing, and capitalization, and flagged unclear text rather than attempting to rewrite passages whose meaning was ambiguous, allowing authors to clarify intent themselves. Of its 83 revisions, only 61% actually improved the text, while 14% made it worse and 24% had no effect. Grammarly made just five readability corrections, two provided improvements, and three had no real impact. U-M GPT also deleted important content from one paper, including citations and a table reference, raising concerns that authors, particularly those less confident in English writing, might accept harmful edits uncritically. The current study highlighted a fundamental difficulty in using AI for academic editing, particularly regarding quality. While U-M GPT generated three times more corrections than a human editor, only 61% actually improved the text. Even though this technology is fast and inexpensive, it introduces risks of deleting key information, making questionable revisions, and potentially blocking content. The promise of AI-enhanced equity in academic publishing remains uncertain. As these tools evolve, researchers need larger studies across diverse manuscript types to understand when AI editing helps and when it hinders. For now, authors using AI editing tools should proceed with caution, because the goal is not rapid editing but access to editing that genuinely improves research communication while preserving author voice, meaning, and scholarly independence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Synthace, the leader in software and services for assay development, today announced a collaboration with Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (Charles River), a leading global drug discovery, development, testing, and manufacturing solutions provider. Under the collaboration, Charles River will give its clients access to Synthace's transformative approach to developing, automating and transferring more robust assays, faster and more efficiently than using other methodologies. Reproducing experiments across different sites has long been a significant challenge for biology research and development teams, with 72 % of researchers acknowledging a reproducibility crisis.1,2 With such a challenge estimated to cost $100 billion annually in preclinical research alone, the collaboration between Synthace and Charles River has the potential to improve reproducibility through a new approach to assay development. In addition, while the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) can help accelerate areas such as target identification, this adds to the volume of demands that must still be validated through wet lab experiments, contributing to delays. Many Research and Development (R&D) teams use one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approaches to develop assays, yet this method is time consuming and limited in scope. To combat this, Synthace enabled Charles River to derisk its assay development and transfer through a combination of Design of Experiments (DoE), automation and software. This was significant because, while having clear benefits, DoE has traditionally been considered a complex, resource-intensive process with a high barrier to adoption. With Synthace's technology integrated into Charles River's lab automation, teams were able to implement high-throughput DoE across multiple locations and a diverse user base, achieving: Computational biology has taken a significant leap forward with AI, but in doing so, the lab risks being left behind. Combining DoE, automation and software is the answer, as together they deliver a step-change in experimental power to unpick biological complexity. We call this High Dimensional Experimentation, and it will be the next generation of experiments for drug discovery." Dr Rob Howes, Senior Director of Small Molecule Discovery at Charles River, said: "Synthace allows us to conduct more technically demanding experiments with greater scientific rigour. In doing so, we're dramatically reducing the amount of time we need to develop robust assays and ultimately speeding up this critical part of drug discovery."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On a simple math task - indicating which of two amounts is greater - kids with math learning disability get the right answer as often as their good-at-math peers, but behind the scenes, their brains are working differently, a new Stanford Medicine study has found. The differences shed light on what causes their math struggles. The findings, which will be published online Feb. 9 in the Journal of Neuroscience, show that children with a math learning disability are less likely to solve problems at the right speed, or to slow down after they make mistakes, particularly while working with number symbols. Their brain scans show different levels of activity in centers involved in executive function - which is similar to air traffic control, enabling focused attention - and checking for errors. Our findings suggest that interventions should target not only basic number sense, but also metacognitive processes, like performance monitoring - how do you adjust when you notice an error? While having their brains scanned via functional magnetic resonance imaging, kids in the study answered problems that were posed in two ways: They compared different-sized groups of dots, and compared Arabic numerals. In other words, kids with math learning disability are less likely to adjust after making mistakes, she said. The study focused on children in second and third grades. Of the 87 children whose data was analyzed, 34 had math learning disability, meaning they scored at or below the 25th percentile on a standard test of math fluency; the other 53 children had higher scores indicating typical math-learning ability. Math learning disability can be defined in different ways. The criteria used in this study - placing in the bottom quarter of scores on a standard test - is fairly broad, which was intentional, Menon said, as it helps make the findings applicable to many children who struggle with math. Some people, about 3% to 7% of the population, have a more strictly defined form of math learning disability called dyscalculia that includes difficulties understanding and comparing quantities, learning to count, understanding number symbols and learning math-based skills such as telling time. Identifying students with math learning disabilities early and offering prompt, effective help is important for keeping their education on track, Menon said. While in the MRI scanner, children saw pairs of quantities and pressed a button to indicate which of each pair was larger. Although children with and without math learning disability had similar rates of correct answers, data from their responses and brain scans revealed differences between the two groups. The researchers developed a computational model to assess factors such as how cautious participants were about deciding which number was larger, on both easy and hard problems, and how readily participants detected their own mistakes and slowed down or changed strategies for the next problem after making an error. (Participants were not told if they had made a mistake.) Those with math learning disability were also less likely to slow down or change their behavior after they made an error than children with typical math ability. However, for problems presented as groups of dots, children with math learning disability were actually more cautious after making an error. "Many of these kids - unless their disability is severe - have normal representation of non-symbolic quantities, so they can tell five from 10 dots quite easily, but when you ask them to reason with and manipulate number symbols, they become deficient," Menon said. Brain scans revealed patterns that lined up with these behaviors. "Seeing weaker function in kids with math learning disability in those brain regions - which are known to be involved in executive function and error monitoring - suggests that they may be using those brain resources less than is necessary to solve these problems efficiently," Chang said. The findings could help educators craft ways to help struggling students become better at math as well as other types of problem-solving. "One of our surprising findings is that even in the absence of an overt difference in the kids' behavior, we could pick up strong signals about what their brains are doing behind the scenes," Menon said. "It gives us insight that how we reason - how we think about problems and adjust our problem-solving behavior - is just as important as having a core domain of knowledge." Chang, H., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They form when polymer chains containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments organize into nanoscale spheres in liquid solutions; these structures can trap and hold drugs that are otherwise difficult to dissolve. This temperature-dependent gelling behavior allows P407 to slowly release loaded drugs over time, thus reducing dosing frequency and their side effects. Despite extensive laboratory research, scientists have struggled to fully understand P407's sol–gel transition. However, most existing knowledge is based on experiments in pure water, which is far simpler than the liquid environments found in the human body. On top of this, existing theoretical models rely on assumptions that do not work well for polymer micelles, leaving key inter-micellar forces unclear and difficult to predict in laboratory saline solutions that mimic bodily fluids. To tackle these knowledge gaps, a research team led by Associate Professor Takeshi Morita from the Graduate School of Science, Chiba University, Japan, conducted an in-depth experimental study on how P407 micelles interact in a saline environment. Rather than assuming anything about how micelles should behave, the researchers used experimental data to quantify their interactions under conditions that closely resemble those inside the body. First, small-angle X-ray scattering was used to probe how micelles are positioned relative to one another over nanoscale distances, revealing collective structural patterns. Then, they used dynamic light scattering to measure the sizes and motion of individual polymer chains, micelles, and larger aggregates by tracking fluctuations in scattered light. By integrating these datasets, the researchers calculated the 'pair interaction potential,' a quantitative description of how strongly two micelles attract or repel each other depending on their separation. They found that as the temperature increased toward gel formation, micelles became more regularly spaced, moving slightly farther apart yet still remaining connected. This behavior is consistent with an entropy-driven process known as the Alder transition, in which particles crystallize because an ordered arrangement allows more freedom for small thermal motions. This stronger attraction limited how far micelles could separate, producing a gel with more structural fluctuations and less uniform order. The team demonstrated that these differences had marked effects on gel stability. Gels formed in saline broke down at lower temperatures than those formed in water, suggesting that structural fluctuations weaken the gel as temperature rises and make it collapse sooner. "With this improved understanding of inter-micellar interactions that govern drug nanocarrier properties, it will be possible to elucidate and predict the fundamental mechanisms of sustained drug release behavior and gelation in environments closer to bodily conditions," states Dr. Morita. The findings of this study have important implications for drug delivery research. Polymer micelles like P407 are widely studied as promising carriers for novel drugs, including many modern anticancer and anti-inflammatory compounds. Understanding how salts and ions affect micelle interactions could help researchers design formulations that release drugs more predictably and remain stable at body temperature. Beyond the specific micellar system of P407, this work demonstrates how experimentally grounded approaches can clarify interactions and physical mechanisms in complex soft materials-an essential step toward translating nanoscience into practical applications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cornell researchers have discovered a new way cells regulate how they respond to stress, identifying an interaction between two proteins that helps keep a critical cellular recycling system in balance. The findings show that a protein called SHKBP1 regulates another protein, p62, which plays a key role in clearing damaged cell components and activating antioxidant defenses. By helping maintain this balance, SHKBP1 allows cells to respond appropriately to stress – a process that can break down in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. "Our cells are constantly dealing with stresses, whether from normal metabolism or specific insults from the environment," Baskin said. "A protein called p62 is a central player in this recycling operation, as it gathers damaged proteins into compartments called 'p62 bodies' where they can be dealt with." However, the key challenge for p62 is a Goldilocks problem, he said. With too little activity, toxic proteins can accumulate, which is seen in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. With too much p62 activity, the system becomes overactive, which happens in many cancers, as cancer cells use the output of this recycling process to fuel tumor growth. Using a combination of advanced biochemical and imaging techniques, the team sought to view how the two proteins interact inside living cells. What we found was that SHKBP1 binds directly to a portion of p62 that normally allows it to aggregate into large clusters, so SHKBP1 binding physically prevented p62 molecules from clustering together into large bodies. Under normal conditions, this system is balanced, but when cells experience stress, it switches on a protective response that helps limit cellular damage. p62 plays an important role in this process by helping remove a protein that suppresses the antioxidant response. The new study shows that SHKBP1 influences this system indirectly, by controlling how p62 behaves, helping determine how strongly the protective response is activated. Cancer cells often hijack this pathway to survive chemotherapy, while neurons in neurodegenerative diseases may fail to activate it when needed most. "Understanding how SHKBP1 influences this balance could open new therapeutic avenues," he said. "If loss of SHKBP1 function naturally boosts the Nrf2 response, perhaps we could develop drugs that safely inhibit SHKBP1 in the brain to provide neuroprotection."

Men found significant barriers in accessing TRT through formal medical channels, including bureaucratic delays, financial costs, and stigma. Despite access challenges, TRT was widely described as transformative, with reported improvements in both physical and mental health." Ben Bonenti, PhD Candidate, Griffith University's School of Applied Psychology The study tracked nine men, aged 18 years or older, who used TRT and documented their experiences via videoconferencing interviews. The results raised many key issues, particularly for men who frequently described self-regulating dosages, with some even mixing prescribed testosterone with underground products to manage access gaps. These practices reflected active, self-managed care rather than passive medical compliance. "While TRT was framed as a medical treatment, participants' experiences showed access and use were strongly shaped by social, financial and regulatory constraints," Mr Bonenti said. "The findings suggest the current models of TRT may not align with how men actually engage with testosterone use.
