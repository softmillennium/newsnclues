                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Porto and Spain striker Samu Aghehowa is set to miss the 2026 World Cup after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Aghehowa, 21, was replaced at half time during Monday's Primeira Liga fixture against Sporting CP and assessments have revealed an ACL injury to his right knee. He is also expected to miss the 2026 World Cup, which begins on June 11. Spain have been drawn alongside Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay in Group H at the tournament. Aghehowa has made four appearances for Spain's senior team since his debut in November 2024. Aghehowa has scored 20 goals in 32 appearances for Porto this season. Newcastle United also considered a move for him in the summer of 2025. Real Sociedad's Mikel Oyarzabal was predominantly selected as Spain's starting striker throughout their 2025 Nations League campaign and World Cup qualifiers. Guillermo began his career covering Real Madrid and the sports industry for Diario AS. He has since returned to Madrid and joins us at The Athletic where he will deliver Real Madrid news, interviews, stories, and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Banks has become a regular starter this season for Augsburg, despite only recently turning 19. The defender was born in Hawaii to an American father and German-Spanish mother. After moving to Washington, D.C., Banks relocated to Germany with his mother when he was "4 or 5 (years old)," he told reporters during a roundtable on Tuesday, Feb. 10. He has frequently visited the U.S. to keep up with his father and other relatives. And then also at the U-19 and U-20 level, I was always just very happy to get into camp to see my friends again, because we were like a big class of friends. "It was not like, 'I'm going to the national team to play football,' it was like, 'I'm meeting my friends and playing football with them.' After he made his first appearance in a USMNT camp in September, Banks said he's been in touch with national team staff regularly — though not necessarily head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is known to not contact many players outside of international windows. If he is to make a late charge toward a World Cup spot, Banks will likely need to earn a call-up for March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal — the team's last two games before Pochettino names his World Cup squad. Even with a chance to appear at a World Cup on home soil, Banks insisted that he's not thinking about the tournament right now — or even the March window. "I think it's not the right moment to think about the World Cup, because we have a lot of games left here, and we want to win those games because we have goals for the season," he said. Banks also said his mind is only on the USMNT for now, though he wouldn't fully rule out a future switch to Germany. "I have been in touch with Germany before to be honest," he said. He added: "But yeah, I can't tell what's in the future."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shakira was spending the holidays at her farm in Uruguay, across a vast ocean from South Africa, host country of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, when she conceived “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa).” Already a global phenom known for her vocals and dance moves, the Colombian star had quickly gone to work when presented with the opportunity to write a song for the upcoming soccer tournament, and she soon turned a track around that fused genres, languages and multinational beats with abandon. 50 Cent Mocks Stefon Diggs Amid Cardi B Split Rumors ': Watch Miley Cyrus Team Up With Elmo & Co. in New 'Sesame Street' Trailer Travis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Pokes Fun at His Relationship With Taylor Swift in Super Bowl Ad “Waka Waka,” produced by Shakira with John Hill, was already catchy — but it became even more so after a fortuitous encounter in a New York studio between Hill and South African pop fusion group Freshly-ground, which then contributed to the song, adding a musical element that honored the host nation. “Shakira moved swiftly from interest to creation, writing and recording a track that stood apart from the musical landscape at the time,” recalls Dusko Justic, senior vp of international artist strategy and development for Sony Latin Iberia, who at the time was responsible for the A&R and marketing for the official FIFA World Cup music program. “Once FIFA heard the finished record, there was no debate.” For nearly four decades, FIFA has partnered with prominent musicians to craft songs that celebrate the World Cup and its competing nations. “Waka Waka,” the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, remains the most successful World Cup song in history and a global juggernaut; its video has been viewed a staggering 4.4 billion times on YouTube, making it the platform's eighth most viewed music video of all time. A decade after its release, Shakira would perform the enduring hit at another globally watched sporting event: the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, where it ended her co-headlining set with Jennifer Lopez. “Waka Waka” had all the elements that make for a successful and enduring World Cup song: a danceable, uptempo beat to resonate with audiences around the world (the song samples “Zamina Mina [Zangaléwa],” by Cameroonian band Golden Sounds), an artist with global appeal and reach, and a featured artist representing the host nation. And significantly, she was already a genuine soccer aficionado; the song's music video not only incorporated her signature dance moves but also major soccer stars from Lionel Messi to Gerard Piqué, who became Shakira's longtime partner and the father of her two sons after meeting her at the video shoot. It's unclear when FIFA became actively involved in the song's selection (the organization did not respond to Billboard's requests for comment), though multiple reports cite Italian composer Giorgio Moroder's “To Be Number One,” recorded for the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Since then, every tournament has had an official song, anthem or — for the past several World Cups — both. Some of them have been performed at the closing ceremony (as was the case with “Live It Up,” performed by Nicky Jam, Will Smith and Era Istrefi in 2018) and some at the opening ceremony (like 2014's “We Are One [Ole Ola],” performed in Brazil by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Brazilian artist Claudia Leitte). “The Cup of Life,” with its mix of brash trumpets and Brazilian batucada, was a global hit, peaking at No. It was so successful, in fact, that when Martin earned a 1999 Grammy nomination for best Latin pop performance for his Spanish-language album Vuelve (which included “The Cup of Life”), Mottola pushed hard to have him on the show, over the Recording Academy's objections. “There would probably be no Bad Bunny without this.” But while that platform “100% provides value” to any music release, Mottola says, it doesn't guarantee huge, or lasting, commercial success. Sony Music — which was FIFA's official label partner for many years until 2019 — released “The Cup of Life” and “Waka Waka,” and in their wake, the importance of music as a promotional vehicle during the World Cup soared. What was once one “official” song became many, with tournament sponsors, broadcasters and individual countries commissioning original tracks. And while a hit is not something you simply dictate … it helps when there is a single song that's played everywhere you go.” But, Verde continues bluntly, “you need a real hit. In 2021, FIFA launched its FIFA Sound strategy, meant to connect soccer and music fans, and partnered with Universal Music Group for a series of releases and initiatives that included the first-ever multisong FIFA World Cup official soundtrack for the 2022 event in Qatar. From that soundtrack, “Arhbo,” performed by Ozuna with Congolese French rapper and singer–songwriter GIMS and produced by RedOne, topped Billboard's Latin Airplay chart for three weeks in 2022. At press time, FIFA had yet to announce an official tournament song or anthem for this year's event, which will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. But official FIFA songs already include Robbie Williams' “Desire” (penned for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup), while last year Telemundo premiered its own official song, “Somos Más,” performed by Carlos Vives, Xavi, Wisin and Emilia. There have been notable World Cup songs through the years. 59 on the Hot 100; as of Jan. 22, it has 146.5 million on-demand official streams, according to Luminate. And K'Naan's “Wavin' Flag” from 2010 was chosen by Coca-Cola as its official song for the tournament, garnering 161.6 million on-demand streams in the United States and reaching No. I think music is the best vehicle for moments of extreme emotion, like a World Cup can be.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

On 9 December 2022 in Qatar, Croatia took on football powerhouse Brazil in a thrilling World Cup quarter-final. Croatia came back from a goal down in extra time to eventually win 4-2 on penalties. The match drew extraordinary online attention through a live stream on the Brazilian YouTube channel CazéTV, run by popular streamer Casimiro, which is the most popular source to watch games online in South America. The stream peaked at approximately 6.1 to 6.15 million concurrent viewers, with some reports citing even higher figures. CazéTV: 6.1 million (2022 World Cup QF – Brazil vs Croatia)3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's because there's a really good chance you were one of the hundreds of thousands, and maybe even millions, who have received bad news in your email inbox over the past few days. “Unfortunately, your application was not successful, and no tickets have been allocated for purchase. FIFA recently announced that more than 500 million ticket requests were submitted during the random selection draw, which ran for 33 days in December and January. On top of that, it's not a stretch to think that a lopsided amount of those requests went toward matches at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Not only will North Texas host nine World Cup matches, more than any other North American host city, but global soccer powers England and Argentina are among the national teams that are scheduled to play in Jerryworld. Although all-time great Lionel Messi has yet to confirm he will take part in this year's tournament, you can bet untold scores of people opted to take their chances and request tickets to one of the two matches the defending World Cup champions will play in Arlington. This isn't the first year that FIFA has used a lottery system for tickets, but the global soccer governing body has reported “unprecedented demand” for 2026 World Cup tickets, which means that getting tickets directly through FIFA before they hit the secondary markets was always going to be tough sledding. Many readers may feel we're burying the lede here, however. Headlines and complaints regarding ticket prices have arguably been the most prominent World Cup storyline thus far, aside from perhaps the draw and schedule announcements. When we took our shot in the random selection draw, tickets ranged from around $200 to over $700 for the AT&T Stadium group stage matches. In response to complaints about pricing from around the world, FIFA did allocate a limited number of $60 tickets to every match, although those tickets will be allocated to and distributed by national federations like CONCACAF (North America, the Caribbean) and UEFA (Europe), instead of being sold to the public at large. If you're one of the many who have just accepted that you'll go without spending any money on the next couple of summer vacations and Christmases, that random draw email had some rays of hope under the bad news. There will still be ways to get verified World Cup tickets directly from FIFA. Fans can get in on the “last-minute sales phase” for tickets by registering now. According to FIFA, this phase will begin in April and, unlike recent phases, will be first-come, first-served, although tickets available in this phase are likely to be extremely limited. If lotteries, phases, waiting and hoping are all too much for you, there is a way to get World Cup tickets in your hands right now. Secondary market ticket-selling websites like SeatGeek now offer many options, including tickets to the June 17 England vs. Croatia match at AT&T Stadium starting around $950. But buyer beware: although your money may be guaranteed by the seller or your credit card company, counterfeit World Cup tickets have a long, troublesome history. FIFA, as one might guess, has its own resale marketplace for verified tickets. For that same June 17 match, the cheapest ticket available through FIFA's resale/exchange market is $1,045 before fees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major update is expected Tuesday on Boston's World Cup matches. The town of Foxboro, Massachusetts is fighting for funding to cover security this summer. You can watch it live at 1:30 p.m. on CBS News Boston in the embedded video. The first game will be between Scotland and Haiti on June 13. Town officials want to know who is fronting the $7.8 million bill for security costs in Foxboro. Massachusetts is eligible for $46 million in federal grants for World Cup security and preparedness, but a recent state report called the grant program process "unusual" because the state has limited control in how that money can be distributed and when. The Boston Globe reported Monday Foxboro was supposed to learn on January 30 about its grant request. In statement Tuesday, a town spokesperson told WBZ-TV "hosting an event of this scale creates significant public safety, operational, and infrastructure demands" on Foxboro. "The Town has spent many months working with event organizers and public safety professionals to carefully identify the resources required to safely host these matches. We believe it is reasonable and appropriate that FIFA and/or event partners provide the funding necessary to support the public safety and operational requirements that come with hosting these matches."</p>

As Liam Rosenior settles into his new role as the Chelsea coach, putting his own stamp on the team he inherited will be a long-term project rather than a short-term one. His challenges are similar to those many midseason hires have faced before him, though there is one unique element he is still battling -- the lingering impact of the Blues' Club World Cup-winning run last summer. The Blues' schedule has been jam-packed since the start of the 2024-25 campaign with few breaks in between – they won the Conference League in Poland on May 28 and then opened their Club World Cup campaign in Atlanta on June 16, played seven games as they won the title on July 13 in the New York City suburbs and were back in London on August 17 to start a new season. Though their successful trip to the U.S. took place six months before Rosenior took charge at Chelsea, he admitted that the tournament's impact is still being felt. "You have to try to freshen up the team mentally and physically," he said on Monday ahead of their match against Leeds United, detailing further that he has to be mindful about rotating through his squad as a result. It is something Rosenior has mentioned on a handful of occasions in the early weeks of his Chelsea tenure, most notably in the Blues' 1-0 defeat at Arsenal in the second leg of the EFL Cup semifinals last week. Cole Palmer was named amongst the substitutes that day in an attempt to manage the player's minutes during an injury-plagued season, especially as the team's priority switches to finishing in a UEFA Champions League berth. The Blues sit fairly comfortably in fifth place with a four point cushion over sixth place Liverpool, while Rosenior has the benefit of a squad that is near full fitness for their clash against Leeds, who will be eager to pick up a favorable result in the hopes of widening their six point gap from the relegation zone. Reece James, who missed Saturday's win against Wolverhampton Wanderers with a small fitness issue, might miss Tuesday's match through illness while Chelsea's other mainstays are available. He admits they are still a work in progress, though, and that they even had room for improvement as they cruised to a 3-0 advantage at Wolves before the halftime break. "When you're the level of player I get to work with here, the reason they are top and elite is because they make great decisions in the moment," Rosenior said. But if you do not have the right structure behind that you can become really open in transition. I felt against Wolves there were some really pleasing aspects in our rotations. In the second half we didn't stay true to our structure. "We've had a few conversations about that in recent days." A high-intensity approach is almost in conflict with Chelsea's fixture congestion realities, finding the sweet spot admittedly serving as Rosenior's most notable challenge as he looks to make the Blues his own. He believes, though, that players are getting used to the demands of a very intense workload. "If I'm being honest, these lads are fantastic professionals - they live for their job which is so important," Rosenior said. There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not many other Serie A players can compare to U.S. men's national team star Weston McKennie right now. The Juventus midfielder has simply been that good in the last four months and continued to show it with a goal in Sunday's 2–2 draw against Lazio. Suddenly, McKennie has gone from a player on an expiring contract that the Bianconeri did not seem interested in renewing to one of their most essential pieces in a dramatic turnaround. Against Lazio, his goal sparked a comeback to secure a valuable point, even though the Turin-based side were by far the better team, outshooting their opponents 34–9. Juventus fought back from a 2–0 deficit after Pedro and Gustav Isaksen scored on the bookends of halftime. McKennie's goal came in the 59th minute, as he headed home a cross from Andrea Cambiaso in a fervent spell of attacking pressure. That marker turned the tide, leading to Pierre Kalulu's equalizer in second-half stoppage time. Outside of the goal, McKennie had five shots and completed 28 of his 33 attempted passes as he helped Juventus maintain fourth place in Serie A, holding a three-point buffer on the final Champions League spot, ahead of Roma. In just over a month, he will likely return to the USMNT fold under manager Mauricio Pochettino and his newfound versatility and confidence could be key in friendlies against Belgium and Portugal, leading into the World Cup this summer. While Gianluca Busio may not be exceptionally young at 23, his potential with the USMNT is still an enigma. This week, he was once again omnipresent, creating three chances through the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 win over Frosinone, who sit second in the table. Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, a dual-national prospect has caught some headlines. Rokas Pukštas, who has played for U.S. youth teams, scored his fifth goal of the season for Croatian giants Hajduk Split, lifting them to a 2–0 win over NK Slaven Belupo and keeping them within five points of league-leading Dinamo Zagreb. A product of the Sporting Kansas City academy, Pukštas has not been capped by either Lithuania or the U.S., but has been getting consistent minutes in a solid league and could be a name to watch for the future. Pochettino may have effectively closed the door on new faces to his team for this summer's World Cup, but both Busio and Pukštas could be names when the quadrennial shifts to 2030, potentially even as extra bodies this summer to kickstart that process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Endrick has scored five goals in seven games for Lyon, but was sent off at Nantes on Saturday Even those who do not follow French football in its most granular detail will be aware of the plight that could have befallen Lyon this summer. Constrained by their financial frailties, Les Gones, spearheaded by sporting director Matthieu Louis-Jean, had to work diligently, embarking on an agile recruitment drive. Spotting talent from lesser-known European leagues became a central tenet of their philosophy. "We worked on different markets," outlined the former Nottingham Forest right-back in September. Amid a flurry of moves, Pavel Sulc and Ruben Kluivert arrived on permanent deals from Viktoria Plzen and Casa Pia respectively, while Adam Karabec joined from Sparta Prague on loan. Louis-Jean has cultivated a burgeoning reputation as a strategic operator, but his most innovative market manoeuvre would have to wait until the winter window. Louis-Jean, and Lyon's wider recruitment department, were convinced an opportunity would present itself in January. Having amassed just 99 minutes of action for Real Madrid during the first half of the season, Brazil striker Endrick needed an escape. Lyon were more than happy to provide sanctuary for a player and talisman they desperately craved. Endrick's unveiling video is the most watched of all time on Lyon's Instagram account At a club where strikers are held in such reverence, his impact has been almost divine. Endrick's signing perpetuates a long-held legacy of Brazilians representing the club. Juninho Pernambucano, Cris and Sonny Anderson are just a few to have spent significant portions of their careers with Lyon, each contributing to the club's unprecedented run of seven successive Ligue 1 crowns between 2002 and 2008. "I know there are a lot [of Brazilians] that have played for the club, and many of them have had a fantastic career here," said Endrick during his first interview with French newspaper L'Equipe. Lucas Paqueta and Bruno Guimaraes, Brazil team-mates of Endrick, provided counsel prior to his move. "Before coming, I spoke with Paqueta and Bruno," he said. "They told me it was a place I could be really happy." Personal fulfillment, and a chance "to play football" with this summer's World Cup looming, he says were driving factors in his decision to join. "Obviously it's a dream I have - that won't change. If you don't play well for your club, however, you can't have a chance of playing for Brazil," he added. "We don't have that mobile number nine in the Brazil side," says former Lyon captain Cris. Lyon, and Ligue 1, provide the perfect platform for him to do just that. His contentious sending-off for two yellow cards against Nantes on Saturday, however, following a petulant kick out after some robust challenges against him, provides a timely reminder of the adjustments Endrick needs to make. "When there are players of that calibre, we have to make sure to contain them," said Nantes manager Ahmed Kantari in the aftermath. Herein lies the challenge Endrick will have to confront - at Madrid he was part of a constellation of stars, while here he assumes that mantle almost uniquely. Endrick is the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick for Lyon His arrival video, published on the club's official Instagram account, is the club's most-watched on the platform, while highlights of games against Metz, Lille, Brest and Stade Laval - in which Endrick featured - top their YouTube charts.
