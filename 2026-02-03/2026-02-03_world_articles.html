                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A package of bills aims to combat federal immigration operations, including codifying the city's sanctuary protections. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. At least 15 Philadelphia city councilmembers have backed a package of ”ICE Out” legislation aimed at combating ICE and federal immigration enforcement operations in Philadelphia, including codifying sanctuary protections and prohibiting federal immigration agents from concealing their identities or covering their faces. “Our goal was to make sure that something is in place to prevent any undue harm.” Councilmembers will vote on the legislation in the coming weeks, and it is expected to pass with a veto-proof majority. AMY GOODMAN: As we continue to look at local resistance nationwide against Trump's crackdown, we go to Philadelphia, where a group of at least 15 city councilmembers have backed a package of seven bills aimed at combating federal immigration enforcement operations in Philadelphia, including codifying the city's sanctuary protections. It also requires judge-signed warrants and prohibits city workers from cooperating with ICE. The efforts are being led by Philadelphia City Councilmembers Kendra Brooks, who will join us in a minute, and Rue Landau. In response to the legislation being introduced, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker made one of her first public statements about Trump's immigration raid, saying on social media, quote, “We are aware of the potential challenges that we face, and we understand the public's fear of the unknown, as it relates to federal policy associated with immigration,” unquote. Meanwhile, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has launched a national coalition of prosecutors that would hold federal immigration agents accountable if they're found to have violated state or local laws and civil rights protections. The coalition includes prosecutors in Virginia, Arizona and Texas. Last week, DA Krasner issued this warning to federal immigration agents. LARRY KRASNER: This is a small bunch of wannabe Nazis. In a country of 350 million, we outnumber them. … I, along with a bunch of other state prosecutors, are rallying around Mary Moriarty, who is the prosecutor in Minneapolis. I know for a fact she is working 24/7 to make sure that there is justice coming out of two, what appear to be, by all indications, criminal homicides, and what appears to be, by all indications, a criminal shooting of someone in the leg. I want — I want you to understand that just as you have come together, there are state prosecutors coming together right now to make sure that people understand there will be accountability. There will be accountability after Trump is out of office. If we have to hunt you down the way they hunted down Nazis for decades, we will find your identities. For more, we're joined in Philadelphia by City Councilmember Kendra Brooks, sponsor of the ICE Out legislative package that's being voted on by the Philadelphia City Council. Can you explain exactly what's at the heart of your legislation and how it can be enforced, if in fact you and Rue Landau, the two of you sponsoring this legislation, get it passed? KENDRA BROOKS: Well, we — thank you so much for having me, to start. Councilmember Landau and I worked very closely with DA Larry Krasner and our sheriff's department to make sure this legislation will be able to be enforced once we move it forward. Part of it was just making sure our community members felt safe. So, we started out with a series of community trainings around how to protect yourself against ICE. And over the last couple of months, we've been crafting out this legislation with both local and national legislators and attorneys to make sure that this is something that we can actually implement here in the city of Philadelphia. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Councilwoman, how would these — this package actually work? KENDRA BROOKS: I think the determination on exactly how it will work will be up to the prosecutor, which will be the DA's Office, to determine exactly how that works. But for us, the goal was to get something on the books to codify our existing executive orders, to make sure that community members felt safe and that something was actually being done to protect, you know, our citizens here in Philadelphia, whether it's the number of folks who have experienced ICE agents being [masked] and in unmarked cars coming to the criminal justice center or to schools or to places of employment, or whether it was making sure that we're not participating and sharing data with ICE agents, and also making sure that they're unable to stage raids and attacks on our community in our public spaces, i.e. schools, recreation centers or any places owned by the city. What can the Philly city government do to regulate conditions inside a federal jail? KENDRA BROOKS: I think, well, from my understanding, we have been looking into the — we heard it was two deaths in detention centers here in Pennsylvania, but they aren't actually in Philadelphia. We are working with legislators across the commonwealth to have this discussion, and we have a couple bills that are happening in our state House, as well, around regulations around ICE and detention centers. We've been working very closely with a lot of our immigrant justice organizations in the city and across the commonwealth, and hopefully we'll see something come out of that soon. As we begin to wrap up, can you talk about the significance of this support from the state government, and also perhaps what you want to see more of, and the timing of your ICE Out legislation, when it's going to be voted on? I think, collectively, as a commonwealth, we can work together to protect our citizens across the board. And also, with our ICE Out legislation, we are waiting for it to get put into committee. It should take about four to six, maybe eight weeks before we can get a committee hearing, or maybe sooner. AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you very much for being with us, Philadelphia City Councilmember Kendra Brooks, the minority leader and member of the Working Families Party, as we continue our tour around the country of what cities and states are doing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. A federal judge is blocking the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., finding that statements made by White House officials demonstrate that racial bias played a part in decision-making. In a social media post late last year, for example, Noem said she was recommending travel bans on multiple countries, including Haiti, using abhorrent and bigoted language to describe immigrants from those countries. “I am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies,” Noem said in her tweet, further describing those people as “foreign invaders” who “slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS.” “Plaintiffs charge that Secretary Noem preordained her termination decision and did so because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants. Reyes recognized that Noem “has terminated every TPS country designation to have reached her desk — twelve countries up, twelve countries down.” Despite the department saying otherwise, the DHS head also failed to review the current conditions in Haiti, and to consult with federal agencies that could inform her decision, Reyes said — which Noem is required to do by law under statutes governing TPS changes. Reyes also pointed out that, while Noem claims that Haiti is hospitable enough for immigrants under TPS to return, the U.S. government advises against Americans traveling to the country “for any reason.” That warning “does not exactly scream, as Secretary Noem concluded, suitable for return,” Reyes wrote. Reyes noted in her ruling that President Donald Trump has made numerous racist comments about nonwhite immigrants, including those from Haiti, over the course of his two presidential terms. Noem's decisions about Haitian immigrants over the past year have come in close proximity to some of Trump's comments, the judge said, citing instances in February, June, and December of last year. Reyes also cited previous rulings against removing the TPS designation for Haitians in Trump's first term, showing that judges in those decisions had shown that his first administration was “motivated by the ‘discriminatory purpose of removing nonwhite immigrants from the United States. Taken together, the record strongly suggests that Secretary Noem's decision to terminate Haiti's TPS designation was motivated, at least in part, by racial animus. “Supreme Court, here we come,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said after the ruling was issued, describing Reyes's order as “lawless activism.” “Haiti remains an extraordinarily dangerous place, marked by widespread gang violence, rampant disease, lack of access to clean drinking water, severe housing instability, and the absence of a functioning government,” they said in a statement. Trump's racism toward Haitian immigrants was perhaps most evident during his 2024 presidential campaign, when he peddled incendiary and dehumanizing lies about Haitian residents of Springfield, Ohio. Trump's running mate, and now vice president, JD Vance, seemed to acknowledge that Trump's racist tirade was a lie — but stated that he didn't care if the claims were false as long as they advanced his anti-immigrant agenda.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A US aircraft carrier shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively approached” the ship in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday hours before two gunboats operated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and threatened to board and seize the ship, according to a US military spokesman. The two incidents occurred days before US and Iranian officials are due to meet Friday for diplomatic negotiations meant to avert a military clash. In the first incident on Tuesday, US forces shot down an Iranian drone “as the unmanned aircraft aggressively approached” the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which was transiting the Arabian Sea about 500 miles from Iran's southern coast, said Capt. Tim Hawkins, a US Central Command spokesman. “The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters,” Hawkins said. “No American service members were harmed during the incident, and no U.S. equipment was damaged,” Hawkins said. Hours later, two Iranian gunboats approached the M/V Stena Imperative — a chemical tanker operated by Americans flying under the US flag in the Strait of Hormuz — passing the ship three times at high speeds as an Iranian Mohajer drone also flew overhead, said Hawkins. During one of their passes, the Iranians threatened via radio call that they would board and seize the tanker. The tanker was in international waters, Hawkins said. US military forces operating in the area responded when they learned of the Iranian threats. The situation de-escalated as a result. Hawkins said the Iranian behavior was an example of the Iranians' “unprofessionalism and aggressive behavior” that increases the risk of miscalculation for vessels operating in the area and said their “harassment” in international waters won't be tolerated by the US. The incidents come as President Donald Trump has been weighing a major strike on Iran amid stalled discussions about limiting that nation's nuclear program and ballistic missile production. In the last week the US military has accelerated a buildup of military hardware in the Middle East, deploying the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to the region along with three guided-missile destroyers and the carrier air wing, which includes squadrons of F/A-18E Super Hornet fighters, F-35C Lightning II fighters, and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets.</p>

The incidents come as President Donald Trump has been weighing a major strike on Iran amid discussions about limiting that nation's nuclear program and ballistic missile production. Talks between the US and Iran planned for later this week hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated, that regional participants be excluded, and that the discussions' scope be limited to the country's nuclear program, according to three sources familiar with the matter. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that the meetings, led on the US side by special envoy Steve Witkoff, are “still scheduled as of right now, but of course the president has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force.” The new demands by Iran could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions. The talks had been set for Istanbul, with foreign ministers from Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also expected to attend. Tehran is now asking for an alternate location: Oman, the small Gulf sultanate that has previous hosted talks between the US and Iran. The US has said its demands for Iran extend beyond an end to its nuclear program to curbing its ballistic missiles and ending support for regional proxy groups. What the changes — first reported by Axios — portend for the diplomatic efforts wasn't immediately clear. Already, some American officials had privately warned that Iran may be using diplomacy to play for time in preventing military action. The two key US participants in the discussions — Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner — arrived in the region on Tuesday for talks with Israeli officials. Trump said Monday that talks were ongoing but continued to point to the large military buildup in the region as evidence of his willingness to order strikes. We're talking to Iran, and if we can work something out that'll be great, and if we can't, probably bad things would happen,” he said. This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House passes package of five funding bills and DHS stopgap measure 217-214; measure now goes to Trump for approval as battle looms over guardrails for immigration enforcement Trump-Petro meeting could end in detente or discord with Colombia leader The House narrowly passed a package of five annual funding bills, and a stopgap measure to keep the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) open for two weeks – ending the partial government shutdown. It includes a short-term bill to fund DHS until 13 February. Minnesota governor Tim Walz slammed homeland security Kristi Noem at a press conference today. When asked about her latest update, that all immigration officers deployed will be issued with body cameras. Walz said Noem is the “absolutely worst choice for any cabinet position”. The governor noted that he's asked for body camera footage of Alex Pretti's fatal shooting which he's yet to receive. “I put no stake in what she says at all. But here's the good thing, every single Minnesotan has a camera. The House narrowly passed a package of five annual funding bills, and a stopgap measure to keep the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) open for two weeks – ending the partial government shutdown. It includes a short-term bill to fund DHS until 13 February. James Comer, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, announced that former president Bill Clinton, and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, have agreed to appear for closed-door depositions as part of the committee's ongoing investigation into the handling of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's crimes. Hillary Clinton will give testimony first, on 26 February, and the former president will appear for his deposition on 27 February. Their respective testimonies will be transcribed and filmed. “Once it became clear that the House of Representatives would hold them in contempt, the Clintons completely caved,” Comer said in a statement. “We look forward to questioning the Clintons as part of our investigation into the horrific crimes of Epstein and Maxwell, to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors.” The man accused of spraying congresswoman Ilhan Omar with an unidentified substance at a Minneapolis town hall last week is appearing before a federal judge today. A magistrate judge today denied Kazmierczak's request for release while he awaits trial. Court documents state that Kazmierczak rushed the lectern after Omar called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be abolished “for good” and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Kristi Noem, to resign. The House cleared a procedural hurdle for a five-bill funding package and stopgap measure for the Department of Homeland Security to avert an ongoing partial government shutdown. Republicans can only afford for one member of their party to defect, or they will need help from Democrats to pass the bills. Thomas Massie, a GOP congressman from Kentucky, voted against the legislation earlier and is expected to hold out again. “An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,” said navy captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the US military's Central Command. The incident came as diplomats sought to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and Donald Trump warned that with US warships heading toward Iran, “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached. Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was “seriously talking,” while Tehran's top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way. US Central Command said that in another incident today, hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel. With the full Democratic caucus currently voting against the package, speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose one GOP vote. Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump's approval, the Guardian has learned, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. Her presence at the raid drew criticism from Democrats and former intelligence officials, who questioned why the country's top intelligence officer with no domestic law enforcement powers would appear at the scene of an FBI raid. But Gabbard, whose role ordinarily focuses on overseeing the intelligence agencies, has played only a minimal role in the criminal investigation, according to three administration officials. “She's doing her own thing,” one of the officials said. As part of that effort, Gabbard has been briefing Trump and senior White House advisers every few weeks. Officials said Trump directed her to travel to Fulton county, Georgia, so she could observe the FBI executing a search warrant on Wednesday. The raid itself was overseen by Andrew Bailey, the deputy FBI director, who was also sent by Trump to Georgia. The warrant authorized agents to seize sweeping amounts of voter data from Fulton county, including all physical ballots from the 2020 election, voting machine tabulator tapes, images produced during the ballot count and voter rolls from that year. More than 40 Democratic members of Congress have written a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) inspector general (IG), to expedite its investigation into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents' use of force. This comes after two US citizens – Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good – were fatally shot my federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, and protests continue to grip the Twin Cities. The lawmakers write that agents are using “needlessly violent force against community members who are exercising their First Amendment rights and pose no threat”. Last year, several Democratic lawmakers urged the IG to launch an investigation into the department's practices and use of force. However, the members of Congress note, these probes usually take more than a year to complete. “Given the urgency of this situation – with communities facing severe, and sometimes fatal, harm from ICE's tactics on American streets every day – we request that your office conduct this review expeditiously and share any preliminary findings with Congress and the public on an expedited basis,” they wrote. The press pool notes that Colombian president, Gustav Petro, has arrived at the White House for his meeting with Donald Trump. There was no traditional military honor guard or ceremonial protocol, reporters at the White House note. Just a note on the vote to end the partial government shutdown, and pass a five-bill package, as well as a stopgap measure to keep the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for two weeks while Democrats negotiate guardrails on federal immigration enforcement. Right now, there is a procedural vote in the House. A reminder that Trump called on “no changes” when urging Republican lawmakers to pass the bills, noting that a longer shutdown was out of the question. Republicans can only afford one defector, after the balance shifted to 218-214 on Monday when speaker Mike Johnson swore in Christian Menefee, the newly elected Democrat from Houston. A quick reminder that last year, just months into his second administration, Trump signed an executive order to enact sweeping restrictions and conditions on voting rights throughout the country. Again, changes that constitution prevents the executive branch from carrying out. However, a federal judge blocked this effort last year, ruling that it was a “violation of the separation of powers”. Also part of Trump's directive was an effort to block states accepting ballots after election day, despite the fact that many accept mail-in votes as long as they have been postmarked in time. My colleague, Andrew Gumbel, has been tracking Trump's attack on elections and voting. Per my earlier post about Trump's comments that Republicans should “nationalize” voting in certain places, it's worth remembering that the president, and many members of his administration, have repeated the baseless claims that he won the 2020 election. “Supreme Court, here we come,” said assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This is lawless activism that we will be vindicated on.” “Haiti's TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago, it was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program,” McLaughlin added. “Yet that's how previous administrations have used it for decades.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So far, three staff-organized letters sent by Post employees to Bezos imploring him to protect the Post's robust coverage have gone unanswered. The first plea went to Bezos on 25 January, when about 60 people signed a letter asking him to protect the company's foreign news operation, which is rumored to be a major target of cost-cutting. Two days later, employees sent Bezos a letter asking him to preserve the newspaper's local coverage, which is also said to be at risk for heavy cuts. Post staffers have also filmed and posted videos on social media urging Bezos to “#savethepost”. While Post chief executive, Will Lewis, has been included on at least one of the emails, the letters have been addressed to Bezos, who some staffers hope might be more persuadable. (Matt Murray, the Post's top editor, has had private discussions with several Post journalists in recent weeks, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.) Emails sent by the Guardian to Bezos and a representative at the company he founded, Amazon, have not been returned. A Post spokesperson declined to comment on the rumored cuts. “If @JeffBezos follows through with his reported plan to decimate the Post's newsroom, it will be a huge indictment of his supposed business prowess,” the account wrote. Some Post staffers also noted that Bezos has not yet commented on the 14 January raid of a Post reporter's home, even though many groups that advocate for journalists decried the government's tactics as unprecedented and dangerous. Cameron Barr, a former managing editor of the Post, called out Bezos for his silence in a post on LinkedIn, writing: “It's not just the chest-thumping overreach of the Trump administration that will crush American freedoms – it's the silence of its enablers.” Amazon and Bezos have also faced criticism for spending approximately $75m to acquire and promote a documentary about Melania Trump – particularly after Bezos faced accusations of cozying up to Trump by killing the Post's planned endorsement last fall of Kamala Harris for president. Glenn Kessler, who ended a 27-year-long career at the Post last year, expressed cautious optimism about the campaign to reach Bezos. “That kind of pushback might have an impact,” he said. Kessler said he and a few other reporters had lunch with Bezos, who purchased the paper in 2013, after Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 election. “He was quite interested in what people did. “Even before these cuts, you can question the quality of Bezos's stewardship,” Kessler said. I think people were slower to see that something had changed because they wanted to believe so badly that the original sense we had of Bezos was it.” Cillizza remembered being skeptical when Bezos said he intended the Post to be profitable. While Bezos has stayed silent about potential cuts to the Post and ignored an effort by the union last year to get him to visit the newspaper, he was more visibly engaged with one of his other companies on Monday, the spaceflight startup Blue Origin. Bezos was on hand to meet secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, who last November called the Post's reporting “fake news”, during a visit to the company's facility in Florida.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A selloff in European and North American software, data analytics and advertising stocks deepened on Tuesday after new artificial intelligence models raised concerns over the ‍potential ​impact on sectors once seen as AI beneficiaries. One catalyst was the launch of Anthropic's legal plug-in for its Claude generative AI chatbot, according to traders and analysts. The move sent Britain's RELX and the Netherlands' Wolters Kluwer, both providers of legal analytics services, down as much as 17 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. Toronto-based Thomson Reuters (TRI-T, TRI-Q), which owns the Westlaw legal database, ⁠fell over 14 per cent. “The software companies were assumed to be winners from AI,” said Lars Skovgaard, senior investment strategist at Danske Bank. Its dramatic reversal highlights the pressure AI ‍is exerting on Europe's software sector. Germany's SAP, which less than ‌a year ago was Europe's most valuable company, slumped over 16 per cent last week after its ⁠cloud revenue forecast missed expectations, wiping about US$40-billion off its market value in one day. “Artificial intelligence is increasingly able to perform exactly the sort of programming and knowledge-based services that underpin these business models, so parts of the sector have been under pressure for some time,” said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia. Salesforce (CRM-N), ServiceNow (NOW-N) and Photoshop maker Adobe (ADBE-Q) all fell over 5 per cent in early trading. Traders and analysts said fear often outweighed company fundamentals. Publicis, the ⁠world's largest advertising group by market capitalization, said it had earmarked approximately 900 million euros (US$1.06-billion) for acquisitions ⁠in 2026, focusing on AI-powered technologies and data assets. According to a Barclays survey of buy-side investors published on Monday, advertising agencies are ‌seen as the most exposed part of European media to artificial intelligence, with WPP, Omnicom and Publicis ranked the top “AI losers”. Analysts at the bank said companies could most effectively shake off an “AI loser” label by launching and clearly promoting revenue-generating AI products. Other firms that rely heavily on advertising were also hammered, with Pinterest slipping 4 per cent and Snap falling more than 5 per cent. Ad-dependent Big Tech ‌companies Meta and Alphabet's Google, however, were down only marginally. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov has condemned France, saying it is “not a free country” after a raid on Elon Musk's X offices in Paris. The search was part of a probe into the social media platform's Grok AI and its alleged generation of sexualized deepfake images of women and children, and comes amid a broader crackdown on X across the EU. “French police is currently raiding X's office in Paris. France is the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom (Telegram, X, TikTok…),” Durov wrote on X on Tuesday. Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country. Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino have been summoned to Paris for “voluntary interviews” in April, the press release said. Last month, the European Commission and British telecommunications watchdog Ofcom announced they were investigating the platform after a recent integration of its chatbot Grok allowed users to generate sexualized deepfake images, including of minors. The probes followed a €150 million ($177 million) fine the commission issued X in December for breaching transparency obligations under digital regulations. The Russian-born tech mogul was arrested in Paris in 2024 over allegations that Telegram had failed to deter criminal activity on the platform. Durov has maintained that his detention was politically motivated, and accused French authorities of attempting to force him to use his platform to curb “conservative voices” ahead of the election in Romania.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) yesterday called for an “equal and orderly multipolar world” in the face of “unilateral bullying,” in an apparent jab at the US. Xi was speaking during talks in Beijing with Uruguayan President Yamandu Orsi, the first South American leader to visit China since US special forces captured then-Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro last month — an operation that Beijing condemned as a violation of sovereignty. Chinese electric vehicle brands have also grown their market share in Uruguay, accounting for almost one-third of sales last year. Beijing has invested billions of dollars in Latin America as part of its quest for natural resources and through its Belt and Road Initiative. China and Uruguay would “seek to increase and diversify our bilateral trade,” Orsi said at the meeting, adding that they both supported a “standard-based international trade system.” The two leaders signed agreements on science, technology, environmental cooperation and other areas. Uruguay is part of South America's Mercosur trade bloc, along with Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, which limits its ability to strike unilateral trade deals with Beijing. Montevideo has previously expressed interest in an independent commercial deal with China, which sparked opposition from fellow members. Orsi was also due to hold talks with Chinese Premier Li Qiang (李強) and Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee Chairman Zhao Leji (趙樂際) yesterday before traveling to Shanghai. China's maritime militia could become a nontraditional threat in war, clogging up shipping lanes to prevent US or Japanese intervention, a report said                                        About 1,900 Chinese ships flying flags of convenience and fishing vessels that participated in China's military exercises around Taiwan last month and in January have been listed for monitoring, Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Deputy Director-General Hsieh Ching-chin (謝慶欽) said yesterday. Following amendments to the Commercial Port Act (商港法) and the Law of Ships (船舶法) last month, the CGA can designate possible berthing areas or deny ports of call for vessels suspected of loitering around areas where undersea cables can be accessed, Oceans Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling (管碧玲) said. The list of suspected ships, originally 300, had risen to about 1,900 as Right-wing political scientist Laura Fernandez on Sunday won Costa Rica's presidential election by a landslide, after promising to crack down on rising violence linked to the cocaine trade. Fernandez's nearest rival,  economist Alvaro Ramos, conceded defeat as results showed the ruling party far exceeding the threshold of 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff. Draftees would be expected to fight alongside professional soldiers, likely requiring the transformation of some training brigades into combat units                                        The armed forces are to start incorporating new conscripts into combined arms brigades this year to enhance combat readiness, the Executive Yuan's latest policy report said. The new policy would affect Taiwanese men entering the military for their compulsory service, which was extended to one year under reforms by then-president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) in 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Winnipeg's incoming Water Tower District, named after a 1936 water tower that will be located in the enclave's central retail area, will take over 165 acres of vacant industrial land.Shindico Realty/Supplied Winnipeg's eastern St. Boniface neighbourhood is poised for a major transformation as a large-scale mixed-use development moves into its early construction phase, blending commercial, industrial, residential and parkland uses into one area. The Water Tower District, a 165-acre stretch of former industrial land, aims to convert the long-vacant former Union Stockyards space, a large livestock-handling facility, into a flexible, centrally located district that easily connects to the city's core. Similar conversions are underway nationwide, including Montreal's former Molson Brewery site, which is being redeveloped into a mixed-use district called Quartier Molson, and Toronto's former Downsview Airport, set to become YZD, a 370-acre site that will connect 66,000 residents across seven neighbourhoods. When the Union Stockyards closed in 1988, it left behind a vast brownfield site in a prime, centrally located part of the city that has sat empty until now. Designated as a major redevelopment site under the city's development plan policies, it advances three goals from the city's Complete Communities Direction Strategy 2.0. The Water Tower District takes its name from a historic 1936 water tower, which will be a featured landmark in the neighbourhood's central retail area. Shindico Realty is overseeing the district's marketing, sales and leasing. Driven largely by record immigration, Manitoba's population growth has surged in recent years, adding 34,946 residents in 2024, while new housing starts that year totalled just 7,191 units, according to the Fraser Institute, a Canadian think tank. “There's not very much land in this community, and every apartment that's been built has leased up quickly with waiting lists,” Mr. Scaletta says. The project is currently approved for 2,000 units overall, and a rezoning application is currently being finalized to convert a portion of industrial land into multifamily housing, which would add 800 units. Under an agreement with the city, 10 per cent of all residential units will be designated as affordable housing, Mr. Scaletta says. Supporting that population growth will also require employment opportunities, as well as access to services, retail and shared community space - all of which are essential to fostering a sense of belonging in a deeply rooted neighbourhood. “We're putting in three parks, two larger ones and a smaller acre lot, along with community gardens,” Mr. Scaletta says, adding that play areas will be accessible for families. There are also discussions around potential non-profit cultural centres, including spaces for seniors, youth groups and offices. “The…approach offers a replicable template for other legacy industrial conversions in Winnipeg and in other mid-sized Canadian cities,” Ms. Borys says of the Water Tower District. She points to five transferable lessons emerging from the project: start with a strong network of stakeholders; retain central employment; phase development to manage risk; plan collaboratively; and monitor progress and adjust over time. Ms. Borys says the district's scale and central location are among its key strengths, allowing it to accommodate new housing while retaining employment land alongside existing services and infrastructure. “The Water Tower District is a district-scale expression of that shift.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's Armed Forces have regained positions in the embattled city of Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState said on Feb. 3. On Nov. 20, Russia's chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, said Russia had captured Kupiansk, a claim that Ukraine's Armed Forces refuted, which was followed by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 12 recording a video from the city. DeepState also reported Russian forces have advanced near the settlements of Udachne, Hryshyne, and Pryvillia in Donetsk Oblast. Denmark and Sweden announced on Feb. 3 they will procure and supply Ukraine with additional air defense systems in the face of Russia's devastating winter bombing campaign. Speaking jointly at a press conference, the countries' defense ministers said the military aid supplied will total $290 million and be spent on Tridon air defense systems developed by BAE Systems Bofors. "The purchase doesn't just support Ukraine on the battlefield with more material, but also strengthens our production capacity in Sweden." A shortage of air defense missiles has left some Ukrainian air defense systems empty at times amid the threat of further Russian attacks, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force's communications department, said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on Feb. 2. With the onset of winter, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the country into a nationwide blackout. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defense forces lack sufficient resources to intercept all Russian missiles and drones. Ihnat said that Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have repeatedly stressed the shortage of missiles for air defense systems, noting that some of them are depleted and not ready to repel Russian attacks. "Indeed, before one such attack, we were provided with the necessary means a day in advance," Ihnat said. "Ukrainian forces repelled that massive strike quite successfully, thanks to missiles for F-16s, NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot." A Russian first-person view (FPV) drone training center was among several targets hit by Ukrainian forces over the past day, the General Staff reported on Feb. 3. The General Staff also reported successful strikes on a TOS-1A Solntsepyok heavy flamethrower system, an electronic warfare station, and a "manpower concentration near the settlement of Terebreno, Belgorod region, Russia." Russian forces launched a mass ballistic missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on Feb. 3, the largest this winter and involving the highest number of missiles launched in a single attack this season. The strikes came amid a larger attack on Ukrainian cities, including those located hundreds of kilometers from the front line, with dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones reported over Ukraine's night sky. Russia's latest assault signals the end of a brief energy ceasefire, under which Moscow had agreed to temporarily pause strikes on Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure. The resumed attacks on the capital come days after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 29 that he personally asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from attacking Kyiv. The Kremlin previously said it would pause strikes on energy facilities, but only until Feb. 1. NATO Secretary Mark Rutte said on Feb. 3 that he is confident the allies would allocate $15 billion this year under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL). "I'm absolutely confident that the money will be there," Rutte said during a press conference alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv when asked about the figure requested by Ukraine. The news comes as Ukraine and Russia prepare for another round of talks this week aimed at ending Russia's full-scale invasion. Representatives of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia are set to meet in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 4-5. Rutte and President Volodymyr Zelensky placed candles and paid tribute to fallen Ukrainian soldiers at a memorial on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, according to the President's Office. Rutte also spoke at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament. "Direct talks are now underway, and this is important progress," he said at the Rada. "But Russian attacks, like those last night, do not signal seriousness about peace." Rutte also said that strong security guarantees must be provided to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. At least four people have been killed and 32 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Feb. 3. Russia launched 71 missiles and 450 drones, including nearly 300 Shahed-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. At least 27 missiles and 31 drones made it through, striking 27 locations. The fall of debris was recorded at 17 locations, with information on other aerial targets still being clarified. Russian forces struck thermal power plants operated by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, marking the ninth mass attack on its thermal facilities since October 2025. The attack caused significant damage to equipment, DTEK said. In Kharkiv Oblast, one person died and five others were injured, Governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. One person was killed and three others injured in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed and another injured, local Governor Vadym Filaskin reported. In Sumy Oblast, four people were injured, Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported. In Kyiv Oblast, three people suffered injuries due to the Feb. 3 mass strike on Ukraine, Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said. Russia has lost around 1,242,290 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Feb. 3 According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,633 tanks, 23,985 armored fighting vehicles, 76,738 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,855 artillery systems, 1,633 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,292 air defense systems, 435 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 122,388 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United Nations proposes more flexible nuclear arms control, while the UAE seeks to assume civilian control of Gaza. Meanwhile, China's Xi Jinping looks to make the yuan a global reserve currency. These stories topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia. However, experts from Russia and NATO are discussing the future of strategic arms control, with a scenario of exchanging data amid looser quantitative restrictions. "Washington does not consider the treaty useful to itself. A situation may occur where negotiations on New START are no longer held and nuclear tests begin. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) made it clear to Izvestia that it cannot force the issue in any way. "I don't think the UN or any other international organization will be able to play a significant role in finding a solution here. Therefore, this practice can only be continued through the efforts of Moscow and Washington. The countries that the United States or Russia would like to see as signatories are hesitant to participate," Kharitonova maintained. Abu Dhabi is currently discussing the implementation of this plan with Israel, the Jewish state's Channel 12 reported, citing Israeli government officials. The two sides are currently busy agreeing on an interstate agreement and have already exchanged draft documents. However, the final details of a potential deal will need to be approved by Israel. "It would be no use making any financial or organizational investments in the enclave as long as Hamas maintains its military capabilities there. These are perhaps hypothetical scenarios of how the situation may develop," she contended. Orientalists argue that there is currently intensifying competition between the leading Muslim states for a leading role in resolving the Palestinian issue. Chinese leader Xi Jinping wrote in Qiushi Journal that the yuan will be given the status of a global reserve currency. According to him, the Chinese state would need a "powerful currency" for international trade and investment. China would need a "powerful central bank" and competitive financial institutions capable of attracting foreign capital and influencing prices in global markets to achieve the goal, Xi added. Russia and China have almost 99% embraced settlements in the yuan and the ruble in bilateral trade already, and the Chinese currency has a large share in Russia's foreign reserves. However, the dollar looks more preferable to many other countries that do not maintain such a close trade relationship with China. Xi's statement came as the United States released a new report on foreign exchange policy in which the Americans again called on China to strengthen "its substantially undervalued exchange rate," economist Yegor Susin told the newspaper. A weak yuan exchange rate gives China an advantage in global trade, which irritates the United States. "For a legal tender to become a reserve currency, the issuing country must not only be an active participant in international trade but also play a powerful role in the investment and FX markets. Currently, almost all pricing globally is underpinned by the dollar, and this gives the United States a key advantage. The European Union is weighing a ban on a number of platinum group metal and copper imports from Russia as part of a new sanctions package, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing sources. The EU may impose a 20th sanctions package on Russia later this month. Restrictions, if any, will mostly affect Nornickel, Bloomberg warned. A source familiar with the situation told Kommersant that it is too early to jump to conclusions yet, as everything will depend on the final wording. Akhmed Aliyev, a senior analyst at T-Investments, argued that Nornickel might have expected such an outcome and been prepared for potential restrictions. "While it could be affected in the short term, sales in the longer term are unlikely to come under pressure, for global demand for such metals has been sustainable enough, and the company is certain to find consumers in other countries," he said. Vasily Danilov, an analyst at Veles Capital, said, referring to data from Eurostat, that Russian iridium imports to the EU ended back in December 2022, and that Russia has not sold platinum and rhodium to the bloc since December 2023. At the same time, Nornickel does not account for the whole of it, Danilov added, as he surmised that the company may have successfully diverted its exports to other markets. European countries have increased purchases of Russian gas. In January, Russia supplied a record 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe. In addition, gas volumes pumped through the Balkan Stream have reached a maximum: the average daily volume through this pipeline reached 56 million cubic meters in January, exceeding the design capacity by almost a quarter. Among the reasons for this are a frosty winter, gas extraction from underground storage facilities, and a decrease in LNG imports from the United States, where cold weather has also set in. Despite the fact that fuel prices in Europe have so far decreased from $500 to $418 per 1,000 cubic meters, experts believe that the cost of Russian natural gas will increase in the second quarter of 2026. "As a result, the share of Russian LNG in the overall EU imports reached about 19%, European media acknowledged, as local traders bought up ‘the whole of Yamal LNG' in January. Our country will not be able to help Europe in any other way, for there are currently no other opportunities for supplies to the Old World (after Nord Streams were sabotaged, and Kiev blocked gas transit through Ukraine)," he said. According to Tamara Safonova, CEO of NAANS-Media, an independent think tank that specializes in the oil and gas sphere, the European Commission's ambitions to reduce its reliance on Russian energy have damaged energy security systems built over decades. This has propped up gas prices, hurting the European economy, she added. Rising gas prices on European exchanges will have a positive impact on the revenues of Russian gas giants, which continue to supply LNG and pipeline gas to Europe, she argued.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Representatives of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia are set to meet in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 4-5. Rutte and President Volodymyr Zelensky placed candles and paid tribute to fallen Ukrainian soldiers at a memorial on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, according to the President's Office. Rutte also spoke at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament. "Direct talks are now underway, and this is important progress," he said at the Rada. "But Russian attacks, like those last night, do not signal seriousness about peace." Rutte also said that strong security guarantees must be provided to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. "You need to know that this peace will be lasting not because papers have been signed but because there is hard power to back it up," he added. Some European allies have announced that they will deploy troops to Ukraine after a deal is reached, and the U.S. is expected to provide a backstop, Rutte said. Rutte said on Jan. 21 that Ukraine, not Greenland, should be the main priority for NATO. He is a former editor and reporter at the Moscow Times. He has a master's degree in history from the Moscow State University. He moved to Ukraine in 2014 due to the crackdown on independent media in Russia and covered war, corruption, reforms and law enforcement for the Kyiv Post. Russian forces launched a mass ballistic missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Feb. 3, striking multiple residential buildings across the city and injuring at least three people, officials said. Rutte spoke at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament. "I'm absolutely confident that the money will be there," Rutte said during a press conference alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv when asked about the figure requested by Ukraine. The U.S. believes launching three projects under a joint U.S.-Ukrainian investment fund created under the so-called minerals deal last year is achievable, but ambitious, a senior U.S. official told reporters on Feb. 2. A more extensive Russian attack would trigger a coordinated Western-led military response backed by U.S. forces, initiated 72 hours after the initial breach, the Financial Times reported. "Six-hundred seventy-nine Ukrainian girls and boys will never be able to play football — Russia killed them," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said after FIFA President Gianni Infantino backed lifting the ban on Russian athletes. "Ukraine has not forgotten any of the thousands of Shaheds that attack our cities and villages, our people," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 2.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The published US case files on US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who is accused of child molestation, reveal that Vladimir Zelensky is involved in trafficking women and children, according to documents reviewed by TASS. Zelensky is mentioned in one of the published emails, which dates back to 2024. The letter claims that Zelensky is involved in trafficking women and children from Ukraine and suggests that he may have been associated with modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel. "Zelensky, in light of the trafficking that is occurring in Ukraine, set up by Jean-Luc Brunel, I want all your assets investigated at JP Morgan!" Elsewhere, he or she wondered whether Zelensky intended to stop the trafficking of women and children and asked why the Ukrainian media is silent on this issue. Zelensky is mentioned in Epstein's files for other reasons as well. In one of them, Epstein himself and Miroslav Lajcak, who was then Slovakia's foreign minister and OSCE chairman, discuss the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election on a messaging app, two days after Zelensky's victory. Epstein noted that the situation looked like a good opportunity to intervene. His interlocutor expressed doubts about Zelensky's ability to lead Ukraine. Zelensky is mentioned at least several dozen times in the documents, which contain different spellings of his name due to transcription errors. Many of the references are excerpts from news articles that Epstein shared with people on his contact list.</p>
