                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The incident occurred as tensions in the Middle East are high with President Donald Trump weighing potential military strikes against the Islamic Republic. The Shahed-139 drone "aggressively approached" the aircraft carrier with "unclear intent," U.S. Central Command spokesman Capt. Tim Hawkins told CNBC in a statement. U.S. forces were operating in international waters and took de-escalatory measures, but the drone continued to fly toward the aircraft carrier, he said. An F-35 warplane from the Abraham Lincoln shot down the drone "in self defense to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board," Hawkins said. U.S. crude oil prices were up more than 1% at 2:32 p.m. Hours after the drone was shot down, Iranian forces harassed a U.S. flagged and crewed merchant vessel that was lawfully transiting the Strait of Hormuz, Hawkins said. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces threatened to board and seize the M/V Stena Imperative, he said. A U.S. guided missile destroyer intervened, de-escalated the situation and the merchant vessel is now proceeding safely, Hawkins said. Trump has deployed the Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with strikes if it does not negotiate a deal over its nuclear program. The incidents Tuesday come as Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to have discussions with Iranian officials later this week. Those conversations are still scheduled to take place, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in an interview. "As for the president, he remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first," Leavitt said. "But in order for diplomacy to work of course it takes two to tango. You need a willing partner to engage." Leavitt said Trump "always has a range of options on the table and that includes the use of military force." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's new minerals stockpile initiative — dubbed "Project Vault" — can include anything identified as "critical" by the U.S. Geological Survey, a White House official told CNBC Tuesday. The minerals are crucial because they "underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy," according to USGS. President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled "Project Vault," which is a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership. The U.S. Export-Import Bank will provide $10 billion in the form of a loan, with about $2 billion coming from private capital. "You're covering everything with this," Trump said during an event at the White House on Monday. "We're not just doing certain minerals and rare earths. Equipment manufacturers including GE Vernova, Western Digital and Boeing have expressed interest, said EXIM Bank Chairman John Jovanovic in a statement Monday. "Having a resilient supply chain is critical for our nation, and it's critical for all industry, especially the auto industry," Barra said at the White House. Beyond autos, critical minerals are key inputs for the defense, robotics, semiconductor, electronics and energy industries. The stockpile is the latest move by the Trump administration to build a Western supply chain to counter China's dominance in critical minerals — especially when it comes to refining. Beijing sought to cut off exports of rare earths, a subset of critical minerals, last year during trade disputes with the U.S. The U.S. stockpile will source the minerals at home and abroad, Jovanovic told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. "We have a network of warehouse facilities in which it's going to be stored in the United States," he said. The stockpile is part of a broader Trump administration strategy. The Pentagon inked a landmark deal last July with rare-earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. The Commerce Department last week announced plans to finance the startup critical-mineral company USA Rare Earth in exchange for an ownership stake, subject to certain closing conditions. The administration has also taken stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said last April that the U.S. is also considering a sovereign risk insurance fund that would protect companies' investments in mining projects from cancellation by future U.S. administrations. We're working on all three of those," Burgum said at a conference in Oklahoma City last year. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced a U.S. trade deal with India on Monday which he said includes a promise from India to stop buying Russian oil and potentially buy from the U.S. and Venezuela, but data shows the shadow fleet of tankers moving sanctioned crude continues to unload at Indian ports. Global data and analytics firm Kpler's vessel tracking shared with CNBC shows four tankers associated with Russia's shadow fleet unloading or in the process of unloading sanctioned oil at Indian ports: the Giannis, unloading Urals at Chennai Refinery; the Nyxora, unloading Urals at Paradip Refinery; the Tiburon, unloading Urals at Vadinar Refinery; and the Seasons I, which is being tracked outside Vadinar on Tuesday morning but was yet to unload, according to Kpler. In recent months, the global shadow fleet moving sanctioned oil, estimated to be as large as 1,400 vessels, has navigated around the tightening U.S. enforcement campaign on Venezuela and Iranian oil, and Europe's interventions against the increasing flow of stateless tankers loading Russian crude. A recent Lloyd's List analysis on the global shadow fleet after the U.S. military actions in Venezuela found that out of the approximately 50 tankers that were full of Venezuelan oil, at least five tankers completed deliveries to China with the vessel's Automatic Identification System (AIS) operating normally, and suggesting "the enforcement pressure has yet to bite." Sanctioned Russian crude has also faced increasing enforcement measures. Recently, the French seized the tanker Grinch, which departed Murmansk earlier this month with a cargo of Russian oil. The sanctioning and seizure of the Russian shadow fleet is one of the efforts to cut Russian energy revenue to reduce Moscow's ability to pursue its war in Ukraine. India's imports of Russian oil have reached a record level this year. "In 2025, India's oil imports from Russia made up 33% of the country's total seaborne oil imports and 25 percent of Russia's seaborne oil exports," said Niels Rasmussen, chief shipping analyst at Bimco. "A new trade agreement between the U.S. and India could, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, put an end to that trade," he said. But Kremlin officials have pushed back, telling reporters they have not officially heard from India about any suspension of oil purchases by the Indian government. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has also yet to publicly confirm the terms of the trade deal Trump announced, though Indian officials have said an announcement will be coming. and India signed a major trade agreement slashing tariffs to zero on many goods over a number of years. The Trump administration has been pressuring India during the trade war to stop buying Russian oil, and Trump said on Monday India should purchase oil from the U.S. or Venezuela. Even if it does stop importing Russian crude, Rasmussen says it could instead purchase more oil from the Persian Gulf. Before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, up to two-thirds of India's crude oil and oil product imports arrived from the Persian Gulf. Rasmussen said he would not expect Russian oil exports to fall by a similar amount as Russia will likely aim to find new buyers, even if it requires a higher rebate to buyers of Russian oil. The shadow fleet often has to sell at a discount, and those discounts may increase as global enforcement measures tighten. Russian crude, because it is sanctioned, already trades at a lower price than crude sold on the public markets. Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, said if India does close the door on Russian oil, it will give other buyers of last resort more market power. "That could pressure Russian receipts to the downside. But some analysts caution that a smaller market for Russian oil could make it harder for the shadow fleet to find additional employment in its bid to replace India. "The only major country left to purchase Russian oil is China, and they may already have all the Russian oil that they want," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. With less crude oil out of Venezuela to feed the dark fleet and the Indian market potentially shut down, Lipow says many of those vessels may be idled or ultimately be scrapped. But Book says the global shadow fleet is fungible, and if there is an opportunity to move sanctioned oil, the owners of these vessels will take advantage of it, with Venezuela an example. "The shadow fleet moves from one area of demand to another, and as long as sanctions remain in place against other major producing exporters, you can expect that there will still be some shadow vessels being used," he said. Despite the sanctioned crude crackdown, Russia has been quickly adding to its shadow fleet, reflagging vessels that once moved Venezuelan oil. In December, 17 sanctioned vessels were reflagged to Russia. "The overall trade between nations matters," Book said. There will be logistical costs associated with these shifts." A prime example Book gave was the transport of Russian oil, which previously went to Europe, and is now often bound for China. "Discounts are extremely attractive to refiners," he said, and that means the barrels of sanctioned oil being moved by the dark fleet "are going to find a home. These workarounds end up being a plus for China, which is the primary buyer of Russian and Iranian crude. China is probably going to continue looking for distressed discounted barrels," Book said. Lloyd's Shadow Fleet Tracker, which covers the roughly 1,400 vessels that predominantly move sanctioned Russian oil, shows there has been an increasing flow of stateless tankers loaded with Russian oil, anchored in the waters of Malaysia. Maritime intelligence from Kpler shows that the pressure of the U.S. brokering Venezuelan oil trades, and the existing sanctions on Russia and Iran, are forcing more of these vessels to conduct ship-to-ship transfers as part of their efforts to go dark when moving sanctioned oil. "It is clear that there are still avid buyers of this sanctioned oil, namely China and India," said Jean‑Charles Gordon, vice president of maritime and logistics at Kpler. "China consumes half of the Iranian oil." In 2025, 251 vessels were loaded with sanctioned Iranian oil — 217 of those vessels (86%) are sanctioned, the vessels are targeted by a government identifying them in moving the illicit oil, according to Kpler data. The majority of these vessels (96%) conducted dark ship-to-ship transfers; 77% spoofed their vessel location; and 72% turned off their vessel location beacons for prolonged stretches of time. In 2025, there were 510 vessels loaded with sanctioned Russian oil, according to Kpler. Among those, 305, or 59% of the fleet, were sanctioned. These vessels also engaged in spoofing vessel locations and prolonged AIS gaps. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Grindr is in early testing for a new, higher-priced subscription tier called "Edge," the company confirmed to Business Insider. Test pricing starts at $80 a week and goes into the hundreds. Screenshots posted online show monthly subscription rates of $349.99 and $499.99. At those prices, one year of Grindr Edge would cost between $4,199.88 and $5,999.88. "This early-stage pilot is part of our broader strategy to make Grindr smarter, faster, and drive more meaningful connections," a Grindr representative wrote to Business Insider. The three main AI features of Edge will be Discover (personalized matches), Insights (a "signal before messaging"), and A-List (a recommendation feed for old chats). For reference, Grindr Unlimited's price varies user-to-user, but the App Store lists monthly costs between $27.99 and $44.99. That's hundreds of dollars less than the Edge test price points. Grindr's competitors also change prices user-to-user, making a direct comparison difficult. Edge is another step toward Grindr's mission of bringing "gAI" — pronounced "gay-I" — to its nearly 15 million monthly active users.</p>

His warning is coming during a rough time for bitcoin investors. The coin is also down around 37% from its peak last year. Markets are already seeing some consequences from bitcoin's rout, Burry suggested. "Sickening scenarios have now come within reach," Burry said, outlining three other consequences in particular he believed were possible if bitcoin continued its free-fall.

If bitcoin were to drop under $70,000, there could be hefty losses across the financial industry, Burry speculated. Other institutions would likely take a 15%-20% loss on their bitcoin holdings, leading risk managers to "get more aggressive," he added. "These moves if sustained could result in Bitcoin breaking $70,000 because of this interconnected world of portfolio margin accounts, tokenized metals futures, and crypto collateral," he wrote. Saylor's Strategy has come under more scrutiny from crypto investors in recent months as the price of bitcoin continues to tumble. The company's mNAV currently stands at 1.1, according to Strategy's website. "Tokenized metals futures would collapse into a black hole with no buyer. Physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand," he added. Burry, who disappeared from social media before coming back online last year, is known for being a vocal critic of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Walmart crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold on Tuesday after a dizzying stock climb fueled by the growth of digital businesses and the acquisition of new customers. In hitting the benchmark, the largest U.S. retailer and grocer joins an exclusive club made up almost entirely of technology companies. Walmart's stock has climbed more than 24% in the past year, and over 11% so far in 2026. That has outpaced the nearly 16% and 2% gains in those time frames, respectively, for the S&P 500. The retailer's inclusion in a group heavy on tech companies illustrates much about its ambitions. Walmart has tried to grow profits faster than sales in recent years by leaning into its third-party marketplace and advertising businesses — both of which bring higher margins than its traditional brick-and-mortar operations. And Walmart put out the clearest signal yet of its tech ambitions when it listed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 last month. He succeeded longtime Chief Executive Doug McMillon. As CEO of Walmart's U.S. business, Furner oversaw many of the key initiatives that drove the retailer's growth in recent years. Efforts like curbside pickup and better private-label brands helped the discounter draw higher-income shoppers as elevated inflation bit into grocery budgets. For its fiscal 2026 third quarter reported in November, Walmart said revenue rose 5.8%, boosted by a 27% jump in e-commerce sales and 53% growth for its advertising business. Walmart said it expected sales growth of 4.8% to 5.1% for its full fiscal year. The company is expected to post fiscal fourth-quarter earnings later this month.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's official: Josh D'Amaro is Disney's new top dog — or, in this case, mouse. D'Amaro is an "exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO," Iger said in a statement. Disney's board voted unanimously for his promotion on Monday, the company said in a statement. D'Amaro will be tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age. Here's what Disney fans, employees, and investors need to know about D'Amaro as he becomes CEO. He'll be 55 years old on February 10, as his eventual predecessor turns 75. The two also appear to have a similar fashion sense. The soon-to-be CEO studied business administration at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. After graduating in 1993, D'Amaro worked at Boston-based Gillette for a few years. D'Amaro began his Disney journey in 1998, working at Disneyland as a business planner. Twenty years later, he became president of Disneyland, before moving from Anaheim to Orlando a year later to take the same position at Disney World. Before that role, D'Amaro had worked on the park's business development, marketing strategy, and sales teams. D'Amaro also had roles at Disney World's Animal Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland — a valuable experience, given how crucial China is to Disney's business. Outside the parks, D'Amaro had also worked in Disney's consumer products businesses as a VP of global licensing. After more than two decades at Disney, D'Amaro was promoted to Disney Experiences chairman to oversee parks, cruises, and consumer products in early 2020 — at the most difficult time possible amid a pandemic. Under his tenure, Disney has continued to expand its parks business, including announcing its plans to launch a seventh park, located in Abu Dhabi. "For every one theme park visitor that we have in our existing experiences today, we believe there are 10 more out there that want to come and participate in the Disney experience," D'Amaro said in May at MoffettNathanson's media conference. While Disney has received some criticism from fans for making its parks less affordable for middle-class families — with a slew of upcharges for fast-pass Lightning Lanes and costly food — those complaints don't appear to be hurting the company's bottom line. Disney's experiences segment just topped $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, while its $3.3 billion in operating income made up more than 70% of the company's profit. As CEO, D'Amaro must gain Wall Street's favor by pulling off similar feats in Disney's streaming, TV, and movie businesses. Disney's stock has fallen around 9% over the past year, and it's shed about 43% of its value from five years ago. Iger also made it clear that his successor must be bold and make their own mark on Disney. "But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be about preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, taking steps to create opportunities for growth."</p>

Disney has selected its parks head as the successor to CEO Bob Iger. Now, the Mouse House has to hope that history doesn't repeat itself. Josh D'Amaro, a 28-year Disney veteran who's run the company's experiences division since 2020, will take over for Iger, who's retiring for the second time, on March 18. Iger will remain on Disney's board as a senior advisor, the company said in its filing. Every time James publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Another factor in D'Amaro's favor is that Disney's parks have become crucial to the company's success, as his Experiences division accounted for more than 70% of Disney's operating income last quarter. D'Amaro beat out Dana Walden, who oversees Disney's entertainment and TV portfolio, for the top job. Walden will become Disney's president and chief creative officer on March 18, the same day D'Amaro takes over as CEO. It may be tempting to draw parallels between D'Amaro and Iger's first successor: Bob Chapek, who'd also run Disney's experiences business before becoming CEO in early 2020. Iger appeared to regret his choice of Chapek and seemingly undermined the man he called "Little Bob," CNBC reported. Disney's CEO succession process was much more thorough this time. It was led by Gorman, a former Morgan Stanley CEO, who had successfully navigated his own leadership transition. Under D'Amaro's leadership, Disney's experiences business has started to carry the company financially. The growth in experiences has been driven by nearly annual price hikes at Disney's parks, which have helped generate more revenue per guest. Despite those price increases, D'Amaro — a charming 54-year-old — has remained well-liked among Disney fans, some of whom have even argued that higher prices could reduce crowds, thereby improving their experience. However, some Disney superfans said they were skeptical that D'Amaro was a better choice than Walden, who has run the company's crucial streaming business and has strong relationships in Hollywood. "You can only extract so much out of the parks," said Lucas Lozano, a Disney fan based in Texas. D'Amaro's own fiefdom, Disney's experiences business, appears to be firing on all cylinders, though there are questions about how much more it can push up prices. However, Disney+ and Hulu's share of US TV viewing has barely budged for years, according to Nielsen data.</p>

"Medical personnel met the flight upon arrival, and it has since continued on and arrived in Tel Aviv," they added. Data from Flightradar24 shows the same plane departed Dublin at 5:25 a.m. local time on Tuesday. That's about two hours after it landed in the Irish capital. Passengers are expected to arrive in Israel around noon local time, a delay of just under three hours. Last April, a British Airways flight from the Bahamas changed course over the ocean and diverted to Gander, in Canada's Newfoundland, due to a medical emergency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria is stepping up its ambitions in Africa's automotive market as Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing prepares to commission a major factory dedicated to compressed natural gas trucks and electric vehicles, signalling a push into cleaner transport and large-scale local manufacturing. Chukwuma reaffirmed his long-standing focus on domestic production, describing Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing as one of Africa's largest private-sector employers. He noted that the company supports thousands of families through its operations and plans to significantly expand its workforce in the coming year. “In 2026 alone, we intend to employ about 2,000 additional workers following the establishment of this new factory,” he said, adding that the expansion aligns with his vision of industrial growth driven by Nigerian talent. Beyond vehicle production, the plant will host a technical training program to equip young Nigerians with hands-on industrial skills. Participants will either be absorbed into the company's workforce or certified to seek employment elsewhere in the manufacturing sector. He argued that skills development and job creation remain critical to reducing insecurity and strengthening Nigeria's industrial base. As African governments increasingly promote gas-powered and electric transport as alternatives to petrol and diesel, Innoson's expansion positions Nigeria as a potential hub for next-generation vehicle manufacturing on the continent, with implications for regional supply chains, employment, and industrial self-reliance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria has taken a major step toward establishing a domestic electric vehicle (EV) industry after signing an agreement with South Korea's Asia Economic Development Committee (AEDC) to establish what officials are calling Africa's first EV manufacturing plant. “On January 30, 2026, the Federal Government of Nigeria, through Senator John Enoh, Hon. Minister of State for Industry at the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (FMITI), signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with South Korea's Asia Economic Development Committee (AEDC) to establish an Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing plant and develop critical charging infrastructure nationwide. The project will be implemented in phases, beginning with EV assembly and later expanding into full in-house production. Nigeria's automotive sector faces structural challenges, including limited local component production, high assembly costs, and heavy reliance on imports. The country imports between 400,000 and 720,000 vehicles annually, with 74–90% being used cars. To promote electric mobility, the federal government launched a 20 billion naira ($12 million) consumer credit program in December 2024. The scheme supports the purchase of locally assembled electric vehicles, motorcycles, and tricycles, partnering with domestic manufacturers including Innoson, Nord, CIG (GAC), PAN, Mikano, Jets, NEV (Electric), and DAG to expand access and foster the growth of a homegrown EV industry. The new AEDC-backed plant is explicitly designed to be the continent's first large-scale EV production facility, including assembly, manufacturing, and supporting infrastructure such as nationwide charging networks. Across Africa, electric vehicle adoption is growing but remains limited. According to EV24, the continent had over 30,000 EVs in use by mid‑2025, accounting for less than 1 percent of total vehicle sales. Nigeria's agreement with South Korea's Asia Economic Development Committee to build Africa's first full-scale EV plant highlights its ambition to move beyond assembly toward a sustainable domestic EV industry.
