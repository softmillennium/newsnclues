                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the Department of Justice released three million files over the weekend, blockchain enthusiasts were quick to discover a certain Jeffery Epstein was an active and prominent figure in crypto during its formative years. One file highlighted by crypto investor Patrick Riley shows an email chain between Epstein and Joichi Ito, the former head of MIT's Media Lab whose Digital Currency Initiative played an integral role in helping crypto grow into the giant it is today. “FYI,” Ito told Epstein, “used gift funds to underwrite this which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. “At the time this letter was written, there were around 12,000 commits to Bitcoin's code,” Riley remarked in a post on social media. That means that 74.79 percent of the Bitcoin core development and code was committed after Jeffery Epstein took over the defacto senior management role as benefactor.” That news didn't go over well with crypto enthusiasts, to put it lightly. “We've basically funded an elite global pedophile ring since 2015. Another crypto account lamented that “BTC has been funding a global elite pedo group since 2015… great.” The email chain from Ito also suggests that Bitcoin's mysterious developer — the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — may have in fact been five “core developers,” each of whom was in talks with Epstein. One of those core devs may have been early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back, who invented the proof-of-work algorithm cited by “Nakamoto's” original whitepaper on crypto. A separate email chain shows Ito suggesting the convicted sex criminal meet with Back and other tech luminaires to discuss this revolutionary new currency. “I think we should have a meeting with Jeremy Rubin, Adam Back (or other core developer of bitcoin), Seth [Lloyd], Martin Nowak, you and a few others soon about money and the future of finance,” a 2015 email from Ito reads. As these files seem to suggest, Back had sought a meeting with Epstein to secure funding for his crypto company, Blockstream. Unsealed records show Back along with Blockstream CEO Austin Hill trying to schedule a trip to meet Epstein in St. Thomas — one of the main US Virgin Islands located a little over six miles away from the infamous islet, Little Saint James. “Sunday in NY I think is a no-go because of our commitments on the west coast, but Fri/Saturday on the Island are still possible,” Hill told Epstein.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin issuer Tether has launched an open-source Bitcoin mining operating system, a move that places it directly into the mining infrastructure layer traditionally dominated by large, vertically integrated firms. The software is called Mining OS, or MOS, and was announced on Feb. 2 during the Plan 9 Forum in San Salvador and is being marketed as a production-ready system that can be deployed by mining operators of all sizes. Tether claimed MOS would be used to control, observe, and automate Bitcoin mining through a single control layer by integrating hardware performance, energy consumption, site infrastructure, and operational data. Mining of Bitcoin usually uses disjointed software stacks to manage machine usage, power infrastructure, cooling, and logistics of the site. MOS seeks to replace that patchwork by treating each component as a coordinated “worker” within one operating system, allowing operators to see and manage their entire setup in real time. The company claimed that the system monitors more than just hashrate but also monitors energy efficiency, device health, and site-level infrastructure. The company also noted that it has a peer-to-peer and modular architecture that can be deployed on lightweight hardware in small deployments or on industrial sites with hundreds of thousands of machines. Network hashrate climbed from around 800 exahash per second at the start of the year to a peak of roughly 1.15 zettahash per second in October, pushing mining difficulty to record levels. At the same time, the post-halving block reward of 3.125 BTC and declining transaction fees reduced revenue per unit of hash. Network hashrate has fallen below 1,000 EH/s for the first time since September, dipping to 870 EH/s at points following winter storms and reduced profitability. Analysts have said the pullback could temporarily improve margins for remaining miners, though competition remains intense. Against this backdrop, Tether's move into mining software adds to its expanding footprint across the digital asset ecosystem. Best known as the issuer of USDT, Tether reported more than $10 billion in net profit in 2025 and has expanded into tokenized gold through XAUT, and payment partnerships like Opera's MiniPay wallet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the role of layer-2 networks needs to be reconsidered as Ethereum's main network continues to scale and transaction costs remain low. In a post on X, Buterin said the original rollup-centric roadmap, which positioned layer-2s as the primary way Ethereum would scale, “no longer makes sense.” That roadmap envisioned layer-2s as secure extensions of Ethereum that would handle most transactions while inheriting Ethereum's security guarantees, often described as “branded shards” of the network. Space is limited, so getting in can be slow and expensive. Layer-2 networks act like overflow rooms, letting people participate and interact without crowding the main hall, while still staying connected to what's happening there. According to Buterin, two developments have challenged that original vision for Layer 2 networks. First, progress among layer-2s toward later stages of decentralization has been slower and more difficult than expected. Second, Ethereum itself is now scaling directly on layer-1, with fees remaining low and gas limits expected to increase significantly in 2026. In his view, Ethereum no longer needs layer-2s to function as "branded shards" for the network. Buterin also noted that some layer-2s may intentionally choose not to move beyond “stage 1,” including for regulatory reasons. In one example, he wrote that a project argued it may never decentralize further because “their customers' regulatory needs require them to have ultimate control.” While he said that approach may be appropriate for those users, he added that such systems should not be described as scaling Ethereum. But it should be obvious that if you are doing this, then you are not 'scaling Ethereum' in the sense meant by the rollup-centric roadmap,” Buterin wrote.” He said layer-2s should focus on providing value beyond basic scaling, such as privacy features, application-specific design, ultra-fast transaction confirmation, or non-financial use cases, and be clear with users about what guarantees they provide.

For the past several years, an objectively stupid stock market trade has been creeping further and further into your retirement. Strategy sells some software, enough to generate $128 million in revenue in the last quarter for which it reported earnings. Meanwhile, the entire market capitalization of Strategy, whose business is buying Bitcoins, was about $41 billion when the market opened on Tuesday. You might also get some dividends, but you're not getting much else, because Strategy doesn't do much else besides buy Bitcoin. In fact, about 3 percent of all Bitcoin belongs to Strategy. For years, the company pulled off this bizarre sleight of hand—effectively acting as a middleman that buys Bitcoin for you so your stock in the company is worth less than Bitcoin. The market began to fill with “crypto treasury companies” as Bitcoin rose in price yet remained intimidating and inaccessible to most people. With crypto becoming easier to buy than ever, and Strategy's stock in a tailspin, that spell now appears to be breaking as the market questions whether this middleman deserves to exist at all. In 2020 the very-online chief executive of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, decided to invest the company's cash reserves into Bitcoin. One thing led to another, and eventually, MicroStrategy was buying Bitcoin as the bulk of its business. At the time, this was a slightly less absurd concept than it seems. Bitcoin was rising in price, but there were no crypto exchange-traded funds, for which you could give your money to an asset manager and have it buy Bitcoin for you for a small fee. If you didn't want to futz with the word blockchain but did want Bitcoin exposure, you could buy MicroStrategy stock. This worked unbelievably well for a while, to the point that its stock was trading for about twice the value of its Bitcoin despite the company's barely having another business. Bloomberg's Matt Levine described it in April 2025 as a “perpetual motion machine” built out of buying $1 of Bitcoin, enjoying $2 of stock price gains, and selling stock in order to fund new Bitcoin purchases and the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual dividends it had agreed to pay to preferred shareholders. But also legal, and a more convenient way for retail investors to own Bitcoin. It's impossible to say exactly why this trade has stopped working now, but oh brother has it stopped working. The company's CEO has responded by simply selling more stock and buying more Bitcoin and indicating that he will keep doing that. We should never rule out the likelihood that this kind of vibes-based quintupling down will have a nice payoff at the end. Bitcoin and Strategy could both come roaring back fine. The company's stock was flying north of $400 a share last summer. But when Bitcoin got on a bad run last fall, Strategy fell much more dramatically. There isn't a legible reason for a normal person who wants Bitcoin to now think, Hmm, I'll get it by purchasing stock from Strategy, or from one of its many smaller copycats who have turned their businesses into holding companies for some type of crypto. There are at least 168 public companies playing some version of this game, though most of them have business plans that are a little bit more varied than Strategy's. This may seem like an abstract curiosity. But as I wrote in March 2025, when times were good for Strategy, the company's success was rapidly becoming your business. Strategy was, at the time, a big enough company that it constituted all of 0.1 percent of the typical market-tracking index fund that most of us use in our retirement and brokerage accounts, and a much bigger slice of tech-focused or crypto-focused funds. That little decimal point wasn't a lot, but then, artificial intelligence was barely a decimal point's worth of those index funds a few years ago. (Nvidia alone is now 6.6 percent of Vanguard's massively popular market-tracking fund that trades as VTI, to say nothing of all the other tech giants who have staked big chunks of their futures on A.I.) If the crypto treasury gambit had continued to juice stock prices, the copycat game would have spread further. may now control your economic future, sure, but companies buying huge pots of Bitcoin currently do not. There could be a lesson here about societal overinvestment in things in tech hype cycles, though the use cases for generative A.I. already seem much more expansive than whatever someone would claim the use case is for Bitcoin beyond speculation. For the time being, we can grant ourselves permission to stop paying attention to this phenomenon in at least one previously frothy part of the market. Meanwhile, Saylor, Strategy's boss with a cult following, continues to hype Bitcoin all the time. On Sunday, he posted a graph showing Strategy's massive recent Bitcoin purchases amid the crash, typing only “More Orange.” (Strategy's colors are now orange, like Bitcoin, and he tweets a version of this graph every few days.) Bitcoin will probably go up again at some point in the future. We should consider the possibility, however, that the days of a company successfully collecting a 100 percent premium to buy Bitcoin for other people may be waning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. BLUFF, the next-generation betting and entertainment platform, has raised $21 million in a strategic round led by global blockchain technology fund 1kx, with participation from Makers Fund, Maximum Frequency Ventures, Delphi Ventures Founders, and other high-profile backers, including sports champion & tech investor, Tristan Thompson. The team comprises former senior executives from Stake, Bet365, William Hill, and Bodog. It offers quick onboarding, real-time settlement, provably fair games, and reward systems that enable users to actively participate in the ecosystem they help develop. “When we began building BLUFF, we set out to create a betting platform for the new generation of betters who prioritise fast, high-engagement gameplay, real-time experiences, real stakes and the social energy that defines how players engage online today,” said BLUFF's Founder. Novel content, user-experience obsessed, deep community focus, and hyper-engaging for all users.” The raise comes after an amazing pre-release phase in which BLUFF got more than 600,000 sign-ups, kept tens of thousands of daily active players, and processed more than 125,000,000 bets through its beta in just three months. With key partners in crypto, gaming, and consumer entertainment, BLUFF is one of the fastest-growing new betting platforms on the market, thanks to this early success. BLUFF is creating a single platform that combines betting, live prediction markets, binary outcomes, and community events run by creators. This is in addition to standard iGaming and sports betting. Bluff also provides a VIP matching program to make the transition from legacy platforms such as Stake, Shuffle, and Rollbit to Bluff as seamless as possible, offering market-leading bonuses, rewards, and world-class VIP service through a 24/7 VIP concierge. “We are thrilled to back the BLUFF team,” said Andrew Willson, Partner at Makers Fund. “They bring a deep, nuanced understanding of player needs combined with an innovative approach to company building and platform design.</p>

Aryam Investment 1, an Abu Dhabi-based entity headed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed AL Naya of the UAE royal family, will acquire 49% stake in the Trump family crypto venture for $500 million. The Trump administration has been pro-crypto lately, and this new breaking news has led to a fresh wave of discussion regarding conflict of interest and foreign influence on U.S. policies. World Liberty Financial is a crypto platform with all the standard Defi and crypto hallmark features, including tradable tokens and blockchain lending via Aave tech. It is also listed and tracked by CoinMarketCap. According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap, WLFI has a market cap of $3.42B and is currently traded at $0.1282. The company is primarily held by the Trump family through DT Marks DEFI LLC, with a 60% stake and 75% ownership of token revenue. This has led to a wave of ethical controversy regarding how Trump's policy could be biased to favor his family ventures. Trump has been vocal about how he wants to make America dominant in digital assets. “A giant step to cement the American dominance of global finance and crypto technology,” Trump said, signing the GENIUS Act in 2025. The GENIUS Act brought clarity around stablecoins, which attracted traditional investors towards it. The CLARITY Act (Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025) aims to clear rules for crypto by dividing oversight between the SEC and CFTC. The Act is in limbo now as U.S. banks have taken a stance against allowing stablecoin rewards. The opposition will likely push a narrative of potential quid pro quo by linking Trump's pro-crypto stance and foreign investment in a family venture in the same sector.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's social network X (formerly Twitter) in relation to non-consensual sexual imagery generated by Grok, the platform's AI assistant. The UK's investigation will examine whether personal data used by Grok has been processed lawfully, fairly and transparently, and whether appropriate safeguards were built into Grok's design and deployment to prevent the generation of harmful manipulated images using personal data. The ICO said it was examining the risks as part of a mandate to protect people's rights and hold organizations to account as they build and deploy AI technology. “The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” said William Malcolm, executive director regulatory risk and innovation at the ICO. “Losing control of personal data in this way can cause immediate and significant harm. This is particularly the case where children are involved.” The ICO said it has contacted X to seek “urgent information” on the reports around AI-generated content. Jon Belcher, data protection partner with Excello Law commented: “The news that the ICO has now opened a formal investigation into X and xAI is welcome. “Users of X whose images were manipulated without their consent will expect to see the ICO move quickly and take decisive action in this case,” Belcher concluded. The news comes as another of Musk's companies, SpaceX, announced it was acquiring xAI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK's information watchdog will investigate reports that Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, has been used to generate sexual imagery of children. Integrated into X, formerly Twitter, it uses real-time data from the platform to generate text, images and code. In a statement on its website, the ICO confirmed it had opened a formal probe into two X companies concerning their processing of personal data in relation to Grok, and the AI's potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content. "We have taken this step following reports that Grok has been used to generate non‑consensual sexual imagery of individuals, including children," the statement said.

"Losing control of personal data in this way can cause immediate and significant harm. Another regulatory watchdog, Ofcom, also opened a formal investigation into X last month under the UK's Online Safety Act, to determine whether the firm was complying with its duties to protect people from illegal content. The EU is one of a number of authorities around the world to have raised concerns about Grok, with government officials in Germany, Sweden, India, Japan, Malaysia, California, Indonesia and Philippines among those that have spoken out. Mr Malcolm said the ICO was working closely with Ofcom and "international regulators". Ofcom also said its investigation into X was still gathering evidence and warned the probe could take months. "We continue to demand answers from xAI about the risks it poses. We are examining whether to launch an investigation into its compliance with the rules." xAI said on 14 January it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal". xAI earlier said it had limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most blockchain networks today rely on classical cryptographic algorithms such as ECDSA, which are expected to become vulnerable once sufficiently powerful quantum computers emerge, a milestone often referred to as Q-Day. While post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms have now been standardized by NIST, upgrading existing Layer 1 blockchains remains a significant engineering and governance challenge. The Layer 1 Migration Toolkit addresses this gap by providing a phased, production-ready framework that enables smart-contract-based blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Hyperliquid, and major stablecoins, to transition toward quantum-resistant security without disrupting existing infrastructure. The toolkit builds on 01 Quantum's patented and patent-pending technologies, including its Quantum Crypto Wrapper (QCW) and Quantum DeFi Wrapper (QDW) with a “PQC Circuit Breaker”, combining post-quantum cryptography with zero-knowledge proofs to maintain on-chain efficiency, scalability, and compatibility. The Layer 1 Migration Toolkit introduces a three-phase approach to quantum-safe upgrades: This phased model allows blockchains to begin mitigating quantum risk today while avoiding forced hard forks or disruptive user experience changes. It is designed to enable access to quantum-safe transaction verification, support Quantum-Sig wallet functionality, and align incentives across developers, validators, and users. “Quantum computing poses a systemic risk to today's blockchain security model,” said Andrew Cheung, CEO of 01 Quantum and CTO of qLABS.“The Layer 1 Migration Toolkit delivers a realistic, deployable path for blockchains to prepare for Q-Day using post-quantum cryptography without sacrificing performance.” “By combining enterprise-grade post-quantum security with Web3-native deployment, we are enabling quantum safety where liquidity and users already exist,” said Antanas Guoga (Tony G), President of qLABS.

This interest has expanded cryptocurrency into a broader discussion that links personal responsibility, technological growth and campus values. Environmentally concerned students will typically ask: How does Bitcoin's energy use compare with real-world standards? According to an environmental analysis conducted in July 2023, the estimated CO2-equivalent emissions from Bitcoin mining range from 55 million to 69 million tons (Binance Insights Hub, “Bitcoin and the Environment,” July 2023). Additionally, data updated in March 2024 estimated that Bitcoin's annual energy consumption is 138 TWh and its carbon emissions are 88.23 million tons (Binance Insights Hub, “Energy Use and the Bitcoin Network,” March 2024). For college students engaged in sustainability efforts on campus, these figures introduce new elements into the often abstract conversation about climate change, highlighting awareness campaigns centred on recycling, energy saving and climate education. Students are curious if participating in crypto aligns with their environmental objectives. Clubs are debating whether to include sustainability topics in blockchain workshops. Academic groups are evaluating how environmental considerations should influence coursework on emerging technologies. Some industry perspectives really acknowledge the scale of Bitcoin's energy use. Throughout 2024, other jobs featured renewable energy tests, regional procurement figures and other sustainability experiments for the mining industry (Binance Insights Hub, environmental category, January-September 2024). A July 2023 report estimated that 55–65% of mining operations in certain regions rely on renewable energy (Binance Insights Hub, “Bitcoin Mining Energy Mix,” July 2023). Although this does not remove the overall impact, it really illustrates active attempts to reduce strain where possible. Responsible-tech discussions also extend to other areas of digital development. For students, statements like this signal how major platforms weigh ethical and operational considerations, reinforcing the need for thoughtful design across all forms of emerging technology. Many students feel pulled between learning about new technologies and honouring their environmental priorities. Campus spaces can help bridge that tension by offering structured, informed ways to explore crypto without ignoring its ecological cost. These approaches allow students to stay engaged while maintaining a realistic understanding of environmental implications. University communities play a key role in shaping how this information is interpreted, encouraging thoughtful analysis rather than reactive judgments. The future of sustainable crypto development depends on transparency, improved mining practices and continued research into efficient network models. For students who prioritise environmental values, the strongest approach is informed engagement. Bitcoin raises legitimate sustainability questions and a well-educated campus community can guide balanced conversations that keep climate awareness central while examining new technologies with purpose and clarity.</p>
