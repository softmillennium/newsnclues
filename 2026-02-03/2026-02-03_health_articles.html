                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent international research project has used advanced microscopy techniques and computational modeling to discover why virus infection changes the nuclear structures and biomechanical forces affecting the nucleus. Researchers at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland), in cooperation with national and international research groups, have shown that DNA viruses infect cells and take over the host cell nucleus induce dramatic structural modifications. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection and the emergence of nuclear enlarged, low-density viral replication compartments lead to changes in nuclear volume, chromatin organization, and the structure of nuclear lamina. To understand the phenomenon, advanced microscopy, including cryo-soft X-ray tomography (SXT), atomic force microscopy (AFM), combined with computational modeling, was employed. Our mechanical simulations and in vitro experiments showed that a reduction in outward forces, such as actin cytoskeleton pull or osmotic pressure, is the most likely factor in nuclear softening." Maija Vihinen-Ranta, Research Director, University of Jyväskylä - Modern science is increasingly seeking to identify the forces acting on cells that shape their biomechanics. Usually, these forces come from outside the cell. Brain microphysiological systems are reshaping in vitro neurotoxicity testing through functional validation and advanced disease modeling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rounds focused on critically ill pediatric patients at the greatest risk for developing healthcare-associated conditions (HACs) reduced the rate of specific HACs by nearly 50% at a Colorado hospital, according to a study published in Critical Care Nurse (CCN). After implementing a high-risk rounding process, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, was able to decrease the mean rate of project-specific HACs in its pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) from 5.41 to 2.89 events per 1,000 patient days. "Reducing Hospital-Acquired Conditions in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit With a High-Risk Rounding Process" details how the interprofessional project team developed criteria for PICU patients at high risk for HACs and created a template script to encourage dialogue with direct care nurses. Our high-risk rounds focus on the underlying risks for multiple HACs and extend prevention efforts 'beyond the bundle,' in a collaborative and supportive way. The approach can be easily adapted for changes in patient population and different clinical needs." Before implementation of weekly high-risk rounds, HAC prevention included team members auditing bedside nursing staff for bundle compliance during patient care and conducting apparent cause analysis for all HAC events. A template script based on a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) survey provided question prompts for the rounding team to cover topics efficiently and collect data. Rounds resulted in 351 interventions, including escalation of concerns, direct patient care, resource procurement and education. Implementation of high-risk rounds reduced the rate of project-specific HACs by 46.5%, which was sustained over the two-year project period. The initiative focused on rates for central line [catheter]-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), unplanned extubation and pressure injury. Based on the data analysis, high-risk rounds prevented an estimated 50 HACs during the project period, reducing patient harm and generating significant cost savings. Patients who received high-risk rounds were less likely to develop an HAC than those who did not receive them. Patients were included in high-risk rounds if they met specific screening criteria, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement therapy or endotracheal intubation. Trends identified through the high-risk rounds have already spurred additional projects such as a study of unit psychological safety, changes in PICU policies, identification of education topics and a revamp of the shift safety-check process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study led by researchers at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine of Lleida (IRBLleida), the University of Lleida (UdL), the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital (HUAV) has developed and internally validated a clinical prediction model called the Goliat score, which can be used by emergency services to estimate the risk of acute complications in patients suffering from minor and moderate traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). The study was recently published in BMC Emergency Medicine. Non-severe head trauma accounts for a large proportion of emergency room visits, but most patients do not develop important clinical complications within 48 hours of their injury. The Goliat score was constructed based on a consecutive cohort study of adults with mild or moderate TBI (a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13-15), who were treated in a hospital emergency department in Lleida between June 2019 and December 2020. The model contains variables that can be obtained in less than six hours, including age, history of hypertension, platelet count, systolic blood pressure, anticoagulant treatment, serum levels of the S100B protein, and high-risk clinical indicators such as fluctuating GCS and pupil alterations, and predicts the likelihood of neurological or cardiorespiratory complications and mortality in the first 48 hours. The results show that the Goliat score can discriminate between patients at high and low risk of developing complications. The model performed similarly in age and sex subgroups, although it requires prospective external validation before it can be routinely applied in clinical practice." According to the researchers, this tool could limit unnecessary exposure to radiation, reduce the use of cranial computed tomography (CT) and enable safer and risk-based discharge decisions, especially among elderly patients, when the presence of multiple comorbidities can make clinical evolution difficult. This study is a significant step towards achieving simple yet robust clinical predictive models that contain immediately available demographic, laboratory and clinical data for improving the care of patients with minor or moderate traumatic brain injury in emergency services. This project is part of the UOC's research mission on Planetary Health and Well-being and supports UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doctors have found that metformin, an everyday medicine for diabetes, is associated with less progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the commonest cause of blindness in western countries. People with diabetes over the age of 55 years taking metformin were 37% less likely to develop the intermediate stage of AMD over a five year period compared to those not taking metformin. It eventually causes the light-sensitive tissue to die off (geographic atrophy, a form of 'dry' AMD) or be damaged by abnormal blood vessel growth ('wet' AMD). Intermediate and advanced AMD affects 10-15% of people over 65 years of age (1.1 to 1.8 million people in the UK), and is the commonest cause of blindness in high-income countries. Geographic atrophy has no treatment in the UK and Europe, while treatments for wet AMD are expensive and unpleasant (repeated injections into the eye). The researchers assessed whether AMD was present on the photographs and how severe it was, and then compared those taking metformin and those who were not. They also adjusted for factors which might bias the result such as age, sex, and duration of diabetes. A potential benefit from metformin in AMD has been suspected before, but this is the first study to grade AMD from eye photographs. Previous studies on metformin have used secondary information on AMD such as GP diagnostic codes, or insurance claims in the US. Dr. Nick Beare, an eye doctor who led this research, says: "Most people who suffer from AMD have no treatment, so this is a great breakthrough in our search for new treatments. What we need to do now is test metformin as a treatment for AMD in a clinical trial. Metformin has the potential to save many people's sight."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The loss of social connectedness as people age increases the odds of cognitive-related disorders and can worsen health outcomes in older populations. But is there a direct relationship between social behavior and cognition? Subhadeep Dutta Gupta, Peter Rapp, and colleagues, from the National Institute on Aging, developed a rat model to probe social cognition in the aging brain. As presented in their eNeuro paper, the researchers used 169 young and aged male rats to discover that while older rats were as social as younger ones, a subpopulation largely favored familiar peers over new ones. This preference was unrelated to differences in spatial memory, anxiety-like behavior, or motor abilities. Notably, smelling ability, which is important for social interaction in rodents, was also unrelated to peer preferences. Altering how neurons talk to each other using a noninvasive technique reversed social preferences in older rats, enhancing their approach towards new peers. According to the researchers, these findings suggest that aging may influence social behavior through a distinct, potentially modifiable neural system that is at least partly separate from mechanisms underlying age-related spatial memory decline. The researchers emphasize that their preclinical work provides not only a good tool to understand how the brain ages through a "social" lens, but also valuable insight into approaches for maintaining healthy aging. Future work will focus on assessing social networks in the brain as older rats interact with peers to unveil what neural mechanisms support different social behaviors, which could inform treatment interventions early on in the aging process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New study shows how bacteria adapted a virus-derived injection system to recognize and attach to many different types of cells. By systematically identifying thousands of rapidly evolving receptor-binding proteins, the researchers explain how these systems can be retargeted again and again in nature by swapping the part that binds to cells. The work not only solves a long-standing mystery about how these bacterial machines function, but also demonstrates that they can be engineered to deliver proteins into specific human cells, pointing to future biomedical and biotechnological applications. To do so, they rely on highly specialized proteins that recognize and bind to receptors on the surface of target cells, a molecular arms race that drives constant evolution.Now, a new study published in Nature Communications, led by Prof. Asaf Levy of the Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, reveals just how far this evolutionary creativity can go.Working over several years, doctoral researcher Nimrod Nachmias, together with collaborators Zhiren Wang and Xiao Feng from Prof. Peng Jiang's laboratory at the NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens in Beijing, uncovered a vast and previously hidden repertoire of receptor-binding proteins used by bacteria, many of them borrowed from viruses, plants, fungi, and even animals. At the center of the discovery are extracellular contractile injection systems (eCISs), sophisticated, virus-like molecular machines derived from bacteriophage tails. While viruses use these structures to infect cells, many bacteria have repurposed them as toxin delivery devices, deploying them against competing host organisms such as insects, and likely against competing microbes. "eCISs look like viral weapons, but they are now fully integrated into bacterial life," the researchers explain. For years, researchers have suspected that eCISs rely on specialized receptor-binding proteins, equivalent to viral spike proteins, to recognize their targets. Like the coronavirus spike protein, these receptor-binding protein domains, which are called tail fiber proteins, evolve extremely rapidly, constantly changing shape to keep up with their targets in what is defined as a molecular arms race. Traditional search methods repeatedly failed to detect them.To overcome this, the team developed a new computational algorithm capable of identifying these elusive genes across thousands of genomes.The result was striking.The researchers identified 3,445 eCIS tail fiber proteins encoded within 2,585 eCIS gene operons across 1,069 bacterial and archaeal species, the most comprehensive catalogue of its kind. The study revealed that eCIS tail fibers are built from two distinct parts: Using structure prediction tools, the team classified these proteins 1,177 distinct domain fold families, many of which are predicted to bind sugars and proteins on the surface of bacterial or eukaryotic cells.Remarkably, genetic evidence suggests that many of these domains were acquired through horizontal gene transfer - not only from other bacteria and viruses, but also from plants, fungi, and components of animal immune systems. Horizontal gene transfer is a common phenomenon in bacteria. "This is accelerated evolution on steroids," the researchers say. "Bacteria are essentially sampling the biological world for useful binding tools and repurposing them." Namely, they speculated that it can bind to human cells.They engineered a chimeric eCIS particle, equipping it with this newly identified fiber, and showed that it could bind to and inject proteins into human THP-1 monocyte-like cells, while sparing other cell types.Further experiments suggested that D-mannose, a sugar found on human cell surfaces, may act as a key receptor, partially blocking binding when added externally.Electron microscopy images captured virus-like particles attaching to human cells moments before delivering their molecular payload. This work uncovers thousands of naturally evolved receptor-binding proteins, and these could eventually be harnessed to deliver drugs, enzymes, or other therapeutic molecules into specific cell types. Beyond its technological promise, the study opens fundamental biological questions. "We still know very little about what many of these systems do in nature," the researchers add. This catalogue gives us, for the first time, a map to start answering those questions.

In a comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) were not associated with a statistically significant lymphoma safety signal in patients with atopic dermatitis when robust Bayesian methods were applied.

“While gold standard experimentation methods such as randomized controlled trials are required to confidently disbar the TCI-lymphoma association, this study may help provide reassurance to concerned clinicians in light of related mounting evidence supporting TCI safety,” the study authors wrote. Recent studies, they noted, have “also supported a lack of lymphomagenic potential associated with TCIs.”

The study was led by Domenico Arcuri, MD, PharmD, McGill University and St. Mary's Hospital, Montreal, Québec, Canada, and was published online on January 27 in JAAD International.

The analysis was limited by the impact of drug-drug interactions on adverse drug reaction genesis, potential duplicate reports, and reporting bias.

The study did not receive any funding. The authors did not declare any conflicts of interest.
